Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  Protocol Synopsis  
Title  A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457348]  I/IIa 
Number of Sites  Multiple  
 
Study Objectives  The primary objective s of the study are to: 1.) establish a range of 
German cockroach allergenic extract doses that, when delivered intranasally, can induce a threshold of nasal symptoms  in adults 
(defined as a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) ≥ 8 out of 12 or a 
sneez ing score  of 3) and subsequently in 8 -14 year old children 
(defined as a TNSS ≥6 out of 12 or a sneez ing score  of 3) with 
asthma and allergic sensitization to German cockroach  and 2.) To 
document the safety profile of nasal challenge with German cockroach allergenic extract first in adults and subsequently in 8 -14 
year old children with asthma and allergic sensitization to German cockroach . 
Secondary objectives are:  
1.  To test the validi ty of objective outcomes of nasal challenge 
with German cockroach allergenic extract in 8 -14 year old children 
with allergic sensitization to German cockroach including peak nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PNIF).   
2.  To test the validity of objective outcomes of  nasal challenge 
with German cockroach allergenic extract in 8 -14 year old children 
with allergic sensitization to German cockroach  including allergic 
reaction biomarkers in blood and nasal secretions.   
3.  To assess reproducibility of the  Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) 
with German cockroach allergenic extract in adults with asthma who are sensitized to German cockroach.  
Study Design  This is a  multi -center,  open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_457349] . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_457350]. 
Phase [ADDRESS_584240] of two parts, Phase 1a and 
Phase 1b. In Phase 1a, participants will undergo a nasal allergen 
challenge. In Phase 1b, participants will undergo a repeat nasal allergen challenge to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population with asthma. The data from Phase 1 a will be used to identify a range of doses that is safe and 
elicits a threshold of nasal symptoms  (TNSS ≥8 or a sneez ing score  
of 3). Phase 2 will enroll 25  cockroach sensitive children with

Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  asthma age s 8-14 years  who will undergo a nasal allergen 
challenge using the dose range identified in Phase 1 a.  The 
threshold for a positive response to the NAC in Phase 2 will be 
lowered to a TNSS ≥ 6; the sneez ing score of 3 will remain the 
same.   
Primary Outcome s 1.  Prevalence of a positive response to NAC, defined at each dose 
as any sneez ing score of 3  or a Total Nasal Sy mptom Score (TNSS) 
≥8 out of 12  in Phase 1 or  a TNSS ≥6 out of 12 in Phase 2.  
2.  The number of reported adverse events and serious adverse 
events, including their severity, seriousness, and relatedness  
Secondary Outcomes   1. Number of Sneezes  
2. TNSS – highest score out of all doses received  
3. TNSS – change from baseline

2 The In ner-City Asthma 
Consortium (ICAC) has been working on developi[INVESTIGATOR_457358] a clinical study to determine 
whether subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with German cockroach extract could induce a beneficial 
immunomodulatory effect on cockroach allergy -associated asthma, in children.   
Unlike pollen allergy, where symptoms characteristically peak during a particular season, or allergy to 
animals (e.g., cat, dog), where symptoms are induced upon exposure, there is no specific period during 
the year at which assessment of the efficacy of SCIT on natural cockroach allergen exposure can be 
undertaken.  This only leaves the option of year -round clinical evaluations of symptoms, medication use, 
lung function and asthma exacerbations as clinical outcomes of a cockroach allergen immunotherapy 
study.  Although these are very relevant outcomes, their specificity or sensitivity as surrogates of the 
effect of single allergen immunotherapy in polysensitized individuals is low and the need for a “positive control” approach  becomes pertinent.  In this context, provocation testing with cockroach allergen 
could be used to objectively evaluate the efficacy of SCIT.  Nasal allergen challenge is an established type of provocation testing commonly used in the research setting to a ssess early stage efficacy of nasal 
allergy treatments, including allergen immunotherapy, and to study the pathophysiology of allergic 
reactions in an accessible part of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352].

In the Okuda study, 560 patients  from the ages of 4 to 80 years old (mean 31.3 years; 112 participants 
were 19 years old or younger) with allergic rhinitis were recruited to undergo an evaluation for insect allergy.  Sixty -five participants of unknown ages were selected by [CONTACT_457388] 
[ADDRESS_584259] mix.  The cockroach mix nasal allergen testing was done with an arbitrarily chosen single dose of 100 µL  of 1:5000 (w/v),  and no testing was conducted 
prior to the challenge to establish a dose.  No adverse events were reported  in this published report.

2. Study Hypotheses/Objectives  
2.1. Hypotheses  
The two hypo theses tested by [CONTACT_103754]: intranasal delivery of cockroach allergen via a nasal 
allergen challenge  1) can induce significant changes in nasal symptoms  and 2 ) can be safely 
administered in adults and children with asthma . 
2.2. Primary Objective  
The primary objective s of th is pi[INVESTIGATOR_56096]:  
1. To establish a range of German cockroach allergenic extract doses that, when delivered intranasally , can induce a threshold of nasal symptoms in most adults (TNSS ≥ 8 out of 12 or a 
sneezing score of 3) and subsequently in most 8 -14 year old children (TNSS ≥6 out of 12 or a 
sneezing score of 3) with asthma and allergic sensitization to German cockroach.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_584261] in 8 -14 year old children with allergic sensitization to German cockroach including peak 
nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PNIF).  
2.   To test the validity of objective outcomes o f nasal challenge with German cockroach allergenic 
extract in 8 -14 year old children with allergic sensitization to German cockroach including 
allergic reaction biomarkers in nasal secretions.  
3.  To assess reproducibility of the Nasal Allergen Challenge ( NAC ) with German cockroach allergenic 
extract in adults with asthma who are sensitiz ed to German cockroach.  
3. Study Design  
3.1. Description of Study Design  
This is a multi-center, open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_457359]  (NAC)  in children with asthma. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_457360]. Phase [ADDRESS_584262] of  two parts, Phase 1a and 
Phase 1b .  In Phase 1a, the cockroach sensitive adults will undergo the initial NAC.  In Phase 1b , the adult 
participants will undergo a  repeat challenge 30 -365 days after the Phase 1a NAC .  The purpose of  Phase 
1b is to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population with asthma.   Phase 2 
will enroll 25 cockroach sensitive children with asthma who will undergo a NAC with increasing doses of cockroach allergen.  Progressing to Phas e 2 will not be dependent upon the results of Phase 1b , and 
Phase 2 will proceed immediately after the completion of Phase 1a.  After the completion of Phase 1a, 
the primary outcome data ( positive response to NAC, defined as TNSS ≥8 out of 12 or a sneezing score  of 
3) for the participants in Phase 1a will be reviewed to determine the optimal dose range to be used in 
Phase [ADDRESS_584263] appropriate dose range will include tolerability and the 
aim of eliciting a threshold of nasal symptoms. The investigators planned to  use the results of the 
primary outcome analysis (Section 13.4.2) to determine the o ptimal dose to be used in Phase [ADDRESS_584264] dose of allergen (challenge dose 2).   
Phase [ADDRESS_584265] to the firs t dose of allergen 
(challenge dose 2) , then that dose will be dropped from subsequent challenges. The threshold for a 
positive response to the NAC in   Phase 2 will be defined  as  a TNSS ≥ 6; the sneezing score of 3 will 
remain the same.

4.Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories 
4.1.Rationale for Study Population 
Because the combination of cockroach allergy and co ckroach exposure is one of the most important 
factors contributing to the dramatically increased asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with 
asthma, a major ICAC goal is to conduct a large mult i-center efficacy trial of cockroach immunotherapy 
in this population. Direct instillation of allergen to  the nose via a NAC has been studied as a surrogate 
measure of allergic reactivity. Another DAIT NIAID- sponsored clinical trial (Protocol ITN 057AD, IND 
#117,529) conducted in conjunction with the Immune Tolerance Network, incorporated a NAC followed by [CONTACT_457389] a way of quan tifying treatment efficacy for individuals with cat 
allergy. However, cockroach allergen has not been previously used in a NAC, and the tolerability and 
appropriate dose range for administ ration to children with asthma is unknown. The first phase of this 
study will recruit adults in order to establish a rang e of doses of cockroach allergen that can be safely 
administered to cockroach sensitive children with asthma.  
4.2.Inclusion Criteria 
Individuals who meet all of the following criteria ar e eligible for enrollment as study participants for 
Phase 1a and Phase 2:

5. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants  
5.1. Risks of Study Procedures  
5.1.1. Nasal  Allergen Challenge  
This involves the direct application of one or more defined doses of allergen onto the participant’s nasal 
muc osa using a nasal drug delivery system  (LMA® MAD Nasal delivery system LMA/Teleflex, San Diego, 
CA) . Challenge is expected to cause allergic symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal 
discharge, and itchy, watery eyes  which may last up to several hours after the last dose is administered . 
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 26 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  If nasal and/or ocular symptoms persist after the period of observation in the clinical unit , participants 
will be offered treatment with oral antihistamines. There is a theoretical risk of provoking asthma  
sympto ms. If a participant begins exhibiting asthma symptoms during the NAC, or the PEF is reduced by 
[CONTACT_726] 20% from baseline, the challenge will be suspended , and the participant will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_1003]. If it is determined treatment is nee ded based on clinical judgment , then the 
challenge will not be continued.  In the absence of an immediate need for treatment, spi[INVESTIGATOR_457363] a change in lung function. If the FEV1 is < 85% of baseline value, the challenge will 
be stopped . If spi[INVESTIGATOR_106438] a low PEF and the FEV1 is ≥ 85% of baseline value, the 
challenge can continue at the clinician’s discretion. To minimize this risk, individuals with a pre -
bronchodilator FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted are excluded from this trial.   In addition, the allergen 
will be delivered to the nose while subjects are breath holding at Total Lung Capacity (TLC) and will be asked to exhale through their nose thereafter thus minimizing the potential for allergen to reach t he 
lower airways.  As for any intervention with allergen to which the patient is sensitive there is the 
theoretical risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_457364]. Trained personnel, including a physician, as well as medications and equipment, will be immedia tely available to treat any reaction.  
No previous studies have reported on the safety or efficacy of cockroach nasal allergen challenge in 
children with asthma.  Nasal allergen challenge has been performed with other allergens (perennial and 
seasonal) in c hildren with asthma and found to be low risk.  Mild cough or wheezing developed shortly 
after the nasal challenge in 2 out of 25 children ,
8 while in another study a slight drop (10%) in FEV1 was 
noted in [ADDRESS_584276] for Nasal Allergen Challenge.  
5.1.2. Skin Prick Tests  
Participants may experience mild to moderate pruritus or local discomfort at the sites of skin pricks with allergen and the positive control (histamine dihydrochloride 10 mg/mL). The symptoms are not bothersome. Usually, the allergen -induced wheal and flare responses resolve within 1 –[ADDRESS_584277] systemic allergic symptoms. These symptoms may include sneezing, ocular pruritus and tearing, rhinorrhea and/or generalized pruritus or urticaria. Treatment with oral antihistamines is available and is effective although almost never required. A physician is 
always present and drugs and equipment for treatment of anaphylactic reactions are available.  
There is also a very rare chance that the participant may experience a systemic allergic reaction or 
fainting.  A study clinician will be available to provide immediate treatment, if needed.   To date, 
aeroallergen skin prick test procedures, conducted according to our manual of operations by [CONTACT_457392], have NEVER resulted in a systemic adverse reaction. Further, we believe that performance of such allergen evaluation is consistent with national asthma guidelines, and provides 
direct benefits to participants . The results of the skin tests are provided to participants . 
5.1.3. Venipuncture  
The risks associated with taking blood include possible pain from the stick, as well as bleeding, bruising, and infection of the skin. Lightheadedness and  fainting rarely occur. To minimize these risks, a staff

5.1.5. Questionnaires  
There is a possibility that participants may find the questions too personal.  Participants may refuse to 
answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable.  
5.2. Potential Benefits  
The results of the skin testing will be provided to participants at the end of the study visit. A copy of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_457368]. The participant may choose to share these results with 
their primary care physician to facilitate further medical care.  
The Inner -City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) has been working on developi[INVESTIGATOR_457358] a clinical 
study to determine whether SCIT with German cockroach extract could induce a beneficial immunomodulatory effect on cockroach allergy -associated asthma, in children.  Unlike pollen allergy, 
where symptoms characteristically peak during a particular season, or allergy to animals (e.g., cat, dog), 
where symptoms are induced upon exposure, there is no specific period during the year at which 
assessment of the efficacy of SCIT on natural cockroach allergen exposure can be undertaken.  This only leaves the option of year-round clinical evaluations of symptoms, medication use, lung function and 
asthma  exacerbations as clinical outcomes of a cockroach allergen immunotherapy study.  Although 
these are very relevant outcomes, their specificity or sensitivity as surrogates of the effect of single 
allergen immunotherapy in polysensitized individuals is low and the need for a “positive control” 
approach becomes pertinent.  In this context, provocation testing with cockroach allergen could be used 
to objectively evaluate the efficacy of SCIT.   An alternative approach would have been to establish a bronchial cockroach allergen provocation ,

Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  8. Study Proc edures  
8.1. Recruitment  
The study centers may use any IRB -approved means to identify potential participants. Examples include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or emergency department admission records; investigators’ specialty clinic records; and 
advertising (in public locations and on the radio). Potential participants will be screened and recruited 
using a standardized questionnaire that collects contact [CONTACT_106495]/exclusion criteria information. Participants may be recruited by [CONTACT_48052].  
Retention m ethods involve a number of different approaches.  Appointment reminder cards are given at 
each visit. We will use an appointment reminder system that consists of phone calls and/or text messages several days and one day prior to scheduled appointments for confirmation. To facilitate telephone contact [CONTACT_457396], at least three 
telephone contact [CONTACT_15750] (relatives, neighbors, friends) will be collected for each subject.  This has 
proven to be an effective strategy in previous ICAC studies. Those who have no obvious characteristics making them ineligible and who are interested will be invited to the clinic for a Screening Visit.  
8.2. Screening  Visit  
The research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any study procedures . Written 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable) and Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) authorization will be obtained from all participants at the beginning of this visit. Study procedures will be stopped and the participant will be deemed ineligible for the study at any point during the Screening Visit if and when they fail to meet eligibility criteria.  
After the consent (and assent, if applicable) is signed , participants will undergo screening study 
procedures, including prick skin tests with German cockroach allergenic extract to ensure participants 
are sensitive to the test product. In addition, 8- [ADDRESS_584283] results 
within the previous year under another ICAC protocol will not need to be re -tested.  
A medical history will be taken and a targeted physical examination will be performed to verify the 
participant’s suitability for inclusion in the study. A urine pregnancy test will also be performed on all post -menarcheal female participants  prior to any procedure s that entail any risk, such as skin prick 
testing and the NAC . 
For participants with a positive skin prick test to cockroach, b lood will be collected by [CONTACT_457397].  For participants with a negative skin prick test to cockroach, 60 
mL of blood (Phase 1 a) or the  maximum  volume allowed  up to 60 mL (Phase 2) will be collected at the 
screening visit for mechanistic assays if the participant agrees. Participants who have valid IgE test 
results within the p revious year under another ICAC protocol will not need to be re -tested.   
Participants,  who have both a positive skin prick test to cockroach allergenic extract and a cockroach -
specific IgE ≥0.35 kU
A/L and are considered eligible for the study, and at the d iscretion of the study 
physician, will be invited to proceed to the Challenge Visit.

Participants may also qualify for rescreening if they are ineligible due to nasal sympto ms or other 
reversible illness if their condition improves while recruitment is ongoing.  
8.3. Challenge Visit  
Participants who are deemed eligible based on results from tests conducted at the S creening Visit will be 
invited to proceed to  the Challenge Visit in Phase 1a and Phase 2 .  
The following procedures, assessments, and laboratory measures will be conducted:  
1. Concomitant medications  
2. Adverse events  
3. Assessment of nasal and pulmonary symptoms  (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_038])  
4. Brief Physical Exam  - includes Vital sign s, height , weight and nasal and lung exam  (or as

5. Urine pregnancy test (female participants ; if more than 28 days after the screening visit)  
6. Initial n asal rinse s – approximately 200mcl of isotonic saline solution ( 2 sprays) will be 
sprayed into each nostril and the participant will be asked to blow their nose ; this process 
will be repeated 3 times (as specified in the MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27).  The fluids from the 
2nd and 3rd rinse s will be collected and processed for analysis as specified in the MOP for 
Protocol ICAC- 27– the outcomes from these fluids will be considered baseline for the 
ensuing nasal challenge procedure .  A nasal rinse will be repeated 10 minutes after the 
diluent control is administered and after each dose of allergen during the NAC, as specified 
in the MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27.     
7. Nasal symptoms – TNSS and VAS and will be assessed pre and post the initial nasal rinse s, 
and then 10  -20 minutes after each NAC dose a dministration  and before the nasal rinse. (as 
specified in the M OP for Protocol ICAC -27)  If the participant does not qualify for the 
Challenge because of the TNSS score, they may be rescheduled as per the MOP for Protocol 
ICAC -27. 
8. Peak nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]  (PNIF ) - assessed pre and post the initial nasal rinse s, and then

20 minute s) up to a specified maximum dose or symptom level, will be given as described in 
an accompanying MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27. Briefly, o ne spray (100mcL)  of diluent or 
diluted allergen solution is applied to each of the participant’s nostrils using a nasal drug 
delivery system  while the participant breath -holds at TLC.  After the dose is delivered, t he 
participant is asked to exhale through the nose and then to avoid sniffing or swallowing in 
the immediate 1 minute after application. In Phase 1, the challenge  will begin with a 0  
mcg/ml ( negative control  – 50% glycerin, 50% COCAS with 0.2% phenol) dose followed by [CONTACT_25765] 8 doses of increasing concentration, until the participant reaches a TNSS score of 8 or 
more , has a sneezing score  of 3 or their symptoms become intolerable. In P hase 2, the 
challenge will begin with a 0mcg/ml (diluent control) dose followed by a number of  doses of 
increasing concentration, until the participant reaches a TNSS score of ≥ 6, has a sneezing 
score  of [ADDRESS_584285] allergen dose, this dose will be 
dropped from the subsequent challenges.  Nasal secretions will be collected for 
approximately 10 minutes immediately following administration of each diluent and 
allergen dose  and a nasal rinse (two 100mcL sprays of isotonic saline solution per nostril) 
will be pe rformed at 10 minutes, as described above. The fluids from each rinse will be 
mixed with the nasal secretions collected during the preceding 10 minutes and processed 
for analysis as specified in the MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27.  Collection of other outcomes w ill 
begin 10 minutes after each diluent or allergen dose is administered. If a participant begins 
exhibiting asthma symptoms during the NAC, or the PEF is reduced by [CONTACT_726] 20% from baseline, the challenge will be suspended , and the participant will be evaluated by [CONTACT_106492]. If it is determined treatment is needed based on clinical judgment , then the 
challenge will not be continued.  In the absence of an immediate need for treatment, spi[INVESTIGATOR_457371] a change in lung function. If the FEV1 is < 85% of

• The participant’s initial TNSS at the Repeat Challenge Visit must be within 1 point of the initial 
TNSS at the Challenge Visit in Phase 1a.  If the participant’s initial TNSS is outside the 1 point range, then the par ticipant may be reevaluated for the Repeat Challenge Visit up to 3 additional 
times.  
• The Repeat Challenge Visit will proceed as described in Section 8.3, except that there will be an 
additional blood draw for mechanistic studies that will occur approximate ly 6 hours after the 
initiation of the challenge (or as specified in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27). Nasal samples will 
be collected and processed for analysis as specified in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27. 
8.5. Follow -Up Phone Visit  
The day after a Challenge Visit, each participant will receive a follow -up phone call to assess if the 
participant is experiencing any late -onset respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. Each participant will be given the peak 
flow meter they used during the Challenge Visit to take home in  order to report their PEF during the 
phone visit. The participants (or their caretaker) will be asked to record two PEF measurements, one 4 -8 
hours after the completion of the challenge and one 24 hours after the completion of the challenge (or 
as soon as  possible after the school day, if applicable). AEs and concomitant medications  will also be 
assessed . The investigator will determine, based on the participant’s symptoms, medication use, and 
PEF measurements , if the participant will be asked to return to  the site for evaluation and possible 
treatment or referred to urgent/emergency care if the site is not open (i.e., on a weekend or holiday).  
Participants,  who have significant asthma symptoms during the Follow -Up Phone Visit as determined by 
[CONTACT_099] , will receive additional  follow -up to assess safety .   
For participants who do not consent to the mechanistic blood draw at the Follow -Up Clinic Visit, a 
Second Follow -Up Phone Call will be made 6 -10 days following the Challenge Visit to assess adverse 
events and concomitant medications.  
8.6. Follow -Up Clinic Visit s 
All participants will be asked to return to the clinic 6- 10 days after the Challenge Visit  for an additional 
blood draw (60 mL or the maximum volume allowed up to 60 mL) for mechanistic studies. A t this visit, 
adverse events  and concomitant medications  will also be assessed.  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 35 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  For participants who do not consent to the mechanistic blood draw, a Second Follow -Up Phone Call will 
be made in lieu of the Follow -Up Clinic Visit 6 -10 days after the Challenge Visit  to assess adverse events 
and concomitant medications . 
In Phase 1b, participants will be asked to return to the clinic 30 days  after the Repeat Challenge Visit for 
an additional blood draw (60 mL or the maximum volume allowed up to 60 mL) for mechanistic studies.  
At this visit, adverse events and concomitant medications will also be assessed.  
In Phase 2, participants will be asked to return to the clinic 30 days  after the Challenge Visit for an 
additional optional blood draw (60 mL or the maximum volume allowed by [CONTACT_457398] 60 mL) for mechanistic studies.  At this visit, adverse events and concomitant medications 
will also be assessed.  
In a subset of sites  in Phase 1a, Phase 1b,  and Phase 2, additional blood (60 mL or the maximum volume 
allowed up to 60 mL) will be drawn once 24 -72 hours after the NAC for mechanistic studies. An outcome 
assessment will be conducted (TNSS, VAS, PNIF and PEF), and AEs and concomitant medications will be assessed. If a participant’s PEF is <80% of the Challenge Visit baseline value, the participant will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_457399] /or spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] . Nasal secretions will also be 
collected at this this visit involving two 100mcL sprays of isotonic saline solution per nostril and 
collecting secretions as described in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27. This visit can be conducted in lieu  of 
the Follow- Up Phone Visit if it occurs the day after the Challenge Visit.  
Details of these mechanistic  studies are sp ecified in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27. 
8.7. Dust Sample Collection  
The caretaker or participant will be given a dust collection kit, which includes instructions on how to 
collect a dust sample (Refer to the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27 for detailed instructions ). A combined dust 
sample from the participant's bed and the participant's bedroom floor will be collected. The room where 
the participant sleeps most nights will be considered the participant's bedroom. Measuring templates will be used to delineate the area s to be vacuumed. Dust will be collected using a vacuum cleaner with a 
special dust collection filter attached. The dust collector will be placed into a sealable plastic bag and 
returned  to the study center for temporary storage (frozen). Crude samples will be batched and shipped 
to a central laboratory by [CONTACT_106493], extraction, and analysis. The dust specimens will be assayed to measure the concentration allergens such as: Der p 1, Der f 1, Bla g 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1, Alt a 1, and Mus m 1. Ad ditional allergens of interest and markers of fungal and microbial exposure may be 
measured.  In addition, the caretaker/participant will complete a dust collection questionnaire, which will be returned  with the dust collector.  
The caretaker or participant  will be given the dust collection kit at the screening visit and asked to return 
the dust sample and questionnaire  either  by [CONTACT_457400]. Those 
participants that are eligible to have the challenge on the same day as the s creening visit will be asked to 
return the sample and questionnaire  either by [CONTACT_457401] -Up Clinic Visit . 
8.8. Unscheduled Visits  
Study participants may attend unscheduled visits for a medical evaluation if they experience moderate 
to severe symptoms.  
8.9. Visit Windows  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_584290] within the time limits specified below: the designated visit windows (i.e. 
+/- n days)  for each scheduled visit are  also indicated on the Schedule of Events.  Additional details are 
provided in the MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27. 
The Challenge Visit should be conducted within [ADDRESS_584291] (if applicable) repeated prior to initiation of the NAC.  
Participants may be reevaluated up to a maximum of 2 times for the Phase 1a and Phase 2 Challenge

within 2 months of the Screening Visit.  
A Follow -Up Phone Visit should occur approximately 24 hours after the end of a Challenge Visit  (as 
described in th e MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27). In a subset of sites  in Phase 1a , Phase 1b,  and Phase 2 , a 
Follow -Up Clinic Visit may occur in lieu of the phone call (see MOP for Protocol ICAC -27 for details). A 
Follow -Up Clinic Visit should occur [ADDRESS_584292] 
agreed to participate in the mechanistic blood draw.   Another Follow -up Phone Visit should occur 6 to 
10 days following a challenge if the participant is not seen at the study site at this time (as described in the MO P for Protocol ICAC -27). 
The optional Phase 2 30 -day Follow -Up Visit should occur 30 days after the Challenge Visit (as described 
in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27). 
The Phase 1b Repeat Challenge Visit should be conducted within 30 -365 days after the Challenge Visit.  
Participants may be reevaluated up to a maximum of 3 times for the Phase 1b Repeat  Challenge Visit  if 
they are ineligible due to nasal symptoms or other reversible illness if their condition improves during the 365 days after their initial Challe nge V isit. 
The Phase 1b 30 -day Follow -Up Visit should occur 30 days after the Repeat Challenge Visit (as described 
in the MOP for Protocol ICAC -27). 
9. Mechanistic Assays  
Blood samples will be drawn prior to the NAC at either the Screening visit or at the Challenge Visit, depending upon the method of recruitment. Additional blood will be drawn once in all phases 6-10 days  
after the Challenge Visit  (or as specified in the MOP  for Protocol ICAC -27). In Phase 1b, participants will 
undergo  an additional blood draw at the Challenge Visit approximately [ADDRESS_584293] comple ted the Challenge Visit and  Follow -Up Clinic Visit (or Additional Follow -Up Phone Visit

Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  Practice , 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.03, June 14, 2010 : 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
12.2 Definitions  
12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any  untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 
International Conference on Harmonization E -6 Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (from 
OHRP "Guidance on Review ing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Other s and Adverse Events (1/15/07)" 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2 )  
The investigator must  report adverse events regardless of relationship to study therapy regimen 
or study mandated procedures . 
Because some nasal and other local symptoms are expected to occur as a result of the nasal allergen challenge, only symptoms/signs described below as well as in Table 12.3.1.a will be recorded as AEs.  However, if the investigator considers additional symptoms or signs, not covered under these lists, as AEs, they should be recorded and reported as described below.   
 
Study mandated procedures  and procedure -specific adverse events :  
Blood Draws  
• Fainting/Vasovagal events  
• Bruising at puncture site larger than 2 cm diameter  
• Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 30 minutes  
• Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm  
 
Pulmonary Function Testing  
• Wheezing or bronchoconstriction requiring treatment with bronchodilators withi n 
30 minutes from the procedure  
• Coughing requiring treatment with bronchodilators within 30 minutes from the 
procedure  
Nasal Allergen Challenge

12.2. 2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 40 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any  adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational drug or study therapy regimen caused the adverse event. For 
the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
12.2. 3 Unexpected Adverse Event   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the safety information of the Investigator Brochure for German cockroach allergen extract, 
AllerMed’s  package  inser t for allergenic extracts , or is not listed at the specificity, severity or 
rate of occurrence that has been observed; or  is not consistent with  the risk information for 
study procedures  described in the protocol .  
12.2. 4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the IND sponsor ( DAIT/NIAID ), it results in any of the following outcomes (21 
CFR 312.32(a)):  
1. Death : A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol-defined follow -up period must be reported whether it is 
considered treatment related or not.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -thre atening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID  Medical Monitor , its occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or b irth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may req uire medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_457379].  
12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E -6: Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice;  and 
applies the standards:  
• Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (published September 2007)  for local reactions to 
study procedures.  
• Grading System of Severity of Anaphylaxis  adapted , from the grading scale of Brown et al.

12.3. 1 Adverse Events Related to Nasal Allergen Challenge and Skin Testing  
Excessive local reactions to nasal allergen challenge and skin testing not associated with systemic signs or symptoms will be graded according to Table 12.3.1a below; declines in PEF 
occurring during the Challenge Visit will be graded according to Table 12.3.1b below.   If 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_106438] a  PEF less than 80% of baseline and the FEV1 is ≥  85% of 
baseline value then the decline in  PEF will not be considered an AE. All AEs should be recorded

prior to the initiation of the NAC .  
 
All systemic reactions  to skin testing or the NAC , regardless of severity grade, will be recorded as 
Adverse Events. Systemic reactions related to skin testing or nasal allergen challenge ( including 
anaphylaxis) will be graded according to Table 12.3.1c  Grading System of Severity of 
Anaphylaxis , adapted from the grading scale of Brown  et al .11 
Table 12.3 .1c Grading System of Severity of Anaphylaxis  
 
Grade  Defined By  
1. Mild (skin & subcutaneous tissues, GI, 
&/or mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]1) Flushing, urticaria, periorbital or facial angioedema; 
mild  dyspnea, wheeze or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; mild abdominal pain and/or emesis  
2. Moderate (mild symptoms + features 
suggesting moderate respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular or GI symptoms)  Marked dysphagia, hoarseness, and/or stridor; SOB, 
wheezing & retractions; crampy abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting and/or diarrhea; and/or mild dizziness  
3. Severe (hypoxia, hypotension, or 
neurological compromise)  Cyanosis or SpO2 < 92% at any stage, hypotension, 
confusion, collapse, loss of consciousness; or incontinence  
1During the Nasal Allergen Challenge , respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908], upper or lower, will ONLY be considered 
as part of an anaphylaxis event if they appear together with other systemic symptoms, as described 
in the Table  12.3.1c , but not if they appear alone.  
12.3.2 Rhinitis  Symptoms  
During the study it is antici pated that participants will experience allergic rhinitis symptoms 
related to the NAC including itching, sneezing, watery discharge, nasal congestion, and eye symptoms. These symptoms are consistent with moderate-severe allergic rhinitis caused by 
[CONTACT_457402]. These symptoms therefore will not be reported as 
adverse events  or grade 1 anaphylaxis .  Only events with symptoms reaching the levels 
described in Table 12.3.1a will be recorded and reported as AEs.  
12.3. 3 Grading and Attribution of All Other Adverse Events  
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_457403] 12.3.1 or 12.3.2,  according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  (Version 4.03, June 14, 2010).
 This 
document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to 
describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical 
significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by [CONTACT_457404].   
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the follo wing standards in the 
NCI-CTCAE manual:  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 43 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  Grade 1 = mild adverse event.  
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event.  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.  
Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
Grade 5 = death.  
Events grade 1 or higher , not described in section 12.3. 1 or 12.3. 2, will be recorded on  the 
appropriate AE case report form  (eCRF)  for this study.  
For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited 
to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram  etc.), a treatment -emergent adverse event is 
define d as an increase in grade from baseline or from the last post -baseline value that doesn’t meet 
grading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to baseline  will also be recorded as adverse events , 
but are not treatment- emergent. If a specific event or result from a given clinical or laboratory 
evaluation is not included in the NCI -CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an 
adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented  as a result of the event/result . 
 12.3. 4 Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study 
procedure(s) will initially be determined by [CONTACT_457405] (AE/SAE eCRF ).  Final determinatio n of attribution 
for safety reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_106507] ( DAIT/NIAID ).  The relationship of an 
adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided above .

• Interviewing  the subject [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.] . 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject.  
• In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also 
indicate an adverse  event, as defined in 12.3.[ADDRESS_584300] adverse events and serious adverse events as described previously (Section 12 .2, Definitions) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF  
regardless of the relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure.  
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study participation, or until [ADDRESS_584301] prematurely withdraws (without 
withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the study,  whichever occurs first.  
12.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Adverse Events  
12.5.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the IND Sponsor DAIT/NIAID  
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report serious adverse events to the IND sponsor via the SA E eCRF .  Timely reporting of adverse events is required by 
21 CFR 312 and ICH E6 guidelines.  
Site investigators will report to the SACCC (Rho Federal) and DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor all 
serious adverse events  (see Section 12 .2.4, Serious Adverse Event) , regardless of relationship or 
expectedness within 24 hours of discovering the event.  
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE  eCRF will be provided.  
However, unavailable details of t he event will not delay submission of the known information.  
As additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF will be updated and submitted.  Every 
time the SAE e CRF is submitted, it should  be signed by [CONTACT_093].  
For additional information regarding SAE reporting, contact [CONTACT_93255]:

12.5.2 Reporting to Health Authority  
Afte
r an adverse event requiring 24 hour reporting (per Section 12 .5.1, Reportin g of Serious 
Adverse Events to the IND S ponsor ) is submitted by [CONTACT_457406] D 
sponsor ( DAIT/NIAID ). The IND sponsor must report an event to the appropriate health 
authorities using one of these two options:   
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard Reporting  (report in the IND Annual Report)  
This option applies if  the AE is  classified as  one of the following : 

Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 45 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  o Serious, expected, suspected a dverse reactions (see Section 12 .2.2, Suspected 
Adverse Reaction, and Section 12 .2.3, Unexpected Adverse Event ). 
o Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 12 .2.2, Suspected Adverse 
Reaction).  
o Pregnancies.  
Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24 -hour reporting) will be reported 
in the IND Annual Report.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Safety Reporting  
This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of 
the following:  
Category 1 :  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [ S[LOCATION_003]R]  (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 12 .2, Unexpected Adverse Event  and 
21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  
The sponsor must  report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious 
and unexpected.  The sponsor ( DAIT/NIAID ) must report an adverse event as a 
suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such as:  
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be 
strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
2. One or more occu rrences of an event that is not commonly associated  
with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under inve stigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent 
or historical control group. 
Category 2 : Any findings from  studies that suggests a significant human risk   
The sponsor shall report any findin gs from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], 
analyses of adverse events  within the current study or pooled analysis across 
clinical studies or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g. mu tagenicity, teratogenicity, 
carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans  exposed to th e drug 
that would result in a safety -related change in the protocol, informed c onsent, 
investigator brochure or package insert or other aspects of the overa ll conduct 
of the study.   
The sponsor ( DAIT/NIAID ) must notify the FDA, and all participating 
investigators of expedited Safety Reports  within 15 calendar days; unexpected 
fatal or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be 
reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days.  
Study investigators are responsible for SAE reporting to the respective IRB as 
mandated by [CONTACT_1201].

12.7 Reporting of Other Safety Information  
An investigator shall promptly notify the SACCC  and DAIT/NIAID  via email when an “unanticipated 
problem involving risks to subjects or others” is identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an 
adverse event.   
12.8 Review of Safety Information  
12.8.1 Medical Monitor Review  
The DAIT/NIAID  Medic al Monitor shall receive monthly reports from the SACCC compi[INVESTIGATOR_457381], SAEs, and p regnancies recorded by [CONTACT_3452](s) on appropriate 
eCRFs.

SAE and pregnancy reports received by [CONTACT_457407] C (See Sections 12.5.1, Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events to  the IND Sponsor  DAIT/NIAID  and 12.6, Pregnancy Reporting. 
12.8.2 DSMB Review  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 47 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  The DAIT NIAID and SA CCC will p rovide  the DSMB with listin gs of all SAEs on an ongoing ba sis including 
quarterly reports of all SAEs.  Furthermore, the  DSMB will be informe d of expe dited reports of  SAEs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned DSMB Reviews  
The NIAID Asthma and Allergy Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review 
safety data at least yearly during planned DSMB Data  Review Meetings. Data for the 
planned safety reviews will include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs.   
The DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety Report in a timely manner . An SAE 
which the Medical Monitor determines to be an unexpected safety risk will be sent to 
the DSMB i mmediately.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ad hoc  DSMB Reviews  
In addition to the pre -scheduled d ata reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB 
may be called upon for ad hoc reviews. The DSMB will review any event that potentially 
impact s safety at the request of the protocol chair or DAIT/NIAID . In addition, any 
occurrence of meeting one of the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_457382] 11.[ADDRESS_584305] and/or continuation.  
 [IP_ADDRESS].1 Temporary  Suspension of enrollment and drug dosing  for ad hoc DSMB 
Safety Review  
A temporary halt in both enrollment  and drug dosing will be implemented if an ad hoc  
DSMB safety review is required.   
13. Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan  
13.1 Overview  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_457383] a range of German cockroach doses that, when delivered intranasally, can induce a pos itive response to NAC in adults ( TNSS ≥8 out of 12 or a sneezing 
score of 3 ) and children  (TNSS ≥6 out of 12 or a sneezing score of 3) .  Other secondary objectives are to 
determine whether these doses are safe, to test the validity of objective outcomes of nasal challenge, and to assess the reproducibility  of the nasal challenge .  
13.2 Outcomes  
13.2.1 Primary Outcome s 
The primary outcome s are:  
1.    The prevalence of positive NAC, defined as  a sneezing score  of 3 or a TNSS ≥8 out of 12 
in Phase 1 or a TNSS ≥6 out of 12 in Phase 2 .  
2.    The number of reported adverse events and serious adverse events, including their 
severity, seriousness, and treatment relatedness.  
13.2.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 48 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  1.    Number of sneezes.  
2. Maximum TNSS recoded out of all doses received.  
3. Change in TNSS.  
4. Change in PNIF.  
5. Change in PEF.  
6. Visual Analog Scale (VAS).  
7. Change in tryptase in nasal secretions  
8. Change in albumin in nasal secretions  
13.2.3  Exploratory Outcomes  
1. Change in c hemokines in nasal secretions  
2. Change in c ockroach -specific T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_457361]  
13.3 Mea sures to Minimize Bias  
This is a one arm open label study without randomization. All laboratory assays for t ryptase and albumin 
will be performed in a central laboratory.  
13.4 Analysis Plan  
13.4.1 Analysis Populations  
The study population consists of adults aged 18 through 55 years (phase 1) and children ages 8 through 
14 years (phase 2) who have a history of asthma and are German cockroach sensitive.  The study will 
examine the safety of the administration of n on-standardized German cockroach extract delivered 
intranasally.  This is a phase I safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_457384]; thus, only one analysis 
population, the safety population, will be defined for this study. The safety population will include all 
study participants who receive  the ini tial dose  during the Challenge Visit. All statistical analyses will be 
performed on the Safety Population.  
13.4.[ADDRESS_584306] primary objective of this analysis is to estimate a probability of positive response  at each dose , 
defined as reaching a sneezing score  of 3 or a TNSS of ≥ 8 in Phase 1 or  a TNSS of ≥ [ADDRESS_584307] reached 
a sneezing score of 3  or a TNSS of ≥ 8 in Phase 1 or a TNSS of ≥6 in  Phase 2 , it is assumed that  they would 
continue to respond for the remaining doses.  Therefore, if 7 people respond prior to Dose 5, 3 will be tested at Dose 5, and the proportion presented for Dose 5 would be (7 + # responders at Dose 5)/10.  
Associated exact 95% confidence interva ls will be estimated using the Clopper -Pearson method.     
The second primary objective of this analysis is to assess if intranasal delivery of cockroach allergen via a nasal allergen challenge  is safe.  This will be done by [CONTACT_457408].  Frequency of AEs and SAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_15992], organ, seriousness, severity, and treatment relatedness.  
13.4. [ADDRESS_584308] dose at which a positive response  occurs 
for an individual will be compared between study visits.   A weighted Kappa statistic and associated 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated for each dose category to quantify agreement between study 
visits.  
13.[ADDRESS_584309] primary outcome, the prevalence of positive response to 
NAC  at each dose , defined as a sneezing score of 3  or TNSS  ≥8 out of 12  in Phase 1 or TNSS  ≥[ADDRESS_584310] 95% confidence intervals.    
Number of observed responses at 
given dose (out of 1 0 subjects)  Probability of Response (95% CI)  
0 0 (0.00, 0.31)  
1 0.1 (0.003, 0.45)  
2 0.2 (0.03, 0.56)  
3 0.3 (0.07, 0.65)  
4 0.4 (0.12, 0.74)  
5 0.5 (0.19, 0.81)  
6 0.6 (0.26, 0.88)  
7 0.7 (0.35, 0.93)  
8 0.8 (0.44, 0.97)

The proposed sample size for phase [ADDRESS_584311] 
information, visits consultations, examinations and other information  are recorded .   Documentation of 
source data is necessary for the reconstruction, evaluation and validation of clinical findings, 
observations and other activities during a clinical trial.  
14.2. Access to Source Data  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page 50 of 52 
Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5.0 9September2016  The site investigators and site staff will make all source data available to the IND sponsor ( DAIT/NIAID ), 
as well as to  relevant health authorities . Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to 
maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified 
individuals. 
15. Protocol Deviations  
15.1. Protocol Deviation  Definitions  
Protocol Deviation  – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the 
protocol; no deviations from the protocol are permitted .  Any change, divergence, or departure from the 
study design or procedures constitutes a protocol deviation.  As a result of any deviation, corrective 
actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violati on) - A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well- being and/or the completeness, 
accuracy and reliability of the study data.   In addition, protocol violations include willful or k nowing 
breach es of human subject protection regulations, or policies, any action that is inconsistent with the 
NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles , and a serious or 
continuing noncompliance with federal, state,  local or institutional human subject protection 
regulations, policies, or procedures .  
 
Non- Major  Protocol Deviation  - A non-major  protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure 
from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that  does not  have a major impact on the 
subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
15.2. Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations  
The study site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393241],  document and report protocol 
deviations.  However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during 
other forms of study conduct review.  
Upon determination that a protocol deviation (major or minor) has occurred, the study staff will a) 
notify the PI, b) notify the NIAID Medical Monitor and Project Manager, c) notify the SACCC, and d ) 
complete the Protocol Deviation form.  The Protocol Deviation (PD) form will document at a minimum 
the date PD occurred, the date PD identi fied, a description of event, whether the  deviation result ed in 
SAE/AE, the signature [CONTACT_39299], and documentation of a corrective action plan.  The SACCC and the IND 
sponsor ( DAIT/ NIAID ) may request discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_457385]/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_457386]  (SACCC, DAIT/NIAID,  and the central IRB, 
per IRB regulations ).  Protocol deviations will be reported to the DSMB  and the central IRB .   
16. Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice  
16.1. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Inner -City Asthma Consortium  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_584312] of the trial, for verifying adherence to 
the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data.  
The CRFs will be completed online via a web -based electronic data capture (ED C) system that has been 
validated and is compliant with Part 11 Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Study staff at the site 
will enter information into the electronic CRFs, and the data will be stored remotely at a central 
database. Data quality w ill be ensured through the EDC system’s continuous monitoring of data and 
real- time detection and correction of errors. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text, 
and the name [CONTACT_8066]) will be recorded in a n electronic audit trail to 
allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations.  
16.2. Statement of Compliance  
This clinical study will be conducted using current good clinical practice (GCP)  guidelines and all 
applicable regulatory requirements , as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice 
Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study 
initiation, the protocol and the informed consent do cuments will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_457409].  Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by [CONTACT_457410], the IRB , and submitted to the FDA  before they are implemented.  
16.3. Informed Consent Process  
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and will allow 
adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her  decision.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_457387] . The consent designee must 
be listed on the delegation log , have knowledge of the study and have received training (from the local 
IRB, PI , or study coordinator) in the consent process .  The prospective partici pant will be told that being 
in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) will read, sign, and date a consent form before 
undergoing any  study procedures.  Consent materials will be presented in participants’ primary 
language. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant.  
The consent process will be  ongoing. The consent form will be revised when important new safety 
information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may 
affect participation in the study.  
16.4. Privacy and Confidentiality  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will be assigned a unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to 
collect, store, and report participant information.  Site personnel will  not transmit documents containing 
personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their representatives.  
17. Publication Policy  
Presentations and publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_106527].

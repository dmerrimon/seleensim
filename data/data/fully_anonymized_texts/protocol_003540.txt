Virtual Reality for Pain Management Study
2. Principal Investigator
[INVESTIGATOR_732813]
3. Purpose
Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and prescription 
pain reliever addiction is driving this epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
[CDC], 2015). There are enough opi[INVESTIGATOR_732814] (e.g., 259 million prescriptions in 2012) (CDC, 2014) and 78 
Americans die every day from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] (CDC, 2016).  Pain is the most universal 
medical complaint with 25% of US adults reporting a day-long epi[INVESTIGATOR_732815] 10% reporting the pain lasted a year or more (National Center for Health Statistics, 
2006). Pain and its sequela (including those directly linked to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]/abuse) cost the US 
economy 61.2 billion per year (Stewart, Ricci, Chee, Morganstein, & Lipton, 2003). 
Accordingly, finding new methods of reducing pain is a priority for the US government. Indeed, 
on March 18, 2016 the CDC released new guidelines for reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] (Dowell, 
Haegerich, & Chou, 2016) and on March 29, 2016 the White House released a document 
detailing the actions needed to address this public health problem (The White House, 2016). 
Both of these documents call for non-medication methods of pain management.  
Virtual Reality (VR) is one effective non-pharmacological 
method that reduces acute and chronic pain.  A systematic 
review of 11 randomized controlled trials (i.e., gold 
standard for evaluating intervention efficacy) showed that 
VR reduced pain more than credible control interventions 
(Malloy & Milling, 2010). Importantly, pointing to room 
for improvement to current VR interventions for pain, this 
analysis showed that the level of pain reduction was 
dependent on how realistic the virtual environments were. 
There are two primary problems with current VR 
technology that prevent large-scale use and effectiveness. 
First, current VR technology uses animated (cartoon like) 
environments (see Figure 1). Patients report this quality 
prevents full immersion. Studies have shown that many 
users complain that the computer generated virtual reality 
(VR) stimuli looks unrealistic, eccentric and too much like 
a video game (Kwon, Powell, & Chalmers, 2013). Virtual reality environments have been 
traditionally created by [CONTACT_732857] 
(CGI). While CGI can be used to make intricate virtual environments, unless there is a team of

The University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin                                                                                                          Page [ADDRESS_1001253]: the tendency of CGI representations of people to be viewed as 
unsettling as the representations become more lifelike. Second, current CGI VR technology is 
bulky and costly requiring a large computer setup with multiple screens (approximately $30,000 
for a setup; see Figure 2). Recent advances in VR technology can address both of these concerns, 
and thus there is potential to develop a more cost-effective application.
Our team has been working with virtual reality for 10 
years now conducting several large randomized 
controlled trials (Powers & Emmelkamp, 2008; 
Meyerbröker, Powers, van Stegeren, & Emmelkamp, 
2012; Powers et al., 2013; Tart et al., 2013). Two 
major recent innovations are central to this proposal. 
First, the realism possible in VR has dramatically 
increased with the use of 360-degree 3D HD film 
environments. 360-Degree Video VR is a radical 
filmmaking technology that can turn live action 
footage into a 360-degree environment that users can 
interact with. 360-Degree Video VR is made by 
[CONTACT_732858] a 360-
degree area of a live action event (see Figure 3). Then 
those angles are stitched together in post-production 
into a 360-degree texture sphere and the sphere is 
then mapped to the head tracker on the users HDM.  Leading to the effect that when a user turns 
his head, their view of the live action video footage turns with them in real time (e.g. if the user 
looks down, the camera pans down and the user sees the floor) allowing the user to look around 
anywhere in the [ADDRESS_1001254] is approximately $500. 
This enhanced level of immersion has the potential to dramatically improve the efficacy to 
reduce acute and chronic pain (see above). Second, deployment of the resulting content to 
patients is now much smaller and inexpensive (e.g., $99 for a Samsung Galaxy Gear VR (see 
Figure 4) or $[ADDRESS_1001255] systems). This technology makes VR accessible to 
anyone with a smartphone. 
The current study seeks to test the efficacy of the standard animated/CGI VR versus the 
enhanced 360-degree 3D HD film versions of VR in reducing pain in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20889]. To this 
aim we will enroll 201 adult participants experiencing pain University Medical Center 
Brackenridge (UMCB), Dell Seton Medical Center (DSMC), Baylor Scott & White Medical 
Center Temple (BSWMCT), and randomly assign them to the enhanced (360-Degree Video VR) 
film condition (n = 67), the standard (animated/CGI film) condition (n = 67), or the waitlist

due to the anticipated number of screen failures (due to inclusion/exclusion criteria). We 
hypothesize that the film VR will show greater pain reductions and increased functioning relative 
to both the animated VR and the waitlist condition.
4. Procedures
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732816] a single visit to the participant at University Medical 
Center Brackenridge Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Dell Seton Medical Center, or Baylor Scott & White Medical 
Center Temple and an online follow-up questionnaire e-mailed to the participant 
approximately one-week after study visit completion. If email is not available for the follow-
up survey, participants will be reached by [CONTACT_756]. Total participation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732817] [ADDRESS_1001257] research personnel with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732818] (DSMC) who care for patients experiencing pain. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732819] a

Research Proposal
The University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin                                                                                                          Page [ADDRESS_1001258] about the study procedures. Participants 
will be able to continue on with the study if they are able and willing to give signed informed 
consent. Following consent, participants will asked, if they are willing, to complete and sign 
the HIPAA Research Authorization form to permit research personnel to access their medical 
records. Information collected from the medical records will include self-report pain ratings, 
medication information (names, doses, and timing), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732820], phone number, 
email address, date of birth, medical diagnosis information, and medical progress notes. If 
participants refuse to sign the HIPAA Research Authorization, they will still be allowed to 
participate in the study, but their medical records will not be accessed by [CONTACT_2710].
During a 15-minute baseline, participants will be assessed for consciousness by [CONTACT_25617] (Glasgow Coma Scale & abbreviated Mini Mental Status Exam) and then complete 
a short battery of questionnaires to obtain demographic, treatment, and prior media use 
information, and to assess their mood, average pain, and pain interference levels. All 
assessments will be delivered on an electronic iPad or on paper. All assessments are designed 
to be able to be delivered orally if participants cannot use the iPad or utilize a pen or pencil.
Conditions
Participants will be randomized to the 360° 3D HD video VR film condition, animated video 
VR condition, or waitlist condition. Those randomized to the waitlist group will complete all 
study procedures except the VR exposure. After completion of the study visit, we will give 
those in the waitlist condition the option of experiencing the 9-minute VR video of their 
choosing. 
360° 3D HD Video Virtual Reality
360° Video Virtual Reality (360° -VVR) refers to a three-
dimensional, immersive film environment that people can interact 
with.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_732827] a digital 
head mounted display (HMD) (see Figure 5.) that immerses the 
user in the virtual world by [CONTACT_732860], so that the user can only see the three dimensional images 
projected on the digital display in front of their eyes. 
A key component of virtual reality is that users can guide their 
sensory input of the multimedia environment in a way similar to how they guide their 
senses in real life.  The HMD typi[INVESTIGATOR_732828] a head tracker that is mapped to a 
virtual “camera” view of the three-dimensional multimedia environment so that when 
users turn their heads, their view of the multimedia environment shifts with them (e.g. if 
users look down, the camera pans down and the users see the floor). As such, unlike a 2D 
film, 360° - VVR is an interactive 360° viewing experience. While you can turn your head 
away from the experience of watching a television, with a virtual reality head mounted

provide powerful interactive experiences for users but until recently, the hardware necessary 
for virtual reality could cost tens of thousands of dollars. However in the last five years 
virtual reality headsets have become almost as cheap as cellphones and Google cardboard 
makes it even cheaper by [CONTACT_732861]-it-yourself VR 
headsets. Thus, VR headsets are no longer limited to well-funded labs but in the grasp of 
individuals. This technology could mean that reducing pain in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732829] a practical and economical reality. 
The VR treatment in this study will be administered using a Samsung Gear VR headset. The 
Gear VR is a new, affordable virtual reality headset, that when coupled with a Samsung 
Galaxy smartphone can deliver photorealistic VR footage easily to participants in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111483]. 
Treatment
Following the acquisition of consent and the baseline assessments, participants will be 
outfitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset. Before the headset is placed on the patient’s 
head, the patient will be given the option to wear a plastic shower cap over their head for the 
headset straps to rest on. This was recommended by [CONTACT_732862]. The shower cap is not required if the patient does not desire to wear one. The 
research assistant will help them adjust the headset. If the participants record any discomfort, 
the research assistant will attempt to adjust the settings on the Samsung Gear VR. If the 
participant finds that regardless of the settings, they cannot watch the video comfortably, 
they will be thanked for their time and their participation in the study will end. 
After the headset is properly calibrated, the participant will receive instructions that they are 
about to view VR footage of central [LOCATION_007] locations. At the same time, they will be told that 
during the task they should try to imagine that they are actually at the location experiencing 
the scenery first hand. Additionally, participants will be instructed not to exert their body in 
any capacity that may cause additional pain while experiencing the virtual environment.   
They will be instructed that if at any time they become uncomfortable or wish to stop using 
the Gear VR, they may do so at anytime. Before watching the video, patients will be outfitted 
with a pair of headphones. The headphone ear cushions will be covered with sanitary 
disposable headphone covers. The covers on each ear cushion will be disposed of in a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732830].
Participants in the enhanced film condition will view [ADDRESS_1001260]-treatment assessments for 5-10 minutes. These assessments will measure pain, 
presence, mood, negative effects of VR, absorption, human presence, participant’s prior 
familiarity with the locations depi[INVESTIGATOR_732831], and their attitude toward the VR 
session immediately after the treatment. Nausea, dizziness, eyestrain, and head pain is being 
assessed in an effort to identify the incidence of this component of simulator sickness 
sometimes associated with VR use (Kennedy et al., 1992). Following the Post-Treatment 
assessments, the Follow-Up Pain Questionnaire & Present Mood Questionnaire will be 
administered [ADDRESS_1001261] 
in order to track the lasting pain reduction from the VR treatments. 
Open Interview
Following the Follow-Up Pain Questionnaire & Present Mood Questionnaire, participants 
will be asked to provide any feedback they had from the VR treatment and to describe their 
experiences throughout the experiment. Was the treatment comfortable? Do they think it 
could help them manage pain? The interview will be left in an open format to allow 
participants more freedom in expressing themselves. 
Cleaning of VR Headset
After each study visit with a patient, research personnel will wipe down the face cushion and 
the plastic exterior of the VR headset using a PDI Sani Cloth Plus Germicidal Wipe. This is 
the sanitization procedure recommended by [CONTACT_732863].
Collecting Data from Medical Records
After completion of the study visit, research personnel will collect data from the patient’s 
medical records if the patient completes and signs the HIPAA Research Authorization form. 
All PHI obtained from medical records (self-report pain ratings, medication information 
(names, doses, and timing), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732820], phone number, email address, date of 
birth, diagnosis information, and medical progress notes) will be accessed electronically by 
[CONTACT_732864] a Seton computer at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Electronic data from medical records 
will be entered directly into a password protected tracking sheet on UT Box and maintained 
by [CONTACT_2710].
One-week E-mail Follow-up
One-week after participating in the experiment participants will be e-mailed a series of 
follow-up questionnaires that will include the Follow-Up Pain Questionnaire, Present Mood 
Questionnaire, and Participant Satisfaction Survey. If participants cannot be reached by 
[CONTACT_6968], research personnel will contact [CONTACT_732865] a follow-up in person interview.

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974)
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974) is a commonly used 
instrument in clinical practice and provides a structured method for assessment of the 
level of consciousness. The GCS has good reliability and well-established cross-
sectional construct validity (Prasad, 1996).
Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, & McMugh, 1975)
The Mini Mental Status Exam (Folstein et al., 1975) is a questionnaire used extensively 
in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. We will be using an 
abbreviated version in combination with the GCS to assess for adequate consciousness 
for participation in the study.
Demographics Questionnaire

race/ethnicity, level of education, etc.). Participants will also be asked about hearing and 
visual impairment as well as their history of motion sickness.
Media Use Survey
The Media Use Survey is a brief 4-question survey aimed to determine the participant’s 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_732837], online videos, and video games. The measure also asks about 
prior use of a virtual reality headset.
Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8)
The Patient Health Questionnaire 8-Item (PHQ-8) is a brief self-report measure of major 
depressive disorder (Koneke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001). The PHQ-8 is considered to be 
a valid measure of depression for population-based studies and clinical populations 
(Kroenke et al., 2009), with a cut off score of equal to or greater than [ADDRESS_1001269] question regarding suicidality. 
Pre-Treatment Pain Questionnaire
The Pre-Treatment Pain Questionnaire will be used to assess the participant’s pain prior 
to receiving VR treatment. It is derived from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; Cleeland and 
Ryan, 1994; Cleeland et al., 1996) and contains Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) aimed at 
assessing the participant’s pain intensity, pain quality, pain interference, and pain relief, 
as recommended by [CONTACT_732866] (Dworkin et al., 2005). The NRS is one of the most common measures for 
assessing pain, and has been a validated outcome measure of pain intensity (Breivik, 
Björnsson, & Skovlund, 2000; Breivik et al., 2008). The NRS was also chosen because it 
could be administered orally if patients cannot use their hands to write or use the iPad.
Present Mood Questionnaire
The Present Mood Questionnaire will be sued to assess the participant’s current mood. 
The survey uses a labeled (0-10) NRS to measure the extent that the participant feels sad, 
anxious, happy, and tranquil.
Post-Treatment Pain Questionnaire
The Post-Treatment Questionnaire will be used to assess the participant’s pain during and 
following the virtual reality treatment. The NRS pain assessment questions are identical 
to the Pre-Treatment Pain Questionnaire, except questions are altered to specify pain the 
participant experienced during the VR treatment. 
Presence Inventory
The Presence Inventory is adapted from The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (Lessiter 
et al., 2001) and The Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ). It will be used to assess the 
degree of Spatial Presence (The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory), Ecological Validity 
(The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory & IPQ), and Negative Effects (The ITC-Sense of 
Presence Inventory).

The Absorption Survey (adapted from Agarwal, & Karahanna, 2000) is a 12-item NRS 
that will be used to measure participant engagement with the virtual world. Participants 
rate the degree to which they agree with the statements on a 1-10 scale, with 0 being 
“strongly disagree” and 10 being “strongly agree”.
Attitudes Toward the Experience Survey (adapted from Sundar, 2000)
The Attitudes Toward the Experience Survey (adapted from Sudnar, 2000) is a 12-item 
NRS that will be used to measure the participant’s attitude toward the VR experience. 
Participants rate the degree to which they agree with the statements on a 1-10 scale, with 
0 being “strongly disagree” and 10 being “strongly agree”.
Human Presence Survey (adapted from Basdogan, Ho, Srinivasan, & Slater, 2000)
The Human Presence Survey (adapted from Basdogan, Ho, Srinivasan, & Slater, 2000) is 
a 2-item measure that will be used to assess the extent that participants felt they were 
with other people during the VR session. 
Location Familiarity Survey
The Location Familiarity Survey is a 1-item measure that will be used to assess the 
participant’s prior familiarity with the locations depi[INVESTIGATOR_732838].   
Follow-Up Pain Questionnaire
The Follow-Up Questionnaire will be used to measure the participant’s pain in the [ADDRESS_1001271] 10 minutes instead of during the 
VR session. 
Open Interview 
The Open Interview will be comprised of brief open-ended questions designed to collect 
general patient feedback regarding their thoughts about the virtual reality treatment upon 
conclusion of the study visit. It will be used to guide future research methods.
Patient Satisfaction Survey
The participant satisfaction survey will be used to assess participant acceptability and 
satisfaction of the virtual reality treatment 1-week following completion of the study. It 
has both questions utilizing a Numeric Rating Scale as well as open-ended questions and 
will be used to guide future research methods. The survey will also include the Patient 
Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC; Guy, 1976). This measure is a single-item 
rating by [CONTACT_732867] a clinical trial on a 7-
point scale that ranges from “much better” to “much worse” with “no change” as the mid-
point. There has been widespread use of the PGIC in recent clinical pain trials (e.g. Dunkl 
et al., 2000; Farrar et al., 2001) and the data provide a responsive and readily

6. Participants
a. Target Population
Our target enrollment is 201 participants who complete all study procedures. We will 
recruit 500 participants 18 years of age and older in order to enroll 201 participants to 
account for dropouts and ineligible participants. Participants will be patients experiencing 
current pain that is not related to day-to-day, normal experiences (such as minor 
headaches, sprains, and toothaches) at University Medical Center Brackenridge or Dell 
Seton Medical Center in Austin, TX, or Baylor Scott & White Medical Center Temple in 
Temple, TX, that are referred to the study by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_33717].  
The final number of participants enrolled in each of the three study conditions is expected 
to be 67 participants.
b. Inclusion/Exclusion
Inclusion Criteria

Pre-Treatment Pain Questionnaire at the onset of study visit by [CONTACT_49419] “Yes” 
to the first question of the questionnaire. There is no specific threshold of how 
much pain the participant must be in to be eligible for this study. The participant 
must be experiencing current pain that is not related to day-to-day, normal 
experiences (such as minor headaches, sprains, and toothaches).
Scores a 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale and a 7 or above on the abbreviated Mini

virtual reality video because of it.
Unable to position head completely upright (90 degrees from the ground).
History of seizures. 
Lesions, rashes, or open wounds on face, head, neck, or ears.
c. Benefits
There is no direct benefit to the participant for participating in this study. The possible 
benefit for the participant from participating in this study is reducing pain they may be 
experiencing. Societal benefits include diversifying pain management treatments for 
patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732840]. The use of portable and affordable VR 
technology could be distributed widely and eventually reach patients in all medical and 
even in home settings. Society could further benefit from using virtual reality for pain 
management by [CONTACT_732868][INVESTIGATOR_732841]. 
d. Risks
The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal. Potential risks include:
The assessment instruments may cause mild distress because of their focus on 
emotional topi[INVESTIGATOR_732842]. If participants are 
interested in receiving referals for this distress, they will be instructed to alert 
research personnel and the personnel will provide the participant with a referral 
list. Participants can stop the study at any time as a result of this distress with no 
consequence.
Cyber sickness, a form of motion sickness, is a potential risk of virtual reality use. 
Symptoms can include blurred vision, sweating, eyestrain, salivation, headaches, 
vertigo, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms are temporary and resolve 
within a few minutes to a few hours. For this reason, we also limit the exposure 
length to 9-15 minutes. Participants can discontinue the exposure at any time if 
they experience any of these symptoms. Less than 10% of participants report such 
symptoms using the old technology. In addition, we expect fewer of these 
symptoms with this new technology. Participants may stop the study at any time if 
they begin to experience any of these possible symptoms from experiencing video 
virtual reality.
Protection of Human Participants from Research Risk 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks: The PI, Mark Powers, Ph.D., is available for 
intervention as needed and back-up plans are established including referral to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732843]. These safety procedures have been effective in dealing with adverse 
physical and mental health events in previous and ongoing studies. Upon study completion, all 
participants will be referred to follow-up care if needed. 
Research Proposal
The University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin                                                                                                          Page [ADDRESS_1001274]- Revised October 2014Persons who express suicidal ideation (or other forms of serious threat to themselves or others, 
or who are gravely disabled due to a mental disorder) at any time they are in contact [CONTACT_732869]. This 
would include assessment of the seriousness of danger or disablement, referral for immediate 
crisis management (e.g., hotlines, crisis centers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]), or contact[CONTACT_732870]. Study personnel who have direct contact [CONTACT_136264] (e.g., telephone interviewers, laboratory assessors, scheduling staff) will be trained 
in methods of crisis management. 
To deal with the potential risk of loss of privacy (judged to be minimal), we will maintain 
confidentiality by [CONTACT_46766], by [CONTACT_46767], and by 
[CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_46741]. Participant information will be accessible only to 
research staff. Identifying information will not be reported.
Collection and Reporting of AEs and SAEs
Information regarding AEs will be obtained by [CONTACT_732871]. At 
each visit all new complaints and symptoms (i.e., those not existing prior to signing of 
informed consent) will be recorded on the AE Form. Pre-existing complaints or symptoms that 
increased in intensity or frequency after having signed the Informed Consent Form will be 
entered on the AE Form also. All AEs will be characterized in terms of their start and stop 
dates, start and stop times, intensity, action taken on Intervention, relationship to Intervention, 
participant outcome and whether or not the AE led to a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). Any 
clinically relevant increase or decrease to the intensity or frequency of a reported AE will 
trigger a separate entry on the AE Form. If the event meets the definition of an SAE, the 
procedure for reporting SAEs will be followed; the event will not be reported on the AE Form 
also incase the start and stop dates are equal to the start and stop dates of the SAE.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death;
Is life-threatening; 
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These 
will also usually be considered serious too.
All serious events occurring between signing of the Informed Consent Form by [CONTACT_732872], except those pre-specified in the 
protocol, will be reported as soon as practical (within 24 hours of awareness) to the IRB. This 
includes serious events, which could be associated with the trial procedures, even if occurring 
outside the treatment period.

of the SAE. Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not be considered as (an) SAE(s) 
and will not be entered on the SAE form:
Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_613080], therapeutic, or surgical procedures for a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen during the course of a clinical trial. These pre-
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732844], including the 
condition requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_613082].
All SAEs (i.e. including serious events occurring outside the treatment period) will be reported 
as soon as practical (within 24 hours of awareness) to the IRB. Reporting of an SAE will be 
done by [CONTACT_732873]. For each SAE, the investigator fills out this SAE form (as 
complete as possible) and sends the form and all available supporting documentation by [CONTACT_732874].
e. Recruitment
Our Seton PI, [CONTACT_732887], will connect research personnel with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732845]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732819] a 
potentially eligible participant. Patient information necessary to conduct an in-person 
recruitment visit by [CONTACT_3462] (patient name [CONTACT_329245][INVESTIGATOR_732820]) will be 
shared by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_732821] 
(Ascension Secure E-mail Portal) or texting (TigerText) applications used by [CONTACT_732875]. Both of these applications are regularly used by [CONTACT_732876] (PHI) with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]. Ascension Secure E-mail Portal 
and TigerText keep messages confidential and are HIPAA compliant. Additionally, 
potential participant information may be shared with research personnel in-person. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732823], but will not be involved with direct 
recruitment. All direct recruitment will be conducted by [CONTACT_2710]. This method 
of recruitment is the standard used by [CONTACT_732877][INVESTIGATOR_33717]. 
Our BSWMCT PI, [CONTACT_732884], will connect research personnel with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732846]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732819] a

by [CONTACT_102]. 
f. Obtaining Informed Consent
The consent form will be handed to the potential participant (paper procedures) or shown 
to the participant on an iPad (electronic procedures), and they will be given time to read 
through the form. Research personnel will go over the consent form and answer any 
questions about the study. If the participant agrees to participate, they will be asked to 
type in their name [CONTACT_3670], and give informed signed consent using either their finger 
directly onto the iPad or a stylus pen, or asked to sign the paper consent form. 
Participants will either receive a paper copy or be emailed a consent form for their 
records, depending on their preference. 
A waiver of HIPAA Research Authorization will be used in order to collect initial 
screening data from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732849]. The 
HIPAA waiver is only being requested for recruitment purposes. A waiver of HIPAA 
authorization is appropriate for this study as the research could not be practically 
conducted without having access to the name [CONTACT_329245][INVESTIGATOR_732850]. This PHI will be supplied to research personnel by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_33717], 
and without it, research personnel would have no way of recruiting potential participants 
in the study. 
Participants will sign a HIPAA Research Authorization to allow research personnel to 
access participant medical records. Information collected from the medical records will 
include self-report pain ratings, medication information (names, doses, and timing), 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732820], phone number, email address, date of birth, medical diagnosis 
information, and medical progress notes. If participants refuse to sign the HIPAA 
Research Authorization, they will still be allowed to participate in the study, but their 
medical records will not be accessed by [CONTACT_2710].
7. Privacy and Confidentiality
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_732851]’ privacy to the best of our abilities. Data 
forms and accompanying narrative summaries will undergo a systematic and rigorous editing 
process before they are keyed into the database. The research assistants routinely evaluate the 
data and discuss any problems and questions with the study staff and [CONTACT_732890] at regular 
weekly team meetings. Accuracy of data entry will be ensured by a standard double-entry 
procedure. Data management formal reports on record status across the three following domains 
will be employed: entered, verified, and edited. These reports of data records will be evaluated 
one time a month during the final team meeting of the month. To help ensure data protection, 
backup copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], automatically generated by [CONTACT_46768], will be available. Additionally, 
our hard copy record systems, as described previously, will be maintained in fire-resistant locked 
cabinets.

previous work. All data for the current study including demographic information, diagnoses, and 
participant and clinician rated measures will be directly entered into an electronic case report 
form (eCRF). 
The eCRF will consist of a series of separate web pages for study personnel and participants. A 
series of passwords will be programmed to ensure that participants are unable to access pages 
reserved for study personnel. The eCRF will be constructed so that all requested information 
must be entered into each page in the fields provided, or the system will not permit access to the 
next page. The system is designed so that only completed eCRFs can be transmitted. If 
information for a field is either not available or not applicable, the system will require that it be 
documented as such in the eCRF. Field parameters will be specified such that suspect values are 
either disallowed or flagged for the immediate attention of the study directors and Principal 
Investigators. 
All study data (eCRF and data entry from paper forms) will be collected and managed using 
REDCap electronic data capture tools or Qualtrics Survey Software hosted at University of 
[LOCATION_007] at Austin. 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data 
entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export 
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for 
importing data from external sources. REDCap is a HIPAA compliant company, and servers are 
stored in a tier one data storage facility that includes adequate security measures.
Like REDCap, Qualtrics is a generalized survey/form service permitting the creation of survey 
instruments, distribution of the surveys, data storage and analysis. Qualtrics meets stringent 
information security requirements as set out by [CONTACT_260189]. Qualtrics servers are protected by 
[CONTACT_5019]-end firewall systems, and scans are performed regularly to ensure that any vulnerabilities 
are quickly found and patched. Complete penetration tests are performed yearly. All services 
have quick failover points and redundant hardware, with complete backups performed nightly. 
Data are stored and processed in a specific secure location. HITECH (Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) updated HIPAA rules to ensure that data are 
properly protected and best security practices followed. Qualtrics safeguards all customer data, 
and uses secure data centers to ensure the highest protection as per HITECH requirements.

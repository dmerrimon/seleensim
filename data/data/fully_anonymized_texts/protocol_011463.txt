Protocol Title  
A Phase 1/2 Study of Combination  Immunotherapy  and mRNA Vaccine  in Subjects with Non -
small Cell Lung Cancer  (NSCLC)  
 
Objectives and Synopsis  
This is an o pen- label multicenter 2-arm study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy 
of the addition of a vaccine therapy to 1 or 2 checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC:  
Arm A: mRNA Vaccine [ BI 1361849 (formerly CV9202 )] + anti-PD-L1 [durvalumab ] 
Arm B: mRNA Vaccine [ BI 1361849] + anti -PD- L1 [durvalumab ] + anti -CTLA -4 
[tremelimumab] . 
For each arm of the study, there is  a dose evaluation  phase  in which  the Recommended 
Combination Dose (RCD) is determined according to a standard 3 + 3 design. For Arm A, the 
RCD of BI 1361849  + durvalumab  is determined. The starting dose of durvalumab is 1500 mg 
with possible de -escalation to 750 mg; the dose for BI  [ZIP_CODE] 49 remains constant. For Arm B, 
the RCD of BI 1361849  + durvalumab  from Arm A  with the addition of tremelimumab 75 mg is 
evaluated. There is no dose escalation/de -escalation for Arm B; if there is unacceptable 
toxicity in Arm B, the arm will be discontinued .  The dose evaluation phase  is followed by [CONTACT_299601] , in which the cohort at the RCD  for each arm  is expanded to 20 subjects 
(inclusive of the subjects from the do se evaluation cohort) .

1.1 Checkpoint Inhibitors  in the Treatment of  Non -Small Cell Lung 
Cancer  
Lung cancer is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 cancer- related deaths, or an estimated 1.6 million 
people, worldwide. In the U.S., lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -relat ed death among 
both men and women. (1)  For patients who are dia gnosed with advanced disease, conventional 
treatment options including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are unlikely to result in cure.   
Lung cancer has also emerged as an exciting target of immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], specifically 
checkpoint inhibitors. (2) In non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), marked single -agent activity has 
been observed with inhibition of programmed death recep tor 1 (PD- 1) on immune cells or 
inhibition of programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD -L1).(3-5)  Notably, PD -L1 appears to be 
expressed in 25% to 50% of NSCLC tumors, with expression both on tumor cells and within the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) on tumor -associated macrophages. (6)  While the relationship of 
expression to therapeutic response is still being defined, early studies indicate there may be 
some activity of such i nhibitors in NSCLC. (7-9)  
Checkpoint inhibitors , particularly PD -1/PD -L1 antibodies,  have been shown to be effective in 
the treatment of NSCLC (10-12), and in 2015, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved by 
[CONTACT_299603] -based 
chemotherapy .  
In March 2015, FDA approved the PD -[ADDRESS_365393] s receiving nivolumab had median overall 
survival of 9.2 months versus 6.0 months with docetaxe l.(11)  In October 2015, FDA expanded 
its approval of nivolumab to include non -squamous NSCLC that has stopped responding to 
chemotherapy. This approval wa s based on the results of a Phase [ADDRESS_365394] s who received nivolumab had a median overall survival of 12.2 months compared to 9.4 
months for those receiving docetaxel. (10)  
Also in October 2015, pembrolizumab, a PD -1 checkpoint inhibitor was approved for patients 
with NSCLC (both squamous and non -squamous) with tumors that test positive for PD -L1. In a 
Phase 1 clinical trial, PD -L1 expression level of 50% was associated with the likelihood of clinical 
benefit. Among subject s with a proportion score of at least 50%, the respon se rate was 
45.2%. (12)  
For both of these immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is recommended that patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (EGFR)  or anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations s hould 
have disease progression on FDA -approved therapy prior to receiving nivolumab or 
pembrolizumab.  
Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab are being studied  in multiple indications  in randomized 
Phase [ADDRESS_365395] -line treatment , and s everal 
other PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors are also in late  stage clinical testing.

antigen 4 ( CTLA -4) on regulatory T -cells (Tregs) which  are often increased in the TME,  has also 
demonstrated single -agent act ivity in certain tumor types.  Although single -agent anti -CTLA -[ADDRESS_365396] not shown responses in NSCLC or improvement in overall survival, there has 
been prolongation of progress ion-free survival observed  with pha sed ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a 
randomized P hase 2 trial. (13)  Furthermore, there is significant synergy seen with combining 
anti-CTLA -4 antibodies with anti -PD-1 antibodies in melanoma, as the two immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_299572]. (14)  In EGFR -driven models of lung 
adenocarcinoma, PD -1 inhibition did not alter the numbers of Tregs expressing high levels of 
CTLA -4, and EGFR signaling itself results in increased Treg infiltration, which may provide  
synergistic  efficacy with anti- CTLA -4 in NSCLC as well. (15) 
1.2 Study Drugs  
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of a vaccine therapy ( BI 1361849, 
previously known as CV9202 ) to 1 or 2 checkpoint inhibitors (durvalumab  and tremelimumab)  
for NSCLC.  
1.2.1  Durvalumab  (MEDI4736 ) - PD-L1 Antibody  
Durvalumab is briefly described in th e section below  using excerpts that have been extracted 
from the  Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). Please refer to the current IB  for complete and current 
information . 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibits binding of PD -L1.  Durvalumab  is selective for recombinant PD -L1 and 
blocks the binding of recombinant PD -L1 to the PD -1 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 
receptors.   
As of the da ta cutoff dates in the IB (15Apr2015 to 18Sep2015), a total of 1,[ADDRESS_365397] 
been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab  clinical studies, including 20 sponsored and 
10 collaborative studies. Of the 1,910 subjects, 1,279 received durvalumab  monotherapy, 454 
received durvalumab  in combination with tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 14 
received other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 MEDI6383), and [ADDRESS_365398] been completed or terminated prematurely due to 
toxicity . 
The safety profile of durvalumab  as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents  
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor class. No tumor types appeared t o be associated with unique  adverse events ( AEs). 
Immune -related AEs (irAEs), which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors,  have 
been observed with durvalumab  and include colitis, pneumonitis,  hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, 
neuropathy  / neuromuscular toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and  nephritis. In addition, 
pancreatitis is an important potential risk particularly with durvalumab  and tremelimumab 
combination therapy. These events are manageabl e by  [CONTACT_213174]/established treatment 
guidelines as described in Section 8.3.  
Partial efficacy data are available for 2 monotherapy studies (CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1108 an d 
D4190C00007) and 2 combination therapy studies (CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1161 and  D4190C00006).

NSCLC as detailed below . 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108: Overall, 456 of 694 s ubjects treated with durvalumab  10 mg/kg 
Q2W were evaluable for response (defined as having ≥ 24 weeks follow- up, measurable disease 
at baseline, and ≥ 1 follow- up scan, or discontinued due to disease progression or death without 
any follow -up scan). In PD -L1 unselected subjects, the objective response rate ( ORR ), based on 
investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma (n = 23) to 20.0% 
in bladder cancer (n = 15), and disease control rate at 24 weeks  ranged from 4.2% in triple -
negative breast cancer (n = 24) to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 23). PD -L1 
status was known for [ADDRESS_365400] for bladder cancer, advanced cutaneous melanoma, hepatoc ellular 
carcinoma ( HCC) (n = 3 each, 33.3% each), NSCLC (n = 86; 26.7%), and squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  (SCCHN ) (n = 22; 18.2%). In 
the PD -L1 positive subset, disease control rate at [ADDRESS_365401] in advanced cutaneous 
melanoma (n = 3; 66.7%), NSCLC (n = 86; 36.0%), HCC and bladder cancer (n = 3 each; 33.3% each), and SCCHN (n = 22; 18.2%).  
Study D4190C00006: Of the [ADDRESS_365402] 16 weeks of follow -up were 
evaluable for response (defined as  measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 follow -up scan; 
this included  discontinuations due to disease progression or death without follow -up scan). Of 
the 63 evaluable subjects, 17 (27%) had a best overall response  of partial response (PR) , 14 
(22%) had stable disease ( SD), 22 (35%) had progressive disease ( PD), and 10 (16%) were not  
evaluable. The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response ( CR) or PR) was 27%  and 
the disease control rate ([ DCR], CR, PR, or SD ) was 49% as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1.  
Durvalumab , like other drugs in the anti PD -L1 class , has shown early evidence of activity against 
solid tumors as a  single agent and is currently being evaluated in combination with 
tremelimumab and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72894]. (16, 17) 
1.2.[ADDRESS_365403] been extracted 
from the  Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). Please refer to the current IB  for complete and current 
information . 
Tremelimumab  (formerly CP -675,206) is a human immunoglobulin G2 ( IgG2) mAb being 
investigated as a cancer immunotherapeutic agent.  Tremelimumab  is specific for human CTLA -
4, with no cross -reactivity  to related human proteins .   
As of the data cutoff dates (1 November 2015 for monotherapy studies and 15 April 2015 to 12  
July 2015 for combination therapy studies), [ADDRESS_365404] been treated in the ongoing blinded Phase 2b monothera py Study 
D4880C00003 [DETERMINE]). In the third
 ongoing monotherapy study (D4884C00001), no 
subject s have been treated as of the data cutoff. In addition, approximately [ADDRESS_365405]

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page [ADDRESS_365406] received tremelimumab in 
combination with other anticancer agents in these studi es. 
In clinical patients, tremelimumab exhibits linear (dose -proportional) PK following IV infusion. 
The estimate of clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and terminal- phase 
half- life is 0.132 mL/h/kg, 81.2 mL/kg and 22.1 days, resp ectively. These values are consistent 
with those of natural IgG2.  
Across the clinical development program for tremelimumab, a pattern of efficacy has emerged that is similar to that of the related anti- CTLA -4 antibody, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Response rates to anti-
CTLA -4 antibodies are generally low, approximately 10%. However, in patients who respond, the 
responses are generally durable, lasting several months even in patients with aggressive tumors 
such as refractory metastatic melanoma. Some patients may have what is perceived to be 
progression of their disease in advance of deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_299573] a tumor response. 
Overall, the impact on conventionally -defined progression -free survival (PFS) can be small; 
however, the durable response or stable disease seen in a proportion of patients can lead to 
significant prolongat ion of overall survival (OS). For example, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_299574] - and second -line treatment of patients with metastatic 
melanoma. The melanoma data with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62594] a small proportion of patients with an objective response and a small impact on PFS rates can lead to significant 
prolongation of OS. In a large, single -arm Phase II tremelimumab study (A3671008) in subject s 
with advanced refractory and/or relapsed melanoma, objective responses (primary endpoint) following tremelimumab 15 mg/kg administered once every 90 days (Q90D) were observed in 
7% of subject s. In each case, the response was durable (present at ≥6 months from enrolment). 
A Phase III, open -label, randomized study (A3671009) compa ring tremelimumab 15 mg/kg Q90D 
(Arm A) to either dacarbazine (DTIC) or temozolomide (Arm B) in subject s with advanced 
melanoma was terminated following a pre -specified interim futility analysis. Based on the final 
analysis, the median OS (primary endpoint ) was 12.6 months in Arm A and 10.7 months in Arm 
B.(18)  Although Phase II and Phase III studies (A3671002, A3671008, and A3671009) of 
tremelimumab in metastatic melanoma did not meet the primary endpoints  of response rate 
and O S, respectively, the data suggest activity of tremelimumab in melanoma. (18, 19)  
Preliminary acti vity of single -agent tremelimumab observed in studies of malignant 
mesothelioma (20, 21) provided a sound scientific rationale for further investigation of single -
agent tremelimumab in this patient pop ulation.  
Clinical studies of tremelimumab are ongoing in several solid tumor types, including malignant mesothelioma, and have been completed in solid tumor types including melanoma, adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , prostate cancer, 
breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and renal cell carcinoma.  In a Phase II maintenance study in 
NSCLC, PFS at 3 months was 22.7% in the tremelimumab arm compared with 11.9% in the best 
supportive care  arm (Study A3671015).  
The profile of adverse events (AEs) and the spectrum of event severity have remained stable 
across the tremelimumab clinical program and are consistent with the pharmacology of the target. To date, no tumor type or stage appears to be associated with unique AEs (except for vitiligo that appears to be confined to patients with melanoma).

LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page 11 of 113 1.2.3  BI 1361849 
BI 1361849  (previously known as CV9202 ) is briefly described in this section below  using 
excerpts that have been extracted from the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). Please refer to the 
current IB  for complete and current information . 
Vaccination with mRNA molecules represents a novel approach in cancer immunotherapy. 
RNActive® cancer vaccines are based on a proprietary technology platform (CureVac), aiming to enhance stability and efficiency of in vivo translation for RNA encoding for selected tumor-
associated antigens (TAA). BI 1361849  comprises 6 different mRNAs, encoding for the TAAs 
MUC1, survivin, NY -ESO-1, 5T4, MAGE -C2 and MAGE -C1. The vaccine is intended f or the 
treatment of patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC . 
RNActive® vaccines , and in particular the antigen components of BI [ADDRESS_365407] ive® vaccination 
occur via priming of immune effectors via dendritic cells that have locally  taken up the RNA -
based vaccine and present the encoded antigens to the immune  system in the lymph nodes 
draining the injection site, and via systemic recirculation  of these effectors  (immune cells, 
antibodies). Dendritic cell migration, increased activation of lymph  node  immune cells and 
increased proliferation of antigen -specific lymphocytes have been shown to  occur after 
RNActive® vaccination. RNActive® vaccinatio n induces a balanced systemic  antigen -specific 
immune response, comprising humoral and cellular responses, including multifunctional cytotoxic CD8+ T  lymphocytes.  
Anti-tumor efficacy has been shown in a syngeneic murine animal model, using tumor cells 
stab ly expressing the well accepted model antigen ovalbumin as a surrogate tumor- associated 
antigen. In this model, vaccination with ovalbumin -encoding RNActive® vaccine led to effective 
reduction of tumor growth, which was dependent to a large extent on the p resence of CD8+ 
T-cells. Intra- tumoral changes of gene expression reflecting increased cytotoxicity were 
demonstrated. Also, synergy between radiotherapy and the added vaccine could be shown, and 
similarly for checkpoint inhibition an d the added vaccine. P re-clinical studies were not 
suggestive of relevant toxicities  aside from commonly mild alterations at the site of injection. 
The RNActive® was degraded locally with an average half- life of 2 days. There was no detectable 
systemic exposure to the administered RNA. Systemic effects of the vaccine are based on the 
systemically recirculating immune effectors rather than systemic exposure to the RNA.  
For each of the individual RNActive® cancer vaccines, data from one trial are currently available. The trials fo r CV9201 ( Trial CV-9201- 003) and CV9103 ( Trial CV-9103 -001) have been co mpleted, 
the respective trials for BI 1361849 ( Trial CV-9202 -006) and CV9104 ( Trial CV-9104 -004) are 
currently ongoing.  
As of March 2017 , an estimated >[ADDRESS_365408] to date been exposed to four  RNActive® 
cancer vaccines . The majority of the subjects were enrolled in a placebo -controlled, double -
blind ongoing trial of the hexavalent p rostate cancer vaccine CV9104 . CV9104 shares one of its 
six constituents with BI 1361849 , namely the RNActive® vaccine encoding for MUC1 .  Forty -six 
subjects have been treated with vaccine CV9201 (comprising 5 of the six antigen constituents of BI 1361849 lacking the MUC1 constituent).  
Data from all RNActive® cancer vaccines are considered of interest for the development of BI 1361849, as many general aspects, in particular regarding feasibility and safety of multiple

pert inence of data especially from the development of the pentavalent vaccine CV9201 for 
BI 1361849, sharing five of the six antigen constituents comprised in BI 1361849, is ascertained 
by [CONTACT_299604] e two vaccines.  
To date, [ADDRESS_365409] been exposed to BI 1361849  (see details for Study CV -9202 -006 
below) . 
Based on the initial dose escalation trials and preliminary Phase 2 data, RNActive® vaccines appear well tolerated and safe, with all 4 clinical vaccines sharing a very similar safety profile.  
Adverse events frequently reported as vaccine related were very similar for all RNActive® cancer 
vaccines tested in clinical trials and consisted of mild injection site reactions as well as flu -like 
symptom s such as pyrexia and occasionally chills. Grade [ADDRESS_365410]  of 26 for BI 1361849 ; none was reported in trial CV9201 -003. No signs or symptoms 
of a clinically manifest autoimmune disorder were observed for any of the RN Active® cancer 
vaccines. Also, no anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccines have been reported, 
except for one AE of non -serious asthma that occurred in a subject  with known chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and was considered probabl y related to study treatment with 
CV9201 by [CONTACT_093]
. 
The recommended dose for each constituent of RNActive® vaccines, encoding for a specific 
tumor antigen, is identical across all RNActive® cancer vaccines. All individual antigen constituents  of a multivalent RNActive® cancer vaccine are to be administered individually and 
in duplicate, based on data showing enhanced efficiency of vaccination. The recommended dose 
per antigen constituent is 320 μg, split into two administrations of 160 μg each , and the two 
administrations are to occur in two different defined regions (upper arm, thigh) drained by 
[CONTACT_299605]. In particular, the recommended dose of BI 1361849, based on trial CV -
9201- 003 and trial CV -9202- 006, has been confirmed as 320 μ g/antigen component and 
administration time point, which is identical to the dose of the antigen components of the other RNActive® cancer vaccines.  
The BI 1361849 components may also be administered by a needle -free device, the PharmaJet  
Tropis®  device . Due to the fill volume of 100 μL, the device allows for administration of half the 
previously established doses . Instead of 320 μg per antigen , 160 μg per antigen is dosed  when 
using the same manner of administration of two inoculations per antigen and vacc ination time 
point. Preclinical data, demonstrating a more even intradermal distribution of the applied 
volume, increased protein production even at reduced doses (e.g. 25% of dose),  and clinical data 
(trial CV -9104 -007 of RNActive® vaccine CV9104), showin g at least similar immunogenicity, 
support the use of this device.  Device -related AEs were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to 
conventional needle administration.   
Summary for Trial  CV-9202- 006 (See IB for details)  
The Phase 1b trial with BI 1361849, CV -9202 -006, was an exploratory, open label study of 
BI 1361849 combined with local radiation as consolidation/maintenance treatment in subject s 
with stage IV NSCLC and a response or stable disease after standard first -line therapy . Radiation 
was to be started one week after the first vaccination. The population was stratified by 
[CONTACT_299606] (non -squamous cell carcinoma [non -EGFR mutated], squamous cell 
carcinoma, non -squamous carcinoma with activating EGFR mutations) and subject s were to

also 20 Gy of radiotherapy, fractionated in daily doses of 5 Gy over a course of 4 days, to be 
administered in week two of vaccin e treatment.   
The trial, which was closed  in July 2016, confirmed feasibility and tolerability of the 
recommended dosing (320 μg per antigen constituent and administration time point) and  for 
long- term therapy up to 806 days (>2 years). In total, about 225  vaccinations (on average ~8.[ADDRESS_365412] ) were administered.  Exploratory efficacy results showed a median PFS 
of about 2.[ADDRESS_365413]  in stratum 1,  who was treated with BI 1361849, 
pemetrexed and experimental low- dose radiotherapy, achieved a partial response; otherwise, 
best response was SD  or PD . Two subjects  in stratum 1 achieved long- term disease control (20 
months and 27 months, re spectively); one subject  in stratum 3, treated with BI 1361849 added 
to erlotinib therapy received vaccination therapy for >25 months despi[INVESTIGATOR_299575] a new pulmonary lesion after 14 months  (treatment beyond progression was allowed per protocol 
if clinical benefit was maintained) .   
Many of the subjects showed a pre -existing immune response to target antigens at baseline  
(baseline immune response to the respective TAA).   Overall, 21 (84%) of 25 evaluable subjects 
fulfilled the criteria for humoral and / or cellular immune responders. Ten (40%) subjects 
fulfilled criteria for cellular immune responders to any of the CV9202 encoded antigens at any 
post -baseline assessments based on either IFN -γ ELISpot or flow cytometry -based  intracellular 
cytokine s taining  (ICS). The frequency of CD4 (measured by [CONTACT_270052]) immune responders to any 
CV9202 encoded antigen was slightly higher compared to that of CD8 responders (measured by 
[CONTACT_270052]) at any post -baseline assessment time- point (28.0% / 7 subjects vs. 16.0% / 4 subj ects, 
respectively).  All [ADDRESS_365414] any of the CV9202 encoded antigens at baseline. Twenty (80%) subjects had a humoral immune response post -baseline (i.e. IgG or IgM against any of the CV [ADDRESS_365415] -
baseline time point) and were rated as humoral immune responder after applying responder 
criteria. The majority of subjects (19 [76.0%]) were responders for IgG at any post -baseline time 
point, whereas only few subjects (7  [28.0%]) were positive for IgM at post -baseline time points. 
A total of 13 (52%) subject s were multiple responders, i.e. [ADDRESS_365416] -baseline cellular 
immunomonitoring assays fulfilled “immune responder” criteria for the individual assay 
outcome, and among those, persistence over both post- baseline time points was not common.  
The tole rability profile of BI 1361849 appear ed very similar to that of other RNActive® vaccines . 
All subjects reported at least one AE and 25 (96.2% ) subjects reported BI  1361849  related AEs. 
Eleven  (42.3%) subjects reported serious adverse events (SAEs), none of  which were considered 
BI 1361849 related. Treatment- emergent AEs by [CONTACT_299607] 1  (4 
[15.4%] subjects),  Grade 2 (7 [26.8%] subjects), Grade 3  (13 [50.0% ] subjects ), and Grade 4 (2 
[7.7% ] subjects ). The two G rade 4 events, neutrophil count decrease d, were not considered 
related to BI 1361849.  With very few exceptions, BI 1361849 -related AEs were of Grade 1 and 
Grade 2.  Three  of the Grade 3 AEs  (one subject with pyrexia and  2 subjects with fatigue ) were 
considered related to  BI 1361849.   No drug- related SAE has been reported in the trial.  A low 
number of subjects experienced nausea/emesis considered related to BI 1361849 in the trial.

As described in Section 1.1 , checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD -1/PD -L1 antibodies, have been 
shown to be effective in the treatment of NSCLC.  Checkpoint inhibitors are also associated with 
minimal toxicities compared with chemotherapy or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_299577]. Therefore, the potential for effective and safe combination with 
existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_299578].  
Vaccine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_299579] (“active 
immunotherapy”) , as opposed to blocking immun e inhibition in the TME  by [CONTACT_299608]  (“passive immunotherapy”).   Randomized v accine studies  in NSCLC have shown 
benefit in some subgroups .  Tecemotide ( Stimuvax ®) demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit 
over  placebo in a subgroup of stage II I subjects who received concurrent chemotherapy and 
radiation prior to vaccine , and b elagenpumatucel -L (Lucanix ®) demonstrated OS benefit in 
squamous cell carcinoma subjects who were randomized within 12 weeks of completion of prior 
treatment and in those who had received prior radiation. (22, 23)  However, checkpoint 
mechanisms limit  the effectiveness of vaccines at the TME, which may explain why more global 
long- term benefit from vaccines h as not been realized.   Therefore, combining “passive 
immunotherapy” with “active immunotherapy” may overcome some of limitations of vaccine therap y alone.  In an animal model of RNActive ® vaccination using ovalbumin (OVA) as model 
cancer antigen stably transfected into E.G7 tumor cells, the combination of the vaccine and a PD-1 inhibitor was more effective than either medication alone. Similar results were also 
obtained for the combinatio n of the RNActive® vaccine and a CTLA -4 inhibitor.  Combination of 
the PD -1 inhibitor and OVA -RNActive® resulted in complete tumor responses in a part of the 
treated mice, who were also protected against subsequent rechallenge with the OVA -negative 
parent tumor cell line .(24) 
2.[ADDRESS_365418] components (F2408, 
F2409, F2410, F2624, F2625, and F2626), which are provided and administered separately.  The recommended dose per antigen constituent is 320 μg  (160 μg x 2) , for a total of 1920 μg  (320 μg 
x 6 constituents) . 
BI 1361849 may also be administered by a needle -free device, the PharmaJet  Tropis®  device . 
See Section  1.2.3 for additional details.  
Due to the filling volume of 100 μL, the device allows for administration of half the previously established doses, i.e., 160 μg instead of 320 μg per antigen when using th e same manner of 
administration of two inoculations per antigen and vaccination time point. Advantages include improved patient convenience, handling safety, ease, and reliability of intradermal administration. Preclinical data showed that using a needle -free device such as the PharmaJet 
Tropis® device, the efficiency of delivery increases and protein production is higher even at half 
or a quarter of the administered dose, hence  lower doses can be used. Clinical data from a 
Phase 2 trial, CV -9104- 007, suggests that administration of half the dose by [CONTACT_299609]® device results in at least similar immunogenicity compared to needle administration of 
the full dose.

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page 16 of 113 For this study, the Pharmajet Tropis® device will be used for the administration of the 
BI 1361849  components .  Allowing for a filling volume of 100 μL (80 μg) and 2 administration s 
per component, the recommended dose per each of the 6 antigen components will be 16 0 μg (2 
x 80 µg), for a total of 960 μg (12 administrations).  
2.2 Durvalumab and Tremelimumab Dose  
Currently, fixed dosing is recommended for durvalumab and tremelimumab with the dose and 
schedule of 1500 mg  durvalumab  Q4W and 75 mg  tremelimumab Q4W  for subjec ts > 30 kg.  
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from a Phase 1 
study ( Study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors ).(25)  
Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body weight -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 
mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_27643] 
(5th, median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body weight  of approximately 75 kg). A 
total of 1000 patients were simulated using body weight  distribution of 40 –[ADDRESS_365419] variability with fixe d 
dosing regimen.   
Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 
through Phase 3 ( N=654; doses= 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melanoma) .(26) 
Population PK model indicated minor impact of body weight  on PK of tremelimumab (coefficient 
of ≤ 0.5). The weight -based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 mg/kg Q4W; based on m edian 
body weight  of approximately 75 kg ) regimens were compared using predicted PK 
concentrations ( 5th, median and 95th percentiles ) using population PK model in a simulated 
population of [ADDRESS_365420] variability with fixed dosing regimen .  
Similar findings hav e been reported by [CONTACT_2312] .(27-30)  Wang and colleagues investigated [ADDRESS_365421] variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics 
parameters .(29)  
A fixed dosing approach is p referred by [CONTACT_27645]. Given expectation s of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, 
we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body weight  of 
75 kg,  a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) and a fixed dose 
of 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) are included in the current study.  
The 1500 mg Q4W dosing of durvalumab is recommended only for subjects with > 30kg body 
weight in order to limit  endotoxin exposure.  Subject s with a body weight ≤  30 kg are not eligible 
for enrollment in the current study .  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details regarding the dose

3.1 Study Design  
This is an open -label multicenter Phase 1/2 study to evaluate  the safety and preliminary efficacy 
of the addition of a vaccin e therapy to 1 or 2 checkpoint inhibitors  for NSCLC : 
• Arm  A: mRNA Vaccine [BI 1361849] + anti -PD-L1 [durvalumab ] 
• Arm  B: mRNA V accine [BI 1361849] + anti -PD- L1 [durvalumab ] + anti -CTLA -4 
[tremelimumab]  
For each arm of the study, there is a dose evaluation  phase  in which the Recommended 
Combination Dose (RCD) is determined according to a standard 3 + 3 design. The dose 
evaluation phase  is followed by [CONTACT_299610] , in which the cohort at the RCD for each 
arm is expanded to 20 subjects (inclusive of the subjects from the dose evaluation cohort).

Enrollment will start in the Arm A dose evaluation  cohorts in a sequential fashion.   After the RCD 
is determined for Arm A , enrollment will start for the dose evaluation of Arm B (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) and for the Arm A Expansion Cohort  (see Figure 1), whereby [CONTACT_299611].  Any new subject will be assigned to the Arm  B dose evaluation  cohort, unless no 
slot is available, in which case the subject will be assigned to the Arm A Expansion C ohort.  After 
the dose evaluation  and safety review  for Arm B is complete , enrollment into the Arm B 
Expansion C ohort  will be prioritized  over Arm A  (see Figure 1).

 Dose Evaluation  Phase  
Each subject enrolled in the dose  evaluation  cohorts  of the study w ill be evaluated for dose -
limiting toxicities ( DLTs ), as defined in Section 3.1.9.  Dose de -escalation  and evaluation of RCD 
will be performed based on the available dose levels (see table below) and the respective  rules  
for a standard 3 +  3 study de sign (see Schema below) . 
For Arm A, the RCD of BI 1361849 + durvalumab is determined. The starting dose of durvalumab 
is 1500 mg with possible de -escalation to 750 mg; the dose for BI 1361849 remains constant. For 
Arm B, the RCD of BI 1361849 +  durvalumab  from Arm A  with the addit ion of tremelimumab 75 
mg is evaluated. There is no dose escalation/de-escalation for Arm B; if there is unacceptable 
toxicity in Arm B, the arm will be discontinued .

Per Figure 2, the RCD for Arm A  and Arm B  is defined as the highest dose level at which no more 
than 1 of 6 subjects (i.e., < 33%)  experience DLTs.   The RCD cannot be determined if non e of the 
predefined dos e level cohorts fulfill that criterion .  In such case, the arm will be discontinued  
without an expansion phase .   
 Dose Expansion Phase  
In each arm for which an R CD is declared in the dose evaluation  phase, the R CD dose level 
cohort will be expanded to 20 subjects  (i.e., 14 subjects will be added to the 6 treated at the 
RCD  in the dose evaluation phase  for each arm ( A and B).

accordan ce with the “ Dose  Adjustment and Management Guidelines ” for toxicity related to 
durvalumab / tremelimumab and BI 1361849 , outlined in Section  8.3 and Section  8.4, 
respectively .   
If a toxicity occurs that requires toxicity management in accordance with Sections 8.3  or 8.4, and 
the toxicity causing drug can be clearly identified, then the respective guideline should be 
follo wed. If the toxicity causing drug cannot be identified, then the more conservative guide line 
should be followed.  
3.1.9  DLT and  MTD/RCD  for the Combination Therapy  
MTDs will not be determined  in this study .  Instead, RCDs will be determined in the context of 
the predefined dose levels used during the dose evaluation phase as per Section [IP_ADDRESS].

In the dose evaluation phase,  for the primary endpoint of determining DLTs and the RCD, the 
analysis of safety and tolerability will be based on the PP Population for DLT Assessment . 
In both phases ( evaluation and expansion), the overall analysis of safety and tolerability will be 
based on the Safety Population. 
Appropriate summaries of AEs,  SAEs,  laboratory data and vital sign s data will be presented  for 
the Safety Population overall and by [CONTACT_9084] .  Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary.  Incidences of treatment -eme rgent adverse events (TEAE, those events that started 
after dosing or worsened in severity after dosing) will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_299617] . 
For each continuous laboratory parameter, results will be categorized as low, normal, or high based on the laboratory normal ranges. Frequencies and percentages will be presented for the shifts in these categories (i.e., low to normal, low to high, high to low, etc.) from baseline to each post -treatment assessment time poi nt. Additionally, for each continuous hematology and

• Immune markers of response and resistance . 
Remaining core biopsies will be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded as per institutional 
standards for further evaluation with immunohistochemistry ( IHC) or tumor DNA/RNA 
extraction for microarrays sequencing or nanostring.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Immunohistochemistry  
Quant itative immunofluorescence will be used to evaluate multiple immune biomarkers 
simultaneously in FFPE archival tissue or  in biopsy sam ples, as available . 
PD-L1 has been examined in studies of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors with mixed results in terms of 
prevalence and impact on clinical benefit from anti- PD-1/PD -L1 therapy, although this has been 
attributed to variability in different assays and in different definitions of positivity.  It is unknown 
how the introduction of the vaccine may alter PD -L1 expr ession and the immune 
microenvironment and whether that may influence outcomes to combination therapy.    
In this study, a pre -treatment biopsy will allow the evaluat ion of PD-L1 and other immune 
biomarkers to determine correlation with response to combination therapy.  In addition to PD -
L1 immunohistochemistry, CD3 , CD4 and CD8  immunostaining will be performed to evaluate the 
degree of immun e infiltrate in tumor specimens , as available .  Finally, other markers of immune 
suppression (FoxP3 to stain T  regulatory cells, TIM -3, Lag -3 and others) will be evaluated , as 
feasible . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  DNA sequencing  
Whole -exome sequencing (WES) targeted next- gen sequencing will be performed, as feasible .

NOTE: Per Amendment [ADDRESS_365481] ion 
[IP_ADDRESS] regarding discontinuation of blood sample collection for immune monitoring.  
There is a great potential for mutual benefits by [CONTACT_299618].   
Assays for antigen -specific immune responses  encompass , for example,  intracellular cytokine 
staining (ICS)  and ELISpot for detection of antigen -specific T -cells by [CONTACT_299619] (NY -ESO-1, MageC1, MageC2, 5T4, 
Survivin, Muc -1) and/or non -vaccine tumor antigens (e.g. MAGE -A3).  Humoral responses 
against vaccine antigens are routinely analyzed by [CONTACT_299620] -vaccine antigens (antigen arrays ).  If possible, t he immune 
analyses will also include a detailed phenotypic characterization  of, e.g., circulating T -cell 
subsets , activation and differentiation states of immune cells, and checkpoint marker 
expression.   Furthermore, B cells, NK cells, DCs, monocytes and the peripheral immune -
suppressive environment med iated by  [CONTACT_260783]  (MDSCs ) and regulatory 
T-cells are evaluated.   Measurements of systemic lymphoid repertoire, e.g., T -cell receptor 
sequencing and immune -related transcriptional changes , cytokine and chemokine profiling are 
additional approaches  of interest  suitable to identify potential blood- derived biomarkers.   
Blood samples will be collected  according to Section 3.2  for the assessment of humoral and 
cellular immune responses and additional biomarker screenings.  A sample for white blood cell 
(WBC) count must also be available for the day of the blood sam ples for immuno monitoring.  
Immunomonitoring blood s ampling is scheduled at 7  ± 2 days after preceding vaccine 
administration.  In the event that, prior to a planned blood sampling time point , the immediately 
preceding vaccination has to be delayed or omitted, the blood sampling has to be delayed in the same fashion to ensure  that the blood sample has been obtained within 7 ± 2 days (5 -9 day time 
frame) after the immediately preceding vaccination .  In the event that  the vaccination had to be 
omitted, blood sampling should occur after the next subsequent vaccine administration.   
See Section 8.4 for maximum allowable delays  for vaccine administrations.

Specifically, the aims are :  
• to compare vaccine -induced antigen -specific responses , under conditions of simultaneous 
checkpoint inhibition , with  immun e-reactivity under checkpoint -blockade alone (cellular 
and humoral immune responses  against vaccine encoded antigens may increase to some 
extent in context of a general, non -specific immune activation by [CONTACT_299621]).

NOTE: Per Amend ment 10.0, all correlative testing will be discontinued, with the possible 
exception of PD -L1 expression and whole exome sequencing.  
For each arm of the study, o nly subject s who receive at least [ADDRESS_365484] 1  on-treatment sample (if applicable) will be evaluated .  
As these analyses represent exploratory evaluations of potential biomarkers of response or 
resistance to therapy, descriptive statistics will be used to describe findings and potential 
relationships to outcomes to therapy.   Criteria for assay positivity (changes compared to 
baseline) of individual assays will be describ ed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
The exploratory pharmacodynamic assessment of the immunologic changes in the tumor 
microenvironment will include the correlation between clinical activity and the expression level 
of PD -L1 and tumor -infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs)  changes in  biopsy samples , as available . The 
association between response and PD -L1 expression within each arm will be assessed 
descriptively. Confidence intervals for the overall odds ratio and the  odds ratio within each arm  
will be prese nted. The association between response and TILs changes (increase, decrease, or 
no change) will be evaluated similarly.  
Subjects are considered  fully  evaluable for immune response if the following criteria are met:  
• Subjects  have received at least 4 treatm ents with BI 1361849  including all vaccine antigens 
according to protocol  
• Samples from baseline and both post -baseline sample 7 days (±2 days) after treatment are 
available  
• Subjects  have not received any prohibited concomitant treatments  (see Section  5.3.1 ) 
within 21 days before on-treatment blood sampling.  Immunosuppressive medication that 
has been taken by [CONTACT_1766] 2 to 3 weeks prior to randomization will be documented so 
that any potential influence on baseline values may be evaluated.  
• Sufficient amount and quality of blood sample and isolated PBMCs is available to fully perform  and analyze, in accordance with respective assay SOPs, at least the ICS assay, as  a 
measure for antigen -specific cellular immune response

7.1 Documentation  and Reporting of Adverse Events  
7.1.1  Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
N.B.:  The definition above, provided for in the GCP -ICH Guideline E6, is being extended for the 
purpose of LICR studies to include any events, intercurrent diseases and accidents observed while the patient /subject  is on study, i.e., during the actual treatment period, as well as during 
drug- free, pre - and post -treatment periods, under placebo or in a reference group receiving 
drug or non -drug therapy or no treatment.  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
1. Results in death,  
2. Is life -threateningA, 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
5. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or  
6. Is another medically important conditionB. 
A The term “ life-threatening”  in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
patient /subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
B Medically im portant conditions that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218402], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient /subject  or may require intervention to 
preve nt one of the outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug  
dependency or drug abuse.  
N.B.:  The term “ severe ” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event (such as: 
mild, moderate, or severe, e.g., pain).  The event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).   This is not the same as “serious ”, which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory re porting obligations.

whichever is longer  (see Section 5.2, #8).  
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study drugs  should be 
discontinued immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_218403] a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be repo rted and handled as 
SAEs  (see S ection 7.1.6) .  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the subject  was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the Sponsor  within 1 day, i .e., immediately, but no later than 24 hours  of when 
he or she becomes aware of it.   
The Sponsor will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided within 1 to 5 calendar days for SAEs and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.    
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_365544] dose of tremelimumab,

pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose  until [ADDRESS_365545] dose 
should, if possible, be followed up and documented.

team should adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use .  
 Overdose  
Any overdose (as defined in Section 6.6 ) of a study subject , with or without associated AEs/SAEs, 
is required to be reported within [ADDRESS_365547] be recorded and reported as an SAE according to Section 7.1.6. There is currently no specific treatment in the 
event of an overdose of the study drugs. The  Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any 
overdose. See Section 6.6 for additiona l details.  
 Hepatic Function Abnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_365548], with or without 
associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of the event  to the Sponsor , unless a definitive underlying 
diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has been confirmed.  
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.  
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the 
study subje ct must be interrupted immediately. Follow- up investigations and inquiries 
must be initiated by [CONTACT_38238] . 
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_299627] d MedImmune /[COMPANY_008].  
 New Cancers  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the IP and have been identified after the subject’s inclusion in this  study.  
 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study treatment period, or within the protocol -defined 
follow -up period (On Study Follow -up) after the administration of the last dose of study 
drug, must be reported as follows:  
• Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be reported to the Study 
Monitor/Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the 
eCRF. It should be reported as an SAE  if it meets SAE reporting criteria per 
Section 7.1.6 .

study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study Monitor/Physician as an SAE within 24 hours. It should also be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• The report should contain a comment regarding the co involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. It should also be documented in the eCRF.  
• A post  mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if 
performed, a copy of the post -mortem results should be forwarded to LICR 
within the usual timeframes.  
Deaths occurring after the protocol -defined safety follow- up period after the 
administration of the last dose of study drug should be documented  only  in the Post 
Study Follow -up eCRF form. If the death occurred as a result of an event that started 
after the defined safety follow -up period and the event is considered to be due to a late 
onset toxicity to study drug, then it should also be reported as an SAE.  
LICR and [COMPANY_008] retain the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
 
7.1.3  Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of all serious and non -serious  adverse events should be assessed according to the 
National Cancer Institute CTCAE Scale (Version 4.03). 
7.1.4  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The r elationship of all serious and non -serious  adverse events to the investigational agent(s) will 
be determined by [CONTACT_218450], using one of the 
following terms (in accordance with NCI Guideline “Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements for NCI Investigational Agents”, NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, January 
2001):  
Definitely related  (The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent)  
Probably related  (The AE is likely related  to the investigationa l agent)  
Possibly related  (The AE may be related to the investigational agent)  
Unlikely related  (The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent)  
Unrelated  (The AE is clearly not related  to the investigational agent)  
N.B.:  When making the assessm ent on causality, it should be taken into consideration that 
immune -therapeutic agents have the potential to cause very late and/or permanent effects on 
the immune system, i.e., a causal relationship could exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of apparent temporal 
relation ship.  Information provided in the IB and/or in “ Background ” of this protocol may 
support these evaluations.

the respective section of the CRF, regardless of severity or the assum ption of a causal 
relationship.  The documentation includes: dates of onset and resolution, severit y, seriousness, 
study drug intervention, treatment and outcome, as well as, the causal relationship between the 
event and the study drug in accordance with Section  7.1.4 .  This documentation is required for 
all AEs that occur:  
a. from the date of signing the informed consent, and  
b. until the off -study date or [ADDRESS_365550] administration of study drug, whichever 
is longer, or until a new treatment is initiated ( see Section 3.1.10  for subjects who begin 
other anti -cancer treatment).  
Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs) will be collected from the time of informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_365551] study treatment (regardless of initiation of 
another therapy).  
7.1.6  Expedited Serious Adverse  Event (SAE) Reporting Requirements  
In addition to the General Reporting Requirements specified in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_365552] be 
reported by [CONTACT_67852]’s Drug Safety Contact (primarily) or, alternatively, 
to the Primary Sponsor Contact, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  (see contact 
[CONTACT_31307]) . SAEs should be reported via the Medidata RAVE data capture  system 
(which utilizes “Safety Gateway”) , using the respective Adverse Event and Safety Case 
Summary eCRFs.  This includes any deaths that occur after the off -study date, but within [ADDRESS_365553], the SAE should be reported using the “Initial Serious Adverse Event Report Form ,” provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
Note: If an SAE cannot be reported via Medidata RAVE or t he “Initial Serious  Adverse Event 
Report Form” within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, the Sponsor’s Drug Safety

be reported expeditiously, as well as , the time frames for such reporting.  
SAE Reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor.  Regulatory authorities and 
other investigators, as well as institutional and corporate partners, will be informed by [CONTACT_299630] , laws and regulations in the cou ntries where the 
investigation al agent is being administered.  In particular, SAEs that are  unexpected and for 
which a causal relationship with the study drug cannot be ruled out, will be reported by [CONTACT_299631] 15 calendar days; if they are life -threatening or fatal, they will be reported within 
7 calendar days.  
Serious adverse event reporting to [COMPANY_008]/Medimmune and to Boehringer Ingelheim  is 
described in separate respective agreement s. 
7.1.7  Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) Follow -up Requirements  
Subjec ts experiencing SAEs  should be followed c losely  until the condition resolves or stabilizes, 
and every effort should be made to clarify the underlying cause.  Follow -up information related 
to SAEs  must be submitted to the Sponsor  as soon as relevant data ar e available . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_365558] (AESIs)  
An adverse event of special interest ( AESI ) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the 
understanding of the investigational products and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to the S ponsor. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The 
rapid re cord ing of  all AEs, including  AESIs , allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order 
to characterize and understand them in association with the use of th e investigational products.    
AESIs for durvalumab  and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammato ry or immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent 
monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with 
durvalumab monothe rapy and combination therapy. An immune -related adverse event (irAE) is 
defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune -mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate aetiology.

an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_1689].  
If an AESI also meets SAE criteria, the event will be reported as an SAE per Section 7.1.6 . 
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab and those considered AESIs for the purpose of this study are listed below.  Further information on these AESIs  (e.g. presenting 
symptoms) can be foun d in the current version s of the durvalumab (MEDI4736)  and 
tremelimumab Investigator ’s Brochure s. Guidelines for the management of subjects 
experiencing toxicities  for durvalumab and tremelimumab  can be found in Section  8.3 and in the 
following Medimmune guideline: “Medimmune’s Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune - mediated, Infusion Re lated, and Non Immune -mediated 
Reactions (MEDI4736 (durvalumab) Monotherapy or Combination therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab monotherapy).”  
• Diarrhea/ Colitis  and intestinal perforation  
Diarrhea and colitis are the most commonly observed treatment -emergent AEs 
following dosing with study medications.  In rare cases , colon perforation may occur 
that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome, if not properly managed.  
• Pneumonitis /Interstitial lung disease (ILD)   
Adverse events of pneumonitis have been observed with anti -PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 
antibodies  (see IB) . Initial work -up should include high -resolution CT scan, ruling out 
infection, and pulse oximetry.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], p ulmonary consultation is required.  
• Hepatic F unction Abnormality ( Hepatitis  / transaminase increases  
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti- PD-L1/anti -PD-
1 antibodies  (see IB) .  Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% of subjects 
treated with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The clinical 
manifestations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated subjects included general weakness, fatigue, 
nausea and/or mild fever and increased liver function tests such as AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, and/or tota l bilirubin. Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any 
increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin 
to be greater than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from se parate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other.  Follow -up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_120066]/or whether there is objective 
evidence that clearly supports causation by a concurrent or pre -existing disease (e.g., 
cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other 
than the investigational product. Cases where a subject shows an AST or  ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_365559] 
or total bilirubin ≥  [ADDRESS_365560] may need to be reported as SAEs. These cases should be 
reported as SAEs if, after evaluation they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any of the individual liver test parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.

Immune -mediated nervous system events include encephalitis, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis . 
• Endocrine Disorders  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathies include hypo - and hyper -thyroidis m, adrenal 
insufficiency, hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] , and Type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
Type 1 diabetes mellitus: For subjects with suspected diabetes mellitus, Investigators 
should obtain an endocrinology consult and institute appropriate management which 
may include the administration of insulin.   
• Dermatitis /Rash  
Prompt treatment with steroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_299587]) is important as per current established toxicity management guidelines.  
• Nephritis  and increases in serum creatinine  
A consult with a Nephrologist should be done as well as monitoring for signs and 
symptoms that may be related to changes in renal function (e.g., routine urinalysis, elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, electrolyte imbalance, de crease in urine output, proteinuria, etc.). Subjects should be thoroughly 
evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, etc.). Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology even for low 
grade events (Grade 2), in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event.  
• Pancreatic Disorders  
Immune -mediated pancreatitis includes autoimmune p ancreatitis or labs suggestive of 
pancre atitis  (increased serum lipase , increased serum amylase) . 
• Myocarditis  
Myocarditis, a rare, but severe immune -mediated adverse event, presents with 
signs/symptoms such as decreased ejection fraction, arrhythmias, in particular 
occurrences of atrioventricular block. For patients with suspected myocarditis, 
investigators should obtain a cardiology consult and institute full diagnostic work -up 
(that includes exclusion of other alternate causes such as infection) . 
• Myositis /Polymyositis  
Myositis or polymyositis should be suspected in patients who p resent with proximal 
muscle weakness and the evaluation should include an examination of the skin, muscle enzyme measurement, antibody testing, any systemic disease manifestations and exclusion of other diseases including drug- induced myopathy. Cases of my ositis have 
been reported with myocarditis in which immune infiltration has been described in skeletal and cardiac muscle (see IB).  
• Other inflammatory responses  that are rare / less frequent with a potential immune -
mediated aetiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis, and 
other events involving the eye, skin, haematological and rheumatological events .

Issue date: 12 -APR-2017 
Summary of Changes:  
 
1. Synopsis: Control Group B was added , Control Group A was modified,  and total dose for BI 
1361849 was changed  from 1920 µg to 12 x 80 µg  due to introduction of needle -free device.  
These change were made throughout based on updated information from Boehringer 
Ingelheim.    
a. Paragraph 3 was updated as follows (changes in bold): “ For each arm of the study, there 
is a dose escalation phase  in wh ich the Recommended Combination Dose (RCD) is 
determined according to a standard 3 + 3 design . The dose escalation phase  is followed 
by [CONTACT_299610] , in which the cohort at the RCD is expanded to 20 subjects 
(inclusive of the subjects from the dose escalation cohort).  For Arm A, there will be an 
additional Control group (n = 10) added to the expansion phase in which the subjects 
will receive only durva lumab every 4 weeks .  During expansion,  there will be an 
additional Control Group  (n = 10) added to expansion for Arm B, where the subjects in 
the Control Group  will receive only durvalumab + tremelimumab. If Arm B is not 
expanded, the Control Group  will b e added to the expansion for Arm A, where the 
subjects in the Control Group  will receive only durvalumab. ”

thus there are 12 administrations  of 100 µL  (80 µg) each . 
2. Section 1.2.3  (BI 1361849): section was updated according to data available as  of March 2017  
from Boehringer Ingelheim : 
a. Data supporting a needle -free device, the PharmaJet Tropis® , were provided  
b. Summary for  Trial CV -9202- 006 was updated  
3. Section 2.1 (BI  1361849 dose), the following paragraphs  were added for the needle- free 
device and dosing: “ BI 1361849 may also be administered by a needle -free device, the 
PharmaJet Tropis® device. See Section 1.2.3 for additional details.  Due to the filling volume 
of 100 μL, the device allows for administration of half the previously established doses, i.e., 
160 μg instead of 320 μg per antigen when using the same manner of admin istration of two 
inoculations per antigen and vaccination time point. Advantages include improved patient 
convenience, handling safety, ease, and reliability of intradermal administration. Preclinical 
data showed that using a needle -free device such as the  PharmaJet Tropis® device, the 
efficiency of delivery increases and protein production is higher even at half or a quarter of the administered dose, hence lower doses can be used. Clinical data from a Phase 2 trial, CV -
9104- 007, suggests that administratio n of half the dose by [CONTACT_299636]® device 
results in at least similar immunogenicity compared to needle administration of the full dose. For this study, the Pharmajet Tropis® device will be used for the administration of the 
BI 1361849 components.  Allowing for a filling volume of 100 μL (80 μg) and 2 administrations  
per component, the recommended dose per each of the 6 antigen components will be 160  μg 
(2 x 80 µg), for a total of 960 μg (12 administrations).”  
4. Section 2.2 (Durvalumab and tremelimumab dose): The last paragraph was changed because 
weight based dosing was added for subjects whose weight drops to ≤ 30 kg during the study. The paragraph was changed FROM:  This dosing of durvalumab and tremelimumab is 
recommended only for subjects with > 30 kg body weight due to endotoxin exposure.  
Subjects with a body weight ≤ [ADDRESS_365573]’s body weight drops to ≤ [ADDRESS_365574] will be dosed at 600 
mg Q4W for durvalumab and  30 mg Q4W for tremelimumab as long as the body weight 
remains ≤ 30 kg .  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details regarding the dose de -escalation 
cohort for durv alumab.  TO: “This  dosing of durvalumab and tremelimumab is recommended 
only for subjects with > 30kg body weight due to endotoxin exposure.  Subjects with a body weight ≤ 30 kg are not eligible for enrollment in the current study.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
additional details regarding the dose de -escalation cohort for durvalumab and for dose 
requirements for instances when a subject’s body weight drops to  ≤ 30 kg while on the study . 
5. Section 3.1 (Study Design), Control Group B was added  and Control Group A was modified .  
The language was changed FROM:  
“For Arm A , there will be an additional Control Group  (n = 10) added to the expansion phase 
in which the su bjects will receive only durvalumab  every 4 weeks:  
• Arm A1 (Expansion group):  BI 1361849  + durvalumab (n=20)  
• Arm A2 (Control Group) : durvalumab (n=10) ”

6. Section 3.1.2 (Enrollment/Randomization) : Control Group B was added  and Control Group A 
was modified .   
a. The language was changed FROM:  “Enrollment will start in the Arm A dose escalation 
cohorts in a sequential fashion.   After the RCD is determined for Arm A, enrollment will 
start for the dose evaluation of Arm B (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and for the Arm A expansion 
phase (Arm A1 Expansion + Arm A2 Control; see Figure 1), whereby [CONTACT_299637].  Any new subject will be assigne d to the Arm  B dose evaluation 
cohort, unless no slot is available, in which case the subject will be assigned to the Arm A 
expansion cohort.  After the dose evaluation in Arm B is complete and enrollment is completed in the Arm A (A1 and A2) expansion coh orts, enrollment will begin in the Arm 
B expansion cohort.”  TO: “Enrollment will start in the Arm A dose escalation cohorts in a 
sequential fashion.   After the RCD is determined for Arm A, enrollment will start for the 
dose evaluation of Arm B (see Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS]) and for the Arm A Expansion Cohort (see 
Figure 1), whereby [CONTACT_299638].  Any new subject will be 
assigned to the Arm  B dose evaluation cohort, unless no slot is available, in which case 
the subject will be assigned to the Arm A Expansion Cohort.  After the dose evaluation in Arm B i s complete and enrollment is complete in Arm A Expansion Cohort, enrollment 
will begin in the Arm B Expansion Cohort and Arm B Control G roup in an alternating 
fashion (see Figure 1 and description below).  If Arm B is not expanded due to toxicities, 
the Control G roup will be added to the expansion for Arm A. The Arm A Control G roup, 
will then start enrolling after the completion of Arm A Expansion Cohort , in a non -
alternating fashion. ” 
b. Figure 1 was updated to add Control G roup B  and modify Control Group A .  The following 
footnote was added: ”*If Arm B Expansion Cohort and Arm B Control Group are not initiated due to toxicities, an Arm A Control Group  (n=10 subjects; dur valumab only) will 
be added, which will start enrollment (in a non -alternating fashion) after Arm A 
Expansion Cohort has completed.”  
c. Language in the last paragraph was changed FROM:  
“For the expansion phase for Arm A , subjects will be enrolled in an altern ating fashion  so 
that there are a total of 20  subjects  (inclusive of the subjects from the dose escalation 
cohort that is being expanded)  for the expansion cohort (Arm A1)  and 10 subjects for  the 
Control Group  (Arm A2).  In order to have only [ADDRESS_365575] of the Arm A dose escalation cohort.  Thus, 3

7. Section 3.1.6 (Sample Size Considerations). Paragraph [ADDRESS_365577] the changes in the control groups (changes in bold): “In the expansion phase , 20 subjects  per arm are 
thought to provide sufficient data to adequately identify essential  safety and preliminary  
efficacy signals.   Therefore, up to 14 additional subjects  will be added to the 6 subjects 
treated at the RCD in each arm (A and B). For Arm A, an additional 10 subjects will be added 
to expansion phase for Arm A2 ( Control Group ).  The cont rol group is added primarily for 
the analysis of the immune response in this group (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). For Arm B, an 
additional 10 subjects will be added to expansion phase for the Control Group .  The control 
group is added primarily for the analysis of the immune response in this group (see Section

handling safety, ease, and reliability of intradermal administration. Preclinical data 
showed that using a needle -free device such as the PharmaJet Tropis® device, the 
efficiency of delivery increases and protein production is higher even at half or a quarter of the administered dose, hence  lower doses can be used. Clinical data from a Phase 2 
trial, CV -9104 -007, suggests that administration of half the dose by [CONTACT_299609]® device results in at least similar immunogenicity compared to needle administration of the full dose.”  
b. Section 2.1 (BI 1361849): Last paragraph was changed FROM  “For this study, t he 
Pharmajet Tropis® device will be used for the administration of the BI  1361849

of these evaluations with clinical response as  well as changes in profiling associated with 
resistance.  Analyses may include the following:  
• Mutational burden, gene expression profiling, and immune profiling from before therapy  
• Immune markers of response and resista nce.

Amendment 8  
Issue date: 24-JUL-2019 
Summary of Changes : 
1. Section 5.1 Inclusion criteria 5. The following change was made (changes in bold):  
Lymphocyte count  >800  ≥ 400 cells/µL. (See Section 3.3 for 
instructions for blood draws for PBMC collection.)  
2. Section 3.2 (Study Flowchart). Footnote L was added.  
3. Section 3.3 (Additional Instructions for Blood Draws for PBMC Collection) was added.  
 
Rationale for the changes:  
The original lymphocyte requireme nt of 800 cells/µ L was intended to allow for enough PBMCs to be 
collected for correlative analyses. However, the requirement was not allowing otherwise qualified subjects 
to enroll in the study. As the restriction was intended only to optimize the PBMC col lection, it was decided 
to lower the lymphocyte requirement to 400 cells/ µL with adjustment to blood volume collection for 
PBMCs when appropriate for the particular subject (See Laboratory Manual for additional details on blood 
volume and weight restrictio n). 
 
Amendment 8.1 
Issue date: 17-SEP- 2019  
 
Rationale for the changes:  
The decision was made not to enroll any subjects into the Control Group for Arms A and B . As the 
protocol was previously amended to allow subjects pretreated with PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, 
baseline correlative sample testing can serve the purposes of the Control Group . In addition, 
reported results of the P hase III MYSTIC, ARCTIC and NEPTUNE studies of durvalumab plus 
tremelimum ab in NSCLC did not find the combination to be superior to standard of care 
chemotherapy making it inappropriate to recruit subjects to th e control treatment arm with 
tremelimumab and/or durvalumab without vaccine.  
 Summary of Changes : 
All references to the Control Group for Arms A and B were removed. The following sections were 
affected:

If a toxicity occurs that requires toxicity management in accordance with Sections  8.3 or 8.4, and 
the toxicity causing drug can be clearly identified, then the respective guideline sho uld be 
followed. If the toxicity causing drug cannot be identified, then the more conservative guideline 
should be followed.  
8.3.1  Durvalumab  and Tremelimumab Dose Modification Due to Toxicity  
Durvalumab  (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab administration  may  be modified  or discontinued as 
a result of toxicities  as described in  the table below.   
Additional information and guidance  regarding dose modification due to toxicity are provided 
from Medimmune in the following guidelines:  
“Medimmune’s Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -
mediated, Infusion Related, and Non Immune -mediated Reactions (MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 
Monotherapy or Combination therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab monotherapy) .” 
Dose modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to durvalumab  or 
tremelimumab (such as an accident)  or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be 
clinically significant . 
MEDI4736 (M) and Tremelimumab (T) Dose Modification Due to Toxicity  
Note:  If M and T dosing is held temporarily until resolution of the event as per instructions below, treatment should resume at the next scheduled treatment date.  
Immune -related Adverse Events (irAEs)  
Immune -related adverse events are defined as AEs of im mune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in 
the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  Maximum supportive care, including 
immunosuppressive medications, such as high dose steroids, is allowed to induce resolution of the event .  However, infliximab should not be  used for management of immune -related 
hepatitis.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of M and T depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393],  
permanently discontinue M  and T also for:  
• Any Grade rash with bullous skin formations.  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_365626] dose of study drug/regimen.  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE following 
resumption of dosing.  
• Any Grade biopsy -proven immune -mediated myocarditis . 
Grade 1  
• In general, no dose modification required.  
• For pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease and myocarditis , consider holding M and T dosing as 
clinically appropriate and during diagnostic work -up for other etiologies.

If a toxicity occurs that requires toxicity management in accordance with Sections  8.3 or 8.4, and 
the toxicity causing drug can be clearly identified, then the respective guideline should be

LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page [ADDRESS_365632] Guidelines   
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines were  revised in [ADDRESS_365633] 1.1. (31) These guidelines have been the widely accepted criteria to assess response and 
progression in solid tumors ; however, limitations have been noted in the use of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_365634] shown that complete 
response, partial response, or stable disease status can still be achieved after an initial increase 
in overall tumor burden, and regression of initial lesions may occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_299596].  The Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) were developed to address the need for 
response criteria in an immunotherapy setting. (32)  The main difference wit h irRC was that it 
considered the subject's total tumor burden  at each subsequent assessment and required 
confirmation of suspected disease progression with subsequent imaging, approximately four weeks later.  In addition, a greater number of lesions (10 vs. 5) were measured in a 
bidimensional manner instead of unidimensionally  as in RECIST 1.1 .  In 2013, Nishino et al. 
demonstrated that immune -related response criteria using unidimensional measurements were 
highly concordant with the bidimensional results of irRC, but with less measurement 
variability. (33)  Based on these findings and in order to utilize both the established criteria of 
irRC and RECIST 1.1, the two systems have been adapted, modified, and combined into the 
Immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) .(34)  The adapted 
irRECIST criteria are modifications to the irRC, incorporating the findings of Nishino et al. and the advantages of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_365635] 1.1 guidelines as published  (31) and as summarized by 
[CONTACT_299649] -involved clinical trials .   
I. Disease Parameters for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_365636] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_365637] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > [ADDRESS_365638] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_365639] scan, or >[ADDRESS_365640] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions tha t are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  If the  investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
NOTE for irRECIST: During target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on 
the anatomical  sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation,  RF-ablation, TACE, 
surgery, etc.). Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions 
unless there has been a demonstration of progress in the lesion.

recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be me asured and followed.  
Non -measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, lepto meningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radi ographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.   ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable le sions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection 
as target lesions.  
NOTE for irRECIST:  
Lesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The longest 
diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of all 
target lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a non- liquid/non- necrotic component are 
present, those should be preferred.  
Brain lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non- target lesions 
depending on the protocol definition.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition sh ould be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reprodu cibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only t he short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non -target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) inclu ding any non -measureable as well 
as measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified a s non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not 
required, but the presence, absence, or in  rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.

LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page 101 of 113 II. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported les ion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_90657] y, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x- ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_365643] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice  
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which  greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the eva luation of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guide lines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters 
for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans  should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful  in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that t he same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page [ADDRESS_365644] in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtai ned or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, the y must normalize for a subject  to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published .(35-37)  In 
addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_365645] -line trials in ovarian 
cancer .(38)  
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between pa rtial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appe ars or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET:   While FDG- PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.  
b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression o ccurring at 
that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this  is not PD.  
c) FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG- PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
III. Response Criteria for RECIST 1.1  
 
A. Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.    
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addi tion to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify fo r PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
B. Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All ly mph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject  to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non -CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normal ly trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.   
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_299597], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
C. Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment un til 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The subject 's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement  and confirmation criteria.

Note:  Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without

D. Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the tim e measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page [ADDRESS_365647] (irRECIST) guideline s according to Bohnsack et al. ( 34) are presented 
below.  
I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST  
In irRECIST,  baseline assessment and measurement of measurable/non -measurable and 
target/non -target lesions and lymph nodes are in line with RECIST 1.1. One new definition is 
added: If a subject has no measurable and no non -measurable disease at baseline the radiologist 
will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessment for any available follow -up time 
points unless new measurable lesions are identified and contribute to the total measured tumor 
burden ( TMTB ).  irND is a valid assessment in studies with ad juvant setting where the protocol 
and study design allow the inclusion of subjects with no visible disease . 
II Follow -up Assessments  in irRECIST 
A. Follow -up recording of target and new measurable lesions  
A key difference in irRECIST is that the appearance new lesions do es not automatically 
indicate progression .  Instead, all measured lesions (baseline -selected target lesions and new 
measurable lesions) are combined into the total measured tumor burden (TMTB)  at follow up.   
Baseline -selected t arget lesions and new measurable lesions are  NOT assessed separately. 
Measurements of those lesions ar e combined into the TMTB, and one combined assessment 
provided.  
In order to be selected as new measurable lesions  (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions total, per 
time point ), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and 
meet the same minimum size requirements of [ADDRESS_365648] 1.1 definitions for assessment of non -target lesions apply.  The response of non -target 
lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon -CR/Non -PD 
(irNN). Non -target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and 
unequivocal worsening of non -target lesions alone, even without progress in the TMTB is 
indic ative of irPD .  In alignment with RECIST 1.1, baseline selected non -target lesions can never 
convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at subsequent time points and 
become measurable. Only true new lesions can be measured and contrib ute to the TMTB . 
C. Follow -up for New Non -Measurable Lesions  
All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non -measurable 
lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive and unequivocal progression of new non -
measurable lesions leads to an overall assessment of irPD for the time  point. Persisting new 
non-measurable lesions prevent irCR.

LUD2014- 012-VAC Protocol Amendment 10.0  (Final, 30-JUL-2021 ) Page [ADDRESS_365649] diameters (SumD) of all target lesions  (up to 2 lesions per 
organ, up to total 5 lesions) is  measured.   At each  subsequent tumor assessment, the SumD of  
the target lesions and of new, measurable lesions  (up to 2 new lesions per organ, total 5 new 
lesions) are added  together to provide the total measurable tumor burden (TMTB) . 
Overall Assessments by [CONTACT_299650] 
(irCR)  Complete disappearance of all measurable and non -measurable lesions. Lymph 
nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in short axis.  
Partial Response (irPR)  Decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non -target lesions are irNN, and 
no unequivocal progression of new non- measurable lesions  
• If new measurable lesions appear in subjects with no target lesions at 
baseline , irPD will be assessed. That irPD time point will be considered a new 
baseline, and all subsequent time points will be compared to it for response 
assessment. irPR is possible if the TMTB of new measurable lesions 
decreases by ≥ 30% compared to the first irPD documentation  
• irRECIST can be used in the adjuvant setting , in subjects with no visible 
disease on CT/MRI scans. The appearance of new measurable lesion(s) 
automatically le ads to an increase in TMTB by 100% and leads to irPD. These 
subjects can achieve a response if the TMTB decreases at follow- up, as a sign 
of delayed response.  
• Based on the above, sponsors may consider enrolling subjects with no 
measurable disease and/or no  visible disease in studies with response 
related endpoints . 
Stable Disease 
(irSD)  Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD 
Progressive Disease (irPD)  Minimum 20% increase and minimum [ADDRESS_365650] 
irPD assessment. An irPD confirmation scan m ay be recommended for subjects 
with a minimal TMTB % -increase over 20% and especially during the flare time -
window of the first 12 weeks of treatment, depending on the compound efficacy 
expectations, to account for expected delayed response.  
• In irRECIST a substantial and unequivocal increase of non- target lesions  is 
indicative of progression.  
• IrPD may be assigned for a subject with multiple new non -measurable 
lesions  if they are considered to be a sign of unequivocal massive worsening  
Other  irNE:  used in e xceptional cases where insufficient data exist.  
irND:  in adjuvant setting when no disease is detected  
irNN:  no target disease was identified at baseline, and at follow- up the subject 
fails to meet criteria for irCR or irPD

 Project Summary  
Intravitreal injections are a very common form of treatment for a variety of ocular pathologies. The use of these injections has only increased given the large utility they provide. They both improved visual outcomes and provided patients an overall better quality of life. However, a problem experienced by [CONTACT_609036].
1,2,[ADDRESS_807592] shown adequate to improved pain control through the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]- steroidal anti -
inflammatory drug (NSAID) ey e drops. One study looked at the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609007] 0.10% on post injection pain.
8 This study used the McGill pain assessment 
questionnaire, which not only quantified pain but the additional benefit of describing the nature of the pain the patient experienced. In a clinical research study , Makri et al 
looked at pain immediately and 6 hours after injection. The researchers found that when 
Page 2 of 12 
compared to the control group (artificial tears) the group who received NSAID eye drops 
had better pain control.8,[ADDRESS_807593] compared the timing of application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_609008], in the alleviation of long -term pain patients experience. Bromfenac  
0.09% is our agent of choice given its previously demonstrated effectiveness in pain control and also strength when compared to other ophthalmic NSAIDs.
[ADDRESS_807594] surgery to help reduce 
intraocular  inflammation. Our study look s at this medication’s  utility to control pain 
following IVI, another invasive procedure. We would assess pain control immediately following injection, [ADDRESS_807595] injection. This will allow us to evaluate Bromfenac 0.09%’s effectiveness on overall immediate pain control as well 
as on ocular discomfort/soreness that can often follow IVI. Additionally, we plan to have 
two intervention groups that look compared Bromfenac 0.09% instillation 30 minutes prior to IVI and instillation immediately following IVI.  
 The primary goal of this study is to determine if topi[INVESTIGATOR_609009] 0.09% 
eye drops can reduce the discomfort that patient experience both during and after intravitreal injections. Additionally, we will investigate the effect of both pre and post injection application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% on subjective pain scores.  
 Our study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609011] [ADDRESS_807596] once before. This will serve to minimize bias from initial injection anxiety and will give patients a comparative data point (prior injection discomfort). Patients will be randomized into one of three groups, which will be known as group A, B or C. The groups will have drop regimens as follow s: 
 
Group A : Will receive 1 drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% 30 minutes prior to the 
injection and then 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop immediately after the injection and wash.  
 
Group B : Will received 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop 30 minutes prior to the 
injection and then 1 drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% immediately after the injection and wash.  
 
Page 3 of 12 
Group C: Will received 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop 30 minutes prior to the 
injection and then 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop immediately after the injection and 
wash.  
 All labels will be removed from the bottles and the patients will be blinded to which group they belong to. The treating physicians ([CONTACT_609046] and [CONTACT_11515] ) will also be 
blinded to which group the patients belong to.  
 Immediately following the injection, each patient will be asked to rate their pain using 
the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale as well as the McGill Pain Questionarire (SF -MPQ). 
Patients will then be given instructions and will be told to expect a call at [ADDRESS_807597] any complications (ie. discomfort, increased 
pain, vision changes, or any other questions). Patients will be provided with a copy of the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire to take home 
with them. Patients will be called [ADDRESS_807598]-injection for further assessment of their 
pain using both the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire 
(SF-MPQ). At 24 hours , patients will again be contact[CONTACT_609037] -Bake r FACES pain scale and the McGill Pain 
Questionnaire (SF -MPQ). This will serve as the last point of data gathered for our study 
for our patients. They will continue regular follow up with their ophthalmologist as scheduled.  
  Background and Significance  
Intravitreal injections (IVI) are a common form of treatment for multiple retinal pathologies. They are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_609012].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_609013]. the downside is that patients often require 
multiple repeat injections to maintain control of their disease state. Many patients fear injections due to the anxiety and pain during the injection and the experience discomfort after the procedure.
1,[ADDRESS_807599] common being topi[INVESTIGATOR_609014]. This can provide some immediately relief, but often does little to control  pain that some 
patients experience hours after the injection.
2,3 Increased lidocaine concentration has 
been applied to the eye with cotton- swaps and has provided adequate analgesia during 
the injection, but patients often still experienced pain hours afterwards.2 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_609015] (tetracaine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_609016], proparacaine) little relief was provided many hours post injection.
4,5,[ADDRESS_807600] utilized the Wong -Baker 
FACES pain scale. This scale proved to be an effective measure of subjective pain in patients and allowed studies to adequately compare pain scores across treatments 
Page 4 of 12 
(topi[INVESTIGATOR_609017], gel, lidocaine- soaked cotton swabs) versus control groups. It 
must be mentioned that this scale is only accurate and useful if patients are able to 
understand the pain scale and to properly rate what they are experiencing. This scale is particularly useful in elderly patients as it is very visual in nature.
5,6 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been looked at as a 
method of controlling immediate and post injection pain. Diclofenac, Nepafenac 0.1% and Bromfenac 0.9% has been shown to be an effective method of controlling post injection pain up to 6 hours after intravitreal injection.
8,9,10 Diclofenac has also been 
utilized in patients with diabetic retinopathy prior to undergoing pan- retinal 
photocoagulation (PRP) and was found to be effective at  reducing the discomfort 
experienced.[ADDRESS_807601] injection.  
 To evaluate the pain experienced hours after injection, the short form McGill pain assessment questionnaire (SF -MPQ) was ut ilized.
[ADDRESS_807602] injection. We will look at the use of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_609018] 0.09%, which has shown reduction in post injection pain.
10 We will evaluate Bromfenac 0.09% effect 
on pain if given [ADDRESS_807603] -
injection.  
 Risks associated Bromfenac are minimal , and i n clinical trials done by [CONTACT_3455] , 
mainly consisted of surface irritation. Some patients did report headaches and increased eye redness; however these symptoms were described only in 2 -7% of 
patients. More severe complications such as corneal thinning and erosions were reported in the post -marketing surveillance group and were more associated with 
chronic use.
13 A study performed by [CONTACT_609038] 0.09% 
in preventing and decreasing post -injection pain. Of the 65 patients enrolled in that 
study, none had any adverse reactions to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09%.10 
 Specific Aims/Study Objectives  Hypothesis and Purpose  
Page 5 of 12 
Our hypothesis is that intervention with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_609019] (IVI) and post -IVI. We will assess the effectiveness of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609020] 0.09% on pain after IVI. In addition, we will investigate whether pre or post 
injection instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% has a greater effect on post -injection 
pain.  
 Duration The study will last 1 day (24 hours) total for each subject. We plan to enroll patients that require an intravitreal injection of an anti -VEGF medication for their eye disease. We 
plan to enroll 45 patients for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The data analysis will be performed at the end of the study. It is expected that the study will be completed, and the results will be available within 1 year from time of commencement.  
 Outcome measures  
1. Assessment of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 0.09% Bromfenac’s analgesic effect pre- and post -injection in 
patients undergoing intravitreal injections of anti -VEGFs as measured by [CONTACT_609039] (SF -MPQ). (Time Frame: 6 hours and 24 hours after IVI)  
2. Assessment of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 0.09% Bromfenac’s analgesic effect pre- and post -injection in 
patients undergoing intravitreal injections of anti -VEGFs as measured by [CONTACT_100953]-
Baker FACES pain scale. (Time Frame: immediately following IVI)  
 Research Design and Methods  Recruitment and Location Subjects are patients with a retinal disease requiring anti -VEGF therapy who are under 
the care of [CONTACT_609047] and other retinal specialists at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166] (UWHC). Ophthalmologists involved in the patients’ clinical care will be the first to approach patients about the study. For patients who are interested and meet the criteria, the study team will explain the study, guide the patient through the study specific consent form, and answer subject questions.

Page [ADDRESS_807605] care IVI and randomly placed in one of three groups: Group A, B or C. Each group will consist of [ADDRESS_807606] been completed the appropriate injection of an anti -VEGF agent will be 
administered. The lid speculum will then be removed. The patient’s eye will then be cleansed of any remaining betadine eye wash solution.  
 3. Group Explanations (Patients will not be aware of what group they belong to via removal of any labels on the bottles):  
 - Group A: Will received 1 drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% 22 minutes prior to 
the injection and then 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop immediately after the injection and wash.  
 - Group B: Will received 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop 22 minutes prior to 
the injection and then 1 drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% immediately after the injection and wash.  
Page 7 of 12 
 - Group C: Will received 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop 22 minutes prior to 
the injection and then 1 drop of an artificial tear eye drop immediately after the injection 
and wash.  
 4. All patients involved in the study will be assessed for subjective pain score immediately (1 minute) following IVI using the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale and the 
McGill Pain Questionaire (SF -MPQ). This result will be recorded.  
 5. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_609041] [ADDRESS_807607] injection for further assessment of their level of pain. This will be assessed by [CONTACT_609042] -Baker FACES pain scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF -MPQ). 
Results will then be recorded.  
 6. Subjects will be contact [CONTACT_53016] ([ADDRESS_807608] -injection) at home at their 
preferred contact [CONTACT_108118] [ADDRESS_807609] injection for assessment of the pain level 
again both the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale and the the McGill Pain Questionnaire 
(SF-MPQ).  
 7. No further follow up appointment will have recorded data and patients will follow up with their normal provider  as scheduled.  
 
Intravitreal injection Procedure  
Group A: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_609021] B: Artificial tears prior to injection and topi[INVESTIGATOR_609022] f ollowing 
intravitreal injection  
Group C: Artificial tears prior to and following intravitreal injection  
Injections procedure will then proceed as follows:  
Preparations for the injection will then be made first by [CONTACT_609043]. The eye that is to be injected will be marked by [CONTACT_1299] a sticker on the patient’s forehead above the indicated eye. Depending on the group 1 drop of artificial 
tears (Groups B and C) or Bromfenac (Group A) will be instilled in the eye intended for 
injection. After instillation of the first drop a timer will be set for 10 minutes. After 10 
minutes has elapsed, a drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_609023] 0.5% will be instilled. A timer will then 
be set for [ADDRESS_807610]  elapsed, the eye will cleansed with betadine 
5% solution by [CONTACT_89062] [ADDRESS_807611] elapsed topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] ( Akten) gel 3.5% will be instilled in the 
eye marked for injection. A timer will then be set for [ADDRESS_807612], 1- 2 fingers will be 
held up and the patient will be asked how many they see. This step is done to assess 
no visual changes following intravitreal injection.  The eyelid speculum will then be 
removed.  After this is done the patient’s eye will then be rinsed with an eyewash 
cleansing solution to remove any excess betadine. After thorough cleansing with the eye wash. The treating physician will then leave the roo m. The Wong -Baker and SF -
MPQ pain questionnaires  will then be administered by a trained study member. The 
patient, depending on what group they belong to will then be given one final eye drop. It will be either artificial tears (Groups A and C) or Bromfenac (Group B). The patient will 
then be told to expect a call [ADDRESS_807613] the clinic.   
Of note all physicians involved in providing intravitreal injections are Retina fellowship 
trained and use the same injection protocol, including choice of anesthesia, type of 
medication/needle/syringe, location of actual injection, etc. Injections will be given in the 
same locat ion (for ex. Superotemporal quadrant as above) to ensure consistency, while 
not deviating from standard of care in which this location is commonly used by [CONTACT_609044]. This ensures that there will be minimal variation in 
the overall injection experience.   
The patient’s care will not differ from standard of care if they decide to participate in this study.   
Being involved in the study group may prolong the patient’s overall visit length by 
[CONTACT_3450] 20- [ADDRESS_807614] of car e activities, specifically 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_609024].  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan

Risk Identification and Minimization 
The risk that patients involved in this study will be exposed to will be instil lation of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09%, a non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) drop. The 
drop will be administered via a single use bottle of the medication and the same bottle 
will not be used on multiple subjects to minimize risk of cross -contamination.  
 Patient’s will also be given an intravitreal injection of an anti -VEGF agent, but this will 
not be a change from what their appointment would normally entail.  All of our study patients will be those whom would normally undergo an injection for their diagnosis regardless of their inclusion/exclusion from the study.  
 Bromfenac 0.09% is an NSAID drop and has been shown to be relatively safe in patients. This is especially true for our method of using this medication as it will only be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. W ith that being side it does have a side effect profile which includes, 
foreign body sensation in the eye, conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation, eye discomfort, eye pruritus, eye redness, headache, and rarely iritis. The manufacturer of this drop reports these events to have occurred in 2- 7% of their patients during clinical trials. 
Post- marketing surveillance has led to less common, but still possible side effects which 
included corneal erosions, corneal perforation, corneal thinning, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_609025]. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_609026], frequent use.  
 It should be noted that any of patient who has previously has a poor interaction with any type of NSAID drop will not be included in our study.  
 Patient will be assessed immediately following their intravitreal injection for their subjective pain scores using the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale. They will also be 
provided a number to call should they have any questions of eye irrigation post injection. All of the patient’s in our  study will have previously had intravitreal injections 
so they will be already familiar with the process.  
 To minimize risks , only experienced professionals will administer the medication. All 
subjects will be monitored closely for any adverse reaction and treated appropriately if any of these would develop. If any adverse reactions do occur, the principle investigator 
will be notified and appropriate action will be taken to assist and treat the patient appropriately.  
 Patients will be contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] [ADDRESS_807615] injection for subjective pain scores 
using the McGill Pain Questionaire (SF -MPQ). During this telephone encounter patients 
will also have the opportunity to ask any questions or report any symptoms that they may be experiencing.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Procedures  
Data collected will be monitored by [CONTACT_609045] (CERU) team listed on this protocol.   
 
Page [ADDRESS_807616] been enrolled. 
 Unanticipated problems, adverse events, protocol deviations, and protocol violations will be reported as soon as they are discovered and will be recorded.  
 The study will be stopped if more than 30% of our subjects have an unanticipated 
adverse reaction to the medical indicating an issue with the medication. The study will also be stopped if any breach in confidentiality is detected.  
 Potential risks  
 The potential risks related to study participation include:  
1. Drug reaction to topi[INVESTIGATOR_609010] 0.09% which includes, increase in IOP, foreign body sensation in the eye, eye pruritus, eye redness, headache, conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation, eye discomfort, and rarely iritis. Also have a small risk of corneal erosions, corneal thinning, corneal perforation, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_609027].  
2. Increased inflammation and endophthalmitis from the intravitreal injections. Although extremely rare, it is possible to have an increase in inflammation and even endophthalmitis from an intravitreal injection.  
3. Large, controlled trials and meta- analyses have been done looking at adverse 
events from intravitreal Anti -VEGF agents. These have shown that “anti -VEGF 
monoclonal antibodies did not significantly increase overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, VTEs, or hypertension.   
4. Confidentiality breach. 
Protection of subjects  
 Subjects will be examined at a standard of care appointment. For those that enroll into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], their pain (post IVI) will be assessed at the conclusion of the appointment. Subjects will be phoned [ADDRESS_807617] care risks such as a change in the vision, appearance of the eye, or development of pain in the eye.  They will be provided with a 
24/[ADDRESS_807618] any difficulties.  Data collection forms will include 
the study identification num ber; no names will be used in the forms. Presentations and 
publications will not identify individual patients.  
Statistical Considerations 
Our study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609028] a total of [ADDRESS_807619] after IVI. Therefore, a 
power calculation cannot be extrapolated. Outcome 1 is written as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609029] 11 of 12 
gather data for interim analysis. If statistical  significance is not achieved at the interim 
analysis, the data will provide us with the deviation required to calculate the number of 
subjects needed for further recruitment in an expanded study.  
 
For Outcome 2, based on initial calculations to achieve a power of 80% and a standard 
deviation of 1.[ADDRESS_807620] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_609030] a private room; collection of sensitive informat ion about subjects will be limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims 
of the research. Data collection forms will include the study identification number; no names will be used in the forms. Presentations and publications will not identify individ ual patients.  
All paper data will be stored in locked cabinets. All the electronic data will be stored in UW IT approved password- protected computers  and/or UW IT approved devices . This 
will be kept at UWHC sites in a room with number lock available only to individuals listed in study protocol. The confidentiality of records will be maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. All the identifiers and information in paper format 
will be shredded. The electronic data that includes any patient identifiers will be deleted 
at the conclusion of the study. Raw data including information regarding injection comfort level will be kept to aide in future studies.

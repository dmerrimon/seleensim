Objectives:  
Primary objective : The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility 
of iovera° lumbar medial branch cryoneurolysis vs. radiofrequency ablation (RFA)  for facet 
mediated chronic low back pain (CLBP).  
Secondary objectives : The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
1. Evaluate safety outcomes ( i.e., adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, 
adverse events [AEs]) related to iovera° treatment  vs. RFA ; 
2. Evaluate clinical outcomes related to iovera° vs. RFA treatment  including pain, function al 
disability , and concomitant medication use (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_860018]) ; 
3. Evaluate the treatment success and failure rate  of iovera° medial branch cryoneurolysis  
vs. RFA ; 
4. Evaluate subject satisfaction with pain management ; 
5. Identify subgroups of patients who are most and least likely to benefit from iovera° 
medial branch cryoneurolysis  for facet mediated CLBP . 
Methodology:  
This is a single -center , randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_860019] .

• Group 1:  subjects will receive iovera° cryoneurolysis to the medial branch nerves  of 
the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Group 2: subjects will receive RFA to the medial branch nerves  of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_860020] [ADDRESS_1198670] provide 
informed consent – as documented in a study informed consent form (ICF) before performing 
any study related procedure that differs from the standard of care (SOC ) at the study site.  
 
During the screening visit, subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic  and 
general medical conditions that in the judgment  of the Investigator would preclude them from 
study participation.  No procedures other than the site’s SOC  will be performed before  signed  
informed consent is obtained. After the ICF is signed, demographic information, medical and 
surgical history, concomitant medications/concurrent procedures information , and vital signs 
will be collected. Assessment of t he intended treatment areas  will be conducted . Subjects will 
assess their pain in the low back region using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) . Subjects 
must be in structed to report any adverse device effects and adverse events (AEs) to the 
Investigator from the time the ICF is signed through Day 360 (±7 days) . 
 
When screening test results are received and the subject is deemed eligible for the study, the 
subject will be  notified  that he or she is  enrolled in the study.  
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Randomization scheme  
This is a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The study will enroll 30 total subjects 1:[ADDRESS_1198671] will be considered randomized into the study once the study treatment 
is assigned.

Subjects who withdraw from the st udy before the study  treatment  procedure may be replaced. 
Once a subject number is assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to 
replace those who withdraw will be assigned a unique subject number and randomized to 
treatment according to the procedures outlined above.  
 
Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before receiving the study 
treatment procedure may be replaced. Additionally, subjects may be replaced if insufficient 
and/or incomplete data are noted on safety or clinical outcomes.  
Diagnostic Medial Branch Block ( MBB ) 
As part of the eligibility criteria, subjects must have undergo ne two successful diagnostic 
medial branch block s consisting of two positive block s with local anesthetic only (i.e., no 
steroids) under fluoroscopic guidance that results in at least 50% relief of primary (index) 
pain for the duration of the local anesthetic used.  
iovera° Medial Branch Block 
ioveraº Treatment  
The iovera° system consist s of a reusable, portable Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], along with single patient use 
sterile Smart Tips (i.e., cryoprobes) and disposable nitrous oxide (N 2O) cartridges. The 
iovera° system produces the desired effect through initiation of a cooling cycle. Each cooling 
cycle  is initiated by [CONTACT_860040]. The Smart Tip needles are made of stainless steel and have a 
closed tip, fully enclosing the cryogen. The “190” Smart Tip will be used in this study.  
Administration Technique  
iovera° is to be administered in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_860021].  
Subjects will receive a fluoroscopic guided iovera° medial branch bl ock. Blocks will be 
performed with the subject in the prone position under asepsis in the following manner:  
• Record start time of procedure  
• The investigator injects 1% Lidocaine at the treatment site to numb the skin and tissue 
around the facet joint  
• The iovera° Smart Tip is positioned appropriately and a fluoroscopic image is taken to 
confirm the Tip’s position  
• The iovera° Smart Tip is inserted through the skin wheal to the target medial branch 
nerve below the junction of the superior articular and tr ansverse process

One freeze cycle will be applied to fully treat the nerve above and below the target joint. The 
exact process will be repeated on the opposite side of the same vertebral level, and the total 
time to place the probe should be recorded. For example, if one level is affected, four nerves 
will be trea ted (i .e., two nerves bilaterally), and if two levels are involved, twelve nerves will 
be treated (i .e., six nerves bilaterally).

Duration of Subject Participation in Study : 
Participation will begin at the signing of the study ICF. No more than 30 days should pass 
between signing of the ICF and the ioveraº or RFA treatment  procedure . Subjects will be 
followed up for  360 days (± 7 days) after iovera º or RFA treatment. Therefore, subjects may 
participate in the study for up to 392 days.  
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_860035], or officials from regulatory authorities 
identify conditions during the study that indicate so.  
 
The Investigator will review all serious adverse device effects and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) reported from the clinical study on an ongoing basis and in real time (i.e., as the 
events are reported). The Investigator will be responsible f or temporarily halting the study if 
the type, frequency, or seriousness/severity of such events suggests a potential threat to the 
safety of the study participants. If such action is taken, a thorough review of all available data 
will be conducted. Based o n the results of this review and discussions with  the Investigator 
and/or regulatory authorities as warranted, the study may be restarted or permanently 
terminated.  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
In addition, any death will be thoroughly reviewed, and appropriate action taken.

CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_1198677]’s post-treatment  course, the 
subject will be withdrawn from the study and the event or  condition will be reported as an 
AE or SAE.  
 
If a subject withdraws from the study and has an ongoing AE, every effort will be made to 
follow  up on such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained or further follow -up is 
otherwise no  longer warranted.  
 
Withdrawal Secondary to Adverse Events  
If a subject, experiences an AE that renders the subject incapable of continuing with the 
remaining  assessments, the subject will be discontinued from further participation in the 
study. A final  evaluation, including the early termination assessments  will be performed  so 
that the subject’s study participation can be terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  
 
Any subject who discontinues because of an AE will be instructed to notify the study 
personnel  of any abnormal sy mptoms and to visit the study site if medical evaluation is 
needed and the  urgency of the situation permits. Any subject exhibiting AEs will receive 
appropriate treatment at  the discretion of the Investigator until resolution of the AE.  
 
This study involves a single treatment (i .e., iovera° or RFA) ; therefore, subjects will not be  
terminated from the ongoing study assessments as long as they are willing and able to 
continue  with the follow -up schedule according to the protocol. For emergen cies and other 
unscheduled  visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_860043]’s case report 
form (CRF).  After termination from the study, the subj ect may be followed for safety 
including monitoring of AEs through Day 360. 
 
Voluntary or Study Investigator Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue from the study at any time, without prejudice to future 
treatment.  A subject may be discontinued from the study if the subject refuses study 
treatment or refuses to comply with study procedures. Subjects will be encouraged to 
complete the study safety assessments. Reasons for discontinuation from the  study will be 
recorde d. 
 
Early Termination Assessments  
In case of early termination, the following assessments shall be performed:

Definitions  
Adverse Device Effect:  Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) associated with the use of a 
device in subjects, whether or not considered related to the device. This also includes adverse  
device effects related to the use of a device resulting from failure, insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, improper or inadequate design, deployment, implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the device, as well as any ev ent resulting from user error (or 
use error) or from intentional misuse of the device.  
Medical Device Report (MDR) Reportable Event: A report of a death, serious injury, or 
malfunction which reasonably suggests that the device:  
• May have caused or contribu ted to a death or serious injury, or  
• Malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device would be likely to cause or 
contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. It is presumed 
that once a malfunction has occurred, it will recur.  
 
Serious adverse device effect:  An adverse device effect which results in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (i.e., an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the t ime of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically may have 
caused death, if it were more severe)  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; or  
• Requires in -patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191] 
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
• Results in fetal distress, fetal death, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
“Permanent” means irreversible  impairment or damage to a body structure or function, 
excluding impairment or damage that is reversible. A life -threatening injury meets the 
definition of serious injury, regardless of whether the threat was temporary.

Malfunction:  Failure of a device to  meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform 
as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the 
device.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect:  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any 
life-threate ning problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in 
the investigational plan, application (including a supplementary plan or applicatio n), or 
approved labeling, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Adverse Drug Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a drug, without any judgment 
about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination 
with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose.  
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function. 
Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status. 
The AE may involve any organ or system and can be represented by [CONTACT_482808] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_482809]. Any medically relevant and 
untoward change after the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or patter n changes for a 
fluctuating condition (e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An untoward medical occurrence with a drug that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (i.e. , an event in which the subject was  at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically may have 
caused death, if it were more severe)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or signific ant disability or incapacity (i.e. , a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect

• Is an important medical event where medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding  whether SAE reporting is appropriate, such as events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_860037]. Examples of such events include 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development 
of drug dependency or drug abu se 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event:  An adverse event in which the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the safety information described in the Reference Safety 
Information of the Investigator Brochure or approved product labeling.  
 
Collection and Assessment of Adverse Device Events and Adverse Drug Events  
All adverse events (adverse device events, serious adverse device events, device 
malfunctions, AEs, SAEs) will be collected from the signing of the ICF until Day 360 (± 7 
days) , regardless of whether or not they are considered related to the study device, surgical 
treatment, and/or drugs used as part of the treatment  regimen. For the study device, 
malfunctions will also be collected.  
 
Any medical condition noted before the subject signs the ICF will be recorded as Medical 
History and is considered a pre -existing condition. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing 
condition or a procedure described in the protocol, without a deteriorat ion of health, is not 
considered a serious adverse device event or SAE. If a pre -existing condition changes (i.e., 
becomes more severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study 
treatment , it is considered an adverse device event  and/or AE.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek safety information after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any serious adverse device event or 
SAE, including a death, after Day 360 (or at any ti me after the subject has been discharged 
from the study), and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study 
intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the appropriate 
regulatory body .

iovera° System  
The severity (or intensity) of an adverse device event or AE should be categorized using the 
following guidelines:  
• Mild: An adverse device event or AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing 
minimal discomfor t and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An adverse device event or AE that is discomforting and interferes with 
normal everyday activities.  
• Severe: An adverse device event or AE that prevents normal everyday activities.  
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
Relations hip of Adverse Device Effects to Study Device and Adverse Events to Drugs  
The Investigator is required to assess the relationship of the adverse device event, 
malfunction, and/or AE to study device and/or medication received for each occurrence after 
caref ul medical consideration on a case -by-case basis. The determination of the causal 
relationship to the study device and/or drug(s) will be made using the definitions below:  
• Unrelated: A causal relationship can be easily ruled out (e.g., based on the tempora l 
sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence 
of actual cause).  
• Unlikely: A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study device and/or drug(s) 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in  which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation;  
• Possible: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the 
study device and/or drug(s) but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals;  
• Probable: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the 
study device and/or drug(s) unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reason able response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge); or  
• Definite: For the study device, it is clear that it caused or contributed to the adverse 
device event and there is no indication of other causes. For drug(s), the 
pharmacological properties of the study drug(s)  or of the substance class, and the 
course of the AE after dechallenge and, if applicable, after rechallenge, and/or

specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of 
the AE, and no indication of other causes exists.  
An additional causality assessment is required for malfunction reports.  
 
Likely to Cause or 
Contribute to a 
serious adverse 
device event   
For device malfunctions that have not already been associated with a 
serious adverse device event, there is a reasonable possibility that 
death or serious injury may occur if the malfunction were to recur.  
 
 
Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the outcome of the adverse device event and/or AE after careful 
medical consideration, on a case-by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:  
 
Recovered/Resolved:  
 The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE.  
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  
 The initial event resolved but has a continuing abnormal 
condition as a result of the AE.  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  
 At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an 
undetermined outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be 
considered resolved as a result of death  
Recovering/Resolving:  
 At the time of last asses sment, the event was decreasing in 
frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected.  
 
Fatal:  
 The AE directly caused death.  
Unknown:  
 There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’s 
records to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew 
consent or was lost to follow -up). 
 
Action Taken with Subject due to an Adverse Device Effect or Adverse Drug Event  
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, 
diagnostic tests, laboratory tests , or therapy) for each reported adverse device event and AE.

Reporting of Serious Adverse Device Events and SAEs  
All serious adverse device events, malfunctions, and SAEs will be captured in the subject’s 
case report form within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Serious adverse 
device event/SAE or ma lfunction forms will be reported in accordance with local regulations .  
 
The serious adverse device event /SAE report will provide as much of the required 
information as is available at the time. The following minimum information is required for 
reporting a serious adverse device event /SAE: subject identifier, reporting source, event, 
causality assessment, and event outcome.  
 
During the time period between treatment  and study discharge, subjects will be instructed to 
contact a designated member of the rese arch team if they experience any adverse device 
effects or AEs during this period. The Investigator and qualified designees will enter the 
information in the electronic data capture (EDC) system as instructed.  
 
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Device Events an d SAEs  
Investigators will not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying the appropriate body of the serious adverse device event, malfunction, or 
SAE. The initial report should be followed by a full written summary  in the EDC detailing 
relevant aspects of the SAE in question. Where applicable, the investigator will report any 
information relevant to the serious adverse device event malfunction, or SAE from treatment  
records, diagnostic reports, or any other source d ocuments. If information from any relevant 
source documents is not available at the time of the serious adverse device event /SAE report, 
the relevant information will need to be added to the EDC as soon as possible.

The Investigator will follow all serious adverse device events and SAEs until resolved or the 
condition stabilizes, and further follow -up is not warranted.  
 
If the Investigator is made aware of any serious adverse device event or SAEs after Day 180 
that are believed to be causally related  to the study device or drug treatment, these should 
also be reported  in the EDC . The event will be followed until resolution, or until adequate 
stabilization is met.  
Safety Endpoints:  
Incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), including adverse device effects, serious 
adverse device effects, AEs, and SAEs through Day 360 (± 7 days) will collected . 
 
The total duration of study follow -up will be 12 months after the iovera° or RFA procedure . 
Adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, adverse events (AEs), and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from the time the study ICF is signed through Day 
360 (± 7 days) . Any concomita nt medications used to treat AEs through Day 360 (± 7 days)  
will also be recorded.  
Statistical Methods :  
As the aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_860038], formal hypothesis 
testing will not be determined , and sample size will not be calculated based on desired 
statistical power to detect a treatment effect.  
 
A total of 30 subjects are planned for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , with 15 randomized to each of the 2 
study groups . 
 
Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will 
be provided for continuous data. Tabulations (number and percentage of subjects) by 
[CONTACT_860044]. Safety data will be summarized descriptively 
by [CONTACT_464410] , and n o statistical testing for comparison of treatment groups 
will be performed for safety variables.

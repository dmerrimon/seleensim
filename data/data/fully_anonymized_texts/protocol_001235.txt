FINAL :  v6.0, [ADDRESS_1114701] to a maximum of 26 pediatric subjects from 2 to less than 4  years 
of age with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  (revised per Amendment 02)  
All subjects must be taking 1 to a maximum of 4 anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) to participate in the study.  For 
at least 6 but not more than 8  of the subjects  in the age group of 1 to less than 24 month s and for 13  subjects 
in the age group of 2 to less than 4 years  (across studies) , only 1 enzyme -inducing AED (ie, EIAEDs; 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ CBZ ], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ OXC ], phenytoin [ PHT ], or eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ESL]) out of the 
maximum of 4 AEDs will be allowed.  These subjects  will be referred to as  EIAED  subjects.  The remaining 
subjects cannot be taking any EI AEDs  and will be referred to as non-EIAE D subjects.  (revised per 
Amendment  02) 
For the age group of [ADDRESS_1114702] 
age (ie, at least  6 subjects in the age range ≥1 to ≤[ADDRESS_1114703] 5  subjects in the age range >6 to 
≤[ADDRESS_1114704] 5 subjects in the age range >12 to <24 months ).  (revised per Amend ment 02) 
For the age group of 2 to less than 4 years, the required number of subjects (total of 26) can be pooled across 
multiple studies for PK and safety assessments.  Therefore, the  target number of subjects to be enrolled in this 
age group  ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 26 subjects.  Enrollment of subjects aged 2 to less 
than 4 years  into th is study  may be stopped upon notification of sponsor when the total number has been 
reached  across clinical studies, or when enrollment in t he 1 to less than 24 months  age group in this study has 
completed (ie, the original purpose of this study has been met).  (revised per Amendment 02)  
This study will consist of 3 phases:  Pretreatment and Treatment (Core Study), and Extension.  The 
Pretreat ment Phase will last up to [ADDRESS_1114705] of 3 periods:  Titration (12- 16 weeks), Maintenance 
(4 weeks), and Follow -up (4 weeks; only for those subjects who complete the Maintenance Period but do not 
continue into the Extension Phase).  The Extension Phase will consist of 2  periods:  Maintenance 
(32-36 weeks) and Follow -up (4 weeks).  (revised per Amendment  02) 
The maximum total duration of treatment for each subject will be  [ADDRESS_1114706] will be 58  weeks ( 2 weeks Pretreatment+52 weeks of treatment+4 week s 
Follow -up).  (revised per Amendment  02) 
Subjects  who complete the Extension Phase and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], will likely  continue to 
demonstrate a positive benefit -to-risk ratio from treatment with perampanel may  be en rolled into an extended 
access program  (EAP) for perampane l if EAP is implemented for this age group in the country where the  
subject resides.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
Pretreatment Phase (Core Study)  
At the first visit of the Pretreatment Phase, 4  weeks of prescreening (ie, before Visit 1) seizure frequency data 
will be  collected for each subject as part of their medical history.  Upon successful completion of the 
Pretreatment Phase, eligible subjects will enter the Treatment Phase.   
Treatment Phase (Core Study)  
During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be dosed with pe rampanel oral suspension as follows:  
• Titration Period:   Subjects will start perampanel treatment at a dose of 0.50 mg/day and follow dose 
titration schemes up to 4 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8  mg/day (EIAED subjects).  Depending 
on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability, non- EIAED subjects could still have the 
perampanel dose up- titrated to 6 mg/day.   Perampanel dose should not be further up- titrated beyond 
6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8  mg/day ( EIAE D subjects) unless there is a medical need (for 
example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal seizure control).  
Before  dose up- titrations beyond 6  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) and 
whenever practi cally feasible, it is recommended to take a blood sample for the measurement of 
plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time of the last perampanel dose

 administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these unsc heduled PK sample 
collection will be recorded .  Up-titrations of perampanel dose within the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will 
be at 1 -week intervals; and at doses greater than 6  mg/day will be at 2 -week intervals  (see Study 
Treatment( s) section).  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 
16 mg/day ( EIAED subjects) .  The decision to up -titrate perampanel dose will be at the investigator ’s 
discretion, based on individual subject ’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose 
for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject ’s dose will be maintained 
stable for the remaining Titration Period or at least 2  weeks before entering the Maintenance Period.  
(revised per Amendment 02)  
• Maintenance Pe riod:   During the Maintenance Period, subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  The maximum total daily 
dose a subject will be allowed is 12  mg for non -EIAED subjects and 1 6 mg for EIAED  subjects .  
(revised per Amendment 02)  
• Follow-U p Period:   Subjects will not receive study drug during this period.   Subjects who do not 
continue into the Extension Phase after completing the Maintenance Period, or those who discontinue 
early from the study  will be r equired to complete the Follow-u p Period after their last dose in the 
Treatment Phase.  Subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter into EAP 
upon completion of study treatment  need not to undergo Follow -up Visit; however , sites will conduct 
a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after the last dose of study drug to follow adverse events ( AEs)  and 
report any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that occur within [ADDRESS_1114707] study drug 
administration.  (revised per  Amendment 02)  
After every 4th subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes the Maintenance Period , an interim 
analysis (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be conducted where by [CONTACT_2715]-normalized exposure will be compared 
to that observed in ot her studies in subjects  between ≥ 2 and < 18 years of age.   If the exposure of the subjects 
is significantly different from that observed in subjects ages ≥2 to <[ADDRESS_1114708] 24 subjects with evaluable PK data, and the target dose or dosing regimen of those subjects 
may be modified via protocol amendment , depending on the PK of the previous subjects.   PK data collected in 
older age cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
Preliminary PK analysis was performed based on data obtained from 7 subjects (>6 to <24 months of age; 
[ADDRESS_1114709] on concomitant EIAED) in this study and pooled with 
existing data from 2336 subjects  (aged 2 to 77 ye ars).  Preliminary PK findings suggest that oral clearance in 
subjects aged less than 24 months  without concomitant  EIAED appears to be approximately 40% of that in 
subjects aged ≥  2 years.  It is predicted that a daily dose of 6 mg or 8 mg in subjects aged less than  24 months 
without or with concomitant EIAED, respectively, will result in comparable exposure to that in subjects aged 
>2 years receiving a daily dose of 12 mg (non-EIAED subjects)  or 16 mg (EIAED  subjects) , respectively.  
However, European Medicines Agency/Paediatric Committee (EMA/PDCO) recommended that perampanel 
dose should be titrated up to a target dose of 4 mg/day for non -EIAED subjects (EMEA -000467- PIP01 -08-
M13), which could be further titrated up to 6 mg/day depending on individual subject’s clinical response and 
tolerability. Therefore, the target dose in this study is revised to 4 mg/day (non -EIAE D subjects) and 8 mg/day 
(EIAED  subjects)  in subjects less than 24 months  of age , while the maximum dose allowed remains as 
12 mg/day and 16  mg/day for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects, respectively.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
In subjects 2 to less than 4 years of age, there were very limited PK data (n=4) to allow adequate evaluation of 
effect of age on perampanel PK.  Therefore, the same target dose and dos e titration approach  will be followed 
for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects aged 2 to less than 4 years  as described above for 1  to less than 2 4 months  
subjects.   (revised per Amendment 02)

 Study Treatment(s)  
Test drug  
Perampanel will be provided as 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension stock.  Dosing should occur once daily before 
bedtime in the evening, unless otherwise specified.  
Study treatments are to be administered as follows:  
Pretreatment and Treatment Phase (Core Study)  
Pretreatment Phase:  Subjects will not receive study drug during this phase.  
Treatment Phase:  
• Titration Period ( 12-16 weeks):  S ubjects will start perampanel treatment at a dose of 0.50 mg/day 
and follow  dose titration  schemes up to 4 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED 
subjects).  Depending on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability, non -EIAED subjects 
could still have the perampanel dose up -titrated to 6 mg/day.   Perampanel dose should not be further 
up-titrated beyond 6  mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) unless there is a 
medical need (for example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control).  Before dose up -titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day 
(EIAED subjects) and whenever practically feasible,  it is recommended to take a blood sample for 
the measurement of plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time o f the 
last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up- titrations of perampanel dose within the 
range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will be at 1 -week intervals; and at doses greater than 6 mg/day will be at 
2-week intervals  (see Study Treatment( s) section)  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12 mg/day (non-
EIAED subjects) or 16  mg/day (EIAED subjects)).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be 
at the investigator’s discretion, based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for the remaining Titration Period or at l east 2 weeks before entering the 
Maintenance Period.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
According to the investigator’s clinical judgment subjects experiencing intolerability at any dose may remain at the same dose or have their dose decreased one dose level down to the previously tolerated 
dose.  If the subject continues to present significa nt intolerable AEs at the decreased dose and the 
investigator deems it is necessary, the dose can be decreased further to the next dose level down.  
Dose decreases can be done via telephone.  Subjects whose dose has been decreased can have their 
dose increased again if tolerability improves.  This must be  done at the next clinic visit after the 
investigator has deemed it is appropriate in view of the resolution of the AE(s).  Multiple dose 
adjustments will be allowed during the Titration Period.  Every effo rt should be made to have subjects 
achieve their optimal dose, not to exceed a maximum dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or  
16 mg/day ( EIAED subjects) during the Titration Period.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
• Maintenance Period (4 weeks):  During this period, subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period.  
Adjustment of the dose level during the Maintenance Period should be discouraged; however, 
according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, subjects experiencing intolerable AE(s) will be 
allowed to have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose.  During the Maintenance Period, subjects whose dose has been decreased cannot have their dose increased again.   A subj ect may not 
decrease their dose more than once during Maintenance Period unless there is a significant medical reason and with approval from the Medical Monitor.  
During the entire Titration and Maintenance Periods, all dose adjustments will be done via 1 d ose 
titration level up or down  (relevant to where the subject is within the study) .  Subjects who do not 
tolerate a dose of 0.50 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.  The maximum total daily dose a 
subject will be allowed is 12 mg ( non-EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects) .

Analyses  
Analysis Sets  
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is the group of subjects with at least [ADDRESS_1114727] 
1 postdose safety assessment.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is the g roup of subjects who received study drug and had any seizure frequency 
data during the 2 weeks of Pretreatment Phase plus 4  weeks before Pretreatment Phase and dur ing the 
Treatment Phase.   
Efficacy Analyses  
Exploration of efficacy will be performed on the FAS.  Summary statistics will be displayed for all efficacy 
parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacogenomic/ Pharmacogenetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Determination of PK will be performed on the PK Analysis Set.  Perampanel plasma concentrations will be 
listed.  
A population PK approach will be used to characterize the PK of perampanel.  The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic fact ors ( age, body weight, gender, race, ALT, AST, creatinine clearance and concomitant therapy 
with carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, lamotrigine, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], 
primidone, zonisamide, levetiracetam and primidone ) on perampan el PK will be evaluated.   A 2-compartment 
disposition PK model with linear elimination will be parameterized for absorption rate, oral clearance,  and 
apparent central and peripheral volume s of distribution.   Derived exposure parameters such as the steady s tate 
peak concentration (C max,ss), area under concentration vs time curve at steady state (AUC ss), and average 
steady -state drug concentration (Css,av) will be calculated using the individual posterior estimates of P K 
parameters from the final PK model .  Descriptive statistics of the individual model -predicted PK parameters 
(including but not limited to C max,ss) will be provided.   
Due to the small sample size, population PK analysis will be performed using NONMEM with first -order 
conditional estimation with interaction on data from this study pooled with existing rich data from 19 Phase 1 studies and spare data from 2 Phase 2 studies (232 and 235), and 5 Phase 3 Studies (304, 305, 306, 332 and 335).  A 2-compartment PK model will be fitted to the data and the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, 
including body weight and age, on the PK of perampanel will be evaluated. The post -hoc estimates of both, 
maximum observed concentration (C
max) and AUC from the final PK mode will be derived for all subjects . 
Subsequently, dose -normalized derived exposure parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_551] 
(≤6 months, > 6 to ≤ 1 2 months, >12 to <  24 months, ≥ 24 months to ≤4 years, >4 to ≤ 8 years, > 8 to <12 years, 
≥12 to < 18 years and ≥18 years) and also presented in box- plots, stratified by [CONTACT_807316].   Additionally, dose -normalized derived exposure parameters will be summarized descriptively for 
the following age groups:  1 to 24 months, 2 to ≤ 4 years, >4 to ≤ 8 years, >8 to <12 years, ≥12 to <18 years 
and ≥18 years), and also presented in box -plots, stratified by [CONTACT_807317] -EIAEDs.   (revised

Descriptive summary statistics of the laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters will also be evaluated.   
Descriptive summary statistics of changes from baseline in growth (ie, height/length, head circumference, 
weight) will be evaluated.  Thes e data may also be compared with normative scores to assess clinical relevance.  
Changes from baseline for thyroid function and IGF -1 testing will be summarized.  
Other Analyses  
Not applicable . 
Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis  (safety, tolerability, and PK) will be performed as follows:  
• After every 4th  subject in the age group 1 to less than 24 months completes  the Maintenance Period 
where dose -normalized exposure will be compared to that observed in other studies in subjects 
between ≥2 and < 18 years of age for evidence of systematic deviations potentially warranting dose 
adjustment in this age group or for other subjects enrolled in the study.   PK data collected in older age 
cohort (2 to less than 4 years) will also be examined in the interim PK analyses.   (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
• All data from the Pretreatment and Treatment Phases will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Maintenance Period.  In addition, a final analysis of data from the Pretreatment, Treatment,  and Extension Phases will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Extension 
Phase.   (revised per Amendment 02)  
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC) will be constructed to monitor the safety data.  The 
responsibilities, membership, and purpose of the DM C, the timing of the meeting(s), and an outline of the plan 
for review of the safety data will be documented in the DMC Charter.  
Sample Size Rationale  
Similar to Study 232, Study 238 will use population PK modeling to characterize PK in pediatric subjects 1 to 
less than 24  months  and 2 to less than 4 years of age, and compare these data to PK in adolescent  and adult 
subjects .  In a prior study (Study 23 2), data were obtained in 42  subjects ≥ 2 to <12  years  of age , with 
approximate equal numbers enrolled in the age ranges of ≥ 2 to ≤6 and ≥ 7 to <12 years .  (revised per 
Amendment 02)  
Given the narrower age range planned for Study [ADDRESS_1114729] that the PK data from this study will be pooled with the data from subjects  in ≥2 to < [ADDRESS_1114730] 16 subjects ≥ 1 to <[ADDRESS_1114731]  24 subjects if dose -normalized (to 8 mg) exposure in the 
Maintenance Period from the first 16 subjects in this study is not com parable to existing data in subjects aged 
≥2 to 18 year s.  (revised per Amendment 02)  
In order to compare the PK of pediatric subject s aged [ADDRESS_1114732] s aged >[ADDRESS_1114733] variability of 46.8% (CPMS -E2007 -015-v1), equivalent to a coefficient of 
variation (CV) on the log scale of 0.445, that provides a sufficient number of subjects to target a 95% 
confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the point estimate for the geometric mean clearance of

 7 INTRODUCTION  
Perampanel (E2007) is an orally active, noncompetitive, and highly selective α -amino -
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropi[INVESTIGATOR_149046] (AMPA) -type glutamate receptor antagonist 
with potential for therapeutic use in patients with  various neurological diseases.  Perampanel 
is approved in the US for the treatment (including monotherapy) of partial -onset seizures 
(POS) with or without secondarily generalized seizures in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] 4 years 
and older, and as adjunctive therapy of primary generalized tonic -clonic seizures (PGTCS) in 
patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] 12 years and older.  Perampanel is also approved in the EU as an adjunctive treatm ent of POS and PGTCS in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] 12 years and older.  
This study aims to provide pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data of perampanel in pediatric 
subjects from age ≥1 to < 24 months  and from age 2 to less than 4 years.   (revised  per 
Amendment 02)

Given the inherent challenges in performing clinical studies in children, extrapolation of efficacy from adult to pediatric subject s (24 months  and above) with partial onset seizures has 
been accepted as an alternative to randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled Phase 3 
studies in children, as reflected in the September 2019 FDA Guidance “Drugs for Treatment of Partial Onset Seizures:  Full Extrapolation of Efficacy from Adults to Pediatric subject s 
24 months of Age and Older”.  To support extrapolation, adequately designed PK and tolerability study(ies) with sufficient sample size are required to demonstrate similar exposure (blood/plasma levels of active drugs and, as applicable, metabolites) and to evaluate safety profile following drug administration in pediatric subject s aged [ADDRESS_1114751] s under 24 months  of age.

as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects age ≥2 to <12 years with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].   
Perampanel oral suspension (0.5 mg/mL) will be used in Study 238.  This formulation was used in Study 232.  The bioequivalence between the oral suspension formulation and the tablet 
formulation was evaluated in Study E2007-A001- 048 under fed and fasted conditions.  The 
results of the study in conjunction with steady state PK simulations of the data confirmed that the oral suspension formulation is bioequivalent to the tablet formulation, and can be used 
interchange ably with the tablet formulation.  From a safety point of view, both the oral 
suspension and tablet formulations were well- tolerated  
In support of pediatric development and minimizing the blood volume necessary to complete appropriate PK analyses, fully validated  dried blood spot (DBS) sampling method was used 
for analysis of perampanel concentrations in Study 232.  However, sites in this study encountered sampling challenges with resultant loss of samples.  For this study, a small -volume 
plasma assay requ iring  only 1- mL blood volume per time  point will be used.  (revised per

absorption and drug metabolism ( Ramsey, 2007).  For example, compared to a dolescents and 
adults , during the first year of life infants have reduced hepatic metabolism that by [CONTACT_807326] , which can  have 
important implications for dosing ( Pellock, 1998).  
Perampanel is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is mostly eliminated in the feces (about 70%) following metabolism primarily via the cytochrome (CYP) P450 3A4 pathway in the l iver.  T he possibility exists that the PK profile of perampanel may 
differ between infants and toddlers  compared with, adolescents and adults, thus requiring 
age-specific dosage regimens.  Study 238 is designed to evaluate the optimal maintenance dose 
and the dosing regimens to achieve plasma concentrations in  infants and toddlers  aged 1 month 
to less than 4 years comparable to those in adolescents and adults.

 subjects ≥12 to < 18 years  of age .  Treatment with pera mpanel for doses ranging from 4 to 
12 mg/day in these Phase 3 studies was significantly more effective than adjunctive  treatment 
with placebo in improving seizure control in subjects ≥12 years  of age with refractory POS .  
The studies also demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile in this population.   
A population PK analysis was completed on data from 74 adolescent ( ≥12 to <18 years  of age ) 
subjects only and from 770 adolescent and adult subjects combined from Studies 304, 305 and 
306.  Perampanel clearance increased in the presence of co -administered carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(CBZ) , OXC, and phenytoin (PHT)  by [CONTACT_3450] 3- fold, 2- fold, and 2- fold respectively.  
Perampanel clearance was not affected by [CONTACT_807327], the time during the study, dose administered, race, age, renal or liver conditions (estimated from creatinine clearance or liver function tests respectively) and concomitant AEDs lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], valproic acid, zonisamide, primidone, clobazam, and phenobarbital.  A small effect of gender and body mass was found but these were not considered clinically important.  Findings from a recent population PK analysis on data from 78 adolescents from 
Study 235 pooled with the data from the 74 adolescents from Studies 304, 305, and 306, were in full agreement with those from the previous analysis. 
A corresponding population PK/pharmacodynamic ( PD) analysis for the relationship between 
exposure and seizure frequency was also completed on data from [ADDRESS_1114756] udies 304, 305, and 306.  On the 
natural logarithm scale, a significant decrease in seizure frequency o f 0.000569 for an increase 
of 1 ng/mL in perampanel concentration was found.  There were no differences in response to 
perampanel resulting from gender, race, age, and co- administration of any AE Ds.  An 
additional population PK/PD responder analysis on data from the same 105 adolescent subjects only and from 1109 adolescent and adult subjects combined showed that the proportion of 
responders increases with the concentration of perampanel.  Again, findings from a recent 
population PK/PD analysis on data from 110 adolescents from Study 235 pooled with the data from the 105 adolescents from Studies 304, 305, and 306 were in full agreement with those from the previous analysis. 
Overall, perampanel PK was shown to be similar in adolescents and adults, was not affected 
in clinically important ways by [CONTACT_18694], age, gender, race, body mass (across the range of adolescents and adults), and not affected by [CONTACT_3252]- administration of AEDs other than inducing 
CYP 3A concomitant CBZ , OXC, and PHT .   
A PK analysis of data from Study 232 comparing dose -normalized perampanel concentrations 
in 42 pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_24590] ( aged ≥2 to <12 years) with dose -normalized perampanel 
concentrations from adolescent subjects ( aged ≥12 to <18 years) in Studies 304, 305 and 306 
was conducted.  Of the 42 subjects with wide range of body weights (ie, 12.2 to 90.9 kg) 
analyzed to date, 20 were aged ≥2 to ≤ 6 years and 22 were  aged ≥7 to <12 years.  A total of 28 
subjects were not receiving any of the EIAEDs  (CBX, OXC, or PHT ) and 14 subjects were 
receiving one of these EIAEDs .  As noted above, subjects in Study 232 were administered 
perampanel suspension (0.5 mg/mL) according to a weight based regimen compared to tablet s 
in Studies 304, 305, and 306.  Whole blood perampanel concentration values from Study 232

 analyzed using the DBS technique were converted to plasma concentrations, and for 
comparison purposes both plasma perampanel concentrations.  The results of the analysis 
demonstra ted that perampanel PK was linear as there was no dose or time- dependency to 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F).  The CL/F was not significantly affected by [CONTACT_654], body weight, 
gender, race, hepatic function markers ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] or aspartate 
aminotransferase [ AST ]), renal function marker (creatinine clearance) or the use of the oral 
suspension formulation in this population.  The predicted perampanel average steady state plasma concen tration dose normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in (intended to correspond to 8 mg/ 70 kg 
in adults/adolescents) for Study 232 were lower than that at 8 mg dose in adolescents from previous Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Since predicted CL/F was comparable among the 3 categorical groups (age 2 to <7, 7 to <12, and 12 to <18 years) independent of weight, the lower steady state concentration was deemed to be due to the lower total dose (mg/body) administered in these.  The results of the analysis suggested that flat dosing approach will be more appropriate in subjec ts within that age range.   
Considering the ontogenic profile of CYP3A enzyme in pediatrics , especially between 1  to less 
than 24 months  old, and due to the unknown safety profile in this population, a lower starting 
dose of 0.5 mg/day was selected, with t itrations to a dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) 
or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects). To date, sparse PK data is available from 3 pediatric subjects 
between age of 4.5 months to 20 months  receiving perampanel as part of a Named Patient IND.  
These subjects were dosed with perampanel up to 8 mg/day at steady state. The plasma 
concentration data in the 3 individuals although close to upper end of the range, were still within the 2 -fold relative to the exposures observed in 2 to <[ADDRESS_1114757] 4 subjects completing the PK portion of Study 238.  These data (dose -normalized to 8 mg) will be compared with data from  and 
adolescents (≥2 to <18 years  of age ) from previous studies for evidence of systematic 
deviations potentially warranting dose adjustment in this age group.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Titration Period 
During the Titration Period, subjects will sta rt perampanel tr eatment  at a dose of 0.50 mg/day 
and follow dose titration schemes  (Table 1  and Table 2 ) up to 4 mg/day ( non-EIAED  subjects) 
or 8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) .  Depending on individual subject’s clinical response and 
tolerability, non- EIAED subjects could still have the perampanel dose up- titrated to 6 mg/day.  
Perampanel dose should not be further up- titrated beyond 6 mg/day (non -EIAED subjects) or 
8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) unless there is a medical need (for example, a subject who 
tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal seizure control).  Before  dose up -
titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) and 
whenever practically feasible, it is recommended to take a blood sample for the measurement 
of plasma perampanel level as a precautionary measure.  The date and time of the last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time of PK blood draw, for these 
unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up -titrations of perampanel dose within 
the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day will be at 1- week intervals ; and at doses greater than 6  mg/day 
will be at 2 -week intervals  (see Study Treatment(s) section).  Dose titrations must  not exceed 
12 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 16 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects); see Study Treatment(s) 
section).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be at the investigator’s discretion, 
based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for the remaining Titration Period or at least 2 weeks before ent ering the 
Maintenance Period.  (revised per Amendment 02).

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups  
This current study (E2007-G000- 238) is part of the continuing development of perampanel in 
pediatric subjects. The purpose of the current study is to fulfill both the European and US 
regulatory requirements for the development of AEDs  in pediatric age grou ps.   
The primary objective of the study is to assess PK in order to determine appropriate dosing regimens of perampanel in pediatric subject s younger than 24 months of age.  Accordingly, 
this study is designed as open- label, single -arm, uncontrolled study with no placebo or 
active-control treatment groups.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Considering the ontogenic development of CYP3A (the enzyme responsible for perampanel 
metabolism) during the first 2 4 months of life, perampanel PK may be affected as the levels of 
CYP3A is changing.  To better characterize perampanel PK over the time course of CYP3 A 
maturation, t his study will seek to ensure adequate age representation among subjects (ie, at 
least 6 subjects a re in the age range 1 to ≤[ADDRESS_1114769] 5 subjects are in the age range >6 
to ≤[ADDRESS_1114770] 5 subjects are in the age range >12 to <24 months).  Additionally, 
due to the limited PK data collected for perampanel in the age group of 2 to <4 years, this study is amended to expand enrollment to include subjects aged 2 to less than 4 years.   (revised per 
Amendment 02) 
In this study, all subjects will be receiving perampanel as an adjunctive treatment.  As with 
dosing regimens studied in Phase 3 s tudies in adolescents and adults, gradual increase in dose 
(dose titrations) to reach therapeutic dose levels will be employed.  Clinical response and tolerability will be used as the criteria to make decision whether to escalate dose at each titration ste p and to define the optimal dose for individual subject.  The dose titration scheme 
and maximum doses (12 mg/kg [non- EIAED subjects] and 16 mg/kg [EIAED subjects]) have 
been evaluated in a Phase 3 study (E2007-G000- 311) in [ADDRESS_1114771] s (4 to <12 years) 
with refractory POS with or without secondarily generalized seizures or with PGTCS, and was found to be generally safe and well tolerated.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
Given the vulnerability associated with the young age of this study population and the lack of 
safety and PK information in this young age group, precautionary safety measures will be 
employed:  (1) Slightly longer titration intervals (ie, 1 -week intervals up to 6 mg/day and then 
2-week intervals from 6 mg/day to maximum dose of 12 mg/d ay [non- EIAED subjects] or 
16 mg/day [EIAED subjects]), compared to those in the adolescent/adult studies; (2) a 4- fold 
lower starting dose (0.5 mg/day instead of labeled 2 mg/day) will be employed as a 
precautionary safety measure, and (3) periodic interim PK analysis to examine the 
appropriateness of the target doses and dose range employed in this study.  (revised per

 EIAED  subjects) or 8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) .  Depending on individual subject’s 
clinical response and tolerability, non -EIAED subjects could still have the perampanel d ose 
up-titrated to 6 mg/day.  Perampanel dose should not be further up -titrated beyond 6 
mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 mg/day (EIAED subjects) unless there is a medical 
need (for example, a subject who tolerated perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control ).  Before dose up- titrations beyond 6 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 8 
mg/day (EIAED subjects) and w henever practically feasible,  it is recommended to take a 
blood sample for the measurement of plasma perampanel level as a precautio nary measure.  
The date and time of the last perampanel dose administration, as well as the date and time 
of PK blood draw, for these unscheduled PK sample collection will be recorded.  Up-titrations of perampanel dose within the range of 0.5 to 6 mg/day w ill be at 1 -week 
interva ls; and at doses greater than 6 mg/day will be at 2 -week intervals (see Study 
Treatment(s) section) .  Dose titrations must  not exceed 12 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) 
or 16 mg/day (EIAED subjects).  The decision to up- titrate perampanel dose will be at the 
investigator’s discretion, based on individual subject’s clinical response and/or tolerability to achieve optimal dose for a given subject.  Once the optimal dose has been achieved, the subject’s dose will be maintained stable for th e remaining Titration Period or at least 2 
weeks before entering the Maintenance Period  (revised per Amendment 02) 
According to the investigator’s clinical judgment subjects experiencing intolerability at any dose may remain at the same dose or have their dose decreased one dose level down to the previously tolerated dose.  If the subject continues to present significant intolerable AEs at the decreased dose and the investigator deems it is necessary, the dose can be decreased further to the next dose level  down.  Dose decreases can be done via telephone.  Subjects 
whose dose has been decreased can have their dose increased again if tolerability improves.  This must be  done at the next clinic visit after the investigator has deemed it is appropriate 
in view of the resolution of the AE(s).  Multiple dose adjustments will be allowed during the Titration Period.  Every effort should be made to have subjects achieve their optimal dose, not to exceed a maximum dose of 12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg/day 
(EIAED subjects)  during the Titration Period.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Maintenance Period (4 weeks):  During this period, subjects will continue taking 
perampanel oral suspension at the dose level they achieved at the end of the Titration Period. 
Adjustment of the dose level during the Maintenance Period should be discouraged; 
however, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, subjects experiencing intolerable AE(s) will be allowed to have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose.  During the Maintenance Period, subjects whose dose has been decreased cannot have their dose increased again.  A subject may not decrease their dose more than once during Maintenance Period unless there is a significant medical reason and with approv al from the 
Medical Monitor.  
During the entire Titration and Maintenance Periods, all dose adjustments will be done via 1 dose level up or down (Table 1  and Table 2 ).  Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of 
0.50 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.  The maximum total daily dose a subject 
will be allowed is 12 mg (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg ( EIAED  subjects) .

Other Dosing Considerations  
Down -titration of perampanel upon early discontinuation or completion of the study is not 
necessary, because the plasma half -life of perampanel is between ~25 (in the presence of 
EIAED) to 105 (in the absence of EIAED)  hours.  As such, plasma concentrations decrease 
gradually following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_807296].  If, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, down- titration of perampanel is still deemed necessary, the investigator must discuss the 
down- titration before the early discontinuation with the Medical Monitor.

 was conducted.  Of the 42 subjects with a wide range of body weights (i e, 12.2 to 90.9 kg) 
analyzed to date, 20 were aged ≥2 to ≤ 7 years and 22 were aged ≥7 to <12 years.  A total of 
28 subjects were not receiving any of the EIAEDs  (ie, CBX, OXC, or PHT) and 14  subjects 
were receiving one of these EI AEDs .  As noted above, subjects in Study 232 were administered 
perampanel oral suspension (0.5 mg/mL) according to a weight -based regimen compared to 
tablets in Studies 304, 305, and 306.  Whole blood perampanel concentration values from 
Study 232 analyzed using the DBS technique were converted to plasma concentrations, and 
for comparison purposes both plasma perampanel concentrations.  The results of the analysis 
demonstrated that perampanel PK was linear as there was no dose or time- dependency to CL/F .  
The CL/F was not significantly affected by [CONTACT_654], body weight, gender, race, hepatic function markers (ALT or AST), renal function marker (creatinine clearance) or the use of the oral 
suspension formulation in this population.  The predicted perampanel average steady state 
plasma concen tration dose normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in pediatrics (intended to correspond to 
8 mg/70 kg in adults/adolescents) for Study 232 were lower than that at 8- mg dose in 
adolescents from previous Phase 2 and 3 studies.   Since predicted CL/F was comparable among 
the 3 categorical groups (age 2 to <7, 7 to <12, and 12 to <18 years) independent of weight, the lower steady state concentration was deemed to be due t o the lower total dose (mg/body) 
administered in pediatric subjects.   The results of the analysis suggested that  a flat dosing 
approach will be more appropriate in subjects within that age range.    
Considering the ontogenic profile with CYP3A enzyme in pediatrics , especially between 1 to 
less than 24 months  of age, and due to the unknown safety profile in this population, a lower 
starting dose of 0.5  mg/day was selected for this study, with titrations to a maximum dose of 
12 mg/day (non- EIAED  subjects) or 16 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects).   To date, sparse PK data is 
available from 3 pediatric subjects between age of 4.5 months to 20 months receiving perampanel through a Named Patient IND.  These subjects were dosed perampanel up to 
8 mg/day at steady state.  The plasma concentration data in the 3 individuals although close to 
upper end of the range, were still within the 2- fold relative to the exposures observed in 2 to 
<12 year old subjects . Based on these findings, the likelihood of starting dose of 0.5 mg 
achieving unexpectedly high plasma exposures in the proposed age population is considered 
to be low. 
Furthermore, noting the wide variability in hepatic metabolism via CYP3A in pediatric  
subjects less than 2 4 months of age, the risk of unexpected plasma exposures in number of 
pediatric subjects is further minimized by [CONTACT_807332] (safety, tolerability, and 
PK) after every [ADDRESS_1114791] complet es the Maintenance Period .  Dose -normalized exposures 
will be compared to that observed in other  studie s in subjects between ≥2 and < 18 years of age 
for evidence of systematic deviations potentially warranting dose adjustment in this age group  
or for other subjects enrolled in the study.   Preliminary PK analysis was performed based on data obtained from 7 subjects (>6 to 
<24 months of age; [ADDRESS_1114792] on concomitant EIAED) in this study and pooled with existing data from 2336 subjects (aged 2 to 77 years).  
Preliminary PK findings suggest that oral clearance in subjects aged less than 24 months  
without concomitant EIAED appears to be approximately 40% of that in subjects age d

 ≥2 years.  It is predicted that a daily dose of 6 mg or 8 mg in subjects aged less than 24 months  
without or with concomitant EIAED, respectively, will result in comparable exposure to that 
in subjects aged >2 years receiving a daily dose of 12 mg (non-E IAED subjects)  or 16 mg 
(EIAED  subjects) , respectively.  However, European Medicines Agency/Paediatric Committee 
(EMA/PDCO) recommended that perampanel dose should be titrated up to a target dose of 4 
mg/day for non- EIAED subjects (EMEA -000467- PIP01 -08-M13), which could be f urther 
titrated up to 6 mg/day depending on individual subject’s clinical response and tolerability.  Therefore, the target dose in this study is revised to 4 mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) and 
8 mg/day ( EIAED  subjects) in subjects less than 2 4 months of age, while the maximum dose 
allowed remains as 12  mg/day and 16 mg/day for non -EIAED and EIAED subjects, 
respectively .  Perampanel dosage should not be further up- titrated, unless there is a medical 
need (for example, a subject who tolerated  perampanel well but have not reached optimal 
seizure control).  At any time in the study, perampanel dose must not to exceed 12  mg/day (non- EIAED subjects) or 16  mg/day (EIAED subjects).  (revised per Amendment 02) 
In subjects 2 to <4 years of age, there were very limited PK data (n=4) to allow adequate evaluation of effect of age on perampanel PK.  Therefore, the same target dose and dose titration approach will be followed for non- EIAED and EIAED subjects aged 2 to less than 
4 year s as described above for 1  to less than 2 4 month s subjects.   (revised per Amendment 02)

Maintenance Period (ie, Visits 7 and 8 for non- EIAED subjects, or Visits 8 and 9 for EIAED 
subjects), as 2 PK samples (1 predose and 1 early postdose [within 1 to 5 hours after dosing]) are to be collected, the following steps are to be fol lowed  (revised per Amendment 02): 
• Study drug administration in the evening immediately before the PK visits during Maintenance Period will be withheld.  All other AEDs should be administered per t he 
subject’s usual AED regimen.   
• During each of the Maintenance Period PK visits, collect predose PK sample.  Then administer study drug on site, followed by [CONTACT_807313] (within 1 to 5 hours after dose administration).  
• Bedtime dosing will resume beginning in the evening of the Maintenance Period PK visits.  
• The dosing date and time of the study drug dose administered on- site during each 
Maintenance Period PK visit, as well as the last 2 doses before will be recorded.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_807314], clinical labs (ie, 
hematology and blood chemistry), vital signs, ECGs, medical history, and physical and neurological examinations.   
Growth will be assessed for this age population by [CONTACT_807315], weight, head 
circumference, thyroid function and insulin -like growth factor -1 (IGF -1) testing .   
Details of the timing of all safety assessments are presented in  Table 4.  
Adverse Events a nd Events Associated With Special Situations  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is perampanel ( E2007).  
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product (Note:  Every sign or symptom should not be listed as a separa te AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE) 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg , ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg , headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
• An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding 
of study drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not  
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the last visit and for 28  days following study drug discontinuation.   
Subjects who fail s creening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen 
failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF.  SAEs will be collected for [ADDRESS_1114798] dose. 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being r eported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated

FINAL :  v6.0, [ADDRESS_1114799]’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, 
to stabilization.  
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_3190].  
ASSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be graded on a 3- point scale ( mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definitions are as follows: 
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity 
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Severe   Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
The criteria for assessing severity are different than those used for seriousness (see  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for the definition of an SAE). 
ASSESSING RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY TREATMENT  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments  
• The presence of ri sk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
• The presence of nonstudy, treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event

 The relationship of each AE to th e study drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility. 
No (not related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is not a reasonable possibility. 
Serious Adverse Events and Events Associated With Special Situations 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE  as it occurred; 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed 
to continue, might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
drug) 
Other important medical even ts that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed abo ve should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.  
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations include AEs associated w ith 
study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special 
situations are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only 
if they meet one of the above criteria.  All AEs associated with  special situations are to be 
reported on the CRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely to stabilization.

 to enable safety evaluation (eg, to assess whether there are treatment -emergent shifts in 
laboratory values from baseline), all post -baseline labs must be conducted at the same local 
laboratory  using same assays as those used at Screening/ Baseline.  In other cases where 
unscheduled laboratory samples need to be taken and immediately analyzed to address a safety 
concern, blood samples will be split (or 2 samples drawn) to allow for a local labora tory 
analysis in addition to the central laboratory.  Laboratory certification , as well as normal assay 
range for each of local laboratory tests run, will be collected as available and will be included 
in the clinical study report for this protocol.  (revi sed per Amendment 02)  
For laboratory abnormalities meeting the criteria of SAEs (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the site must 
fax or email the SAE report including the laboratory report ( as regionally required) to the 
sponsor using the SAE form (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
VITAL SIGNS WEIGHT , HEIGHT , AND HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS  
Vital sign measurements (ie , systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [per minute], body temperature [in centigrade]), and growth parameters including measurement of height, weight ( kg), head circumference, will be 
obtained at the visits designated i n the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4).  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been sitting  or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], for 5 minutes.  
All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, preferably by [CONTACT_3194].  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Physical examinations will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 4 ).  Documentation of the physical examination will be 
included in the source documentation at the site.  Only changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF.  
ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated i n the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments 
(Table 4 ).   
ECGs should preferably be recorded prior to blood draws when both are scheduled at the same visit.  However, if for any reason blood draws occur before ECG recording, then the ECG must be recorded at a minimum of [ADDRESS_1114802] 5 minutes prior to recording an ECG.  The ECG will be reviewed by [CONTACT_093] (paper or electronic tracing) and will be available for comparison with subsequent ECGs by [CONTACT_093].   
If the subject has a normal ECG baseline reading, but during any visit thereafter there is any 
clinically significant ECG abnormality  (as determined by [CONTACT_093]), 3 consecutive  
ECGs separated by 5 to 10 minutes will be performed to confirm the abnormality at that visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a completed SAE form by [CONTACT_36600] [ADDRESS_1114819] visit (through the last visit in the Treatment Phase and for  [ADDRESS_1114820]’s last dose).  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  Any SAE judged by [CONTACT_763094] -required 
procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed 
since study completion. 
Detailed contact [CONTACT_807337].  
For urgent safety issues, please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to 
the subject and contact [CONTACT_3581].    
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality.  
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours  of its 
receipt.  If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality, this 
should also be noted on the follow- up SAE form.  
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_3582][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other documents requested by [CONTACT_456].

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Events Associated with Special Situations 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , MISUSE , ABUSE , 
OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer 
to AEs associated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760].  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher than 
the protocol-defined dose  
Misuse  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the protocol. Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in 
accordance with the prescribed or authorized dose, route of administration, or indication (s) or use of prescription -only study drug 
without a prescription  
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug 
accompanied by [CONTACT_807338].   
All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error  should be  captured  on 
the Adverse Event CRF  and also  reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  Abuse is always 
to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.

Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_3210] a third party acting on behalf of the sponsor to regulatory authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established guidance.  
The format of these reports will be dictated by [CONTACT_119663]. 
All studies that are conducted within any European country will comply with European Good  
Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
will be reported, as required, to the competent authorities of all involved European member states.  
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects  
The investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time for safety or administrative reasons.  A subject may elect to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.  All subjects who discontinue the study are to complete the study’s early discontinuation procedure s indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4) and are to return 
for a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks ( ±6 days) after the last dose of study  drug.   
The investigator will promptly explain to the parent/guardian involved that the study will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return  for visits will be followed up by 
[CONTACT_2319], phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms.   
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for  one of these primary 
reasons:   AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, withdrawal of consent, or 
administrative/ other.  In addition to the primary reason, the subject may indicate  one or more 
second ary reason (s) for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be collected on

and concomitant therapy with carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, lamotrigine, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], primidone, zonisamide, levetiracetam and primidone ) 
on perampanel PK will be evaluated.  A 2-compartment disposition PK model  with line ar 
elimination  will be parameterized for absorption rate , oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent 
central and peripheral volumes of distribution (V
1/F and V 2/F).  Derived exposure parameters 
such as the steady state peak concentration (C max,ss), area under concentration vs time curve at 
steady state (AUC ss), and average steady -state drug concentration (C ss,av) will be calculated 
using the individual posterior estimates of PK parameters from the final PK model .  Descriptive 
statistics of the individual model -predicted PK parameters including but not limited (C max,s s 
will be provided. 
Due to the small sample size, population PK analysis will be performed using NONMEM with 
first- order conditional estimation with interaction  on data from this study pooled with existing 
rich data from 19 Phase 1 studies  and sparse data from  two Phase 2 studies (232 and 235), and 
5 Phase 3 Studies (304, 305, 306, 332 and 335).  A 2-compartment PK model will be fitted to 
the data and the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including body weight and age, on the PK of perampanel will be evaluated. The post -hoc estimates of both, maximum observed 
concentration ( C
max) and AUC from the final PK mode will be derived for all subjects.  
Subsequently, dose -normali zed derived exposure parameters will be summarised descriptively 
by [CONTACT_551] (≤  6 months, > 6 to ≤ 12 months, >12 to < 24 months, ≥ 24 months to ≤4 years,

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses  
Evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set. 
EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
Duration of Treatment Phase (Titration Period + Maintenance Period) exposure will be calculated as the number of days between the date the subject received the first dose of study 
drug and the date the subject received the last dose of study drug in the Treatment Phase.  
Overall study compliance rate for each subject will be calculated as the mean compliance rate 
over all the visits.  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
The AE verbatim descriptions ( investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be coded to the MedDRA (Version 16.1 or higher) lower 
level term ( LLT) closest to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term ( PT) and 
primary system organ class ( SOC) are also captured in the database.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment 
(Baseline) or  
• Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment ( Baseline) but stopped 
before treatment, or  
• Worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. 
Only those AEs that  are treatment -emergent will be included in summary table s.  All AEs, 
treatment- emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listing s. 
The TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_807345]- EIAED .  The incidence 
of TEAEs will be reporte d as the number ( percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_10666].  A subject will be counted only once within a n SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced 
more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number ( percentage) of subjects with

TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764] ( mild, moderate, or severe).  
Adverse events of special interest will also be summarized by [CONTACT_807347].  
A subject data listing will be produced for all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuation due to an AE. 
Adverse events will be summarized using  the Safety Analysis Set.   
LABORATORY VALUES  
Laboratory results will be summarized using Système International (SI) units, as appropriate.  
For all quantitative parameters listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS], the actual value and the change from 
baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined as the last on -treatment 
value) will be summarized by [CONTACT_807348].  Qualitative 
parameters listed in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be sum marized using frequencies ( number and 
percentage of subjects), and changes from baselin e to each postbaseline  visit and to end of 
treatment will be reported using shift table s.  Percentages will be based on the number of 
subjects with both nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline results. Laboratory test results will be assigned a low/normal/high ( LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below ( L), within ( N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference 
range.  Within- treatment comparisons for each laboratory parameter will be based on 3 -by-3 
table s (shift table s) that compare the baseline LNH classification to the LNH classification at 
each postbaseline visit and at the end of treatment.  Similar shift table s will also compare the 
baseline LNH classification to the LNH classification for the highest and lowest value during 
the treatment period. 
Appendix 1 ( Sponsor’s Grading for Laboratory Values) presents the criteria that will be used 
to identify subjects with treatment- emergent mark edly abnormal laboratory values ( TEMAV s).  
Except for phosphate, a TEMAV is defined as a postbaseline value with an increase from 
baseline to a grade of [ADDRESS_1114826] may be counted once in the laboratory parameter high and in the laboratory parameter low categories, as applicable.

9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Study E2007-G000- 238 will use population PK modeling to determine PK in pediatrics ≥1 to 
<24 months and from 2 to less than 4 years of age and compare these data to PK in adolescents  
and adults.  In Study E2007-G000-232, data were obtained in 42 pediatric subjects ≥ 2 to 
<12 years  of age , with approximate equal numbers enrolled in the age ranges of ≥2 to ≤ 6 and 
≥7 to <12 years .  (revised per Amendment 02)

 Appendix 3  Extension Phase 
Eligibility Criteria  
Subjects who meet the following will be eligible to participate in the Extension Phase of this 
study: 
• Have completed the last visit of the Maintenance Period of the Core Study 
Study Design and Plan  
During the 32-36- week Maintenance Period of the Extension Phase, subjects will continue 
taking perampanel oral suspension, at the dose level achieved at the end of the Treatment Phase.  The maximum total daily dose a subject will be allowed is [ADDRESS_1114843] of the active ingredient, perampanel, and assorted 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (all of which are considered appropriate for use in a pediatric population) suspended in a water -based medium.  The resulting suspension is opaque and practically white.  The 
formulation of perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension will be pr ovided by [CONTACT_807353] .  
Perampanel is a Schedule III Controlled Substance in the [LOCATION_002] and will be labeled as such for US sites.  
Perampanel oral suspension will be provided by [CONTACT_807331] -approved vendor in 400- mL 
PET bottles containing [ADDRESS_1114844] the bottles, suitably sized dosing devices (ie, oral syringes), and appropriately sized bottle adapters for accurate aliquotting (ie, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807297]) into a tamper- evident sealed carton,  and ship them 
to the study sites. During the Extension Phase, parents/guardians will be provided with a bottle or bottles of suspension that can be redispensed or replaced at the next visit.   Each bottle 
provided will be in a tamper -evident sealed carton that will also contain oral syringes and 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807297] .  Instructions regarding routine dosage s during the Extension Phase  will be provided by 
[CONTACT_779]. 
Treatments Administered  
• Maintenance Period (32-36 weeks) :  Subjects will continue taking perampanel oral 
suspension, at the dose level achieved at the end of the Treatment Phase.  The maximum 
total daily dose a subject will be allowed is 12  mg for non-EIAED  subjects or 16 mg 
for EIAED  subjects. 
Dose adjustment during this phase is allowed if necessary, per the investigator’s clinical judgment.  Subjects must return to the clinic for an unscheduled visit for any dose increase.  However, dose decreases can be done via telephone.

 All dose adjustments during this phase will be done by [CONTACT_807354].  Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of  0.5 mg/day will be discontinued from the 
study. 
Changes of concomitant AEDs (addition, deletion or adjustment in dose) will be 
allowed. However, if changes do occur subjects should be carefully monitored, 
especially when switching between an EIAED  and a non- EIAED . 
• Follow- Up Period (4 weeks) :  No study drug will  be administered during Follow -up 
Period.  All subjects will be required to complete the Follow -up Period after their last 
dose in the Extension Phase, except for subjects who switch to commercially available perampanel or who enter EAP upon completion of study treatment. For these subjects, sites will conduct a telephone contact 28 (+6) days after t he last dose of study drug to 
follow adverse events ( AEs) and report any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that occur 
within [ADDRESS_1114845] study drug administration.  (revised per Amendment 02)

 EXTENSION PHASE STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_36613]. Statistical programming 
and analyses will be performed using SAS and/or other validated software. 
DEMOGRAPHICS  
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized.  For continuous variables ( eg, 
age, weight) the number of non- missing values, median, mean, standard deviation (SD), and 
minimum and maximum will be displayed. For categorical variables ( eg, gender, ethnicity) the 
counts and proportions of each value will be tabulated. A
NALYSIS OF EFFICACY  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Extension Phase with the following:  
• Seizure Frequency:  Percentag e change in 28- day seizure frequency in the Extension Phase 
compared to baseline.  The primary analysis will use data prospectively collected during 
the 2- week Pretreatment Phase to calculate baseline 28 -day seizure frequency.  A 
secondary analysis will us e data prospectively collected during the 2- week Pretreatment 
Phase plus data ret rospectively collected during the 4 week period before  Visit 1 to 
calculate baseline 28 -day seizure frequency.  (revised per Amendment 02) 
• Responder Rate:  A responder is defined as a subject with a 50% decrease in 28 -day seizure 
frequency during the Extension Phase when compared to baseline .  The responder rate will 
be summarized.  Analyses using the 2 different baseline definitions above wi ll be 
performed.

DVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be classified into standardized medical terminology from the verbatim description (investigator term) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_807355].  Verbatim description and MedDRA level terms, for all AEs will be contained in the data listings of the clinical study report for this protocol.  
The TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_807345]- EIAED groups.  The 
incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_3592].  A subject will be counted only once within an SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SO C and PT.  The number (percentage) of 
subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764] (mild, moderate, or severe)  and by [CONTACT_8792] (Yes [related] and No [not related]). 
Adverse events of special interest will also be summarized by [CONTACT_807356].  
A subject data listing will be produced for all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuation due to an AE. 
The number (percentage) of subjects with treatment -related TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_3592].  Treatment -related TEAEs include those events considered by [CONTACT_807346].  The number (percentage) of subjects with treatment -related 
TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764]  (mild, moderate, or severe).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as:  
• Adverse events that emerge during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
• Reemerge during treatment, having been present at Baseline but stopped prior to 
treatment

LABORATORY VALUES  
Clinical laboratory values will be evaluated for each laboratory parameter by [CONTACT_1130].  Descriptive summary statistics ( eg, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) 
for the laboratory parameters and changes from baseline (Visit  1) to the last visit in the 
Extension Phase (Follow-up Visit, Week 56) will be summarized by [CONTACT_13153]. 
Laboratory test results will be as signed a low/normal/high (LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference 
range.  Shift tables will be used to compare the baseline (Visit 1) LNH classification to the LNH clas sification at end of study. 
Clinical laboratory results post- baseline will be evaluated for markedly abnormal values. 
Appendix 1 presents the Sponsor’ s Grading for Laboratory Values that will be used to identify 
subjects with markedly abnormal laboratory values. For the incidence of markedly abnormal laboratory values, each subject may be counted once in the laboratory parameter value high 
and in the laboratory parameter low categories as applicable.  
V
ITAL SIGNS  
Vital sign values will be evaluated on an individual basis by [CONTACT_1130].  Abnormal vital sign values will be identified as those outside (above or below) the reference range, where appropriate.  Reference ranges for vital sign parameters will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol.  De scriptive summary statistics (eg , mean, standard deviation, m edian, 
minimum, maximum) for vital sign parameters and changes from baseline (Visit 2) to each visit and to the last visit in the Extension Phase (Follow - up Visit, Week 56) will be evaluated 
for each cohort and overall. 
ECG
 RESULTS  
For 12-l ead ECG parameters, changes from baseline (Visit 1) to the last visit in the Extension 
Phase (Follow -up Visit, Week 56) will be summarized for each cohort and overall. 
QTc (Q TcF) and PR variables will also be analyzed to include a summary of the following: 
• Number of subjects with QTc in the borderline or abnormal category (430- 450 ms ec, 
>450 ms ec, and >500 ms ec) during treatment, and

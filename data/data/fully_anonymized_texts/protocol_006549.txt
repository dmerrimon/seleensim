OVERALL  RATIONALE FOR  GLOBAL  PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  01: 
Bristol -Myers  Squibb (BMS)  has made a strategic decision  to terminate  the CA2096GE trial. This 
decision was not related to any safety concerns. Study recruitment has closed; treatment and 
follow -up of ongoing active participants will continue per Protocol Amendment 01. Changes 
implemented in this amendment aim to alleviate participant and site burden and include updates to sample collection, study procedures, and study design. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) co -primary endpoints, and secondary endpoints have been removed. 
Efficacy, patient- reported outcomes (PROs), and biomarker analyses will not be completed. 
Samples already collected for PK and immunogenicity assessments will be analyzed 
bioanalytically for nivolumab concentrations and anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) and reported as 
listings. Further collections for PK, ADAs, biomarkers, and PROs will be discontinued. Only safety assessments will be conducted.  
 
Changes were made to balance the frequency of clinic visits between Part [ADDRESS_1225570] assessments in the clinic  every  4 weeks  (Q4W), 
beginning on Cycle 5, Day 1. 
 
 
Other edits were made throughout the protocol to fix minor errors, add clarity, and improve consistency and alignment. The Summary was updated to reflect changes in the amendment.

1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Open Label, Randomized, Non- Inferiority Pharmacokinetic Study of 
Nivolumab Subcutaneous (Nivo  SC) Versus Intravenous (Nivo  IV) Administration  in Participants 
with Stage  IIIA/B/C/D or Stage IV Adjuvant Melanoma Following Complete Resection  
Brief  Title: A Pharmacokinetic Study of Nivolumab Subcutaneous vs Intravenous Administration 
in Participants with Stage IIIA/B/C/D or Stage IV Melanoma Following Complete Resection  
Rationale:  
Study CA2096GE is a Phase 3, open- label, randomized study of nivolumab administered 
subcutaneously versus intravenous (IV) administration  of nivolumab 
(Nivo) in participants  with resected  Stage  IIIA/B/C/D  or Stage  IV melanoma  in an adjuvant setting.  
Repeated  IV infusion  appointments require travel  to a clinic  or infusion  center,  time,  and resources 
and have physical and emotional impacts on patients.  For healthcare systems,  the preparation  and 
administration  of IV infusions require  time and resource  utilization.  Given  that the growing cancer 
population will increase the burden on healthcare resources, there is a need for more efficient 
treatment options, such as alternative routes of administration and new delivery technologies. 
The development of   aims to address the current and evolving burden of cancer and 
cancer  treatment  on patients,  caregivers,  health  care providers (HCPs),  and the healthcare  system.  
Overall Rationale for Protocol Amendment  [ADDRESS_1225575] been removed. Efficacy, patient -reported outcomes (PROs), and biomarker 
analyses will not be completed. Samples already collected for PK and immunogenicity 
assessments will be analyzed bioanalytically for nivolumab concentrations and anti- drug 
antibodies (ADAs) and reported as listings. Further collections for PK, ADAs, biomarkers, and PROs will be discontinued. Only safety assessments will be conducted.

 Overall Design:  
Study CA2096GE is a multicenter, open- label, Phase 3 study that will assess the safety and 
tolerability  of  vs Nivo IV in  participants  with completely  resected  Stage  IIIA/B/C/D 
or Stage IV melanoma  by [CONTACT_877121]  (AJCC)  8th edition. This  study is 
comprised of 2 arms: Arm A and Arm B.  
Per Protocol Amendment  01, PK co- primary  endpoints,  secondary  endpoints,  and Part  [ADDRESS_1225576] Protocol 
Amendment 01 changes, Part 1 is no longer 
hypothesis-driven, but rather  descriptive  in nature (Arm A and Arm B), with the primary  objective 
being safety and tolerability. 
• Arm A (n = 6): 
− 
 
  
 
• Arm B (n = 8): 
− Nivo  IV (BMS -936558) 240 mg Q2W  for Cycles  1 through 4. 
− Nivo  IV 480 mg every  4 weeks (Q4W)  Cycle  5 onwards for  up to a total of 52 weeks.  
− All dosing will be performed  in-clinic.  
 
Participants  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_64367]  (Stages IIIA/B  vs IIIC/D/IV) per AJCC 8th edition   
 
 
 
All participants will be treated until recurrence of disease, unacceptable toxicity, participant 
withdrawal of consent, death, or a maximum  of [ADDRESS_1225577].

 Number  of Participants:  
The trial has been  terminated.  14 participants  
randomized and treated  in the study with 6 participants  in Arm A and 8 participants  in Arm B. 
Study Population:  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01 (as of 24- Feb-2023, enrollment  in this study  has 
been closed).  
Male and female  participants ≥ 18 years  of age or age of majority  with completely  resected  Stage 
IIIA/B/C/D or Stage IV melanoma.  
Key I nclusion:  
• All participants must have been diagnosed with either Stage IIIA (> 1 mm tumor in lymph 
node)/B/C/D or Stage IV melanoma by [CONTACT_356654] 8th edition and have histologically confirmed melanoma  (as documented in the pathology report) that is completely  surgically  resected  (free 
of disease) with negative margins in order to be eligible. All melanomas, except uveal and mucosal melanoma, regardless of primary site of disease, will be allowed.  
• Participants are eligible if central nervous system (CNS) metastases have been resected and 
participants are neurologically stable.  
− Prior resected CNS metastases must be without evidence of  recurrence, as determined by 
[CONTACT_9252]  (MRI) performed  at least  4 weeks after resection  is complete 
and within 28 days prior to randomization (Part 1) 
− Participants must be off immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (>10 mg/day 
prednisone or equivalent) for at least [ADDRESS_1225579]-operatively. 
− For CNS  lesion(s),  a pathology report indicating that there  has been  complete resection  of 
CNS lesion(s) will suffice as confirmation of negative margins.  
• Complete  resection  must  be performed  within  12 weeks prior to randomization  (Part  1) 
Management of residual lymph nodes after positive sentinel 
lymph node biopsy (ie, completion lymph node dissection) will be as per local  standards and 
recommendations for the individual participant.  
• All participants  must  have  disease- free status  documented by a complete  physical examination 
within 14 days prior to randomization (Part 1)  and imaging 
studies within 28 days prior to randomization/treatment assignment. Imaging studies must include computed tomography (CT)  scan of the chest;  CT or MRI  scans of the abdomen, pelvis, 
and all known sites of resected disease; and brain MRI or CT (brain CT allowable if MRI is contraindicated).  
• Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
of ≤ 1.

 Key Exclusion:  
• History  of uveal  or mucosal melanoma.  
• Untreated/unresected  CNS  metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.  
• Participants with an  active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with type I 
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such 
as vitiligo, psoriasis,  or alopecia)  not requiring systemic treatment,  or conditions not  expected 
to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.  
• Participants  with serious or uncontrolled medical  disorders within  4 weeks  prior to screening.  
− Additionally, in the case of prior severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) infection, acute symptoms must have resolved and based on investigator 
assessment in consultation with the Medical Monitor, there are no sequelae that would place the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment.  
• Concurrent malignancy (present during screening) requiring treatment or history of prior 
malignancy active within 2 years prior to randomization (Part 1)  
(ie, participants with a history  of prior malignancy are eligible if treatment was completed 
at least 2 years before  randomization/treatment assignment and the patient has  no evidence of 
disease). Participants  with history  of prior early  stage  basal/squamous cell  skin cancer  or non- 
invasive or in situ cancers that have undergone definitive  treatment  at any time are also eligible.  
• Participants  with a condition requiring  systemic treatment  with either  corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) within 14 days or  other immunosuppressive medications within 
30 days of start of study treatment.  Inhaled  or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826],  and adrenal  replacement  steroid 
doses > 10 mg daily  prednisone equivalent, are permitted  in the absence of active autoimmune 
disease.  
• Any condition that according to investigator criteria makes a participant ineligible from 
participation in the study, including but not limited to medical conditions (including psychological, psychiatric), or social conditions; or conditions that can impact ability to comply with protocol requirements  (eg, conditions that preclude the use of IV or subcutaneous 
[SC]  route of study drug administration) or that can put the participant at risk. Participants  with 
history of self- harm including suicidal attempts will be excluded from the study.  
• Prior immunotherapy treatments  for any prior malignancies  are not permitted  (such  as, but not 
limited to anti -programmed death- 1, anti -programmed death- ligand 1, anti -programmed 
death -ligand 2, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T -cell co -stimulation or 
immune checkpoint pathways). 
• Participants treated with anti -cancer therapy directed against the resected melanoma (for 
example, but not limited to, systemic, local, radiation, and radiopharmaceuticals) except:  
• Surgery for the melanoma lesion(s)  
− Adjuvant radiation  therapy after neurosurgical resection for CNS  lesions  
− Prior adjuvant  interferon  completed  ≥ 6 months  prior  to randomization  (Part 1) 
 
• Treatment with any live attenuated vaccine within [ADDRESS_1225580] study  treatment (Vaccines 
that are not live attenuated are allowed, including COVID- 19 vaccines).  
• History  of allergy  or hypersensitivity  to study drug components

Statistical Methods  
• This is an open -label, parallel group study in which participants are randomized 1:1 to either 
of the 2 treatment groups: subcutaneous nivolumab or 
nivolumab administered intravenously. Randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_356654]  8th edition 
staging and weight.  
• The aim of the study is to assess the safety  and tolerability  of  and Nivo IV. This 
has changed from the original protocol’s study  objective of  PK. Sample size calculations are 
not based on statistical considerations. There were 14 participants randomized and treated at 
the time of Protocol Amendment 01.  
 
Data  Monitoring  Committee: Yes 
A safety  DMC will be implemented  in this study to provide safety  oversight throughout the course 
of Part [ADDRESS_1225581]-2022, enrollment  was paused  and a total of 14 participants 
had been randomized. On 24- Feb-2023, the study was terminated with no additional participants 
having been randomized. As this is an open- label study, the Sponsor will continue the safety 
monitoring of remaining participants in the study. No subsequent DMC meeting will occur. 
Other Committee: Yes 
A Study Steering  Committee  (SSC)  will be established  to provide  advisory oversight of the quality 
of the trial, with the objective of ensuring scientific integrity and the successful conduct of the CA2096GE Study. On 26-Oct-2022, enrollment was paused  and a total of [ADDRESS_1225582] of the study. No SSC meeting will occur.

Date: [ADDRESS_1225607] to both patients and the healthcare system. In 2018, an estimated 18.1 million 
new cases of cancer were diagnosed globally; however, by 2040, that number will increase by [CONTACT_726] 11 million, to approximately 29.5 million cancer cases.
1 
Globally, individuals and families  suffering  from cancer  endure significant  physical, financial,  and 
emotional strain.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 One of these burdens includes the treatment route of administration, 
which has largely been intravenous (IV) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Burdens associated with IV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_877094], healthcare providers (HCPs), and the healthcare system in a variety of ways. 
Repeated  IV infusion  appointments require travel  to a clinic  or infusion center,  time,  and resources 
and have physical and emotional impacts on patients. For healthcare  systems,  the preparation and 
administration  of IV infusions require  time and resource  utilization.  Given  that the growing cancer 
population will increase the burden on healthcare resources, there is a need for more efficient 
treatment options, such as alternative routes of administration and new delivery technologies. 
The development of nivolumab administered subcutaneously   aims 
to address  the current  and evolving burden of  cancer  and cancer  treatment  on patients, caregivers, 
HCPs, and the healthcare system.11 
• For patients,  potential advantages include the following:  
− Patients  prefer  subcutaneous (SC)  over IV administration  as this option provides  them  with 
more comfort and convenience 
− Time savings associated with shorter injection time, decreased wait times at infusion 
centers, and alleviating the travel time to clinics resulting in less disruption to patients’ daily lives  
− Obviating need for intravenous access (potential reduction in associated complications such as infections)  
− Potential to improve quality of life by [CONTACT_877125]  
• For HCPs,  Nivo  SC may reduce the patient  chair  time traditionally  needed for IV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• From the healthcare system perspective, Nivo SC may increase efficiencies for clinics, with 
r
educed  healthcare resource utilization for administration  (no IV  setup). Nivo  SC has reduced 
cost of care related  to physician  and pharmacy preparation, and administration  expenses.  This 
may also lead to improved access to treatment  in capacity -constrained  areas  or during times  of 
reduced healthcare resources, as currently seen with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  
• In addition to the above- mentioned  advantages  for Nivo  SC, for patients, nivolumab  SC 
 
could reduce the burden of treatment time, 
improve the drug administration experience, and offer flexibility and convenience.

and lines of  therapy including adjuvant treatment of melanoma.13,14 OPDIVO® is currently only 
available for administration via IV infusion.  
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) is committed to improving drug delivery of immuno -oncology

developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a SC formulation  of high  concentration nivolumab (BMS -986298) coformulated with 
a permeation enhancer (recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 enzyme [rHuPH20] Halozyme 
Therapeutics Inc.) to offer an alternative administration route for nivolumab delivery. SC 
nivolumab can be administered  via manual injection  (vial and syringe) by a trained  HCP.  rHuPH20 
is a transiently active, locally acting permeation -enhancing enzyme, which enhances the 
permeation  of large  volumes of SC-administered fluid,  allowing for  reduced  administration  times 
and has been approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration for use with 
other monoclonal antibodies, including HyQvia, Rituxan HYCELA, Herceptin HYLECTA, DARZALEX Faspro, and PHESGO™. 
The coformulated drug product (DP) nivolumab + rHuPH20 administered subcutaneously by a 
trained  HCP  in clinic  is being formally  evaluated  for pharmacokinetics (PK)  and efficacy 
non-inferiority compared to Nivo IV as part of another ongoing protocol, CA20967T, in 
participants with advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  
As ongoing research with nivolumab continues with new combination regimens across multiple tumor types and different lines of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the approval of nivolumab SC, as vial & syringe manual injection for use in ambulatory clinic  (would provide therapeutic 
alternatives to intravenous delivery and meet the needs of a diverse patient population across different lines of therapy. Once approved, the vial and syringe option for SC administration will 
provide greater convenience and flexibility for patients.

3.2 Background  
Melanoma accounts for less than 5% of all skin cancers;  however, it causes the greatest  number of 
skin cancer -related deaths worldwide.15 There were 325,000 new cases of melanoma of  the skin 
diagnosed in 2020, which represented 1.7% of global cancer diagnoses.[ADDRESS_1225609] 
common initial sites of distance metastases are the non -visceral (skin, subcutaneous tissue, and 
lymph nodes), which are recurrence sites for 42% to 59% of participants in various studies. 
Visceral locations are the lung, brain, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and bone; the visceral sites are the initial sites of relapse in approximately 25% of all patients diagnosed with melanoma who experience recurrence.  Early  melanoma  detection  followed  by [CONTACT_877126]. 
In contrast, advanced melanoma frequently usually has poor prognosis. 
The disease course for melanoma has fundamentally changed with the introduction of 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_877095] T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) and 
programmed death -1 (PD -1) checkpoints as  well  as BRAF  and MEK  inhibitors.  Such  agents have 
dramatically improved outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma.  
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_598593], opportunities exist to continue enhancing patient treatment outcomes and quality of life. 
3.2.1 Adjuvant  Treatment  of Stage III/IV Melanoma  
CA209238, a Phase 3, randomized double -blind study evaluating Nivo IV 3 mg/kg (n = 453) 
versus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_877096] 10 mg/kg (n = 453) in participants  with Stage  IIIB/C  or Stage  IV melanoma 
who were at high risk of  recurrence following complete surgical  resection. Participants  receiving 
nivolumab had superior 12- month recurrence -free survival (RFS) rate of 70.5% (95% CI, 66.1 to 
74.5), as compared to 60.8% in participants receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (95% CI, 56.0 to 65.2).
18 
In CA209238, participants  were  included based  on American  Joint Committee  on Cancer  (AJCC) 
7th edition. AJCC  8th edition  (see Appendix 9) was implemented  on 01- Jan-2018. The participant 
data from CA209238 were reviewed using the new staging classification and it was determined 
that some  Stage  IIIB  participants  who  were  T1bN1a and T1bN2a in  the 7th  edition  would now be 
mapped as Stage IIIA in the 8th edition, and some Stage IIIA participants would be classified as 
Stage  IIIB  (T3a  N1–2a), suggesting IIIA  participants  can be considered  reasonable candidates for 
trial. Furthermore, with a [ADDRESS_1225610] recently, data from Phase 3, randomized, double -bl ind study CA209915 (which included 
control arm of Nivo  IV administered  480 mg every  4 weeks [Q4W])  support the activity  of flat

with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W  was consistent  with the originally  assessed  Q2W  weight- based  dose 
in CA209238. 
Additionally, nivolumab adjuvant therapy was efficacious regardless of programmed death 
ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression status  across adjuvant melanoma  trials.  The results from these studies 
further support the choice of adjuvant melanoma in CA2096GE. Moreover, among all the solid tumors, malignant melanoma occurrence is one of  the highest in the younger patient populations 
and notably is the second  most common  cancer  in young women  < 30 years of age  in the United  
States  of America ([LOCATION_003]).

These data supported the global approval of nivolumab IV for  adjuvant treatment of melanoma.  
3.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism  of Action  
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558, MDX1106, or ONO -4538) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] -S228P) that targets the programmed death -1 
(PD-1) cluster  of differentiation  279 (CD279) cell  surface membrane  receptor.  PD-1 is a negative 
regulatory  molecule  expressed  by [CONTACT_93247]  T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its  ligands, 
programmed death  ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results  in the downregulation of lymphocyte 
activation.  Inhibition of the interaction  between  PD-1 and its ligands promotes  immune  responses 
and antigen- specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self -antigens. 
Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using standard 
mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical study 
product is a sterile solution for parenteral administration.  
Nivolumab (OPDIVOTM) is approved for the treatment of several types of cancer in multiple 
regions including the [LOCATION_002] (US, Dec -2014), the European Union (EU, Jun -2015), and 
Japan (Jul -2014). 
3.2.3 Nivolumab Clinical Activity  
Beyond nivolumab activity in the adjuvant treatment of Stage III/IV melanoma, nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding [ADDRESS_1225611] of care in patients with advanced  or metastatic  NSCLC,  unresectable or metastatic melanoma,  advanced RCC,  or recurrent 
or metastatic SCCHN. Details of  the clinical activity in these various malignancies are provided

 3.2.4 Recombinant  Human Hyaluronidase PH20  Enzyme (rHuPH20)  
rHuPH20 is a glycosylated 447- amino acid single -chain recombinant human polypeptide that 
depolymerizes hyaluronan in the SC space locally  at the site of injection.  Hyaluronan is a repeating 
polymer of N -acetyl -glucosamine and glucuronic acid that contributes to the soluble gel -like 
component of the extracellular matrix of the skin.  
Depolymerization of hyaluronan by [CONTACT_350767]20 results in a transient reduction in the viscosity of 
the gel -like phase of  the extracellular matrix and increased hydraulic conductance that facilitates 
the dispersion  and absorption  of injected  drugs (see rHuPH20  Investigator’s  Brochure [IB]).20 Use 
of rHuPH20  enables the delivery  of large  volumes of liquid into  the SC space (approximately 2 to 
20 mL), decreasing dose administration times.

 3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Extensive details  on the safety  profile  of nivolumab are available  in the IB and will not be repeated 
herein.  
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is manageable and generally consistent 
across completed  and ongoing clinical  trials  with no maximum tolerated  dose reached  at any dose 
tested  up to 10 mg/kg. Most  AEs were  low-grade (Grade  1 to 2) with relatively  few related 
high- grade  (Grade  3 to 4) AEs.  There  was no pattern  in the incidence,  severity,  or causality  of AEs 
with respect to nivolumab dose level. 
A pattern  of immune -related adverse events has been defined, for which management algorithms 
have been  developed; these are provided in Appendix 7. Most  high- grade  events were  manageable 
with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed 
in these algorithms.  
Additional details on the safety  profile  of nivolumab, including results  from other clinical  studies, 
are also available in the nivolumab IB (Nivo SC and Nivo IV). 
In safety data from CA2098KX, SC nivolumab showed a safety profile that was similar to the 
safety profile observed in the nivolumab monotherapy program. 
SC administration of rHuPH20 alone or in combination with biological products was generally 
well-tolerated in all clinical study populations. Most AEs were mild, transient injection site 
reactions including erythema, pain, bruising, pruritus, burning, tenderness, edema, induration, 
irritation,  paresthesia,  numbness, and rash.  Moderate injection  site reactions,  which  were  reported 
less frequently, include burning, erythema, pain, and numbness. Mild- to-moderate  headache was 
also commonly reported. 
AEs have otherwise generally  reflected  the adverse reaction  profiles  of the coadministered  drug or 
have been  associated  with the rapid introduction of a relatively large  volume of fluid into the SC 
space. The individual  doses ranged from [ADDRESS_1225612] single dose of 96,000 U, AEs were predominantly mild injection site reactions; there 
were  no deaths,  SAEs,  or discontinuations due to AEs.[ADDRESS_1225613] been associated with positive binding or neutralizing

3.3.2 Benefit Assessment  
This study will also investigate recurrence -free survival in Stage III/IV completely resected 
melanoma participants. Currently, nivolumab monotherapy is an approved option for adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma in many countries.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_877097], there  is a need  to improve patient  quality of life in cancer  care. 
In addition to the benefits of nivolumab to potentially improve RFS and overall survival (OS), participants would benefit from the use of  the SC route of administration and the convenience of 
self-administration  of nivolumab coformulated with rHuPH20.  
3.3.3 Nivolumab Overall  Benefit/Risk  Conclusion 
The Sponsor will evaluate the benefit/risk  profile  of the study on an ongoing basis.  This evaluation 
will be based  on all available  data with particular attention  to 
safety  trends in  this 
or any other clinical study of BMS -986298 or BMS -936558 whose severity and/or frequency 
suggest that participants would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury.

 5.1.3 Follow -Up Period  
Safety  Follow -up will begin after the Treatment  Period, when  the participant has completed  up to 
52 weeks of treatment or discontinues study treatment for any reason  (see Section  8.1).  The Safety 
Follow-up Period  consists of 2 Follow -up Visits:  Visit  1 (to occur  30 days [± 7 days] from  date of 
last treatment dose) and Visit 2 (to occur  100 days [± 7 days] from date of last treatment dose). All 
adverse events (AEs)/serious  adverse  events (SAEs)  (including  AEs/SAEs  related  to severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 [SARS -CoV- 2]) should be collected continuously using 
National Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common  Technical  Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 
5 (v5) during the Safety Follow-up. 
Beyond the [ADDRESS_1225623] dose of study therapy, participants will be followed for all 
drug- related AEs/SAEs until AE resolves, returns to baseline, is deemed irreversible, until the 
participant is lost to follow -up, or withdraws study consent. 
Beyond the [ADDRESS_1225624] dose of study treatment, all AEs/SAEs associated with confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1225625] to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). For suspected cases, 
participants  should be followed  until SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1225626] surveillance assessments until recurrence of disease or study discontinuation as per the Schedule of Activities, Section 2 . 
Surveillance assessments should not be delayed until the planned follow-up visits. 
5.1.4 Data  Monitoring Committee  and Other  Committees  
Data  Monitoring  Committee: A safety  DMC will be implemented  in this study to provide safety 
oversight throughout the course of Part [ADDRESS_1225627]-2022, enrollment  was 
paused and a total of 14 participants had been randomized. On 24- Feb-2023, the study was 
terminated  with no additional participants having been  randomized. As this is an open- label  study, 
the Sponsor will continue the safety monitoring of remaining participants in the study. No subsequent DMC meeting will occur.  
Study Steering Committee: A Study Steering Committee (SSC) will be established to provide a
dvisory oversight of  the quality of the trial, with  the objective of ensuring scientific  integrity  and 
the successful conduct of the CA2096GE Study. On 26- Oct-2022, enrollment was paused and a 
total of [ADDRESS_1225628] of the study. No SSC meeting will occur.

interferon therapy, usually ranging between 1 and 1.5 years throughout the world. In order to minimize  toxicity  leading  to discontinuation of study drug while  maintaining expected  efficacy  of 
the study drug, the decision was reached to limit the duration of study therapy of nivolumab on CA2096GE to 1- year maximum duration. This is supported by [CONTACT_877128]209238, which was 
approved for nivolumab as adjuvant treatment of melanoma.  
5.4.2 Rationale for Part 1 Endpoints and Non-Inferiority  Margin  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
PK co -primary endpoints for Part 1 of this study are Cavgd28 and Cminss. The co- primary 
endpoints would help to establish PK non- inferiority between the 2 different routes of 
administration  (SC  and IV). The use of co-primary  PK endpoints will provide data on exposure 
to nivolumab at different  time points during treatment.  Cavgd28 is the time-averaged  concentration 
over the first [ADDRESS_1225631] 
been selected to adequately characterize the co -primary PK endpoints (Cavgd28 and Cminss) 
while minimizing the burden to patients and HCPs. 
Non-inferiority  
 of  to Nivo  IV will be  concluded if the lower  limit  of the 2- sided  90% 
CIs for the ratio of  geometric means for  nivolumab (SC vs IV) Cavgd28 and Cminss is  not lower 
than 0.8; as this criterion is consistent with regulatory advice. 
Non-inferior  PK exposures at early  and late time points, particularly  when  the dose administration 
is given  by [CONTACT_2299] (instead  of HCP),  ensure effective  drug levels  are maintained  over time 
and provide pharmacologic surrogate of disease control similar to approved Nivo IV.

5.4.6 Rationale for Inclusion of Clinical Outcome Assessments/PROs (Part  1) 
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
The evaluation of clinical outcomes assessments (COAs) such as patient -reported outcomes 
(PROs) is  an increasingly  important aspect  of clinical  efficacy  and safety  in oncology trials. Such 
data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from the participant’s perspective and 
offer insights into patient experience that may not be captured through physician reporting. Additionally, generic health -related quality of life (HRQoL) measures provide data needed for 
calculating utility values to inform health economic models.  
To explore overall participant self -confidence with SC injection the Self -Confidence domain of 
the Self -Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) will be used in the Part 1 Arm A (SC arm) 
only. Participant satisfaction with route  of administration  (IV versus SC) will be assessed using a 
modified version of the Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), namely the Satisfaction with Cancer Therapy domain. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General 7 item version (FACT -G7) will be used to evaluate HRQoL. The FACT -G7 has been 
shown to be a valid, reliable, and rapid measure for monitoring symptoms and concerns in oncology practice and research.  A modified  version of  the Treatment Administration Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (TASQ)  will be used to assess Satisfaction,  Physical  Impact,  Psychological Impact, 
Impact on Activities of Daily Living, and Convenience between IV and SC Routes of Administration. The EuroQol -5 Dimension -5 Level (EQ -5D- 5L) will be used for economic 
evaluations and overall health status. 
5.4.[ADDRESS_1225632] been  extensively studied  and defined  in prior 
clinical trials and are not expected to differ based on route of administration or delivery  systems, 
(when not considering injection site reactions or procedure related AEs) as further demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_877129], CA2098KX; therefore, an 
open- label approach is justified. In addition, the technical challenges associated with blinding 
favor the open- label  design. The BMS  study team  will not conduct aggregate analyses by [CONTACT_877130]-specified database locks (Sponsor blind approach).

5.5.2  Rationale for Dosing Regimen - Intravenous (Arm  B) 
Nivolumab monotherapy was originally approved as a body weight -based dose of 3 mg/kg IV 
Q2W and was recently updated to flat -dosing regimens of 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W in 
multiple  indications. For this study, the selected  dose of 240 mg via IV Q2W  is per dose/schedule 
approved for this patient population. In addition, there is extensive PK, safety, and efficacy data 
available at  this dose across multiple tumors and dosing regimens. Global  development with flat 
doses of nivolumab are  ongoing in a  broad range of clinical  trials in a variety  of additional tumor 
types. Based  on the aforementioned nivolumab [ADDRESS_1225633] recently,  data  from the comparator arm  in study 
CA209915 support that the activity of flat dose (480 mg IV Q4W) nivolumab performs similarly 
to the originally assessed 3 mg/kg IV Q2W dosing schedule in study CA209238. 
Additional details on nivolumab posologies and risk- benefit can be found in the BMS -936558

In order to mitigate participant burden, a switch from Q2W to Q4W will occur after Cycle 5 for 
participants  in Arm B receiving  IV nivolumab. Cycle  5 has been  selected  as the time for the switch 
as it was the time at which  the primary  endpoints in the original study design  were  being collected.

 5.5.5 Rationale for Continued Adjuvant  Therapy for Participants Who  Are 
Diagnosed with Melanoma in Situ During Study Treatment  
Malignant melanoma in situ (MMIS) Stage 0 includes Tis, N0, M0, demonstrates a radial  growth 
phase in which the proliferation of malignant melanocytes is confined to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. Patients 
with a new Stage  0 melanoma are at minimal risk from that new tumor.  The risk of death  develops 
from advanced Stage IIIB/C/D or Stage IV melanoma for which they are receiving treatment during the clinical trial. Opdivo (nivolumab) is approved for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. Consequently, in the absence of intolerable toxicity, patients with diagnosed MMIS should continue adjuvant therapy using the same dose and schedule for their original melanoma for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1225634] dose  (maximum  of 
13 doses). Melanoma in situ will not be considered a new primary malignancy. 
5.5.6 Safety/IMG with SC  Nivolumab +  rHuPH20  
In the Phase 1/2 CA2098KX study, the safety profile of Q2W and Q4W nivolumab SC 
monotherapy in participants with advanced/metastatic cancer was evaluated. The preliminary 
review  of the study safety  data showed that nivolumab SC vial and syringe across all studied doses 
was safe, tolerable, and manageable with an AE profile consistent with nivolumab when administered via IV.  
• Sixty -seven participants in Part A (Group 1) and Part B (Group 2, 3, 4) received 1 SC 
nivolumab dose (720 mg or 960 mg) with or without rHuPH20 followed by [CONTACT_877131]. 
Upon selection of  the dose, 28 of  these participants who were still  on study at the time of the 
amendment, transitioned to SC nivolumab 1,200 mg + rHuPH20 Q4W (Part C) 
• Thirty -six participants in Part D  received SC nivolumab dose of 1,200 mg + rHuPH20 Q4W 
from the beginning of therapy  
• Thirty -six participants  in Part E received  SC nivolumab dose of 600 mg + rHuPH20  Q2W from 
the beginning of therapy 
 
Part A/B : Participants received single -dose SC nivolumab, either 720 mg (with or without 
rHuPH20) or 960 mg (with  or without rHuPH20): The safety  data from single-dose SC nivolumab 
followed by [CONTACT_24636] (Cycle 2+) included treatment- related AEs and SAEs previously reported within 
the Nivo  IV IB with the exception of SC local  reactions.
[ADDRESS_1225635]  to local  AEs reported with 
SC injection, the local site reactions were low incidence, of low grade, and manageable. 
Part C (transitioning to 1,200 mg + rHuPH20 from prior single -dose SC and IV): Interpretation 
of treatment -related  AEs in Part C was difficult  and clear  attribution  of systemic treatment- related 
AEs to SC nivolumab (vs IV) was not possible given switching  between  formulations  and the long 
half-life of nivolumab. 
Of the 28 participants  that transitioned  from Part A/B to Part C, any Grade  AEs after transitioning 
to SC  nivolumab were  reported  in 26 (93%) participants. Treatment -related  AEs were  reported in 
16 (57%) participants  after transitioning to  Part C, all of which were  Grade  1 to 2. In the majority 
of participants,  low-grade treatment- related  AEs were  reported  in the general disorders  and

 administration site conditions and skin and subcutaneous disorders SOCs. Within the general 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC, there were 3 (33.3%), 2 (33.3%), 3 (60.0%), and 1 (12.5%) participants that were  reported with low -grade  treatment- related  AEs in  Groups 1, 
2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Within  the skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC,  there  were  2 (22.2%),  
1 (16.7%), 0 (0.0%), and 1 (12.5%) participants that were reported with low -grade treatment - 
related AEs in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. No participants were reported  to develop new 
or worsening Grade  3 or higher treatment -related  AEs,  and there  were  no reported 
treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation or death. 
Part  D (1,200 mg + rHuPH20): Any grade AEs were  reported  in all 36 participants,  of these  there 
were 17 (47.2%) reports of Grade 3 to 4 AEs and 4 (11.1%) reports  of Grade 5 AEs. Any grade 
treatment- related AEs were reported in 28 (77.8%) participants; of these there were 6 (16.7%) 
reports of Grade 3 to 4 treatment -related  AEs. Treatment -related  SAEs  were reported  in 3 (8.3%) 
participants, all were Grade 3 to 4. In the majority of participants, treatment -related AEs were 
reported in the general disorders and administration site conditions, skin and subcutaneous 
disorders, and endocrine disorders SOCs. Within the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC, there were 16 (44.4%) participants that were reported with low -grade  
treatment- related AEs. Within the skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC, there were 12 (33.3%) 
participants  that were  reported with low-grade treatment- related  AEs,  of these there  were  3 (8.3%) 
reports of Grade 3 to 4 treatment -related AEs. Within the endocrine disorders SOC, there were  
10 (27.8%) participants  that were  reported  with low-grade treatment -related  AEs.  Of the reported 
treatment- related AEs, 4 participants (11.1%) were reported with AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. There was no reported treatment -related AE leading to death. No dose -related 
safety  concerns were noted. Results to date suggest that SC nivolumab with rHuPH20 is safe and 
well-tolerated, which supports further clinical investigation.  
Part E (600 mg + rHuPH20): In 36 participants, any grade AEs were reported in 27 (75.0%) 
participants;  of these there  were  10 (27.8%) reports  of Grade  3 to 4 AEs,  and 1 (2.8%) report of a 
Grade 5 AE. Any grade treatment -related AEs were reported in 20 (55.6%) participants; of  these 
there  were  3 (8.3%) reports  of Grade  3 to 4 treatment -related  AEs. There  was 1 (2.8%) report of a 
treatment- related  SAE  of Grade  3 to 4. In the majority  of participants,  treatment -related  AEs were 
reported in the skin and subcutaneous disorders and general disorders and administration site conditions SOCs. Within the skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC, there were 10 (27.8%) participants  that were  reported  with low-grade treatment- related  AEs.  Within  the general disorders 
and administration  site conditions SOC,  there  were  9 (25.0%) participants that were  reported  with 
low-grade treatment -related AEs. There were no reported treatment -related AEs leading to 
discontinuation or death. 
Across treatment groups, ADAs were reported with nivolumab (BMS -98
 6298) with and without 
rHuPH20 similar to what has been reported with the IV formulation. In Part C, 15 out of 67 
participants had positive treatment- emergent ADA for nivolumab (7 out of 22 [31.8%]) 
participants  in the nivolumab  720 mg with rHuPH20 group, 5 out of 18 (27.8%) participants in the 
nivolumab 720 mg without  rHuPH20  group, and 3 out of  10 (30%) participants in  the nivolumab 
960 mg with rHuPH20  group; there  was no treatment- emergent ADAs in the 17  participants  who

5.6 Clinical  Pharmacology Summary  
5.6.1 Clinical Pharmacology of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK)  was assessed  using a population PK approach for single- agent 
nivolumab.  
Nivolumab as a single agent: The PK of single -agent nivolumab was studied in patients over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple  doses of nivolumab as 
a 60- minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3 weeks. Nivolumab clearance (CL) decreases over 
time,  with a mean maximal  reduction  (% coefficient of  variation  [CV%])  from baseline values of 
24.5% (47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady- state clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h 
(53.9%) in patients with metastatic tumors; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. Nivolumab clearance does not decrease over time in patients with completely resected melanoma, as the geometric mean population clearance is 24% lower in this patient population compared  with patients with metastatic melanoma at steady -state.  The geometric  mean  volume of 
distribution at steady -state (Vss)  (CV%)  is 6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric  mean  elimination  half- life 
(t1/2) is 25  days (77.5%). Steady- state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks 
when administered at 3  mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was 3.7- fold. The 
exposure to nivolumab increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered  every  2 weeks.  The predicted  exposure (Cavg and Cmax)  of nivolumab after a 
30-minute infusion is comparable to that observed with a 60-minute infusion. 
Specific Populations: The population PK analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect  on the clearance of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years),  weight (35 to 160 
kg), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD -L1 expression, solid tumor type, tumor size, renal 
impairment, and mild hepatic impairment.  
Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was evaluated 
by a population PK analysis in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m
2), moderate 
(eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function.  
Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was 
evaluated  by [CONTACT_877132] -986298  CA2096GE

impairment (TB greater  than 1.5 to  3× ULN and any AST).  No clinically  important differences  in

concentrations of rHuPH20  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_877098],  with a very short  t1/2 (≤ 10.4 minutes) and the plasma 
concentration  became undetectable (< 0.03 ng/mL) within  1.5 hours after the end of the IV infusion 
for IV doses of 10,000 or 30,000 units of rHuPH20.38 
As of Dec-2022, 1,592 participants  were  exposed  to HYLENEX and other rHuPH20  DPs in 
30 clinical studies conducted under Investigational  New Drug  66,888 or in postmarketing  Phase 4 
studies. In these studies, the maximum duration of exposure was 12 weeks, and individual doses 
ranged from 15  U to 96,000 U rHuPH20.  In partnered  trials  with co -administered  therapeutics,  
more  t han 9,000 participants  were  exposed.20

was conducted using 10,000 U or 30,000 U of rHuPH20 in healthy volunteer participants. All but 
2 Halozyme studies were  conducted in adult populations; pediatric  exposure (< 18 years of age) in 
2 clinical studies included 139 participants with mild -to-moderate dehydration who received SC 
infusions of isotonic fluids. 
Across all studies, SC injections  of rHuPH20  were  generally well tolerated  in healthy participants,

or co-administered  with lactated  Ringer’s,  normal saline,  co-injected  drugs (morphine, ceftriaxone, 
insulin, and insulin analogues), or biologic products (immunoglobulin G and adalimumab) have 
been well tolerated in all clinical trials. Most AEs were mild, transient injection -site reactions, 
including erythema, pain, bruising, pruritus, burning, tenderness, edema, induration, irritation, paresthesia, numbness, and rash. Moderate injection -site reactions, which have occurred less 
frequently,  included burning, erythema,  pain, and numbness. Mild -to-moderate headache was also 
commonly reported. AEs in these trials have otherwise generally reflected the adverse reaction profiles of the co- administered drug or have been associated with the rapid introduction of a 
relatively large volume of fluid into the SC space.  
Antibodies to rHuPH20 have been evaluated in several nonclinical and clinical studies. To date, no clinical  signs or symptoms have been  associated  with positive binding or neutralizing  antibodies 
titers in clinical trials with rHuPH20 and no confirmed rHuPH20 -neutralizing antibody activity 
has been  detected.  In addition  to these  studies, a large  clinical safety  database  exists for  rHuPH20 
as a tissue permeability  enhancer  co-administered  with several  approved products in the US and/or 
Europe (European Union), including: 
• DARZALEX FASPRO ™ (daratumumab  and hyaluronidase- fihj); 
• PHESGO ™ (pertuzumab,  trastuzumab,  and hyaluronidase- zzxf;  US only);  
• HYQVIA®  (Immune  Globulin Infusion 10% [Human] with rHuPH20);

6.4.1 Retesting During Screening- in Period  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01 (enrollment  closed).  
Participant Re -enrollment: This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant who has 
discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, participant has not been randomized/has not 
been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be re -consented.  
A participant who is a pre- treatment  failure  in Part 1 (participant has not been  randomized/has not 
been treated)  
If re-enrolled, the participant must be re-consented and assigned  a new participant 
number.  
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening period will be permitted (in addition to any  parameters that require a confirmatory value).  
The most current result prior to randomization (Part 1)  is the value 
by [CONTACT_109419], because it represents the participant’s most current clinical state.  
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2 -1, Screening Procedural 
Outline, and Section 9.4.4, may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well -qualified 
participants. Consultation with the Medical Monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular parameter is clinically relevant.  
Testing
 for asymptomatic  SARS -CoV-2  infection,  for example  by [CONTACT_877134] -polymerase chain  reaction  (RT-PCR)  or viral antigen is not required. However,  some 
participants may develop suspected or confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1225644] asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 infection during the screening period. In such 
cases, participants may be considered eligible for the study after meeting all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria related to active infection, and after meeting the following criteria: 
• At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical  illness)  have passed  since  symptoms first appeared 
or positive RT -PCR or viral antigen test result  
• At least [ADDRESS_1225645] fever  without the use of fever -reducing medications  
• Acute  symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) have resolved  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], there are no COVID-19- related sequelae that may place the 
participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment 
• Negative follow -up SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_1225646] based on institutional, local,

 7 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
Study intervention is  defined as any investigational intervention(s),  marketed  product(s), placebo, 
procedure(s),  intended to be administered  to a study  participant according  to the 
study protocol. 
Study  intervention  includes  both Investigational  [Medicinal]  Product  (IP/IMP)  and 
Non-investigational/Auxiliary [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non -IMP/AxMP) as indicated in 
Table 7.1-1. 
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined a pharmaceutical  form  of an active  substance 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study,  including products already with 
a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently from the 
authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when  used to gain further information 
about the authorized form. 
Other  medications used as support or escape medication  for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons,  as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered 
as -IPs/AxMPs.

7.2 Method of Study Intervention Assignment  
Before  the study is initiated,  designated  site staff will receive log- in information  and directions  on 
how to access the IRT. Each participant will be assigned a unique participant number known as 
patient identification  number (PID) after signing  the consent. Participant’s study information  and 
data will be recorded  only using the patient  identification  number. Participant numbers will not be 
reassigned.  An IRT will be employed to manage participant  randomization, treatment assignment, 
and dispensation of study drug. The investigator or designee will register the participant for enrollment by [CONTACT_104126].  
The following information  is required  for enrollment: 
• Date that informed consent was obtained  
• Year  of birth 
• Gender at birth 
 
Participants  who have met all eligibility  criteria  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio and stratified  by 
[CONTACT_8497] (< 80 kg vs ≥ 80 kg) and AJCC 8th edition staging (Stage IIIA/B vs Stage IIIC/D/IV).

7.4.5 Treatment  of Related Infusion- and Injection- Reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Reactions Occurring In-clinic  
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, systemic 
hypersensitivity (allergic)  reactions are unlikely. Although rare,  if severe hypersensitivity were  to 
occur, common manifestations might include fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, and/or bronchospasm. Report all Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions within 24 hours as an SAE. 
Treatment  recommendations are provided below based  on CTCAE  v5 grading definitions  and may 
be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate:  
For Grade  1 symptoms  (mild  reaction;  infusion/injection  interruption  not indicated; intervention 
not indicated): 
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions and injections: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1225663] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms: ( Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours ): 
• Stop the study drug infusion/injection. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and treat the 
participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol  325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. For the participants receiving Nivo IV, if the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes,  the rate may be increased  to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. Monitor participant closely. If symptoms recur, then no further study medication will be administered at that visit.  
• For participants in Arm A (Nivo SC) who need to receive [ADDRESS_1225664] injection,  and 
follow the treatment instructions mentioned above.  
• For future infusions or injections, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1225665] 30 minutes before nivolumab infusions or injections. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.

initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79806]. Grade 4: Life -threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention indicated): 
• Immediately discontinue infusion/injection of study drug. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline and treat the participant  as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 
1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for  subcutaneous or intramuscular administration  or 0.1 to 0.25 mg 
of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Monitor participant until the investigator judges that the symptoms will not recur. Study drug will be permanently discontinued. Follow institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the symptoms.

(local inflammation,  necrosis due to drug extravasation)  including those related  to procedures (eg, 
hematoma).  Local/institutional guidelines, if available, can  be followed.  
In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within  1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

Refer  to the current  version of the BMS -936558 IB for Nivo  IV, the BMS -986298 IB for Nivo  SC 
and the Pharmacy  Manual for complete  information  on storage,  handling,  
dispensing, and administration  information.  
The IP/AxMP  must be stored  in a secure area according to local  regulations. It is the responsibility 
of the investigator,  or designee where  permitted,  to ensure that IP/AxMP  is only dispensed to study 
participants. The IP/AxMP must be dispensed only from official study sites by [CONTACT_121189]. 
The product storage manager  should ensure that the study intervention is stored  in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If concerns regarding  the quality or appearance of the study intervention arise,  the study intervention 
should not be dispensed, and BMS should be contact[CONTACT_15608]. 
Study intervention  not supplied by [CONTACT_877137].  
IP/AxMP documentation  (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must  be maintained that includes  all 
processes required to ensure the drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of 
drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
• The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained  during transit  for all study  intervention  received  and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study intervention. 
• The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention  accountability, reconciliation, and record  maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
• Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are 
provided in Appendix 2. 
 
7.5.1 Retained Samples for Bioavailability/Bioequivalence/Biocomparability  
At the time of receipt of  the IP by [CONTACT_1719], BMS will specify the appropriate 
number of containers or units to select for retention, the conditions of sample storage, required 
duration of sample retention, and provisions for returning or disposing of the IP. When samples are selected,  containers or units should be placed  in packaging with a tamper-evident seal provided 
by [CONTACT_470522]. Package labeling should clearly identify the contents as retention 
samples and state that the IP should be stored in the restricted area with limited access.  
Additional details regarding  the retention  process will be provided in a Pharmacy  Manual  or other 
written documentation.

Prohibited and/or  restricted medications taken  prior to study treatment administration  are described 
below. Medications taken  within  [ADDRESS_1225668] be recorded 
on the CRF. 
The following medications and treatments  are prohibited during the study (unless utilized  to treat 
a drug- related adverse event).  
• Immunosuppressive agents.  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids. Participants are permitted the use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal 
systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity 
reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.  
• Any concurrent systemic anti -neoplastic therapy, including any concurrent adjuvant therapy 
for melanoma or for a new malignancy. Participants who develop a new non- melanoma fully 
resectable malignancy (examples include but are not limited to in situ bladder cancer, in situ gastric cancer,  or in situ colon  cancers;  in situ cervical  cancers/dysplasia;  or breast  carcinoma 
in situ; or prostate  carcinoma)  during the study may continue receiving  study drugs if the only 
therapy required is hormonal therapy, surgery, and/or radiation (and the surgery or radiation site does not overlap with a previous primary melanoma or melanoma metastasis location). Consultation with the Medical Monitor is required once a new malignancy is detected. 
• Any complementary medications (eg herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) intended to treat the disease under study. Such medications are permitted if they are used as supportive care.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 25 -May-2023  101 
Approved  v 212.0 930174717  2.0  
 • Any live attenuated vaccine (eg, live COVID -19 vaccines, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, 
rotavirus,  oral polio and measles,  mumps,  rubella  [MMR])  during treatment and until [ADDRESS_1225669] dose.

♦ The following are NOT considered live vaccines  and the decision  to vaccinate  should 
be made by [CONTACT_726891]: inactivated vaccines (eg, heat -killed and 
formalin -killed  vaccines),  subunit vaccines,  toxoid vaccines,  nucleic acid vaccines that 
do not encode potentially infectious virus  ([COMPANY_007]/BioNTech  and Moderna COVID-19 
vaccines) and replication -incompetent recombinant vector vaccines. If a study 
participant  has received  a live COVID -[ADDRESS_1225671] of the vaccine is stabilized, UNLESS a delay would 
compromise participant health, as determined by [CONTACT_877140]. For COVID -19 vaccines requiring more than a single dose, the full 
series (eg, both doses of a 2-dose series)  should be completed  prior to enrollment when 
feasible, and when a delay in enrollment would not put the study participant at risk. Ideally, enrollment would occur after any acute reactions (eg, reactions occurring within 24 hours of vaccine administration) resolve.  
 
Supportive care for disease -related  symptoms may  be offered  to all participants on the trial. 
7.7.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Participants are prohibited from joining another clinical trial while they are participating in this 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Restriction and Precautions  
It is the local  imaging facility’s  responsibility to determine,  based  on participant  attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be considered  in this assessment.  Participants  with renal  insufficiency are to be assessed  as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast  and if so, which  contrast agent  and dose is appropriate. Specific 
to MRI,  participants  with severe renal  insufficiency  (ie, estimated  glomerular filtration  rate [eGFR]  
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, therefore MRI 
contrast is contraindicated. In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image manual.  
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator, and standards set by [CONTACT_61857].

 7.8 Continued  Access to Study Intervention After  the End of the Study  
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS -supplied study intervention to 
participants/investigators  unless BMS  chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study. 
[ADDRESS_1225672]  discontinue IP (and Non-IP/AxMP  at the discretion  of the investigator) for any 
of the following reasons:  
• Participant’s request to stop study intervention. Participants who request to discontinue study 
intervention will remain in the study  and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified 
follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when  a participant specifically  withdraws 
consent for any further contact  [CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously authorized by [CONTACT_143929]  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070],  indicates  that continued participation  in the study  is not in  the best interest  of the 
participant  
• Termination  of the study by [CONTACT_20444]  
• Loss of ability to freely  provide consent  through imprisonment  or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: Under specific circumstances and only in countries where  local  regulations permit,  a participant  who 
has been  imprisoned may be permitted  to continue as a participant. Strict  conditions apply, and 
BMS approval is required.) 
• Disease recurrence  (local,  regional, or distant)  
• Additional protocol- specified  reasons for discontinuation ( Section  8.1.1) 
• Pregnancy (refer  to Section  9.2.5) 
• Significant noncompliance with protocol (eg, procedures,  assessments,  medications, etc.).  The 
investigator should discuss such issues with the Medical Monitor. 
 
Refer  to the Schedule of Activities  for data to be collected  at the time of treatment  discontinuation 
and follow-up and for any further evaluations that can be completed. 
All participants who discontinue study intervention should comply with protocol -sp
 ecified 
follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 2. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
participant withdraws  consent for all study procedures, including post- treatment study  follow -up, 
or loses the ability to consent freely (eg, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the

Section  7.4. Discontinue nivolumab for any adverse event,  laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent 
illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the 
participant with continued nivolumab dosing. 
Any event that leads to delay in dosing from the previous dose as described in Section 7.4.3  
requires discontinuation of study treatment, with the following exceptions: 
• Dosing delays to allow  for prolonged steroid  tapers to manage  drug- related  adverse events are 
allowed.  
• Dosing delays lasting longer than those described in Section 7.4.3 that occur for non -drug- 
related reasons may  be allowed if approved by [CONTACT_1689] (or designee). 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1225674] -study Intervention Study Follow -up 
Per Protocol Amendment  01, survival follow -up is not required.  Participants  will be followed 
for assessment of safety through 100 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment. 
Participants will not be followed for survival.  
The following  information  refers to the original study  design: In this study, overall survival is 
a key endpoint of the study. Post -study follow -up is of critical importance and is essential to 
preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who discontinue study intervention must continue to be followed (in this study or a rollover study) for collection of outcome as required and in line with Section [ADDRESS_1225675] that survival data be collected on all treated/randomized/assigned participants outside of  the protocol defined window as defined in Section [ADDRESS_1225676]  with  him/her or persons 
previously authorized by [CONTACT_102446]. 
• Participants should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow -up. 
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_1275], as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study intervention only or also from study procedures and/or post -treatment study follow -up, and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.

• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
 
8.2.1 Individual  Discontinuation Criteria  
• A participant may withdraw completely from the study  at any time at his/her own request, or 
may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_877105].

 9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
• Study procedures and timing  are summarized  in the Schedule of Activities  (see Section 2 ). 
• Protocol waivers  or exemptions are not allowed.  
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants  meet  all eligibility  criteria  before randomization. The  investigator will maintain  a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm  eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part  of the participant’s  routine  clinical management  (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
• Perform additional measures, including non- study required laboratory tests, as clinically 
indicated  or to comply with local  regulations. Laboratory toxicities  (eg, suspected  drug induced 
liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored  during the follow -up phase via on -site/local labs 
until all study drug -related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.  
• Evaluate participant immediately  to rule out cardiac or pulmonary toxicity  if participant shows 
cardiac or pulmonary- related  signs  (hypoxia, abnormal heart  rate or changes from  baseline)  or 
symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]). 
• Some of  the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They  are intended to be used as safety  monitoring  by [CONTACT_56951]. Additional testing 
or assessments may be performed as clinically  necessary  or where required  by [CONTACT_193612].  
• Repeat  or unscheduled samples may be taken  for safety  reasons or for technical  issues with the 
samples.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1225678]/MRI  of the abdomen, pelvis, and all  other known and/or 
suspected  sites of  disease is recommended to be performed; however, imaging per local  standard 
of care is allowed.  
• Ima
ging  of extremities for resected  melanomas located  in the extremities  is not a requirement 
and may be conducted per local  standard of care. Extremity imaging should be conducted in 
the event of a suspected locoregional relapse that is not clinically unequivocal. 
• If a PET- CT was obtained within [ADDRESS_1225679]

 (with  intravenous and oral contrast),  then that CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for 
eligibility assessment.  
 
Participants  without a history  of brain  metastases should have brain  imaging if clinically  indicated. 
If a participant starts  systemic therapy  for melanoma  recurrence or for a new non-melanoma tumor 
after study drug discontinuation, follow-up scans for this trial should be discontinued. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1225680] participant,  sites should review  and understand 
the image acquisition guidelines and submission process as outlined in the Imaging Manual 
provided by [CONTACT_11343]. 
Screening  and on study images should be acquired  as outlined in Section  2, Schedule of Activities . 
Tumor assessments at unscheduled time  points and/or  at an outside institution may be performed 
if clinically indicated and should be submitted to the central imaging vendor as soon as possible. 
Unscheduled CT/MRI  should be submitted  to central  imaging  vendor. X-rays and bone scans that 
clearly  demonstrate recurrence of disease,  for example most  commonly as unequivocal lesions that 
are unmistakably new since the prior CT/MRI, should be submitted to central imaging vendor. Otherwise, they do not need to be submitted centrally. 
Assessments  for recurrence should preferably  continue on the protocol- defined imaging schedule 
regardless if  dosing is delayed or discontinued; however, imaging based  on local  standard  of care 
is allowed. Assessment  should be performed  by [CONTACT_877142]. 
• For all participants: until local, regional, or distant recurrence, or up to the 100- day safety 
follow -up (whichever comes first), loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or death. 
• If a participant starts systemic therapy for melanoma recurrence or for a new non -melanoma 
tumor after study  drug discontinuation, follow-up scans for this trial should be discontinued. 
 
It is recommended that the same method of assessment used at Screening should be used for on - 
study time points. CT images should be acquired with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no 
intervening gap (contiguous). In case of contraindication for CT or MRI (including intravenous contrast) it is strongly recommended to adhere to the following guidance:  
• If a participant has a contraindication for CT intravenous contrast,  then a non- contrast CT of 
the chest and a contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known/suspected 
sites of disease should be obtained.  
• I
f a participant has a contraindication for both CT and MRI intravenous contrasts, a non- 
contrast CT of the chest and a non- contrast MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease should be obtained.

 • If a participant has a contraindication for MRI (eg, incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, then a non- contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, 
pelvis, and other known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.  
 
Refer  to Appendix 10: Country Specific Requirements  for possible exceptions. 
Other imaging may be collected per local standards, as clinically indicated. 
• U se of CT component of a PET -CT scanner: Combined modality scanning such as with 
positron emission tomography- computed tomography (PET -CT) is increasingly used in 
clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the 
recommendations outlined  here may change  rather quickly with time.  At present,  low-dose or 
attenuation  correction  CT portions of a combined PET- CT are of limited  use in 
anatomically  -based  efficacy  assessments and it is therefore  suggested  that they should not be 
substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast -enhanced CT scans for anatomically -based 
measurements.  However,  if a site  can document that the CT performed  as part  of a PET- CT is 
of identical diagnostic quality  to a diagnostic CT (with  intravenous and oral contrast),  then the 
CT portion of  the PET- CT can be used for measurements. In this specific study, for example, 
PET- CT can be used to support assessment of disease- free status in case CT or MRI are 
inconclusive.

[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Assessment of Recurrence  
The same method of assessment used at  Screening is recommended to be used for on -study time 
points. Post -baseline assessments will be performed until disease recurrence as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_1697], death, or withdrawal from the study.  
• Tumor assessments for ongoing study treatment decisions will be completed  by [CONTACT_1275].  
• Additional imaging of potential disease  sites should be performed  whenever disease recurrence 
or occurrence of a secondary malignancy is suspected.  
• Brain CT or MRI with and without contrast or bone imaging during on -study treatment and 
follow -up periods should be obtained if clinically indicated. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] General Considerations for Determining Recurrence 
• The goal is to identify lesions suspi[INVESTIGATOR_877106]. If it is believed that a lesion is NOT malignant in nature (eg, infection, trauma), it should be noted in the medical records. The specified minimum size criteria should be combined with radiographic appearance consistent with recurrent tumor in the assessment of all suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352].  
• Non-melanoma  primary  cancer  will be censored.

 • Equivocal recurrence is upgraded to unequivocal recurrence (except in cases of CNS 
recurrence) by [CONTACT_10980]: 
− A subsequent scan not earlier than [ADDRESS_1225682] 
suspected  demonstrates that the lesion  size is ≥ [ADDRESS_1225683] suspected.  
− Positive  histology/cytology  
• Appearance of multiple new lesions in the same time point generally constitutes unequivocal 
recurrence, even though they may be from different organs (eg, one liver lesion, one lung 
lesion, and one enlarged lymph node). 
 
Criteria  for Diagnosing Recurrences  is presented  in Table  [IP_ADDRESS]- 1. 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]- 1: Criteria  for Diagnosing Recurrence  
 
Anatomic  Sites  Criteria  
Non-Nodal  Soft 
Tissue  Equivocal lesions  include:  
• Solitary  lesion  measuring  < 10 mm in LD or with radiographic  appearance equivocal  for 
tumor recurrence.  
Unequivocal  lesions  include:  
• One or more  new lesions  > 10 mm in LD with radiographic  appearance consistent  with 
tumor recurrence.  
• Positive  histology/cytology.  
Bone  Lesions Equivocal lesions  include:  
• Solitary  lesion.  
• Lesions identified  on radionuclide  bone  scan.  Findings  on radionuclide  bone  scan must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, or plain films in order to be upgraded to unequivocal.  
Unequivocal  lesions  include:  
• Two or more  new lesions  consistent  with tumor  recurrence.  
• Positive  histology/cytology.  
Lymph  Nodesa Normal  lymph  nodes  are defined  as < 10 mm in the SAD. 
Equivocal lymph nodes include:  
• Lymph  nodes  measuring  10–14 mm SAD  with radiographic  appearance  consistent  with 
recurrence.  
• Lymph  nodes  ≥ 15 mm SAD  without radiographic  appearance  consistent  with 
recurrence.  
Unequivocal  proof of nodal  recurrence  includes: 
• One or more  previously  normal  or equivocal  lymph  nodes  that enlarge to ≥ 15 mm SAD 
and with radiographic appearance consistent with recurrence.  
• Positive  histology/cytology 
Fluid  Collections  
(eg, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial 
effusions)  • Presence of fluid  alone,  without pathological  confirmation, does not constitute 
equivocal or unequivocal recurrence.  
• Unequivocal  proof of recurrence is positive  pathology  of malignant  cells from  fluid(s).

Table  [IP_ADDRESS]-1:     Criteria for  Diagnosing Recurrence  
 
Anatomic  Sites  Criteria  
CNS Unequivocal  recurrence is defined  as any new CNS  lesion  of any size on CT or MRI  with a 
radiographic appearance consistent with tumor recurrence.  
Abbreviations:   CNS,   central   nervous   system;   CT,   computed  tomography;  LD,   longest   diameter; 
MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SAD, short -axis diameter.  
a For lymph  node  with short axis 10-15 mm, consider  biopsy when  lymph  node  is progressively  enlarged  as 
evidenced.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Recurrence is defined as the appearance of one or more new melanoma lesions (except MMIS), 
which can be local, regional, or distant in location from the primary resected site.  
Local C utaneous  Recurrence  
Local recurrence is defined as tumor regrowth within [ADDRESS_1225684] be 
unequivocal as noted in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1. 
Distant R ecurrence  
Any distant metastases with radiographic appearance consistent with tumor recurrence or positive 
histology/cytology (typi[INVESTIGATOR_877107] M except for M0). Distant metastases include node relapses beyond the anatomical compartment of the primary melanoma basin, a nodal basin situated  in a different anatomical  compartment beyond the primary  melanoma  lesion, or in 2 nodal 
basins (even if contiguous; ie, 2 pelvic nodal basins, 2 mediastinal nodal basins, etc).  
Considerations for establishing  distant  recurrence on cross- sectional  imaging:  
• CT and MRI are an important part of the work -up to establish recurrence. Contrast-enhanced 
CT and MRI are the preferred imaging modalities. See Section 9.1.1 for details.  
• Positron  emission tomography (PET) alone  will not be considered  for the disease assessment. 
Complementary CT and/or MRI or biopsy must be performed in such cases. 
• Cytology and/or histology are mandatory  to confirm recurrence in solitary  or in doubtful 
lesions,  cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymph node lesions.  Histological or cytological evidence

 of recurrence  should be attempted  in all cases (except  for brain  metastases)  when safe and 
clinically feasible.  
 
Clinically  detected  new lesions:  
• The neoplastic nature of superficial cutaneous lesions must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
• Deep  subcutaneous lesions  and lymph  node lesions should be documented by [CONTACT_2207], and 
histo logical/cytological evidence should be attempted. In absence of pathology report, lesion 
recurrence will be documented with a CT scan/MRI.  
• Tumor markers  or auto-antibodies alone  cannot be used to assess recurrence.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Date of Recurrence  
The first date when recurrence was observed  is taken  into account regardless of the method of 
assessment. Therefore, recurrence will be declared for any lesion when:  
• Only  imaging  was performed  and recurrence  confirmed  
• Only  pathology was done and malignancy confirmed  (in solitary  or in doubtful lesions, 
cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymph node lesions) 
• Both  pathology and imaging  were  done and recurrence/malignancy  confirmed. In this case,  the 
date of whichever examination comes first is considered the date of recurrence.  
 
Pathology reports of biopsies  confirming  recurrence should  be sent to a central vendor.  
Note:  For documentation, the date of recurrence  is the date that the pathology and/or imaging 
confirms recurrence - not the date that the information was communicated to the participant. 
9.1.4 Health Outcomes Assessments  
Health outcomes assessment data will be collected using electronic data collection methods at 
designated times during treatment and in follow -up. If exceptional circumstances preclude the 
continued administration of measures using planned modalities, then alternate administration methods may be required, after consultation with Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. 
PRO  data has been  collected  in Study CA2096GE. In this amendment,  we are proposing to remove 
all PRO  data collection in order  to reduce participant and site  burden now  that this study is  being 
stopped. The PRO  data that has been  collected  will not be analyzed  as part of the statistical  analysis 
plan (SAP) due to the very limited amount of data; however, the data may be used internally at some point in the future to help develop PRO strategies in future clinical trials.

[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L (Part 1 Only)  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
Participants’  reports  of general  health  status  are assessed  using the EuroQoL Group’s 5- level  EQ- 
5D (EQ-5D- 5L) questionnaire.40 The EQ -5D- 5L has 2 components: a descriptive system and a 
visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual  activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 
[ADDRESS_1225686] health state, respectively, described by [CONTACT_20367] -5D- 5L. Altogether, the

to rate their own current health on a 101- point scale ranging from best imaginable to worst 
imaginable health.  
The EQ -5D-5L ha s been shown to be a valid measure in a cancer patient population.41 Currently 
there are no published MIDs for EQ -5D- 5L index change scores for the EQ -5D- 5L in a cancer 
population; however a change of 7 points on the EQ -5D VAS score is considered clinically 
meaningful.42 All participants  in Part 1 of the study will complete  the EQ-5D-5L at every  treatment

[IP_ADDRESS] Modified  TASQ  (Part  1 Only)  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
The TASQ was developed to assess patients’ perceptions and satisfaction with subcutaneous 
(TASQ -SC) or intravenous (TASQ -IV) treatment administration. The questionnaire has been 
validated in a cancer patient population.44 Each version of the TASQ (TASQ -IV and TASQ- SC) 
contains 19 items which comprise the 5 subdomains: Treatment satisfaction, Convenience, Physical impact, Psychological impact, and Impact on daily living. Although there is no specific 
recall  period for either  version  of the TASQ,  instructions provided indicate  that the questionnaire  
should be completed after the  most recent  IV infusion  or SC injection. Participants in Part 1 Arm 
B will complete  the TASQ -IV and participants  in Part 1 Arm  A will  complete  the TASQ -SC. The 
questionnaire will be completed  at specified  time points during treatment  (see Section  2, Schedule 
of Activities).  
[IP_ADDRESS] SIAQ (Part 1 Only)  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
The SIAQ is a non- specific indication  questionnaire that assesses patient overall experience with 
subcutaneous self-injection.
45 The measure contains 2 parts  with pre- (7 items) and post- injection 
(21 items) questionnaire. The post -injection questionnaire captures 6 main subdomains: feelings 
about injections  (3 items),  self-image  (1 item),  self-confidence (3 items), pain,  and skin reactions  
during or af ter the injection  (2 items),  ease of use of the self-injection   (5 items),  and 
satisfaction with  self-injection (7 items). To reduce patient burden and avoid capturing the same 
concept multiple times using different measures, only the self -confidence subdomain will be 
completed by [CONTACT_4317]. Each of the items in the self -confidence subdomain response options 
from 1 “Not  at all” to 5 “Extremely”.  There  is no specific  recall  period for the SIAQ;  however the 
instructions state that the post -injection questionnaire must be answered by [CONTACT_877145]-inject. Therefore, if a caregiver or HCP administers the treatment, the participant would 
not complete the SIAQ. The SIAQ self -confidence subdomain will only be completed by 
[CONTACT_877146] -inject in Part 1 Arm A at specific time points during treatment. 
Caregivers/HCPs who administer treatment on behalf of the participant should not complete the 
SIAQ (see Section 2, Schedule of Assessments).

be collected from the date of the participant’s written consent until [ADDRESS_1225690]  all nonserious adverse events (not only those  deemed  to be treatment- related) continuously 
during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1225691]  report any SAE that occurs after  these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study intervention or protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow- up skin biopsy).  
• Medical  occurrences that begin before  the start of study intervention but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the CRF module. 
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported  to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the sponsor or designee within  24 hours 
of updated information being available.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged  from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably  related  to the study 
intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
For participants  who have been  randomized  or assigned to  treatment  and never treated  with  study 
drug, collect SAEs for 30 days from the date of randomization or treatment assignment. 
For participants  who are enrolled but not randomized, all SAEs  and AEs/SAEs  related  to 
SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1225692] be collected for 30 days from the date of signing consent. 
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a participant.  Care  should be taken  not to introduce  bias when  collecting  AEs and/or 
SAEs.  Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by [CONTACT_148696], when appropriate for the program or protocol.

immune -mediated. For events which  are potentially  immune- mediated,  additional information  will 
be collected on the participant’s case report form.  
AEs, including SAEs, occurring during the   period should be collected during in -clinic 
visits and reported as early  as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the SAE). 
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3).  
• Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study intervention and for those present at the end of study intervention as appropriate. 
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
 
All SAEs  and AEs (SAEs  and non-serious AEs)  associated  with confirmed  or suspected 
SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1225694] to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 8.3 ), or for suspected cases, until SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1225695] dose of study therapy, participants  will be followed for drug- related 
AEs/SAEs  until resolution,  returns  to baseline,  or is deemed  irreversible,  or until the participant is 
lost to follow -up or withdraws study consent. 
Further information  on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_148697] a product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
The Sponsor or designee must report AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws and regulations. A S[LOCATION_003]R (suspected, unexpected serious adverse reaction) is a subset  of SAEs  and must be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities 
and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.

Risk of intentional overdose in participants self- administering  is minimized 
based on the following considerations: 
• CA2096GE will exclude participants with serious psychological and psychiatric disorders 
including participants with prior history of self- harm and suicidal attempts.  
• Melanoma is not included among the main cancers with higher risk of suicide. In addition, 
clinical factors associated with suicidality such as substantial pain, insomnia, fatigue, loss of autonomy and independence are not considered prevalent among the study population (adjuvant melanoma).

9.5 Pharmacokinetics  
Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment 01, sample collections for PK and ADAs are 
no longer necessary  for any participant  who is on study  treatment.  In the event  samples  are 
collected following implementation of Protocol Amendment 01, samples will be analyzed 
bioanalytically and reported as listings. 
The following  information  refers to the original study  design.  
Actual  times  of sample collection  will be used in all PK analyses.  
The nivolumab exposure measures  (PK endpoints) to be assessed  in the study include the 
following:  
• Cavgd28: time-averaged  nivolumab serum  concentration over the first 28 days 
• Cminss:  trough nivolumab serum  concentration  at steady -state 
• Cmind28: trough nivolumab serum  concentration on Day 28 
• Cmax1: maximum nivolumab serum  concentration after the first dose 
• Tmax:  time to Cmax1  
• Cavgss:  time-averaged  nivolumab serum  concentration at steady -state 
• Cmaxss:  maximum nivolumab serum  concentration at steady -state 
 
Individual co-primary  (Cavgd28 and Cminss  in Part 1; Cavgd28 in and secondary 
(Cmind28, Cmax1, Tmax, Cavgss, and Cmaxss in Parts 1 and 2; Cminss in  PK endpoints 
will be determined  using  PPK analysis.  Specifically,  the structural,  interindividual  variability,

 covariate, and residual error components of  the previously developed combined SC and IV PPK 
model will be pre -specified and the population and individual PK parameters will be estimated 
using the data collected in this study. Individual PK exposure measures (ie, PK endpoints listed 
above) will be derived  using  the individual (empi[INVESTIGATOR_877109])  PK model parameters (eg, 
rate of absorption, bioavailability,  clearance,  volume of distribution) estimated  by [CONTACT_10994].  The 
details of the PPK analysis will be presented in a pre- specified pharmacometrics analysis plan.  
The co -primary PK endpoints in Part 1 (Cavgd28 and Cminss) will be used for non- inferiority 
assessment as described in Section 10.4.2. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_1225703] before  the administration  of nivolumab (preferably  within 
30 minutes).  If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed,  then collect  the predose sample just 
prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample should not be collected. In Part 1, Arm B, the end of the infusion (EOI) occurs when the entire nivolumab dose in the infusion bag is administered to the participant. If the site infuses the drug without a flush, then collect the EOI- PK sample within 
approximately 5 minutes after EOI. If a flush is administered to clear the IV lines of the drug and to ensure delivery of  the entire drug dose, then draw  the EOI -PK sample within approximately 5 
minutes after the end of  the flush. If the EOI is delayed to beyond the nominal infusion duration 
(30 minutes), the collection of the EOI-PK sample should be delayed accordingly. 
Draw blood samples from a site other than the infusion site (ie, contralateral arm) on days of 
infusion for all predose and EOI -PK samples. Please ensure accurate documentation of the time 
and date of sample collection. 
Samples will be evaluated for development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Samples may also be 
analyzed for neutralizing antibodies and PK samples may be used for ADA analysis in the event 
of insufficient volume, to complete immunogenicity assessment, or to follow -up on suspected 
immunogenicity -related AEs.  
Further details of sample collection, processing, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory 
procedures manual.  
Immunogenicity of nivolumab will be assessed per the SAP. PK data for rHuPH20 will not be 
collected  in this study; however, immunogenicity data  for rHuPH20  will be collected  and may be 
analyzed and reported separately, as appropriate.

Serum  and whole blood  collected  at time points indicated in Table 9.8-1  and  may be 
used for but not limited to the measurement of deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) and protein 
biomarkers in the periphery. Features within the periphery have been established as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of nivolumab biological activity. These include increased soluble 
factors such as, but not limited to, chemokine (CXC)  motif, CXC  ligand- 9 (CXCL9), and CXC  
ligand- 10 (CXCL10). Pre - and on- treatment peripheral blood may be used to compare the 
pharmacodynamic activity between  and Nivo IV treatment arms. In addition to 
characterizing the pharmacodynamic activity of  and Nivo IV, data from these 
investigations may also be evaluated for associations with clinical efficacy and safety/toxicity 
(AE)  data.  To identify  any potential imbalances in known prognostic factors in the tumor between 
SC and IV treatment arms, baseline tumor biomarkers may be compared between arms (may 
include, but are not limited to, PD -L1, tumor mutational burden [TMB], mutational status, and 
tumor inflammation). Optional tumor biopsies will also be collected upon recurrence (see Table

Pre-treatment tumor samples are required from all participants. Sufficient, recent FFPE tumor 
tissue block, obtained from  the recent resection (preferred) or from  an archival biopsy conducted 
within  [ADDRESS_1225708] efforts, 
15 unstained slides are not obtainable, submission of 5 unstained slides is acceptable. Tissue 
availability needs to be determined during the screening period. It is recommended that tissue is submitted during the screening period; however, it must  be submitted no later  than [ADDRESS_1225709] - 
randomization/treatment assignment.  Biopsies should be obtained from core biopsy, punch biopsy, 
excisional biopsy, or surgical specimen. Fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_877110]. Preferably, participants should not have received any systemic anticancer therapy between  time  of tissue acquisition and randomization/treatment assignment.  Submission of tumor 
biopsy upon recurrence is highly recommended but optional. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
detailed biopsy collection instructions.  
Pre-treatment tumor samples will be assessed for PD -L1 expression using the Dako PD -L1 
immunohistochemistry 28- [ADDRESS_1225710], and membranous PD-L1 expression  will be scored  in tumor and immune 
cells if a minimum of 100 evaluable  tumor cells are present.  Samples with < 100 evaluable tumor 
cells or inadequate sample will be characterized as PD -L1 unevaluable. Indeterminate PD -L1 
tumor expression is defined as membrane staining that is obscured by [CONTACT_802666]. To identify any potential imbalances in known prognostic factors between 
SC  and IV treatment  arms,  baseline  biomarkers including, but not limited  to, PD-L1, TMB,  
tumor inflammation,  will be descriptively  compared  between  arms.  Tumor  biopsy submitted  upon  
recurrence will be similarly evaluated. For TMB analysis, tumor tissue may be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_877149]/or  whole  exome  or whole  genome  sequencing (WES). Exploratory  analyses of mRNA 
may be completed using RNA isolated from tumor tissue. Targeted and/or whole transcriptome RNA- seq and/or similar methodologies may be used to assess gene expression signatures,  such as 
but not limited,  to those associated  with inflammatory  processes and/or immune- related  signaling. 
9.8.2 Serum  
Not a

Pre- and on- treatment serum may  be assessed  by [CONTACT_28745]- linked  immunosorbent assay, seromics, 
metabolomics, and/or other relevant multiplex -based protein assay methods for immune- related 
factors  that will predict for SC  and Nivo IV benefit or AEs and to evaluate pharmacodynamic 
activity of SC  and Nivo IV. Potential serum -based biomarkers currently under investigation 
may include, but are not limited  to, levels  of cytokines and chemokines. Changes from  baseline in 
biomarkers will be descriptively compared between SC   and IV treatment arms.

Whole blood will be collected  from  all participants  prior  to treatment  for genomic DNA isolation. 
Blood DNA sequencing data generated  using Next  Generation  Sequencing technologies to enable 
WES may be used as a control in order  to improve  the accuracy  of mutational  analyses from tumor 
samples.  Germline  mutations  from  blood samples will be inferred from  the WES data to consider 
somatic mutations for TMB assessment.  
9.9 Additional Research 
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
This protocol will include both sample collection and residual sample storage for additional 
research (AR).  
For All US sites:  
Additional research is required for all study  participants, except where prohibited by [CONTACT_1202]/ethics 
committees , prohibited by [CONTACT_44896], or academic/institutional requirements. 
Where one or more of  these exceptions occurs, participation in the additional  research should be 
encouraged but will not be a condition of overall study participation. 
• If the IRB/ethics committees and site agree to the mandatory additional research retention 
and/or collection, then the study participant must agree to the mandatory additional research as a requirement for inclusion in the study.  
• If optional participation is permitted and approved, then the study participants may opt out of 
the additional research retention and/or collection.  
 
For non- US Sites:  
Additional research  is optional for all study participants,  except where  retention  and/or collection 
is prohibited by [CONTACT_44896], ethics committees, or institutional requirements.  
Additional research is intended to expand the R&D capability at Bristol -Myers Squibb, and will 
support as yet undefined research  aims  that will advance our understanding of disease and options 
for treatment. This may also include genetic/genomic exploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathways, progression, and response to treatment etc.

 Sample Collection and Storage  
Residual PK, immunogenicity, blood (or blood derivatives) or tumor tissue (recent, archival, or 
fresh  biopsy and extracted  RNA/deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA])  from tumor  biopsy and biomarker 
collections (see Table 9.9 -1 below) will also be retained for additional research purposes.  
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Biorepository in New Jersey, [LOCATION_003] or an independent, BMS-approved storage vendor. 
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly used throughout their usable life and 
will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by [CONTACT_1289].  
Transfers of samples by [CONTACT_54004][INVESTIGATOR_841]’s agreement to establish similar storage procedures.  
Samples will be stored  in a coded fashion, and no researcher  will have access to the key. The key 
is securely  held by [CONTACT_877151], so there  is no direct  ability for a researcher 
to connect a sample to a specific individual. 
Further details of sample collection and processing will be provided to the site in the procedure 
manual .

Per Protocol Amendment 01, only safety analyses will be conducted. Summary tables and listings for baseline characteristics, disposition, safety, and efficacy data will be provided to support the Clinical  Study  Report (CSR). Additional  summaries (as appropriate for small sample 
size) will be planned in the SAP to support study data disclosure on original study objectives. 
10.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
Not applicable  per Protocol Amendment  01. The following  information  refers to the original 
study design.  
Part 1 of the  study will be subjected to statistical  hypothesis testing.  
 
Research  Hypothesis (Part 1 - Randomized  Study)  
Nivolumab exposures following  (BMS -986298) 600 mg administered Q2W are 
non-inferior to exposures following nivolumab (BMS -936558) 240 mg IV Q2W for the adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma.  
10.2 Sample Size Determination  
The aim of the study is to assess the safety  and tolerability  of  and Nivo IV. This has 
changed from the original protocol’s study objective of PK. Sample  size calculations are not based 
on statistical considerations. There were 14 participants randomized and treated at the time of

In Part 1, RFS distributions  will be descriptively compared between treatment groups and hazard 
ratios, and corresponding 95% CIs will be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards (CPH) 
model, with treatment group as a single covariate, stratified by [CONTACT_760]- specified factors.  
RFS curves will be estimated  using Kaplan -Meier  (K-M) product- limit methodology. Median  RFS 
with 2 -sided 95% CIs using the log-log transformation will be computed. 
RFS rates at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months (and yearly after depending on follow -up) with 2- sided 
95% CIs using the log- log transformation will be computed.  
For RFS, a supplemental analysis will be performed using a while on study treatment estimand 
strategy to handle the intercurrent events of start of new anticancer therapy, tumor-directed 
radiotherapy, or tumor- directed surgery (excluding basal cell carcinoma [BCC]/squamous cell 
carcinoma  [SCC]  removal).  Under this strategy,  RFS will be censored  on the date of last evaluable 
disease assessment prior to or on the same date of initiation of new anticancer therapy, tumor - 
directed radiotherapy, or tumor-directed surgery (excluding BCC/SCC removal). 
For the supplemental  descriptive analysis, the RFS curves will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
(K-M) product -limit methodology. Median RFS with 2- sided 95% CIs using the log -log 
transformation will be computed. 
OS is defined as the time from randomization  to the date of death  from any cause.  For participants 
that are alive  (ie, without documentation of death),  their survival time will be censored  at the date 
of last  contact [CONTACT_568] (or “last  known alive  date”).  OS will be censored  at the date of randomization 
for subjects who were  randomized but had no follow -up. OS will be followed  continuously while 
participants are on the study drug and every [ADDRESS_1225718] after 
participants discontinue the study drug.

 APPENDIX 3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse Event Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of  a 
pre-existing medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study 
treatment that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom, or disease temporally  associated  with the use of study  treatment,  whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety  assessments  (eg, electrocardiograms,  radiological scans,  vital signs 
measurements),  including  those that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available.  Once  the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing  condition, including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected  or diagnosed after study  intervention administration, even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected  overdose  of either  study intervention 
or a concomitant medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_093]), 
should not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) unless it is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae and should specify “intentional overdose” as the verbatim 
term.  
Events NOT Meeting  the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which  an untoward medical  occurrence did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE 
If an event  is not an AE per definition  above, then it cannot be an SAE, even  if serious  conditions 
are met.

Approved  v 21.0 930174717  2.0  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is defined  as any untoward medical  occurrence that,  at any 
dose:  
Results in death.  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event;  it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused  death  if it were 
more severe).  
Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143850]  (see NOTE 
below).  
NOTE:  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_877118]- Myers Squibb (BMS)  clinical 
studies:  
• A visit to  the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event).  
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent. 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure.  
• Routine  health  assessment  requiring  admission  for baseline/trending  of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy). 
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. 
• Admission  encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy in the absence  of any other 
SAEs (applies to oncology protocols). 
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical  event[s] that may not  be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious  outcomes listed  in the definition  above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment  in an emergency room or 
for allergic bronchospasm and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.)

EVALUATING  AES AND SAES 
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study intervention and  each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The investigator will use clinical  judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors,  as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  administration, 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s  Brochure and/or product information  for 
marketed products in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information  to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However,  it is very important  that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor. 
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
• The causality  assessment is one of  the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports must include the same investigator term[s] initially reported.)

to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs  must be followed  to resolution or stabilization.  
 
REPORTING  OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE 
 
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  Report Form.  
− The required  method for SAE  data reporting is through the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  
− The paper SAE Report Form is intended only as a back- up option when the electronic 
data capture system  is unavailable/not functioning  for transmission  of the eCRF  to BMS 
(or designee). 
♦ In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile 
transmission.  
♦ When  paper forms  are used, the original paper forms  are to remain  on site. 
• Pregnancies must be recorded on paper Pregnancy Surveillance Forms and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile transmission.

participants, refer to Section 6.1 of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described in 
Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study. 
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing  Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_1225748] a serum  follicle -stimulating  hormone (FSH)  level  
> 40 mIU/mL  to confirm menopause.  
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. Suggested guidelines for  the duration  of the washout  periods  for HRT  types  are presented  below. Investigators 
should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
• 1-week  minimum for vaginal hormonal  products (rings, creams,  gels)  
• 4-week  minimum  for transdermal products  
• 8-week minimum for oral products

 Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.  
End of Relevant Systemic  Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in context of safety  margins  from the no-observed- adverse- effect  level  or the time required for 5 half- 
lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Local  laws and regulations  may require  use of alternative  and/or additional  contraception  methods.  
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive Methods  That  Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently  and correctly.  a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen- containing) hormonal  contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or implantation.  (This  method of contraception can only be used 
by [CONTACT_499860].)b 
− Oral (birth  control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])  
− Intravaginal (rings)

used by [CONTACT_499862].)b,c 
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion.  
• Vasectomized  partner  
Having a vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
A vasectomy  is a highly effective  contraception  method provided that the participant  is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability  of sexual  abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation  to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation  of study therapy.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified in Section  2. 
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participant chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to, calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.
 
NOTES:  
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_143852]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants in clinical studies. 
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be ineffective  or result  in increased  exposures  that could  be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to Sections 6.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol. 
c IUSs  are acceptable methods  of contraception  in the absence  of definitive  drug interaction  studies  when  hormone 
exposures  from do not alter contraception  effectiveness.  For information  specific  to this

 AJCC  Prognostic  Stage  Groups 
Clinical (cTNM) 
Clinical stage includes microstaging of the primary melanoma and clinical/radiologic/biopsy 
evaluation for metastases. By [CONTACT_559], clinical staging should be used after biopsy of the primary melanoma, with clinical assessment for regional and distant metastases. Note that pathological assessment of the primary melanoma is used for both clinical and pathological classification. Diagnostic biopsies to evaluate possible regional  and/or distant metastasis also are 
included. Note there is only one stage group for clinical Stage III melanoma.

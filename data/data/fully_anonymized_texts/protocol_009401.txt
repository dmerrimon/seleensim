1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Self-Fitting  (SF) Strategy Validation NSR Device Study  Protocol : SF Study  
  
Study Des cription : A prospective, randomized  controlled,  adaptive  design , non-inferiority,  
pre-market  and NSR device study. To be conducted in a minimum of [ADDRESS_477091] ´s 
perceived hearing aid benefit when using the Vibe  SF self-fit hearing aids 
and when using  Silk 1X  Hearing Care Professional (HCP) fit hearing aids.  
 
The study begins with a cross -over design. At the interim analysis, the 
possibility of an interaction  effect is evaluated through a nuisance 
parameter. If it is determined to be likely, the design is switched to a 
parallel -group design with a larger sample size. Only data from the first 
period will be included from those subject s who early on participated in 
the cross -over design.  
 
The Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing ai ds are fitted to National Acoustic Labo ratories 
Nonl inear Version 2 (NAL -NL2) prescriptive targets, verified by [CONTACT_380873] -mic 
real-ear measures (REM). The null hypothesis  (H0) is that subject ´s 
perceived hearing aid s benefit using Vibe  SF hearing aids is inferior to Silk 
1X HCP fit  hearing aids, and the alternative hypothesis  (Ha) is that subject ´s 
perceived hearing aids benefit using Vibe  SF hearing aids is non -inferior to  
that using  Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids.

Description of Study 
Intervention:  The mechanism for validating the Vibe SF  strategy will be to compare 
subject ´s perceived hearing aid benefit after two 14 days series of using 
Vibe SF/Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids.          
  
Objectives:  
 Primary Effectiveness Objective:   
To demonstrate that the  Vibe SF strategy is non -inferior to the HCP fit  
strategy  in subject ´s perceived hearing aid benefit after using  the Vibe  SF 
and Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids in real-life conditions.  
  
 Secondary Hearing Aid Benefit Objectives:  
To score  each of the following hearing aid benefit performance measures 
when the subject  is using the Vibe  SF and Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aid s: 
1. Sound quality,  speech understanding  and hearing aid  
satisfaction real-time assessment , 
2. Speech -in-noise recognition performance , and 
3. Hearing disability in communication situations . 
 
Secondary Gain Selection Objective:  
Individual f requency -specific real-ear gain comparison of the two different 
fittin g strategies ( Vibe SF and HCP fit ).  
 
Secondary Preference Objective:  
Fitting  strategy  (Vibe SF or HCP fit ) preference  reported by [CONTACT_423] .  
 
Secondary Safety Objective:  
To estimate the rate of adverse device e ffects  (ADEs)  when the subject  is 
using the Vibe  SF hearing aid s.  
  
Endpoint s: Primary  Effectiveness  Endpoint:    
Differences in the benefit scores on each of the three communication 
subscales  as captured by [CONTACT_380874] 
(APHAB)  after wearing each Vibe SF/ Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids for [ADDRESS_477092] , the endpoints are the individual 3 communication 
subscale differences between the HCP fit  subscal e (benefit) score and SF 
subscale (benefit) score:  
• ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆EC(benefit) SF  
• ∆BN(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆BN(benefit) SF  
• ∆RV(benefit) HCP fi t - ∆RV(benefit) SF

3. Hearing disability resulting from hearing loss quantified by [CONTACT_380876], Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing 
Scale for clinical use:  the SSQ -12 questionnaire.  
 
Secondary Gain Selection Endpoint:  
Individual frequency -specific gain comparis on for the two different fitting 
strategies  (Vibe SF and HCP fit ) for each ear as measured with probe -mic 
real-ear measures (REM).  
 
Secondary Preference Endpoint:  
Fitting preference Vibe SF or HCP  fit strategy . Subject s are asked which of 
the hearing aids they would prefer to keep using a 5-point  Likert scale.  
 
Secondary Safety Endpoint:  
The number of adverse device  effects ( ADEs ) in the time period when the 
subject  is using the Vibe  SF hearing aids.  
  
Population:  A minimum of [ADDRESS_477094] s will be screened to 
confirm their  bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

aids may expand the reach of hearing health care by [CONTACT_380881] a segment of people with 
hearing loss who, until now, have rejected  traditional hearing aids.  
 
The Sponsor  is conducting this NSR device study to fulfill one of the  special control s, 21 CFR  § 
874.3325(b)(1) Clinical data must evaluate the effectiveness of the self -fitting strategy …for self -fitting air 
conduction hearing aids . The primary purpose of the SF Study is to validate the effectiveness of the Vibe SF 
strategy based on the device’s intended use and technological characteristics. The SF Study final clinical 
study report  will be part of the 510(k) submission for the Vibe SF hearing aid.

Mitigations to prevent over -amplifications include a safety output limiter which is  a hardware measure for 
limiting the output sound pressure level (OSPL ) in failure mode. Hence, for the implemented cluster, the 
safety limiter is [ADDRESS_477126] of  the specific cluster. Other mitigation measures include 
performance testing as electroacoustics and software verification and validation.  Critical use -related 
scenarios (critical tasks) and essential functions have been identified and will be tested and validated in 
Human Factors testing.

2.3.3  ASSESSMENT O F POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
Overall, all risk s iden tified  are mitigated as low as possible / below the risk acceptability threshold.  The 
risks associated with the use of the Vibe SF  hearing aid system are acceptable when weighted against the 
expected benefits to the study subject s. The benefit outweighs the ove rall residual risk . 
 
In conclusion, the overall residual risk and the overall risk/benefit profile is acceptable for the clinical study 
using the self -fitting system EasyFit  web app lication  and Vibe SF  hearing aid .

        Differences in the benefit scores on 
each of the three communication 
subscales as captured by [CONTACT_380887] (APHAB) after wearing each 
Vibe SF/ Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids 
for 14 days.  
 
The three communication subscales on 
the APHAB are:  ease of communication  
(EC), background noise (BN) and 
reverberant room (RV). There is one 
benefit score (i.e., = unaided - aided) 
for each communication subscale (EC, 
BN and RV) scored after each fitting 
strategy field testing (SF or HCP fit ): 
∆EC(benefit) SF, ∆BN(benefit) SF, 
∆RV(benefit) SF for the Vibe SF hearing 
aids, and  ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit , 
∆BN(benefit) HCP fit , ∆RV(benefit) HCP fit  for 
the Silk 1X HCP fit  hearing aids.  
 Self-reporting questionnaires 
have been commonly used to 
measure subjective hearing 
impairment.  
The APHAB is selected because 
of its known psychometric 
properti es. The APHAB was 
specifically designed to 
quantify auditory disability so 
that the success of the hearing 
aid fitting in reducing disability  
and comparison between 
hearing aid fitting strategies  
may be examined  (Cox & 
Alexander, 1995)  .  
 
The reason to examine each 
subscale independently is to 
investigate  whether the fitting 
strategies provide different 
benefit in varying kinds of 
environments in the real world.

methodology using 
smartphones in hearing aid 
outcome research (Wu, Stangl, 
Zhang, & Bentler, 2015) . 
The EMA approach overcome s 
several long -standing problems 
in assessment.  
First, EMA minimizes the 
problem of retrospective 
memory biases in reporting long 
after specific behaviors or 
emotional reactions are emitted 
because respondents can be 
prompted during real -life 
situations  (Schiffman, Stone, & 
Hufford, 2008) . Users may 
remember recent events or very 
emotional events more than 
others . For hearing aid trials , this 
also means users may not 
remember the acoustical 
background of the situation.  
 
Secondly , EMA is 
representative of real life - 
surveys are not filled out in an 
artificial situation during an 
investigational site visit but 
rather  are possible in many 
different situations in the life 
of the subject s. With random 
sampling (random trigger s) it is 
possible to deduct how often 
each situation occurs in 
everyday life, but subject s can 
also trigger a survey in very 
important or difficult 
situations.  
 
Thirdly, EMA is context 
sensitive – subjects may have 
different needs and 
preferences in diffe rent 
situations. This can be 
measured with EMA as the user

The name [CONTACT_380936] -fitting air conduction hearing aid is Vibe SF . The EasyFit  web application is intended to 
support the SF strategy of the Vibe SF.  The Vibe SF strategy is being evaluated in this study.  
To address a possible significant interaction effect, a sample size re -estimation based on the nuisance 
parameter: interaction term will be conducted after [ADDRESS_477150] completed Visit 3.  
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
Research of self-fitting  hearing aids is limited , there is only one current published SF validation study  done 
by [CONTACT_380889]. Today the landscape of the hearing industry is changing quickly due to 
the rapid advancement of amplification technology as well as changes in federal regulations of the hearing 
aid market.  
 
The sponsor does not kn ow, before initiating the study, whether the interaction between treatment and 
order is significant. It is the company’s belief that an interaction effect is unlikely because many studies in 
the hearing aid literature use cross -over designs, and none menti on a significant interaction effect. 
Therefore, the company prefers not to start with the assumption that it is necessary to conduct a parallel -
arm trial. To address concerns about a possible interaction effect, the sponsor proposes to address this 
potenti al problem by [CONTACT_380890]:  changing to a parallel -arm design  based on a nuisance 
parameter.  The nuisance parameter is the interaction term.   
 
SF Study   FINAL Version 1. 1 
Protocol #: D00232675   [ADDRESS_477151] practices model 
involving the HCP, it is necessary to verify that a hearing aid user’s first experience with amplification is 
such that core expected benefits are met with a self -fitting approach.  This does not preve nt future 
intervention with a HCP.  Rather, a self -fitting approach to amplification should provide noticeable benefit 
comparable to that of best practices to overcome key challenges of hearing loss directly related to reduced 
audibility.  In this way, the  new hearing aid wearer can begin experiencing benefits of amplification and 
develop a positive acceptance of hearing healthcare.  
 
It cannot be expected for a SF hearing aid to be superior as the advantages of the SF lie in accessibility and 
ownership not the fitting -process itself. However, in the best interest of the subjects it has to be ensured 
that the hearing aid fitting is not inferior to that what they would get from the standard alternative , i.e., 
being fitted by a HCP.

The EasyFit  web application is used to guide the user through the Vibe SF  procedure and to set audiological 
gain parameters and preferred settings on the Vibe SF. EasyFit  web application  is designed to function in 
standard browsers of a user’s compatible smartphone or tablet device. Access to the internet is required 
when using EasyFit web application  during the SF procedure , fine-tuning  and use of volume control . 
Through the Vibe SF hear ing aid, the EasyFit  web app lication  will present several sets of [ADDRESS_477161] the same frequency, but they 
differ in intensity level. Depending on the extent of hearing loss, the user will hear all, some or none of the 
presented tones. EasyFit  web application  will ask the user to enter th e number of tones  s/he hear s. A 
selection of screen shots of the fitting process with the EasyFit web application are shown in Figure 3 . 
EasyFit  web application  can activate 4 different “clusters” in the hearing aid. “Clusters” in this context 
means different hearing aid settings. Those settings are the s ame with respect to hearing aid feat ures, e.g., 
noise reduction etc., but they differ in frequency dependent g ain, compression and MPO (maximum power 
output). EasyFit  uses the result of the profiling procedure to select and activate the cluster  and master gain 
setting  that is most suitable for the user. In case of an asymmetrical hearing loss the cluster can diffe r 
across sides. A short additional test ensures the overall gain is comfortable and balanced between the left 
and right ears. After the fitting is completed, the user may further use  EasyFit  to fine -tune the hearing aid 
settings during daily use.

The control hearing aid device , Signia Silk Xperience , has been commercially available in the U.S.  as a Class 
II 510(k) -exempt medical device  since July 2020 in five models: Silk 7X, Silk 5X, Silk 3X, Silk 2X and Silk 1X. 
The performance levels for each model differ in the embedded software configuration but use identical 
hardware. The Silk 1X model will be fitted to the individual hearing thre sholds by a n HCP as per standard 
clinical care. The Connexx Fitting Software will be used to fit NAL -NL2 prescriptive target verified by [CONTACT_380873] -
mic REM.  The Connexx  programming software allows the HCP access to certain programming parameters 
that are not accessible in the Vibe SF using EasyFit .  Parameters that the HCP can adjust in the Silk 1X  fitting 
are 8 adjustable gain and compression handles, Frequency Compress ion, Feedback cancellation (off, min, 
max).  Silk 1X  does support multiple programs, however only one single program (titled: universal program) 
will be used.

The EasyFit  web application guides the user through the SF procedure as well as the fine -tuning and volume 
control functionality. Subject s who start using the Silk 1X HCP fit  strategy hearing aids  will receive 
instructional material on how to use the Signia App for situation tuning  as per standard of care . 
Subject s in both groups are instructed to listen to as many listening environments as possible and enter 
their sound quality , speech understanding  and hearing aid  satisfaction ratings  when randomly prompted by 
[CONTACT_380901], and subject s may at any time self -enter a rating. The investigational staff will 
practice with the subject s until they ha ve observed that the subject  is able to successfully enter their sound

filled out in various listening condition s daily . The EMA consists of a short survey that is triggered randomly 
four times during the entire day and may also be ente red at any time the subject  wants to enter a rating.  
The EMA survey comprises of four single/multiple choice questions (or three, if the situation does not 
involve speech) which are:

4. Satisfaction  
If the timing is inconvenient (e.g., driving a car), the subject  can delay the response to the survey ( reminder 
is given to not delay the response unduly, e.g., for more than 1 hour ). 
Phone calls (approximately after 3 days +3 days field testing) are scheduled with  investigational staff. These 
calls are intended to ensure that all EMA data collection tools are functioning and subject s are reminded to 
report any adverse device effects  (ADE) occurring during field use. The subject  also has the possibilit y to 
call/e -mail the investigation staff when needed; however, to mitigate the potential for introducing bias 
through counselling of the self -fit group, any questions about the Vibe SF fitting strategy  or how to use the 
device will not be answer ed by [CONTACT_71378].   
For the subject s who start in the HCP fit  strategy  group, b ased on complaints the subject s have about 
sound quality, the audiologist/HCP is able to invite the subject  for an in -person fine -tuning visit and adjust 
the fitting on their Silk 1X  as in a real -life HCP fit ting (standard clin ical care).

incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current risk assessment .  
Note: Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome 
has been identified in the risk assessment .  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with function ing. 
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, 
the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “ serious”.]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_139458]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the s tudy intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationsh ip between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event 
onset, or an al ternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Sponsor and the independent Medical Monitor will be responsible for determining whether an adverse 
event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously desc ribed for the study 
intervention . 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of study 
personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or upon review 
by a study monitor.

Unanticipated problems are defined as problems involving risks to subject s or others to include, in general, 
any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the clinical investigation plan -related documents, such as the approved research Clinical 
Investigation Plan and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject  
population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly relate d” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
This definition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused b y, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipa ted

Protocol #: D00232675   08 September  2021  
This document may not be shown to any unauthorized person without the express permission of Sponsor.                                                                Page 42 of 70  The primary purpose of the SF Study is to validate the effectiveness of the Vibe Air  SF strategy based on the 
intended use and technological characteristics.  
 
Please refer to Section 3 for more detail about the hypotheses.  There are 3 APHAB communication 
subscales that contribute to the perceived benefit (response condition), and each su bscale benefit (EC, BN, 
RV) must simultaneously demonstrate the non -inferiority of Vibe SF  strategy to HCP fit  strategy.  Note that 
higher means are worse.  
 
• Ho EC(benefit):  ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆EC(benefit) SF > 26     vs      
Ha EC(benefit):  ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆EC(benefit) SF < 26  
• Ho BN(benefit): ∆BN(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆BN(benefit) SF > 27     vs      
Ha BN(benefit): ∆BN(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆BN(benefit) SF < 27  
• Ho RV(benefit): ∆RV(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆RV(benefit) SF > 28     vs      
Ha RV(benefit): ∆RV(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆RV(benefit) SF < [ADDRESS_477207] ´s perceived hearing aid benefit as measured by [CONTACT_380904] e hearing aid is HCP fit  
compared to when it is Vibe SF  by [CONTACT_423] .  The non -inferiority margin (NIM)  depends on the 
communication benefit subscale, according to Cox  (1995) , and these are the minimum clinically important 
differences on each of t he three communication benefit subscales.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_477208] passes (i.e., rejects all 3 null hypotheses).   
Descriptive statistics will be reported on each endpoint by f itting strategy and overall, according to the list 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. In addition, some endpoints require more detailed description.  Additional descriptive 
statistics that will be reported are listed with the endpoints.

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
The sample size was estimated for the Primary Effectiveness Objective; that is the only objective with a 
hypothesis test. The sample size of 24 was estimated using Pass 2019 and the following parameters:  
Parameter  Value  
Difference between HCP fit  and Vibe SF  
scores ( δ) 
• EC(benefit)  
• BN(benefit)  
• RV(benefit)   
• δ = ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit it - ∆EC(benefit) SF = 0 
• δ = ∆BN(benefit) HCP fit it - ∆BN(benefit) SF = 0 
• δ = ∆RV(benefit) HCP fit it - ∆RV(benefit) SF = 0 
SD (σ) of scores within a fitting strategy 
and for the difference between Vibe SF  
and HCP fit , assuming independence 
(√(2σ2))*  
• EC(benefit)  
• BN(benefit)  
• RV(benefit)   
 
 
• σ = 24.3;     σ DIFF = 34.4  
• σ = 25.6;     σ DIFF = 36.1  
• σ = 25.5;     σ DIFF = 36.2

Non -inferiority margins (NIMs)  
• EC(benefit)

• RV(benefit)  
  
• EC(benefit) = 26  
• BN(benefit) = 27  
• RV(benefit) = 28

Power  90% on all 3 tests simultaneously, or 96.5% on each 
individually (.9653 = .90)  
Alpha   5% on all [ADDRESS_477209] Type  Paired t -Tests for Non -Infer iority  
 
* The variance of the difference of two means is used, not 4 means, even though this is the difference of differences.  The rea son 
is that the baseline value (unaided) from which benefit is measured is the same for the SF period and the HCP fit  period.  
Ther efore, the difference of differences reduces to the difference between the aided SF score and aided HCP fit  score.  
  
**     All [ADDRESS_477210] p<.[ADDRESS_477211] at 80% and 90% power, as shown in the table below.  The 
NIMs were chosen because each listening condition will be analyzed independently in order to determine if 
there are significant differences in each  specif ic listening conditions.  The largest sample size required for 
combined 90% power was 23.  We will increase this to [ADDRESS_477212] s (ant icipate up to 15% 
drop out rate, 24+4) to successfully complete the study. If the parallel -arm design is used, we will increase 
this to 25 per arm (50 total subjects); for more details on this, please refer to the section on Planned Interim 
Analyses:  9.4. 6.

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
The following populations will be used in the analyses of the Primary and Secondary endpoints in this 
study.  
ITT Population : The intent to treat (ITT) population includes all subject s who received at least one 
hearing aid fitting strategy ( Vibe SF  or HCP fit ) to evaluate. This population will be used for the Primary 
Objective hypothesis test.  Missing values will be handled as de scribed i n Section 9.1.2.  
mITT Population : The modified intent to treat (mITT) population includ es all subject s in ITT population 
who have an endpoint for the analysis in question.  The mITT population will be used for the analysis of 
the Secondary Objectives. No imputation of missing values will be done for these endpoints.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
Section 9 constitutes the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for this study.  
 
The overall approach to this study is that it is an adaptive design with the adaptation being a change 
from a cross -over design to a parallel -arm design if the lat ter is necessary to avoid the interaction  effects 
possible in a cross -over design.  The high -level design with adaptation is:  
 
1. The study begins with an intended sample size of 24  (28) subject s in a randomized cross -over 
design of SF first or HCP fit  first.  There is a washout period of [ADDRESS_477214] by [CONTACT_380910] a significant interaction t erm in the analysis.   (The methods of 
analysis are described below.)  
a. If there is no interaction effect, then we continue with the cross -over design.  
b. If there IS an interaction e ffect, then we will add subject s so that we have  a minimum of 
23 per arm  (23+2, to account for drop -outs) .  (Note that we don’t need 24 to balance 
the groups like we did in the cross -over design.)   The new subject s will be randomized to 
SF or HCP fit  for one period only .  They don’t cross over.   Of th e [ADDRESS_477215] s, we  
use only their Period 1 data;  we ignore their data post cross -over.  
 
NOTE:   We will not suspend the trial while we analyze the data from the first 12.   We will continue the 
cross -over study, but if we change to the parallel -arm d esign, we will ignore the Period 2 data  (i.e., Field 
Test 2  data ).

[IP_ADDRESS]  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
This section describes the descriptive statistics that will be provided with each analysis.  The statistics 
depend on the type of variable (endpoint) that is analyzed.  All secondary objectives involve descriptive 
analyses only.  
Descriptive statistics of subject  demographics and baseline hearing status will be tabulated.  No 
comparisons will be made because the same subject s serve as Vibe SF  strategy and HCP fit  strategy 
subjects in this cross -over study.   
The descriptive statistics that will be presented will depend on the data type:  
1) Continuous data will be summarized using n, mean, SD, minimum and maximum values.  
2) Categorical data will be summarized using frequency and perce ntage.  
3) Time -to-event data will be summarized using percentages at relevant time points, along 
with effective sample size and the 95% confidence interval.  
4) Frequency (count) data will be summarized as a categorical variable if there are 5 or 
fewer values (se e #2), or as a continuous variable if there are more than [ADDRESS_477216] values 
(see #1).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONTROL OF TYPE 1 ERROR   
All hypothesis tests (of which there is only one compound test in this study, and that is for the Primary  
Effectiveness  Objective) will be conducted at α=0.05.  Non -inferiority tests (the type of test in this study) 
are by [CONTACT_380911] -tailed.  The Primary hypothesis test will be conducted in [ADDRESS_477217] a p -value of 0.05 or smaller  simultaneously . 
Although the Secondary Objectives do not include any hypothesis testing, they will not be analyzed or 
reported unless the primary hypotheses pass ( reject all 3 Hos).  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  IMPUTATION OF MISSING DATA AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES  
All attempts will be made to minimize missing data. However, if any subject s in the ITT population have 
missing primary endpoints, five (5) multiple imputations will be used for the analyses. This consists of 
imputing values for each missing value as a set (generating 5 -sets), analyzing the results for each set, 
and then pooling the results.  The Primary Effectiveness Endpoint is continuous, so the imputation 
method will be a multiple  linear regression using treatment assignment and baseline characteristics.  
SF Study   FINAL Version 1. 1 
Protocol #: D00232675   [ADDRESS_477218] passes (i.e., 
rejects H o). We will start by [CONTACT_380912], and if the Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis is not passed, 
we will chan ge one missing endpoint to a difference of [ADDRESS_477219] 
is for SPONSOR ´s information only, and  will not be used to support the study objective.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 
At the time of the visit on which the subject  is provided with his/her first hearing aid, he/she will be 
randomized to either:  Vibe SF First/ HCP fit  Second or t o HCP fit  First /Vibe SF Second.  A computer -
generated pseudo -random -number list will be used for assigning the treatment order.  Assignments will 
be made either  by [CONTACT_380913] -time on the sponsor’s EDC website on a protected 
page.

as measure d by [CONTACT_380914] (EC, BN, RV) benefit 
score  (benefit score = unaided – aided)  when the hearing aids are HCP fit  compared to when it is Vibe SF  
by [CONTACT_3433] e subject .     
There are 3 APHAB communication subscales that contribute to the perceived benefit (response 
condition), and each subscale benefit (EC, BN, RV) must simultaneously demonstrate the non -inferiority 
of Vibe SF  strategy to HCP fit  strategy.  Note that higher m eans are worse  (i.e., higher differences mean 
that Vibe SF  strategy performed worse ). 
• Ho EC(benefit):  ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆EC(benefit) SF > 26     vs      
Ha EC(benefit):  ∆EC(benefit) HCP fit  - ∆EC(benefit) SF < 26

SF Study   FINAL Version 1. 1 
Protocol #: D00232675   [ADDRESS_477221] ´s perceived hearing aid benefit as measured by 
[CONTACT_380915] .  The NIM depends on the communication benefit 
subscale, according to Cox  (1995) , and these are the minimum  clinically important differences on each 
of the three communication benefit subscales.  
Note that because of the adaptive design which entails possibly moving from a cross -over design to a 
parallel -arm design, the analysis methods must differ slightly.  Section [IP_ADDRESS] describes the analysis we 
will use for a cross -over design.  Section [IP_ADDRESS] describes how we will use the cross -over analysis for the 
interim analysis to determine if we must adapt the design.  Section [IP_ADDRESS] describes the analysis we will 
use for a parallel -arm design if we change the design.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ANALYSIS OF CROSS -OVER DESIGN DATA  
This is the final analysis that will be  used if the cross -over design is maintained throughout the study.  
Each communication benefit subscale will be analyzed using a repeated -measures analysis of variance 
(rm-ANOVA) in which the repeated (within) factors are order ( HCP fit  first or Vibe SF  first) and treat ment 
(HCP fit  or Vibe SF ); there are no between -group factors. The interaction term, order x treatment, will 
not be included because, if we use this design, it is because we have concluded that the interaction term 
is not significant.  See  Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
The hypothesis test for each communication benefit subscale will be conducted as the one -sided upper 
95% confidence bound of the regression coefficient on treatment. If this value is less than the NIM for 
that communication benefit subsca le, the null hypothesis will be rejected (at α=0.05, by [CONTACT_380916]).  The p -values for all [ADDRESS_477222] to pass (reject the global null of inferiority).  
Because Sponsor  would like to report a global p -value for these tests, the  3 p-values will be combined 
into a single value using the weighted harmonic mean (WHM) (Good, 1958)  (Wilson, 2019)  (Vovk & 
Wang, 2019) : 
pWHM = ∑ wi / ∑ (wi / pi)        i=1….L  
where L= 3, the number of order tests being combined into one subscale score.  The weights (w i ) are set 
equal to 0.3333…  They are weighted  equally because the scores are calculated with each component 
weighted equally. This method does not require the independence of the tests.  Although this method 
can be anticonservative, it has been shown to be very close to the intended false positive ra te when the 
pWHM is close to 0.05.  Since the sample was sized for this p -value, the pWHM should be neither 
conservative nor anti -conservative.  
Descriptive statistics for  the treatment groups for each of the three communication benefit subscales, 
EC(benefi t), RV(benefit), BN(benefit), at each time point will also be reported.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  INTERIM ANALYSIS OF CROSS -OVER DESIGN FOR DETERMINATION OF DESIGN 
APPLICATION  
An interim analysis will be conducted to determine if the design will be changed from a cross -over to a 
parallel -arm design.  The analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_380917] (SF vs HCP FIT ) will be known to Sponsor .  A nuisance parameter 
will be estimated and tested  for significance to decide whether to change the design.  
The analysis will be conducted as follows.  
Each communication benefit subscale will be analyzed using a repeated -measures analysis of variance 
(rm-ANOVA) in which the repeated (within) factors are o rder ( HCP fit  first or SF first) and treatment ( HCP 
fit or SF); there ar e no between -group factors. The interaction term, order x treatment, will be included 
to determine whether it is necessary to change from a cross -over design to a parallel -arm design.  This is 
the nuisance factor that is the crux of the adaptation. The presence of an interaction term means that 
the difference in benefit (i.e., the treatment effect) differs by [CONTACT_75775].  In this case, we cannot combine the 
estimate of HCP FIT -first benefit with HCP fit -second, and similarly for SF -first and second.   Here is the 
visua l representation of the effects  in the following Figures a, b and c : 
a) Treatment (TX) Effect        b)    TX, Order Effects                                  c)   TX, Order, Interact ion Effects  
        
HCPF = HCP fit  
 
Figure (a) shows an effect of treatment only.  The score with SF, averaged over SF First and SF Second , is 
different from the average score of HCP fit.  The scores for SF are the same for both orders, and that is 
also true for HCP fit, so there is no or der effect.  The difference between SF and HCP fit is the same for 
both orders, so there is no intera ction effect.  
 
Figure (b) shows an effect of treatment and of order.  The average SF score is lower than the average 
HCP fit score, and the averages are lo wer when SF is first than when HCP fit is first.  However, the 
difference between SF and HCP fit is the same  regardless of order, which means there is no intera ction 
effect. So, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_380866], it is possible to estimate the difference between treatments  and to 
test for the non -inferiority of SF to HCP fit . 
 
Figure (c) shows an effect of treatment and order, and also an interaction effect.  The inte raction effect 
occurs because the difference between treatments is not the same with both orders.  Compare this to 
Figure (b), in which the difference is the same.  In this case, the test for non -inferiority of SF to HCP fit 

SF Study   FINAL Version 1. 1 
Protocol #: D00232675   [ADDRESS_477223].  The interaction term will be tested be combining the p -values from the 3 
scales.  The method WHM, show in Section [IP_ADDRESS], will be used here, but in this case, it will be the 
interaction term p -values that are combined. The combined p -value will  be compared to α=0.10; if the 
null hypothesis of no interaction is rejected in favor of the hypothesis of an interaction, we will switch to 
the parallel -arm design.   
If the design is switched to parallel -arm, then subject s who have not crossed over will have only one 
treatment, and subject s who have crossed over will have only their first treatment used in the analysis 
of the parallel -arm data.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Each communication benefit subscale will be analyzed using a t -test of the benefit with SF (as described 
previously, the difference between baseline and SF score) versus the benefit with HCP fit (the difference 
between ba seline and HCP fit score).  The p -values fo r all [ADDRESS_477224] to pass (reject the global null of inferiority).  
 
Because Sponsor  would like to report a global p -value for these tests, the 3  p-values will be combined 
into a single value using the method of WHM as described as in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The p -values cannot be 
assumed to be independent because the data are from the same set  of subject s, and it is therefore likely 
that the benefit on the E C score is correlated with the benefit on the RV score, etc.  
Descriptive statistics for the treatment groups for each of the three communication benefit subscales, 
EC(benefit), RV(benefit), BN(benefit), at each time point will also be reported.

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsi bility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate inter pretation 
of data.   
 
Study visit worksheets / checklists will be provided for use as support ing source document for recording 
data for each subject  enrolled in the study.  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) 
derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.  
 
An Electronic Data Capture system will be used, created as per clinical in vestigation requirements. The 
database will be tested to verify that the design meets the specification. Data validation checks will be 
designed to be applied consistently across trial data, and all errors that are identified through data 
validation checks  should be corrected with a documentation of the discrepancy resolution.   
Clinical data (including adverse events (AEs), and expected adverse reactions data) will be entered into 
SMARTTRIAL, a [ADDRESS_477239] variable in 
the system, and that the parameters for the variable correctly store the data.  
Further details can be found in the clinical investigation Data Management Plan . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  DATA  MANAG EMENT SYSTEM   
 
SMART -TRIAL will be used as the primary Electronic Data Capture tool in this study. SMART -TRIAL is 
developed and owned by [CONTACT_380927] ( www.medei.dk ). 
Development, validation, and maintenance of SMART -TRIAL is conducted acc ording to medical device 
software and quality standards.  
 
The Sponsor will enter a contractual agreement with MEDEI ApS which clarifies how MEDEI ApS 
complies with regulatory requirements for processing of personal identifiable information according to 
applicable regulations.  
All critical actions performed by [CONTACT_380928] -TRIAL are logged both in relation to general operations 
(e.g. user creation/edit) and study specific operations. Audit logging ensures that all operations 
performed by [CONTACT_380929]. 
Validation of the system will be performed before it is being released.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  DATA SECURITY, ACCESS AND BACK -UP  
All data in SMART -TRIAL  is collected, transferred, and stored encrypted in databases, which are hosted 
on ISO certified servers that are managed  by [CONTACT_380930] (Ireland). Backups 
are performed continuously throughout the day and stored within the same country.  
 
To collect and view data, or access a study in SMART -TRIAL users must create a user account with an 
associated st rong password, which shall be used to authenticate with the system. To perform any 
security critical actions within the system, a user must be authenticated. SMART -TRIAL implements two -
step authentication for every log in, i.e. users must log in to the sys tem using their created credentials 
and confirm their authentication with a unique one -time code sent to their mobile phone or e -mail 
address. On successful authentication, SMART -TRIAL creates a unique user -session that is used to 
identify the authenticate d user.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ANALYSIS AND ARCHIVING  
 
After a proper quality check and assurance, the final data validation is run. If there are no discrepancies, 
the Statistical datasets are finalized in consultation with the statistician. Once approval for locking is 
obtained from all stakeholders, the data base is locked and clean data is extracted for statistical analysis. 
After the database is locked, no modification in the database is possible except in exceptional cases.  
 
An unlocking of the database requires proper documentation and an audit trail has to be maintained 
with sufficient justification for updating the locked database. Data extraction is done from the final 
database after locking. This is followed by [CONTACT_380931]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  ELECTRONIC AND CENTRAL  DATA VALIDATION  
 
Data validation will be completed on a regular basis. Quality control audits of all key performance and 
safety data in the database will be made after the sites complete enrolment. The entire database will be 
re-validated to ensure that there are no outstanding data discrepancies prior to database lock. Any 
changes to the database after that time will require joint written agreement between Clinical Affairs  and 
Clinical Data Management. Concomitant Medications an d Adverse Events entered into the database will 
be reviewed and assigned the appropriate codes by [CONTACT_5944].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
The Investigator will be responsible for data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_380869]. Data required 
accordin g to this Clinical Investigation Plan must be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) 
as soon as possible.  
If the Investigator relocates, or for any reason withdraws from the clinical investigation, the Sponsor 
should be prospectively notifie d. Subjects' hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380870].

The Sponsor, in consultation with clinical investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) may 
determine that the protection of a subject ’s safety, welfare, and rights is best served by [CONTACT_205519] a 
study subject  in the trial as per the protocol or by [CONTACT_380932].  
Due to the fact that the device is a non -significant risk  device, with no or very limited expected Adverse 
Events, no increased risk to safety is expected in the case that the patient cannot come bac k for a

Protocol #: D00232675   [ADDRESS_477245] report this finding to the FDA within five working days [§812.150(b)(9)]. The FDA considers 
an investigation of a non -significant risk device to have an approved IDE when the IRB concurs with the 
non-signifi cant risk determination and approves the study . 
The sponsor also must comply with the abbreviated IDE requirements under  §812.2 (b) : 
• Labeling - The device must be labeled in accordance with the labeling provisions of the IDE regulations 
(§812.5 ) and must bear the statement "CAUTION  Investigati onal Device. Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or United 
States) law to investigational use.";  
• IRB Approval – The sponsor must obtain and maintain Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval 
throughout the investigation as a non -significant risk device study ; 
• Informed C onsent – The sponsor must assure that investigators obtain and document informed consent 
from each subject according to  [ADDRESS_477246] s, unless documentation is 
waived by [CONTACT_255487] §56.109(c);  
• Monitoring - All investigations must be properly monitored to protect the human subjects and assure 
compliance with approved protocols (§812.46). Guidance on monitoring investigations can be found in 
Guideline for the Monitoring of Clinical Investigations.  
• Records and Reports - Sponsors are required to maintain specific records and make certain reports as 
required by [CONTACT_380933].  
• Investigator Records and Reports – The sponsor must assure that part icipating investigators maintain 
records and make reports as required (see Responsibilities of Investigators); and  
• Prohibitions –Commercialization, promotion, test marketing, misrepresentation of an investigational 
device, and prolongation of the study are  prohibited ( §812.7 ). 
 
Background  
The Vibe Air is a n investigational  self-fitting air conduction hearing aid that is intended to compensate for 
impaired hearin g and incorporates technology, including software, that allows users to program 
independently their hearing aids. This technology integrates user input with a self -fitting strategy and 
enables users to independently derive and customize their hearing aid fitting and settings.

Document No: D00230228 Version 1, Clinical Study Doc – SF System Verification Activities Overview  
- SF System  
Risk assessment identified risks of over -ampli fication or misuse of the device, which are mitigated by 
[CONTACT_380934].  
Mitigations to prevent over -amplifications include a saf ety output limiter which is a hardware measure 
for limiting the  OSPL in failure mode. Hence, for the implemented cluster, the safety limiter is [ADDRESS_477248] of the specific cluster. Other mitigation measures include performance testing as 
electr oacoustics and software verification and validation.  Critical use -related scenarios (critical tasks) 
and essential functions have been identified and will be tested and validated in Human Factors testing.  
The risks associated with the use of the SF system  are acceptable when weighted against the ex pected 
benefits to the study subject s. The benefit outweighs the overall residual risk.  
- Comparison to Bose Hearing Aid  
 
The principles of operation, performance and repeatability of the self -fitting feature have been a subject 
of research for a number of years. In October [ADDRESS_477249] for De Novo

 II, self -fitting air -conduction hearing aid.  FDA created a new classification regulation (21 C.F.R. § 
874.3325) identifying this device type as a wearable sound amplifying device that is intended to 
compensate f or impaired hearing and incorporates technology, including software, that allows users to 
program their own hearing aids. This technology integrates user input with a self -fitting strate gy and 
enables users to independently derive and customize their heari ng aid fitting and settings.

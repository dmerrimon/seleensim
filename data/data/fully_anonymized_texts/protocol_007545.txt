COMIRB Protocol #14- 1711 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_589879]: 01/23/[ADDRESS_777022] common cancer worldwide, with about 45,220 new cases diagnosed 
in the US in  2013 [1,2].  Given its nonspecific subtle presentation, close to 50% of patients with pancreatic 
cancer unfortunately have metastatic disease by [CONTACT_589889], with average 5- year 
survival of approximately 6% [2].  
 Neoadj uvant chem oradiat ion therapy in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
has become standard of care and is associated with higher rates of  complete resection without 
microscopic evidence of residual tumor (R0 resec tion), lower rates of lymph node positivity, and 
improvement of overall survival in this patient population [3,4].  Radiation therapy to a soft tissue organ 
such as the pancreas can be difficult, as it is not readily visualized radiographicall y.  In the past, bony 
structures have been us ed as  surrogate markers for approximation of the pancreas.  However, respi[INVESTIGATOR_589880].  Thus, image guided radiation t herapy (IG RT) is a commonly implemented 
modality for delivering high doses of radiation directed at cancer tissue, while reducing collateral damage 
to adjacent healthy tissue  [5,6].  Fiducials, which are inert radiographic markers  typi[INVESTIGATOR_589881], can be placed in and around the tumor to delineate tumor margins to allow for IGRT.  
 
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_589882].  This has traditionally been 
accomplished with the use of 19-guage or 22-guage fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) needles [7-14].   To prepare the needle for fiducial placement, one to two fiducials are manually back -load ed into the tip of t he 
needle after the stylet has been removed.  Different size fiducials are used for different gauge needles.  In 
order to hold the fiducials within the needle, sterile lubrication or bone wax can be applied [21].  Once the pancreatic mass has been targeted, fiducial  inject ion can be accomplished via stylet reinsertion or sterile 
water injection [15,16].   
 Currently, back -loading the fiducials is the only option for  preparing delivery of fiducials via the EUS 
approach.   Difficulties asso ciated with fiducial  loading and deployment can increas e procedure duration 
due to cumbersome fiducial back -loading, fiducial misplacement  & migration, as well as inability to pass 
the fidicual marker through the needle due to endoscope angulation.   
 Multiple observational s tudies rangi ng from [ADDRESS_777023] sited a technical success rate of 86-
100%  using 19 and/or 22 gauge needles [8,10-14, 17-19], with average procedure time between 7-12 
minutes [12] using the fiducial back -loading technique.  
 A new mode of fiducial delivery has  recently been developed that hopes to circumvent some of the 
technical issues inherent to traditional fiducial marker loading and deployment.  In a feasibility study by 
[CONTACT_589890],  a prototype 22-G auge EUS needle preloaded with four fiduci als were use d in a porcine 
model to test ease of deployment,  technical success, accuracy, EUS visualization of the needle, fiducial 
visualization on EUS as well as fluoroscopy and CT, as well as time for placement and adverse events.   
Fiducial deployment  was succe ssful 95.6% of the time with all 172 fiducial markers deployed on 
predetermined targets.   Using a 5 point Likert scale, needles were deemed easy to pass, relatively easy to 
COMIRB Protocol #14- 1711 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_589879]: 01/23/[ADDRESS_777024] visualizat ion.  In addition, time 
for deployment was on average less than 60 seconds.  
 
To date, there is no randomized controlled trials comparing total duration of time needed for placement of 
fiducials using the traditional back -loadi ng technique of fiducial marke rs to the new preloaded needles in 
regards to EUS based fiducial marker placement for IGRT in pancreatic cancer.  
 
1.2 Hypotheses and Endpoints  
 
Hypotheses  
1) Use of a [ADDRESS_777025] 60%  of the procedure time that it takes for  traditional back -loaded 
22G needles, improving overall procedure efficiency.  
2) Use of a 22 G preloaded needle for EUS guided fiducial mark er placement in pati ents with pa ncreatic 
cancer will maintain comparable technical success and adverse event rates when compared to 
traditional back -loaded  22G needles.  
 
Primary Aims 
1) To compare the procedure time of 22G needle placement of  three Visico il fiducial markers and 22G 
need le preloaded fiducial markers.   
  
Secondary Aims  
1) To compare endpoints of technical success defined as proper placement of three fiducial markers in a 
pancreatic neoplasm in 22G needle placement of Visicoil  fiducial markers and 22G needle pr eloaded 
fiducial markers.   
 2)  To compare adverse event rates in 22G needle placement of Visicoil fiducial markers and 22G needle preloaded fiducial markers  
 
1.3. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report :  To date, there are no preliminary studies of the above 
proposed study.

A. Description of Population to be Enrolled.  (Appendix AP1)  
Inclusion Criteria:  
• Patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer referred for IGRT.  
 
Exclusion Criteria : 
• Age <18  
• Inability to  consen t 
• Known c oagulopathy/thrombocytopenia (INR >1.5, platelets <75 ) 
• Patients on antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication that cannot safely  be discontinued 5-7 
days prior to the procedure  
• Gold allergy  
• Current infection       
• EUS evidence of vessel interfer ing with path of fiducial marker

B. Study Design and Research Methods: Patients with pancreatic cancer referred for fiducial marker 
placement for IGRT will be eligible for enrollment in the study.  Eligibility of st udy enrollment will be 
determi ned pri or to the endoscopic evaluation.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_589891] a copy of the consent form sent to the s ubject 
prior to the EUS procedur e (please see Append ix AP2  for copy of phone script).  The consent form will 
then be reviewed in person either in the pre-operative endoscopy unit or in the gastrointestinal clinic if pre-procedure consultation was obtained.  Prior to the patients undergoi ng EUS evaluation, patients wi ll be 
excluded from the study if they meet any of the exclusion criteria as listed above. All patients who are not 
excluded from the study as outlined above will be eligible for the study.  
 
Patients without a previous diagnos is of pancreatic cancer but ar e referred for  EUS guided FNA of a   
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_589883] a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer can be made 
by [CONTACT_63689]-site by a cytopathologist , and the stage dictates that they will need IGR T based on clear 
discussion wi th the radiation oncologist, oncologist and surgeon. In this situation fiducial markers may be 
placed in the same setting.   
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE (Fig. 1 ) 
Once the patient is consented for the study, randomization wil l then be performed using stratified (based 
on location of the tumor –  head/neck vs. body/tail)  block randomization .  The patients will  undergo Linear 
EUS, as previously described by [CONTACT_589892]. and have fiducial marker placement via a traditional  
22G back -loaded needle (Visi coil) [22] or the new 22G preloaded needle (PreLoad4).  Multiple endpoints 
will be recorded, including total length of procedure, how many markers are successfully deployed, and 
technical success (Ease of passage of  delivery s ystem, ease of deployment of f iducials, EUS visualization 
of delivery system needle, EUS visual appearance of fiducials, and time for fiducial placement defined as 
starting time of removing the needle from its packaging and ending time as removal of needle after final 
marker deployment ).  Pro cedure time will be recorded by a research assistant at each site.  Fiducial 
marker location will be confirmed via fluoroscopy at time of placement  and on 4D treatment planning CT 
ordered by [CONTACT_589893].  
 Patient s will be di schar ged home after post procedure recovery.  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_589894] a 
research coordinator  or endoscopy staff  24-48 hours and 7-10 days  after the procedure to document any

 C. Description, Risks, and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools.    
 
Recording of Complications  
Complications will be defined as any deviation from the clinical course after the procedur e. All 
adve rse event data will be collected during the study period and graded as:  
 
Minor : nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain  
Major : perforation, pancreatitis, major bleeding,  infection,  transfusion secondary to major bleeding, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], arrhythmia, hypot ension, death  
 
The investigator at each site will assess each adverse event with respect to severity and relationship to 
the study interventions. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_6811] 24- [ADDRESS_777027] proc edure  (See Appendix AP5/6 ). All adverse events (whether 
or not considered device-related) must be reported immediately (within 48 hours) to the study coordinator, 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_589897] n of the case  report 
form (CRF). Those adverse events that meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event will be reported 
additionally on a Serious Adverse Event CRF. The investigator at each site will make the determination 
regarding reportability of any AE or SAE t o their respective IRB.   The University of Colorado will be the 
central site for all SAE reporting at any site within 24 hours of the occurrence.  They will also control 
randomization, and receive/manage AE/SAE reporting and D SMC . A group of PIs  at the cance r center 
DSMC will review all reports every 6 months.  SAE reporting will be reviewed within 24 hours, and all sites 
and IRBs  (per IRB policy) will be informed within a 12-24 hour period of the event and review regarding 
whether the SAE was thought to be potentially related to the study/new device.    
 
Monitoring and Oversight 
The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, in 
addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial includi ng any spec imens collected, 
executing the data and safety monitoring (DSM) plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight 
from the Data and Safety Monit oring Commi ttee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer 
Center (CU Cancer Center).  The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and study 
participant safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center, which is the coordin ating institution 
of this tria l.   A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as follows:  
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all unanticipated adverse device effects, serious adverse events (SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs) and reportable adverse events (AEs)  
• Has the authority  to close and/or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues  
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s Executive Committee  
 Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs ar e reported to 
the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor investigator per protocol.  All SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs 
including unanticipated adverse device effects are to be reported to the DSMC within 5 business 
days of the sponsor investigator receiving notificatio n of the oc currence. 
COMIRB Protocol #14- 1711 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_589879]: 01/23/[ADDRESS_777028]’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_589885].  Data regarding number of subjects, adverse device effects, treatment 
modifications and treatm ent responses will be discusse d and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  
The sponsor investigator is responsible for organizing and conducting regularly scheduled 
teleconferences with all participating sites.  The sponsor investigator will also be responsi ble for 
including data from al l of the participating sites to include the minutes from these regularly 
scheduled teleconferences between the sponsor investigator and the sites within the overall trial’s six month DSM report.  
The sponsor investigator will p rovide a DSM report  to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a six month 
basis. The DSM report will include a protocol summary; current enrollment numbers; summary of 
adverse device effects to include specific unanticipated adverse device effects, SAEs, UAPs and 
AEs; any treatment mo difications ; all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments.  The DSM 
report submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis 
conducted.  Results and recommendations from the review of t his six month repor t by [CONTACT_589898] a DSMC review letter.  The sponsor investigator 
is then responsible for ensuring this letter is submitted to the site’s IRB of record at the time of IRB 
continuing review . 
 
Quality Control and Quality  Assur ance 
Site monitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_16170]’s authorized representative on a regular basis, pursuant to the Monitoring Plan. During these visits, information recorded on the 
CRFs will be ver ified against sourc e documents .  Additional computer programs that identify 
selected protocol deviations, out -of-range data, and other data errors within the electronic data entry 
may also be used to help monitor the study.  As necessary, requests for data clarification or 
correction w ill be sent to the appropriate site PI.  
Independent auditors from the sponsor investigator’s authorized representative will be allowed by 
[CONTACT_779]’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_16158].  In addition, audits may be conducted at any time by [CONTACT_589899]/or  the IRB.

At UCD,  eligible p atients who consent to the study will have their  data captured in a password protected 
database through Redcap.  Protected Health Information will be de-identified after extraction, and each 
subject assigned a unique random number. This database will be st ored in a password-protected 
database, in a password-protected folder on the secure server behind the UCD firewall.  The information will, at all times, only be able to be accessed by [CONTACT_255038]-investigat ors.  All study 
personnel have compl eted HIPAA and CITI training in human subjects’ research.  In order to de-identify 
patients from their health information a spreadsheet will be created that assigns a number to each patient.  
The legend will be stored separately in a passw ord-protect ed folder for patient numbers.  Once the data

protected.  
  
Regarding multicenter data,  any institutional data will be shared via encrypted email to the primary site 
(UCD).  At UCD, the Case Report Forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_564258]'s investigators and study coordinators periodically thr oughout the conduct  of the tri al to review adverse events  
 
 
D. Potential Scientific Problems.    
Factors that could threaten our ability to obtain meaningful generalizable knowledge from this study  would 
be lack of patient followup to reevaluate fiducial marker location.  How ever, as pati ents are having this 
procedure performed for cancer therapy, it is unlikely that there will be a large proportion of patients who 
are lost to followup.  
 
E. Data Analysis Plan.   This section should include:  
 
For Quantitative analyses:  
i)  Stat istical Ana lysis: Categorical variables will be summarized with counts and percentages 
whereas continuous covariates will be summarized with means and standard deviations (SD). For evaluation of the demographic data a Fisher’s exact test  or Mann-Whitney U test will b e 
performed as applicable.  
 
ii) Success rates for each of the two arms will be calculated as a proportion of number of 
successfully deployed f iducial markers over the total number of patients in whom this was 
attempted within the study populati on. This will be reported as a percentage. Comparison of 
successful deployment of f iducial markers by [CONTACT_589900]’s exact test.  Similarly, comparison between the two arms will be performed for technical 
success, proce dure time, adverse event rate, rate of migration, ease of fiducial deployment, 
and visualization of needle and fiducials via EUS and CT  by [CONTACT_417393]’s exact test. When 
data is ordinal, comparisons will be made using Mann-Whitney U tes t.  
 
Sample Size:  
 
Sample size  calcu lated for the primary aim showed that in order to detect that the PreLoad4 device can 
be delivered in at least   60% of the time it takes to deliver a fiducial marker by [CONTACT_3382] -loading, for an 80% 
power and alpha of 0.05 (t wo-sided)  a minimum  of  20 patients will be required in each arm.  
 
Randomization:  
Patients will undergo central block randomization (5 blocks of 4 per stratified arm  at each 
center ) stratified based on tumor location (head/neck vs. body/tail ).  This will b e performed by 
a computeri zed binary number generator at the University of Colorado, who will control 
randomization for all sites . The arm that the patient will be randomized to will be determined 
by [CONTACT_589901].

 F. Sum marize Know ledge to be Gained.    
 
This study offers the potential to illustrate a significant clinical difference in overall reduction in 
procedure duration between the current type of back -loaded fiducial deployment needl e 
(Visicoil  fiducials) and a novel  preloaded fiducial deployment needle, thus offering potential for 
increased efficiency .  This information would be useful to both endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_589886] n.

HELLO--I am [ name]  a [role (e.g. medical doctor/clinical investigator/study coordinator) at the University of 
Colorado Denver.  You are currently scheduled to have an endoscopic ultrasound, also known as an 
“EUS”, for fiducu ial marker plac ement performed at the Univers ity of Colorado Denver on [date] for 
marking of your pancreatic cancer prior to undergoing chemoradiation therapy.  
 
I wanted to tell you a little bit about a study to see if you would be interested in participat ing.  Is now a 
good time? (if ‘yes ’, proceed per b elow.  If ‘no’, say “Is there a better time that I can call back?” If ‘yes’, 
thank the patient and call back repeating the above script.  If ‘no’, thank the patient for their time, and say 
“That’s OK.  Thank you for your ti me.  We look forw ard to seei ng you at your scheduled EUS on [date].  
Take care.”  Hang up phone.  
 Thank you.  Before I get started, I want to inform you that agreeing or declining to participate in this study 
in no way affects the quality of care you wil l receive nor will it affect y our future follow -up with this 
institution beyond the scope of the study.  
We are currently conducting a research project to identify whether the use of one type of fiducial marker 
needle takes less time to use t han the use of th e current fiducial marker ne edle.     
 
The name [CONTACT_589903] “Comparison of traditional back -loaded fiducial needles with preloaded 
fiducial needles in EUS -guided fiducial marker placement for image-guided radiation therapy in patients 
with panc reatic cancer: A multicent er randomized controlled trial” .  Fiducial marker placement performed 
via EUS is traditionally performed at our institution with a 22G needle.  This needle requires manual 
loading of the fiducial markers one at a time, and can l ead to prolonged pr ocedure tim es.  A new type of 
fiducial marker needle has been designed, which has [ADDRESS_777036].  Would you prefer an email or a sent packet for further reading material and 
the consent form?  (If email, ask for email address.  If mail, ask for mailing address).   
 
Thank you for your t ime.  We look  forward to seeing you at your procedure.  Please make sure to bring all 
your forms and any questions you may have for your treatment team and the research team.  Take care. (Hang up phone).

3.0 BACK GROUND  AND RA TIONA LE 
 
3.1 Esophageal cancer 
 
In 2007, t here will be  an estimated 15,560 n ew cases of esophageal cancer, with 13,940 
estimated deaths.1 The large majority of esophageal cancers are classified as squ amous cell 
carcinoma  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_856109]/middle  thirds of  the esophagus) or 
adenocarcinoma  (distal esophagus or gastroesophageal (GE) junction). 
While squamous cell carcinoma  used to be  the predomin ant histolo gical subtype, this is no 
longer the case in the  [LOCATION_002] and Western Europe. In the  U.S., the  incidence of 
adenocarcinoma  of the distal esophagus, GE jun ction and gastric cardia has increased 4%  to 
10% per year among U.S. men since [ADDRESS_1192165] screening procedure for esophageal cancer, 50%  of patients p resent 
with m etastatic disease, where chemoth erapy is the  mainstay of palliative therapy. Even for 
patients with lo calized dis ease, surgery alone results in 5 -year survival of only about 20 %, 
with the  remainder of patients d evelopi[INVESTIGATOR_856110].4 The addition of  neoadjuvant 
chemoth erapy or chemoradiotherapy to su rgery results in 5 -year survival of no mo re than 25- 
35%.5,6 
 
For patients with m etastatic or recurrent dis ease, chemoth erapy results in respons es in 20 -40% 
of patients and m edian survivals of only 8-[ADDRESS_1192166] chemotherapy included 
continuous in fusion fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, the  administ ration of  which is 
cumbersome  and requires placement of central intravenous access. Gastrointestinal and oth er

chemoth erapy drug (docetaxel) to the  standard two -drug regimen, resulting  in a modest 0.6 
month imp rovement in ov erall survival, but at the expense of significant hematologic toxicity 
(including  a 29% rate of febrile neutropenia versus 12%  with 5 -FU/cisplatin).8 
Clearly, there is a need for more active and tol erable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
3.2 Vas cular endothelial g rowth factor (VEGF) and anti-angiogenic therapy 
 
Folkman and oth ers have provided compelling evidence linking tumor  growth and m etastases 
with angiogenesis.[ADDRESS_1192168] cancer and clinical out come, 
including  the incidence of metastases as well as overall and relapse-free survival.10,11 
 
Of the identified angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth  factor (VEGF) is the  most 
potent and sp ecific and has been identified as a crucial regulator of both no rmal and 
pathologic angiogenesis. VEGF  produces a numb er of biologic effects, including  endoth elial 
cell mito genesis and mig ration and indu ction of  proteinases, leading to remodeling of the 
extracellular matrix, increased vascular permeability, and m aintenance of survival for newly 
formed blood v essels.[ADDRESS_1192169] 
cancer15. 
 
Our group h as previous ly performed a multi-center phase II evaluation of  bevacizumab and 
cisplatin/irinotecan in p atients with advanced gastric and GE jun ction adenocarcinoma.16 The 
addition of  bevacizumab to cytotoxic chemoth erapy significantly improved the time-to- 
progression (8.3 months; 95%  CI, 5.5 to 9.9 mont hs) and ov erall survival (12.3 months; 95% 
CI, 11.3 to 17.2 months)  of patients, compared to a  historical time-to-progression of  5 months. 
Therapy was well-tolerated, although a 6% incidence of gastric perforation or near-perforation 
and a 2% incidence of myocardial infarction w ere noted. 
 
Sunitinib, an oral multi -target tyrosine  kinase inhibitor  (TKI) that has activity against VE GF 
receptor (VEGFR), has also und ergone preliminary evaluation in advanced gastric cancer.17 In 
data presented at ASCO 2007, in a  multicenter phase II trial, 42 p atients received sunitinib as 
second-line therapy. Of these, two p atients (5%) had a PR while  another 15 (36%) had SD. 
Median TTP  was 17.1 weeks, while  median OS  was 50.7 w eeks. To xicities were comparable 
to those  seen on oth er trials with sunitinib. Significant grade 3/4 to xicities included hand-foot

reaction (10%), fatigue (10%) and anorexia (10%). Grade 3/4 h ematologic toxicities included 
neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (29%) and anemia (14%). 
 
There are limited data to indicate what would be  the expected progression free survival in 
patients either on suppo rtive care alone, or receiving an inactive second line  therapy. 
Erlotinib w as inactive in our  adenocarcinoma  patients, and PFS was 1.6 months.  Th ree other 
trials of EGFR TKI’s, two limit ed to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, in dicated PFS of 1.9- 
2.[ADDRESS_1192170] ant metastasis, and with a  poorer survival outcome.18 
 
In esophageal adenocarcinoma, increasing expression of  VEGF  correlates with the  transition 
from Barrett’s esophagus to high grade dysplasia, and with the  transition from mi croinvasive 
to locally advanced cancer.19,[ADDRESS_1192171] that angiogenesis is a  viable and attractive target for therapy in advanced 
esophageal and GE jun ction cancer. 
 
3.4 Ras/Ra f/MEK/ERK pathway in esophageal cancer 
 
The mitogen-activated protein kin ase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays a critical role in 
transmitting  proliferative signals generated by [CONTACT_856125]. Because derangements in the MAPK pathway have been link ed to a 
numb er of human malignancies, m any of its aberrant and critical compon ents are potential 
therapeutic targets in h uman cancers.[ADDRESS_1192172] consists of  the ras family of oncogenes and encoded proteins. Ras plays 
a central role in an intricate array of signal transduction p athways, characterized by [CONTACT_12783]-talk, 
feedback loops and multi -compon ent signaling complexes.24,25

The Raf serine/threonine  kinases are the principal effectors of Ras in the  MAPK pathway. Raf 
activation o ccurs imm ediately downstream of  membrane and cytoplasmic receptors that relay 
mitogenic signals. 
In turn, Raf activation l eads to the  downst ream activation and phospho rylation of  MEK 
(mitogen-activated protein kin ase kinase) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase).[ADDRESS_1192173] that it may be active. 
In one study, activation of ERK and Raf was identified in 63.3%  and 60.3%  of squamous 
esophageal cell carcinoma specimens respectively, whereas normal mucosal epi[INVESTIGATOR_856111]. Mo reover, a close association w as observed between ERK expression and the 
differe ntiation grade, with the  ERK signal greater in poo rly differentiated tissu es than in w ell 
and mod erately differentiated tissu es.[ADDRESS_1192174] is thou ght to be activated by [CONTACT_856126][INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR), a member of the ERBB growth factor receptor tyrosine  kinase 
family. EGFR protein expression h as been reported in 30%  to 70%  of esophageal cancers and 
has been correlated with  poor patient out come and inferior response  to conventional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].28 
In a prior phase II evaluation of  erlotinib, an anti-EGFR TKI, as second-line therapy for 
patients with advanced esophageal cancers performed here at MSKCC, 2 of  30 patients (7%) 
had a partial respons e.29 Both of  these patients h ad squ amous cell histology  and EGFR 
overexpression by [CONTACT_856127] (IHC) staining. 
In a phase II evaluation of gefitinib, another anti-EGFR oral TKI, as second-line therapy for 
patients with advanced esophageal cancers, 36%  of tumo rs were found to  express 
phospho rylated ERK (pERK) by [CONTACT_88304].30 How ever, there did not appear to be  a 
differe nce in response  to gefitinib th erapy between pERK-positive  and pE RK-negative 
patients. 
 
3.5 Sorafenib 
 
3.5.1 Pre-clinical rationale 
 
Sorafenib (BAY 4 3-9006) is an oral multi -kinase inhibitor  with effec ts on tumor  proliferation 
and tumor  angiogenesis.[ADDRESS_1192175] the  tyrosine  kinases for VEGFR 
and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, as well as Flt-[ADDRESS_1192176] the  serine/threonine

including  renal cell carcinoma  (RCC ), colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular 
cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer cell lines.[ADDRESS_1192178] rated in a phase II 
randomi zed dis continu ation t rial in p atients with m etastatic RCC .40 In this stu dy, all patients 
were treated with so rafenib 400 mg  BID and were assessed at 12 weeks. Patients with tumor 
shrinkage ≥25%  continu ed on op en-label sorafenib and patients with tumor  growth ≥25%  
were taken off-study. Patients with tumor  shrinkage or tumor  growth < 25% were randomi zed 
to receive either sorafenib or placebo. At [ADDRESS_1192179] -randomi zation, 50%  of the sorafenib 
patients w ere progression-free, compared to on ly 18% of patients receiving placebo. Sorafenib 
significantly prolonged median progression -free survival from randomi zation v ersus pl acebo 
(24 versus 6 w eeks; p=0.009). 
 
The most common adverse events w ere fatigue (73% of patients), rash/desquamation (66%), 
hand-foot skin reaction (62%), pain (58%) and diarrhea (58%). The  majority of these events 
were grade 1/[ADDRESS_1192180] 
common grade 3/4 adverse event was hypertension, whi ch was obs erved in 31% of patients; 
antihypertensive  therapy was initi ated in 46%  of patients. 
 
3.5.3 R enal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
 
Based on t he promising  phase II results, a  multicenter, doubl e-blind randomized phase III 
evaluation of  sorafenib [ADDRESS_1192181] acebo was und ertaken.41 The primary endpoint 
of the trial was overall survival (OS), with p rogression -free survival (PFS) as a secondary 
endpoint. Patients with advanced RCC with good performance status following one prior 
systemic therapy were randomi zed to either sorafenib or  blinded placebo w ith best suppo rtive 
care.  
From Nov ember [ADDRESS_1192182] rated a statistically significant benefit for sorafenib 
over placebo. As su ch, the study was unblind ed in M ay 2005 and so rafenib was offered to 
patients who w ere initially randomi zed to receive placebo. 
 
At the  time of cross-over, an interim analysis of  OS was conducted. M edian OS  in the  placebo 
group was 14.7 months and had not b een reached in the  sorafenib group  (hazard ratio 0.72;  
95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94, p=0.02). The threshold for statistical significance for this int erim 
analysis was not reached (p< 0.0005 ).

Final analysis of  OS was reported at ASCO 2007.42 Median OS  in the  sorafenib group was 
17.8 months and 15.2 months in the  placebo group (hazard ratio 0.88, p =0.15). For this stu dy, 
however, OS was likely confounded by [CONTACT_856129]. Indeed, OS analysis with pl acebo 
patients censored at the time of crossov er indicated that sorafenib treated patients h ad a 
statistically significant 22% reduction in mo rtality risk compared to pl acebo patients (OS 17.8 
months v ersus 14.3 months; h azard ratio 0.78, p =0.03). 
 
Median PFS was 5.5 m onths for sorafenib v ersus 2.8 months for placebo (p<0.0001 ). 
Sorafenib w as associated with a  reduction of  56% in the  independently-assessed risk of 
progression (hazard ratio 0.44; 95%  CI, 0.35 to 0 .55). 
At the  May 2005 cutoff, among  the 451 evaluable patients in the  sorafenib group, 1 patient 
had a complete response  (<1%), 43 had a partial response  (10%) and 333 had stable disease 
(74%). Amo ng 452 p atients in the  placebo group, no patient had a complete respons e, 8 had a 
partial response  (2%) and 239 h ad (53%) stable disease. Significantly more patients in the 
sorafenib group had a partial response  or stable disease (p<0.001 ). 
 
In December 2005, the  U.S. Food and D rug Adm inistration (FDA) approved sorafenib for the 
treatment of patients wi th advanced RCC . 
 
3.5.4 H epatocellular carcinoma 
 
A multi center, randomi zed, placebo-controlled, double-blind ph ase III trial of sorafenib in 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) was reported at ASCO 2007.43 In the  SHARP 
study, 602 p atients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A, with no p rior systemic therapy 
were randomi zed to receive either sorafenib 400 mg BID (n=299) or placebo (n=303). In 
February 2007, b ased on a planned interim analysis of OS, the study group recomm ended 
unblinding  and closure of the study. Median OS  in the  sorafenib group w as 46.3 w eeks versus 
34.4 w eeks in the  placebo-treated group. This represented a 44% increase in median OS 
(hazard ratio 0.69, p =0.001). Median PFS was also si gnificantly increased in the  sorafenib 
group (24 w eeks) versus the  placebo group (12.3 weeks) (hazard ratio 0.58, p =0.[ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
In a prior open-label, single-arm, multi center phase II evaluation of  sorafenib in H CC led by 
[CONTACT_27156], Abou -Alfa et al. demonst rated that higher tumor  expression of  pERK as 
determined by [CONTACT_856130] e-to-progression compared 
to patients whose  tumo rs had low er levels of pERK expression (p=0.0003 ).[ADDRESS_1192183] indicated pot ential fatal bleeding 
compli cations with the  use of the VEGF targeted agent bevacizumab (48,49 ).  How ever, the 
registration t rial in N CSLC reported a small but finite rate of fatal pulmon ary hemorrhage in 
non squ amous cancers.  Recent non sm all cell lung  cancer studies have also included

including  bevacizumab and sunitinib, w ere safe and tol erable in squ amous  cancer of the head 
and neck.  No ne of these trials reported bleeding compli cations th at led to dis continu ation of 
the trials. 
 
Two recent reviews dis cussed the  historical experience of bevacizumab in NSCLC, and 
recent trials of VEGF-tarted agents (48,49 ).  The initial randomi zed phase II trial combining 
bevacizumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel in 99 p atients with N SCLC reported an 
increased incidence of fatal pulmon ary hemorrhage associated with squ amous cell histolo gy; 
6 events occurred in 62 patients receiving bevacizumab, five were fatal.  Six patients h ad 
centrally located tumo rs, 5 h ad cavitation, and 4 were squamous  cell.  This observation l ed to

bevacizumab to chemotherapy.  However, pulmon ary hemorrhage was more common on the 
bevacizumab arm (1.9% in 434 p atients v ersus 0.2%  in 444 p atients), including  5 cases of 
fatal pulmon ary hemorrhage in 1.2%  on the  bevacizumab arm. 
 
Other trials reviewed included a trial combini ng gefitinib with the  VEG F-targeted agent 
sorafenib, in N SLC indicating no dose  limiting  toxicities in 32 p atients.  A  phase II trial of 
sorafenib in N SLC reported one  one pulmon ary hemorrhage (fatal) in [ADDRESS_1192184] been reported in 20  patients to d ate. 
 
In a recently reported phase II trial, 22 p atients were treated with sunitinib in recurrent or 
metastatic head and neck cancer (50).  One partial response  was obs erved, but the  trial was 
closed due  to failure to achieve efficacy endpoint s.  Vascular compli cations in cluded 2 
pulmon ary hemorrhages, one primary tumor  bleed, and 2 g astrointestinal bleeds.  The  
authors reported the  agent as well tolerated and again the  trial was not closed or amended for 
toxicity concerns. 
 
In a recent phase II trial, 25 p atients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer 
received pemetrexed in combin ation with b evacizumab (51).  2 grade 3 tumor bleeds were 
observed, and 1 from a  gastric ulcer, and one  patient had a fatal tracheal tumor bleed that the 
authors claimed was not t reatment related but caused by [CONTACT_856131] g.  The  trial

A recent report updated results on a  trial treating 18 patients with recurrent or metastatic head 
and neck cancer with the  combin ation of  cetuximab and bevacizumab (52).  Respons es were 
seen in [ADDRESS_1192185] studi es to show a  benefit for an EGFR TKI combin ed with chemoth erapy; indeed this is 
the only phase III trial in p ancreatic cancer that has yielded a survival benefit compared to 
gemcitabine alone.  On the  other hand, the  EGFR targeted antibody cetuximab failed wh en 
combin ed with chemoth erapy in pancreatic cancer. This is in contrast to the  single agent 
activity for cetuximab, and even greater activity when combin ed with chemoth erapy, in 
colorectal cancer; cetuximab also has some  limited sin gle agent activity in esophagogastric 
adenocarcinoma. 
 
Similarly, bevacizumab in combin ation with chemoth erapy consist ently improves response 
rates, progression free, and often overall survival in t rials in colorectal, breast, and non sm all 
cell lung cancer; how ever, in p ancreatic cancer, no benefit of any sort was seen for 
bevacizumab in combin ation with chemoth erapy.  Lastly, in b reast cancer, whereas 
cetuximab, erlotinib, and gefitinib h ave all failed to yield any signal of activity, the broader 
spectrum HER  tyrosine  kinase inhibitor  lapatinib, which inhibits HE R-1 (EGFR) and HER-2 
tyrosine  kinases, has single agent activity and benefits chemoth erapy effectiveness as well. 
Lapatinib how ever has failed in recent trials in esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.

with the  VEGF  receptor and the  PDGF  receptor, also targets the  serine/threonine  kinases Raf-

4.0 OVERVIEW OF  STUDY D ESIGN/IN TERVENTION  
 
4.1  Design 
 
This is a  single instituti on, op en-label, non -randomized, ph ase II evaluation of  sorafenib 400 
mg BID in p atients with  metastatic or recurrent esophageal or gastroesophageal (GE) junction 
squamous cell carcinoma  or adenocarcinoma. 
 
Patients m ay have received up to two p rior chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic dis ease 
or up to th ree prior regimens if they received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemoth erapy or 
chemoradiotherapy. All patients must be  able to provide  informed consent prior to enrollment. 
 
See Section [ADDRESS_1192187] ess 
develops or  if patient consent is withd rawn. 
 
The primary endpoint w ill be 2-month p rogression -free survival (PFS). With a total of [ADDRESS_1192188] 90% power to detect an imp rovement in the  2-month PFS from a  historical 
control of 50% to 70%  with type I error rate of 10%. Secondary endpoints in clude the 
response  rate to so rafenib and its toxi city.  Our basis for PFS estimate in this p atient 
popul ation comes from our prior phase II trial of erlotinib in esophageal cancer (which had 
essentially no activity in adenocarcinoma  of the esophagus), and nearly identical PFS results 
reported for this p atient popul ation t reated with either erlotinib or  gefitinib (1.6-2.0 months 
PFS in all studi es) (54-56). 
 
Patients must h ave measurable disease and will undergo a comput erized tomo graphy (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest and abdom en at baseline, after the first 
four weeks of therapy, at eight weeks, and every eight weeks thereafter, with a scheduling 
window of  up to one  to fourteen (1-14) days.  If a complete response  is achieved and

assessment will be  by [CONTACT_13407].45 The same imaging modality performed at baseline 
(CT or MRI) will be  repeated at subs equent im aging. 
 
Therapy will be  administ ered in the  outpatient setting, with each cycle consisting  of 28 days 
of continuous  therapy. The cycle start date will coincide with the  physician visit d ate.  A stu dy 
diary will be  completed by [CONTACT_856132] (see Appendix

Patients will be  required to take antacid therapy to reduce the potential for gastrointestinal 
bleeding. Allow able agents in clude but are not limit ed to ranitidin e, om eprazole, carafate or 
similar agents.

Route of Orally 
Administration: 
 
Sorafenib is suppli ed as 200 mg  tablets. The  dose of sorafenib is 400 mg  orally twice daily for 
28 days (continuous ly). There is no pl anned interruption b etween treatment cycles. The  cycle 
start date will coincide with the  physician visit d ate. Because of the potential need for 
physician visit s cheduling to vary (due to both p hysician and patient issu es), to avoid viol ation 
of, and deviation from, t he protocol, th ese visits m ay vary by [CONTACT_281764] (1-14) 
days. 
 
Sorafenib will be  taken in the  outpatient setting on Days 1-28 of  each 28-day cycle. Patients 
should sw allow the  tablet whole  with approximately 250 ml (8 oz.) of water each morning and 
evening,. Sorafenib tablets may be crushed and administ ered via  a feeding tube if necessary. 
 
Sorafenib should be  taken without food (1 hour  before or 2 hou rs after eating). If it is t aken 
with m eals, patients will be  instructed to t ake sorafenib with a  low- to mo derate-fat diet. A 
high fat meal causes a decrease in sorafenib absorption (a 29% decrease in sorafenib area- 
under-the-curve (AUC) concentration and a 38% decrease in sorafenib m aximum 
concentration (Cmax) value). 
 
Dose  modifications for sorafenib are detailed in Section 11.5. Patients will be  taken off 
sorafenib at disease progression.  
 
Drug metabolism interactions: Sorafenib is p rimarily metabolized by [CONTACT_856133]: 
CYP3A4-mediated oxidation and UGT1A9 -mediated glucoronidation.[ADDRESS_1192191] of CYP3A4 indu cers on the  pharmacokinetics of 
sorafenib.33 Inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. rifampin, Hypericum perforatum also known  
as St. John’s wo rt, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, and dexamethasone) may 
increase metabolism of  sorafenib and thus d ecrease sorafenib pl asma concentrations.  
 
Concomitant administ ration of midazolam, d extromethorphan and om eprazole, whi ch are 
subst rates of cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, respectively, following  four 
weeks of sorafenib administ ration did not si gnificantly alter the exposure of these agents.33

This indicates that sorafenib is n either an inhibitor  nor a clinically meaningful indu cer of these 
cytochrome P450 iso enzymes. 
 
Sorafenib is also known to inhibit CYP2C9 in vitro. Substrates of CYP2C9 include warfarin 
and digoxin. How ever, the previous ph ase III evaluation of  sorafenib v ersus placebo for 
advanced renal cell carcinoma  did not reveal a significant di fference in PT/INR between both 
groups, s uggesting that sorafenib m ay not have in vivo inhibito ry activity against CYP2C9.33 
Nevertheless, routine  monitoring of the PT/INR for patients on coumadin therapy is 
warranted. 
 
Availa bility: Following  submission and approval of the required regulatory documents, a 
supply of sorafenib m ay be ordered from Bayer Pharmaceuticals.

7.0 RECRUI TMENT PLAN 
 
This will be  a single institution, ph ase II study. Patients with m etastatic or recurrent 
esophageal and gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer who are eligible will be  identified 
for enrollment. No additional measures, e.g. advertisement, payment to patients, will be 
employed to recruit patients. 
 
Inclusion of women and minorities 
 
The investigators take due notice of the NIH poli cy concerning inclusion of  wom en and 
minorities in clinical research popul ations. Th ere will be  no limit ation with  regards to 
race or gender. 
 
Our institution al demographics for accrual of patients on esophageal and GE jun ction 
cancer trials reflect the national incidence of this dis ease. 10-15% of our patients h ave 
been wom en. African-American males (almost exclusively with esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma) comprise 3-5% of patients treated on protocol. Giv en that our protocol 
accrual closely reflects the national incidence of this dis ease, no sp ecific strategy will be 
undertaken to recruit w omen or persons of  color on this trial. 
 
This p rotocol/project does not in clude children because the numb er of children with 
esophageal and GE jun ction cancer is very small and because the majority are already 
accessed by a nation-wide pediatric cancer research network. This st atement is based on 
exclusion 4b of  the NIH Policy and Guid elines on  the Inclusion of  Children as 
Participants in Research Involvi ng Hum an Subjects.

Immunohistochemistry for pERK 
 
Phospho rylated extracellular signal-regulated kin ase (pERK) determination th rough 
immunohisto chemical (IHC) staining of prior paraffin sto red tumor  blocks or unstained 
slides. pE RK determination m ay be pending at the time of protocol registration, with p rior 
material submitt ed for IHC during the course of protocol therapy. The  pERK status is not 
required for enrollment on the  protocol.  Studies will be  performed at MSKCC. 
 
Whenever possibl e, the most recent tumor  biopsy/patholo gic specimen prior to stu dy 
enrollment will be  used. 
 
Paraff in-embedded tissue  should be  prepared by [CONTACT_856138] 10%  neutral buffered 
formalin. An optim al fixation time  is 12 – [ADDRESS_1192209] of  a minimum of  five unstained, positiv ely charged microscope slides with 4 – 
6 µm tissue  sections, cut from a  paraffin blo ck. The slides should be  prepared in a  37 – 42 oC 
water bath without  gelatin. On ly one 4 – 6 µm cut section is placed on each slide, opposite 
the frosted end, before the slides are allowed to air dry. 
 
pERK tissue  expression is assayed using a rabbit po lyclonal antibody for pERK (phospho - 
p44/42 mito gen activated protein kin ase [Thr202/Tyr204]; Cell Signaling Technology Inc, 
Danvers, MA). A st andard secondary biotinylated anti-mouse  antibody and streptavidin 
horseradish p eroxidase are then applied for visualization. 
 
Briefly, the procedure involves: (1) Deparaffinization and rehydration of  the tissues with 
xylene and graded alcohols; (2) Antigen unm asking by [CONTACT_856139]; (3) 
Incubation with p rimary antibody or negative control sera (non-specific mouse  IgG); (4) 
Incubation with s econdary biotinylated anti-mouse  antibody; (5) Incubation with st reptavidin 
horseradish p eroxidase; (6) Incubation with subst rate and chromog en (DAB) (7) 
Counterstaining the tissue  with h ematoxylin-eosin; (8) Mounting  with an aqueous cover slip 
medium and; (9) Microscopy. 
 
A positive  control cell line  (derived from a  gastrointestinal stromal tumor  cell line  that 
expresses pERK) is included with each assay. Each specimen is reviewed after staining for 
the presence of tumor  cells, the  localization of  pERK staining to the  cell nuclei or the 
cytoplasm, the  staining intensity and the  proportion of  tumor  cells that stain positiv e. pERK 
staining is graded semi-quantitatively using a five-point s cale: 0, no st aining; 1+, weak; 2+, 
moderate; 3+ strong  and; 4+, intense.

11.3 Laboratory abnormalities 
 
The following  laboratory abnormalities were observed in the  randomi zed phase III trial of 
sorafenib in p atients with  advanced renal cell carcinoma33: 
 
 
Elevated lipase and amylase: Elevated lipase and amylase levels were very common ly 
reported. Grade 3/4 lip ase elevations o ccurred in 12%  of patients in the  sorafenib group 
compared to 7%  of patients in the  placebo group. Grade 3/4 amylase elevations w ere reported

in 1%  of patients in the  sorafenib group compared to 3%  of patients in the  placebo group. 
Clinical pancreatitis w as reported in 2 of  451 s orafenib treated patients (Grade 4) and 1 of  451 
patients (Grade 2) in the  placebo group. 
 
Hypophosphatemia: Hypophosph atemia was a common l aboratory finding, obs erved in 45% 
of sorafenib treated patients compared to 12%  of placebo patients. Grade 3 hypophosph atemia 
(1–2 mg/dl) occurred in 13% of sorafenib-treated patients and 3%  of patients in the  placebo 
group. T here were no cases of Grade 4 hypophos phatemia (< 1 mg/dl) reported in either 
sorafenib or  placebo patients. The  etiology of hypophosph atemia associated with so rafenib is 
not known.  
 
Lymphopenia: Grade 3/4 lymphop enia was reported in 13%  of sorafenib treated patients and 
7% of placebo patients. 
 
Neutropenia: Grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 5%  of sorafenib treated patients and 2%  
of placebo patients. 
 
Anemia: Anemia was observed in 44%  of sorafenib-treated patients and 49% of placebo 
patients. G rade 3/4 anemia was reported in 2%  of sorafenib-treated patients and 4%  of 
placebo patients. 
 
Thrombocytopenia: Thrombo cytopenia was obs erved in 12%  of sorafenib-treated patients 
and 5%  of placebo patients. G rade 3/4 th rombo cytopenia was reported in 1% of sorafenib- 
treated patients and 0%  of placebo patients. 
 
 
11.4 Special warning and precautions for use 
 
Dermatologi cal toxicities: Hand-foot skin reaction (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) and 
rash represent the  most common adverse drug reactions with so rafenib. Rash and hand-foot 
skin reaction are usually Grade 1/[ADDRESS_1192212] six weeks of 
treatment with so rafenib. Management of dermatologic toxicities may include topi[INVESTIGATOR_856115], temporary treatment int erruption and/or  dose modification of 
sorafenib, or  in severe or persistent cases, permanent dis continu ation of  sorafenib. See Section 
9.2.4 for suppo rtive measures and Table 11.5.1 for suggested dose modifications for hand-foot 
reaction. 
 
Hypertension: An in creased incidence of hypertension w as obs erved in s orafenib-treated 
patients. Hypertension was usu ally mild to mod erate, occurred early in the  course of treatment 
and w as amenable to management with st andard antihypertensive  therapy. Blood pressure 
should be  monito red regularly and treated, if required, in accordance with standard medical 
practice. In cases of severe or persistent hypertension, or  hypertensive  crisis d espi[INVESTIGATOR_856116], permanent dis continu ation of  sorafenib should be  consid ered. See 
Table 11.5.2 for suggested dose  modifications for treatment-emergent hypertension.

Amended: 05/12/15  
- 28 -  
  
Hemorrhage: An in crease in the  risk of  bleeding may occur following  sorafenib 
administ ration. The  incidence of severe bleeding events is un common.  If any bleeding event 
necessitates medical intervention, it is recomm ended that permanent dis continuation of 
sorafenib be  consid ered. 
 
Wound healing complications: No formal studi es of the effect of sorafenib on wound 
healing have been conducted. In patients und ergoing major surgical procedures, temporary 
interruption of  sorafenib therapy is recomm ended for precautionary reasons. There is limit ed 
clinical experience regarding the timing  of reinitiation of  therapy followi ng major surgical 
intervention. Th erefore, the decision to resume  sorafenib th erapy followi ng a major surgical 
intervention should be  based on clinical judgment of  adequate wound h ealing. 
 
Cardiac Ischemia and/or Infarction: In the  phase 3 randomi zed stu dy of sorafenib in 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, the incidence of treatment-emergent cardiac 
ischemia/infarction events was higher in the  sorafenib group (2.9%) compared with the 
placebo group (0.4%).[ADDRESS_1192213] able coronary artery disease or recent myocardial 
infarction w ere excluded from this stu dy. Sorafenib should be  discontinu ed in p atients who 
develop cardiac ischemia and/or  infarction. 
 
Gastrointestinal perforation: Gastrointestinal perforation is an uncomm on event and has 
been reported in <1% of patients taking sorafenib.[ADDRESS_1192214] and use machines: No studi es on the  effects of sorafenib on the 
ability to drive or use machines have been performed. Th ere is no evidence that sorafenib 
affects the  ability to drive or operate machinery. 
 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment:  In vitro and in vivo data indicate that sorafenib is 
primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_4852].  Systemic exposure and safety data were comparable in 
patients with Child-Pugh A and B hepatic impairment.  Sorafenib h as not been studi ed in 
patients with Child-Pugh C hepatic impairment.  No dose  adjustm ent is n ecessary when 
administ ering sorafenib to patients with Child-Pugh A and B  hepatic impairment. 
 
 
Patients with Renal Impairment: Sorafenib h as not b een studi ed in p atients with s evere 
renal imp airment (CrCl <30 mL/min)  or in patients und ergoing dialysis. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, I mpairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity studies have not 
been performed with so rafenib.  Sorafenib w as clastogenic when tested in an in vitro 
mammalian cell assay (Chinese Hamster Ovary) in the  presence of metabolic activation. 
Sorafenib w as not mut agenic in the  in vitro Ames bacterial cell assay or clastogenic in an in 
vivo mouse  micronucleus assay.  One  intermediate in the  manufacturing process, whi ch is also 
present in the  final drug substance (<0.15%), was positive  for mutagenesis in an in vitro 
bacterial cell assay (Ames test) when tested independently.  No sp ecific studies with so rafenib

and seminal vesicles, central necrosis of  the corpora lutea and arrested follicular development. 
Sorafenib-related effects on the  reproductive organs of  rats were manifested at daily oral 
doses =30 m g/m2 (approximately 0.5 tim es the  AUC in cancer patients at the recomm ended 
human dos e).  Dogs showed tubul ar degeneration in the  testes at 600 m g/m2/day 
(approximately 0.3 tim es the AUC  at the recomm ended hum an dos e) and oligospermia at 
1200 m g/m2/day of sorafenib. Ad equate contraception should be  used during therapy and for 
at least 2 w eeks after completing therapy. 33 
 
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of sorafenib in p ediatric patients have not b een 
studied.  Repeat dosing  of sorafenib to  young and growing dogs resulted in irregular 
thickening of the femoral growth pl ate at daily sorafenib dos es =600 m g/m2 (approximately 
0.3 tim es the  AUC  at the recomm ended human dose), hypocellularity of the bone marrow 
adjoining  the growth pl ate at 200 m g/m2/day (approximately 0.1 tim es the  AUC  at the 
recomm ended human dose), and alterations of  the dentin composition at 600 m g/m2/day. 
Similar effec ts were not observed in adult d ogs when dos ed for 4 weeks or less. 
 
Geriatric Use:  In total, 32% of RCC patients treated with so rafeniab were age 65 years or 
older, and 4%  were 75 and older. No di fferences in safety or efficacy were observed between 
older and younger patients, and oth er reported clinical experience has not id entified 
differe nces in respons es between the elderly and younger patients, but  greater sensitivi ty of 
some  older individu als cannot be  ruled out.  
 
Drug-Drug Interactions: Caution is recomm ended wh en administ ering sorafenib together 
with compounds th at are metabolized/ eliminated predomin antly by [CONTACT_192643]1A1 p athway 
(e.g. irinotecan) 33 
 
CYP3A4 indu cers: Th ere is no clinical information on the  effect of CYP3A4 indu cers on 
the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
Hypericum p erforatum also known as St. John’s wort, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenobarbital, and dexamethasone) may increase metabolism of  sorafenib and thus 
decrease sorafenib pl asma concentrations.  
 
CYP3A4 inhibito rs: K etoconazole, a potent inhibitor  of CYP3A4, administ ered once daily 
for 7 days to h ealthy male volunt eers did not alter the mean AUC  of a single 50 mg  dose 
of sorafenib. Th erefore, clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of  sorafenib with CYP3A4 
inhibito rs are unlikely. 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 09-016A(9) 
Amended: 05/12/[ADDRESS_1192216] rates: The  possible  effect of sorafenib on the  metabolism of  the CYP2C9 
subst rate warfarin was assessed indi rectly by [CONTACT_264355]. The mean changes from 
baseline in PT-INR were not hi gher in sorafenib patients compared to pl acebo patients, 
suggesting that sorafenib did not inhibit w arfar in metabolism in vivo. How ever, patients 
taking warfarin should h ave their INR checked regularly. 
 
CYP isoform-selective substrates: Concomitant administ ration of  midazolam, 
dextromethorphan and omeprazole, whi ch are substrates of cytochromes CYP3A4, 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, respectively, followi ng [ADDRESS_1192217] ration did 
not si gnificantly alter the exposure of these agents. This indi cates that sorafenib is n either 
an inhibitor  nor a clinically meaningful indu cer of these cytochrome P450 iso enzymes. 
 
Combin ation with oth er anti-neoplastic agents: In clinical studi es, sorafenib has been 
administ ered tog ether with a variety of other antineoplastic agents at their common ly used 
dosing  regimens, in cluding gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, do xorubicin, and irinotecan. 
Sorafenib h ad no effect on the  pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin. 
Concomitant treatment with so rafenib resulted in a  21% increase in the  AUC of 
doxorubicin. When administered with i rinotecan, whose  active metabolite  SN-[ADDRESS_1192218], there was a 67-120%  increase in the  AUC  of SN- 
38 and a 26-42% increase in the  AUC  of irinotecan. The  clinical significance of these 
findings is unknown. H owever, caution is recommended wh en administ ering sorafenib 
with do xorubicin and wi th compounds th at are metabolized/elimin ated predomin antly by 
[CONTACT_192643]1A1 p athway (e.g. irinotecan). 
 
Warfar in: Infrequent bleeding events or  elevations in the  International Normalized Ratio 
(INR) have been reported in some  patients taking w arfarin while  on so rafenib th erapy. 
Patients taking warfarin concomitantly should be  monito red regularly for changes in 
prothrombin tim e, INR and for clinical bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_156198]. 
 
11.5 Dose  delay/modification 
 
Intrapatient dose  reduction will  be allowed depending on the  type and severity of toxicity 
encountered provided that criteria for patient withd rawal from stu dy treatment have not b een 
met. The  dose levels for sorafenib are as described below: 
 
Starting dose 0 Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily 
Dose  level -1 Sorafenib 400 mg daily 
Dose  level -2 Sorafenib 400 mg every other day 
If further dose reduction is required, the  patient should be  taken off-protocol. 
 
Patients who require a treatment delay of >4 consecutive weeks should also be taken off-

Adverse events associated with the  use of a drug in hum ans, wh ether or not consid ered drug 
related, include the followin g: 
• An adverse event occurring in the  course of the use of a drug product in p rofession al 
practice. 
• An adverse event occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional. 
• An adverse event occurring from d rug abuse. 
• An adverse event occurring from d rug withd rawal.

be reported as an adverse event even if it is not related to the  investigational product. 
 
11.6.2 Serious adverse event (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in d eath. 
• Is life-threatening. 
• Requires in-patient hospit alization or  prolongation of  existing  hospit alization. 
• Results in p ersistent or significant dis ability or incapacity. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.

Documentation must be  suppo rted by [CONTACT_36927]’s file. A laboratory test 
abnormality consid ered clinically relevant, e.g., causing  the subject to wit hdraw from the 
study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or  judged relevant by 
[CONTACT_093], should be reported as an adverse event. Each event should  be described in 
detail along with st art and stop d ates, severity, relationship to inv estigational product, action 
taken and out come. 
 
11.7 R eporting of serious adverse events (SAE) 
 
Each serious adverse event must be  follow ed up until resolution or  stabilization, by 
[CONTACT_856142]. An isol ated laboratory abnormality 
that is assigned grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE, unl ess the 
investigator assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 
baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be  reported as 
an SAE, sp ecifically when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_154109]/ exclusion criteria. 
 
When required, and according to local law and regulations, s erious adverse events must be 
reported to the  Ethics Committ ee and Regulatory Autho rities. 
Serious adverse drug-related events should  be reported to Bayer/Onyx.  In the event of such 
an event, the  investigator should refer to the  Pharmacovigilance section of  the contract for

fractions of  centimeters). 
 
Tumor  lesions within a  prior radiation field are considered measurable as long  as disease 
progression h as been documented in th ese lesions after prior radiotherapy. 
 
12.2.2 No n-measurable disease 
 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease), including  small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm using 
X-ray or <[ADDRESS_1192234] or MRI scan), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, l eptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, in flammatory breast dis ease, abdominal masses (not follow ed by [CONTACT_462]), 
and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
 
12.2.3 Target lesions 
 
All m easurable lesions up to a  maximum of  five lesions p er organ and 10 lesions in tot al, 
representative of all involv ed organs, should be  identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be  selected on the  basis of  their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
[CONTACT_14217]). A sum of  the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be  calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be  used as 
reference by [CONTACT_856143] e. 
 
 
 
12.2.4 No n-target lesions 
 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline. Non-target lesions in clude measurable lesions th at exceed the 
maximum n umbers per organ or total of all invol ved organs as well as non -measurable 
lesions. M easurements of  these lesions are not required but the  presence or absence of each 
should be  noted throughout follow -up.

Ultrasound (U/S). U/S should not be  used to m easure tumor  lesions.  It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of  superficial palpable lymph no des, subcutaneous 
lesions and thyroid nodu les. U/S  might also be  useful to confirm the  complete disappearance

Endos copy/laparoscopy. The utilization of  these techniqu es for objective tumor  evaluation h as

techniqu es for objective tumor  response  is not p ermitted. How ever, such techniqu es can be 
useful to confirm pathological complete response  when biopsi es are obtained.

• Patient becomes pregnant; 
• Non-compli ance by [CONTACT_88821] p rotocol requirements; 
• Patient is lost to follow -up. If the patient fails to return for follow -up evaluations, every

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a  single instituti on, op en-label, non -randomized, single-arm ph ase II evaluation. The 
primary objective of this study is to d etermine the 2-month p rogression free survival (PFS) for 
patients with advanced or recurrent esophageal and gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer 
who are treated with so rafenib 400 mg twice daily. PFS is defined in Section 12.6.  
 
The historical control 2 month PFS for patients with unt reated advanced esophageal and GE 
junction cancer is approximately 50%[ADDRESS_1192241] binomi al single stage design we 
require 35 patients to di fferentiate between 2-month PFS of 50% and 72%  with type I and II 
error rates of 10% each. If [ADDRESS_1192242] approximately 89% 
power to detect an imp rovement in the  response  rate from 5%  to 18%  with a type I error rate 
of 10%. 
 
If at any time there are 14 or more deaths or  progressions b efore 2 months then the  trial will 
close as it is m athematically impossible  to achieve the desired endpoint.  
 
We assume  an accrual rate of 1-2 patients p er month for a study duration of  18-35 months.  
 
 
Secondary endpoints involve  an assessment of the overall response rate (complete and partial 
respons es), as determined by [CONTACT_13407]. Toxicities will also be  assessed and tabulated. 
While the small sample size precludes any definitive  conclusions about di fferential respons es 
based on the  squamous cell carcinoma  and adenocarcinoma  histolo gies, any differences 
observed between the two histolo gies may be exploratory and hypothesis-generating. 
Finally, tumor  tissue  will undergo immunohisto chemical staining for phosphorylated 
extracellular signal-regulated kin ase (pERK). Any differe ntial response  based on di fferent 
levels of pERK tumor  expression will simil arly be hypothesis-generating.  Fisher’s exact test 
will be  employed to inv estigate these exploratory analyses.

16.2 Data and safety monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_540284] 2001. The  plans address the  new 
policies set forth by [CONTACT_11095] “Policy of the National Cancer Institute 
for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http:// cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/ind ex.html . The  DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monito red by [CONTACT_30591]. The  MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monito ring Plans can be found on the  MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.ms kcc.org/irb/ind ex.htm 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_540286], safety 
and qu ality. There are institution al processes in pl ace for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monito ring, compli ance and data verification audits, th erapeutic respons e, and staff education 
on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus th ere are two 
institution al comm ittees that are responsible  for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials 
programs. The  committ ees: Data and Saf ety Monitoring Committ ee (DSMC) for Phase I and 
II clinical trials, and the  Data  and Saf ety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical 
trials,  report to the  Center’s Research Council and Institution al Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be  assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monito ring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponso red, 
in-house  sponso red, ind ustrial sponso red, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed and 
the monito ring procedures will be  established at the time of protocol activation 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF  HUMAN SUBJECTS 
Inclusion of women and minorities 
MSKCC has filed forms HHS  441 (civil rights), HHS 641 (handicapped individu al), HHS  
639-A (sex discrimination) and HHS  680 (age discrimination); we  also take due notice of the 
NIH/ADAM HA poli cy concerning inclusion of  women and mino rities in clinical research 
popul ations. Patients of  all races, both m ales and female, will be  enrolled into the  protocol. In 
the [LOCATION_001] metropolit an area, there is a high proportion of  minority patients (e.g. African- 
American, His panic). In general, about 15%  of patients at MSKCC are members of minority 
ethnic groups. We will actively try to recruit mi nority patients to this p rotocol. 
 
Exclusion of children and lactating or pregnant women 
 
Children are excluded from this  protocol because there is insu fficient data to determine the 
safety of sorafenib in children. In addition, the  incidence of esophageal cancer in children is 
very low. Similarly, lactating and pregnant wom en are excluded because of the potential 
teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of sorafenib.

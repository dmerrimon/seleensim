 Page 12 of 30 7.3.2  Speech Perception Measures:  
All speech perception testing will be conducted using recorded stimuli presented 
from a single loudspeaker in , at a minimum , a single -walled sound booth capable of 
accommodating  the calibrated speaker orientation. Soundfield le vels will be 
calibrated to [ADDRESS_1024608]’s head (one meter from loudspeaker).  
Speech per ception measures in the soundfield are to be administered unilaterally  for 
unilaterally implanted subje cts and bilaterally for bilaterally implanted subjects  via a 
loudspeaker at 0° azimuth at a distance of one meter from the subject. Speech 
signals will b e presented at 60 dBA.  
Devices will be removed from the non ‐test ear (if necessary)  for unilaterally 
implanted subjects  and foam plugs will be used to isolate the test ear  for unilateral 
users .  
7.3.[ADDRESS_1024609] (Spahr et al. , 2012) is a validated test of open -set 
sentence recognition ab ility. The test will be administered in quiet at 60 dBA (target 
0° azimuth). The test is scored as total number of words correct which will be 
expressed for reporting as percentage correct. The  sentence tokens include both 
male and female speakers.  
Acute AzBio sentence testing will be performed immediately following in -office and 
remote fitting sessions, respectively. Chronic AzBio sentence testing will performed 
at the beginning of each follow -up visit.  
7.3.4  Questionnaires  
Subjects will be completing  a Mobile Device Prof iciency Questionnaire (MDPQ -16), 
subjective outcome measures questionnaire s (SSQ -12), a reimbursement 
questionnaire and a custom remote fitting satisfaction questionnaire. In additio n, 
audiologists will be completing a custom remote fitting sati sfaction questionnaire.  
Questionnaires may  be comp leted on paper or electronically  in the EDC system .

• After informed consent /assent , subject’s demographics and hearing history will 
be captured.  
• Subjects’ technical competency will be determined using the Mobile Device 
Proficiency (MDPQ -16) questionnaire  and subjects will complete a Reimbursement 
Questionnaire.  
• Speech perception in quiet will be tested using the subject’s personal sound 
processor  to determi ne eligibility for the study.  
• Audiometric thresholds are used to determine whether subje cts are considered 
to have aidable residual hearing (ARH) . Subjects no t meeting the ARH criteria 
will be fitted under the electric -only criteria (EO).  Audiometric thresholds will be 
determined for the implanted ear only for unilaterally implanted subjects and for 
both ears individually for bilaterally implanted subjects.  
➢ Bilateral subjects meeting the ARH inclusion criteria in both ears will be 
enrolled in the ARH group.  Bilateral subjects meeting ARH criteria in only 
one ear will be screen failed.  
• Subjects  who meet inclusion and do not meet exclusion criteria  are then fit wi th 
a Naída CI M DS  sound processor in the audiologist’s office. Unilateral ARH 
subjects will be fitted with an acoustic earhook and EO subjects will be fitted with 
a T-mic. Bilateral sub jects meeting the ARH criteria will be fitted with an acoustic 
earhook in both ears. Fitting parameters on the Naída CI M DS  sound processor 
shou ld mimic the parameters on the subject’s personal sound processor  as 
closely as possible and be adjusted for co mfort and sound quality as needed. 
Program settings will include two programs, one AutoSense OS program with 
and a second manually selected Calm situation  program . This will be considered 
the in -office fitting.  
• Acute s peech perception in quiet is performed  to confirm the  in-office  fitting on 
the Naída CI M DS  sound processor.  
• Adverse events  and device observations  are collected, as needed, and device 
accountability is performed.  
• Following the visit, the subject will test the Naída CI M DS  sound processor 
chronically for 2 -3 weeks during their day -to-day activities.  
7.4.3  Visit 2  
Visit 2 will occur 2 -3 weeks after Visit 1 .  
• The visit will start at the audiologist’s office with subjects completing a subjective 
outcome measures questionnaire.  
• Chronic  speech perc eption in quiet will be tested using AzBio sentences.  
• In addition,  the audiologist will introduce the remote fitti ng application to the 
subject and will pair the smartphone with the subject’s Naída CI M DS  sound 
processor. For the purposes of the study, a ded icated fitting smartphone will be 
used that is only used for remote fitting.  
• The subject will then move to the  remote fitting location. The audiologist will 
initiate the remote fi tting session through Target CI DS, and the subject will open 
the applicatio n on the remote fitting smartphone. Both parties will engage 
verbally to ensure audibility and visualization  via smartphone video  during the 
call. The audiologist then remotely connects to the subject’s sound processor  to 
begin the fitting session. The fit ting will include measurement of impedances,  
measurement of electrode -specific neural response imagin g (NRI),  programming  
of M levels, and live speech stimulation to confirm acceptability of adjustments. 
Fittings for A HR subjects will include a review of a coustic and electric cutoff 
frequencies and gains at 65 dB. Additional adjustments may be made as needed 
to ensure comfort and clarity of the Map  and to ensure acceptability of the fitting 
Evaluation of Remote Fitting in Adult and Pediatric Users of the HiResolution Bionic Ear System  
Version # 1. 2 / Version Date : May 26, [ADDRESS_1024611]’s chronic wear period.  The audiologist and subje ct will then 
confirm the completion of the fitting and both parties close their respective 
remote  fitting session applications.  
➢ Should technical issues occur during the remote fitting session, the 
audiologist will first try to mitigate the issues, for exa mple by [CONTACT_749248] a different location  in 
case of poor connection.  
➢ The audiologist will re -schedule the remote fitting session s hould the 
remote app fitting not be completed because  technical iss ues could not be 
mitigated  during the session . Adverse events  and/or device observations 
are collected and device accountability is performed, as needed.  
➢ If remote fitting cannot be completed due to non -technical reasons (e.g. 
subject was not able to suffi ciently communicate with the audiologist via 
the app), the subject will be exited from the study . Reasons for non -
completion of the remote fitting will be documented. Adverse eve nts and/or 
device observations are collected and device accountability is perf ormed.  
• After the remote fitting session  is successfully completed , the subject will re join 
the audiologist in person for  acute speech perception in quiet to confirm the 
remote fi tting on the Naída CI M  DS sound processor.  
• In addition, the audiologist and the subject each will complete a custom remote 
fitting satisfaction questionnaire.  
• Adverse events and device observations are collected and device accountability 
is performed, as needed.  
• Following the visit, the subject will test the r emotely -fitted Naída  CI M DS  sound 
processor chronically for 2 -3 weeks during their day -to-day activities.  
7.4.4  Visit 3 
Visit 3  will occur 2 -3 weeks after  the Visit 2 . 
• This visit is performed at the audiologist’s office and begins with subjects 
completing a subjective outcome meas ures questionnaire.  
• In addition, chronic speech perception in quiet will be tested.  
• Adverse events  and device observations  are collected, as needed, and device 
accountability is performed.  
• The subject will then return the Naída CI M DS  sound processor an d return to 
using their personal sound processor . Standard clinical follow -up is 
recommended after subjects exit the study.  
7.5 Withdrawal of Subje cts 
Study participants may withdraw from the study at any time, with or without reason, and 
without prejudice to further treatment. The study site Investigator(s) and/or study Sponsor 
have the right to discontinue study participants. Participants can be discontinued for the 
following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent made by [CONTACT_2299]  
• A safety concern id entified by [CONTACT_079], the Sponsor, or any third party  
• Inability of the subject to perform the tasks nec essary to provide usable data for the 
study  
• Failure to respond after three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_423]  (lost to follow -
up). Potential reasons will be documented.  
Once a subject is withdrawn or discontinued they will be required to return the Naída CI M 
DS sound processor utilized for the study. Subjects  who withdraw or who are discontinued 
from the study will be reported ac cordingly to the Institutional Review Boar d. If a subject 
was discontinued because of a device -related adverse event or serious adverse event

The above sample size calculation provide s the minimum sample size for the EO cohort. In 
addition, 5 ARH subjects will be enrolled in the study to provide confirmatory data for the 
electric and acoustic fitting mode  for subjects wearing an acoustic earhook . The incidence 
of acoustic earhook use am ong Advanced Bionics recipi[INVESTIGATOR_749240], less than 2.5% of US 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. As such, a confirmatory sample of 5 subjects is considered sufficient  in order to 
provide clinical data via  descriptive sta tistics . Outcomes after remote fitting are expected to 
be si milar between the EO cohort and the ARH group.  The total sample  size was expanded 
to 17 (12 EO and 5 ARH) as the expected dropout rate due to withdrawals  or lost to follow -
up is not expected to exceed [ADDRESS_1024614] event rate was calculated in order to provide c omplication rates. If no events are 
observed in 17 subjects, then 16.2% is the upper bound for a one -sided 95% confidence 
interval on this event rate.  
8.2 Data Analyses  
Subjects will  be analyzed separate ly for the AzBio in quiet mode for remote fitting 
(Inves tigational) and for the in -office fitting (Control) as well as the paired difference . All 
enrolled subjects that meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be included in the in tent-to-
treat (ITT) population. The analysis will be repeated for the per -protocol (PP) population 
excluding subjects with major protocol deviations. Protocol deviations will be classified as 
major if they affect data in tegrity  for the primary endpoint  or subject safety  as defined in 
Table 2  below.

8.2.1  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is chronic  speech recognition using  AzBio  senten ce 
tests  in quiet for  remote  fitting  vs. in-office fitting . Non-inferiority analysis will be 
based on a paired t -tests looking at the  mean  difference in scores (D) calculated 
from the chronic remote fitting speech perception testing (investigational ) minus  the 
chronic in -office fitting speech perception scores. Unilateral and bilateral 
involvement will be additionally considered in two separate manners for the primary 
effectiveness analysis  endpoint  to assess t he remote vs local difference. First, the 
unila teral and the bilateral subjects will be analyzed as separa te subgroups . Second, 
a linear regression analysis for the paired difference will include a covariate for 
whether the subject is unilateral (reference group) or bilateral in order to evaluate 
the laterality effect.  Clinical  significa nce is defined as ruling out a -[ADDRESS_1024615] ing the null hypotheses, indicating that  the means of the 
paired differences ar e greater  than – [ADDRESS_1024616] protocol . Multiple imputation will be used 
to analyze the primary  efficacy endpoint ( SAS PROC MIANALYZE; Little and Rubin 
[2002] ). Subject values wi ll be imputed using observed test scores and  selected 
baseline variables.

8.2.3  Analyses of Individ ual Results  
A critical difference score will be used to determine whether individual subjects 
demonstrate a significant decrease in performance between the Inves tigational 
(remote fitting ) and Control ( in-office fitting ) conditions. Specifically, the crit erion 
value for the critical difference score will be based upon the test -retest variance on 
the AzBio test. Gifford (2008) provided a set of data on [ADDRESS_1024617] deviation σ of 3.8%. The critical difference score can be  
computed based on the assumption that (1) the difference scores have a normal 
distribution, a nd (2) the difference scores are deemed significant if, under the null 
hypothesis, the probability of the difference score exceeding the critical score is 1%. 
Under these assumptions, the critical improvement (or decrement) score CS is equal 
to: 
CS = σ * b 
In the above equation, b = 2.33, the percentile of the normal curve corresponding to 
the desired values of  = 0.01, one -tailed test. Using Gifford’s σ value, the critical 
difference score for AzBio sentences is 8.9%.  
The number and percentage of subjec ts exceeding, within, and below the critical 
difference (Investigational - Control) score will be tabulated. The shift will be 
summarized for both the Experimental and Control results indicating improved, the 
same, or deteriorated. Further the difference b etween the two strategies will be 
evaluated and classified as better for the Experimental strategy, the same for both 
strategies, or better for the Control strategy. A two -sided exact binomial test will be 
used to evaluate the null hypothesis that the dist ribution of subjects showing a 
performance difference (Investigational is better or Control is better) is  distributed 
equally. This analysis will provide an additional indication of the efficacy of remote 
fitting  relative to in-office fitting  based upon in dividual data.

 Page 19 of 30 9. Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence experienced by a study 
subject when using the HiResolution System or when undergoing research procedures, whether 
or not the AE is co nsidered to be device -related. The definition of an AE also includes any event 
related to a ny study procedures o r to any underlying medical condition present at baseline that 
increases  in severity during the study. An underlying medical condition that was present at the 
time of enrollment will not be reported as an AE, but any increase in severi ty during the study w ill 
be reported as an AE .  
All device -related and non -device -related adverse events (AEs) will be tracked and reported 
accordingly throughout the study as defined above in the investigational plan and in accordance 
with require ments of  an IDE investigation . The AEs will be recorded and tracked between 
completion of the informed consent form (signed and dated) and two weeks after the participant’s 
last study visit. The number and percent of all subjects experiencing adverse events will b e 
summarized by [CONTACT_24975],  status and frequency of event. Adverse Events will be recorded and will 
include but are not limited to the following information [refer to Appendix B for Case Report Forms 
(CRFs)]:  
9.1 Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications  
9.1.1  Serious  Adverse Event  
A seri ous adverse event (SAE) is an event that: a) led to a death, or b) led to a 
serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body struct ure or of a body func tion, 
• required inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to 
body structure or a body function, or  
• led to fetal distress, fetal de ath or a congenital a bnormality or birth defect.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1024619] (ADE) is any untoward and unintended  response to a 
medical device. A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an event related to the 
device that re sulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event (SAE) or that might have led to any of the consequences if suitable action had 
not been taken or interventions had not been made or if circumstances ha d been 
less opportune.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1024620] (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety; any life threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
a device, if that effect, probl em, or death was not previous ly identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application; or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subject s. 
9.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events and adverse device effects, serious and non -serious, will be recorded on 
the Adverse Event Report Case Report Form [CRF] (see Appendix B for all CRFs). 
Information to be recorded on the CRF should include, but is not limited to:  
• Date of on set of the adverse event  
• Description of the event, duration and severity  
• Seriousness  
• Relatedness

 Page 20 of 30 • Treatment/Intervention – course of action taken  
• Outcome/Status (Resolved, Improved, Stable, Worse, Unchanged) . In case of an SAE, 
the subject must be followed until the serious adverse device effect is resolved or no 
reasonable improvement is expected .  
Investigators should immediately report any SAEs, SADEs and UADEs to Advanced Bionics 
at ClinicalResea [EMAIL_14306] . Evaluation of any SAE, SADE, or UA DE will 
be conducted promptly. Confirmed UADEs will be reported to the FDA according to 21 CFR 
Part 812.150(b) (1) within [ADDRESS_1024621] presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, this study, or those parts of the study 
presenting that risk, will be terminated  no la ter than 5 working days after the de termination 
is made and no later than 15 working days after Advanced Bionics/Clinical Research first 
received notice of the event.  
9.3 Anticipated Adverse Events  
The risks associated with the investigational products include  but are not limited to:  
• There is a possibility that speech and environmental sounds may sound different or 
louder than what the subjects are accustomed to hearing or that subjects may not like 
the sound quality of the study  sound processor  used in the study . This risk occurs with  
all change s to sound -processing, and subjects should be advised of this possibility. If a 
subject cannot tolerate using the study sound  processor or does not like the sound 
quality, they can return to using their own sound processor  with their baseline 
programming. In this event, the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
• Subjects may experience some overly loud sounds that result in discomfort. If such loud 
sounds occur, they can be stopped immediately by [CONTACT_749249][INVESTIGATOR_235712]/or the 
entire extern al device.  
• Subjects may experience neural tissue damage in the event of chronic overstimulation.  
• There is risk of facial nerve stimulation. This risk can be mitigated through 
reprogramming of the device.  
• Subjects may experience intermittent sound or short -term loss of functionality while 
wearing the device or while being programmed. The intermittency can be eliminated by 
[CONTACT_749250][INVESTIGATOR_13959], reprogramming the sound processor , or exchanging the sound 
processor . 
• Subjects may have permanent residual acoust ic or natur al hearing damage due to 
excessive acoustic power.  
• Subjects may experience skin or tissue irritation because of the device materials or the 
equipment may overheat or otherwise malfunction, causing tissue damage.  
• Subjects will be exposed to sma ll parts th at pose a choking hazard. Care should be 
taken to avoid choking and the outcomes of choking, such as endoscopic surgery or 
death.  
• Exposure to electromagnetic emissions from the device (external sound processor, 
internal device) may adversely in terfere wit h other electronic medical devices  
• Subjects should only use accessories compatible or designed for the study  sound 
processor  (such as the battery chargers) in order to avoid electric shock.  
• Static electricity can potentially damage sensitive electronic com ponents such as the 
ones used in the cochlear implant system.  
A complete listing of the risks can be found in Appendix A; all risks listed are considered 
anticipated Adverse Events. Risks are minimized by [CONTACT_749251]. At any time, subjects may discontinue use of the study sound 
processor , and return to using their own sound process or and baseline program. If subjects 
stop using the study  sound processor  during the study, they will be withdrawn from the 
study.

 Page 21 of 30 In all case, the event(s) will be recorded and the incidence of such events reported as part 
of the results analysis.  
9.4 Device Deficiencies  
Events that involve a device issue or observation need to be reported as Device 
Observations and Deficiencies (DODs) vi a the Electronic Data Capture system. Adverse 
event  reporting takes precedent over DOD reporting. Therefore it is not necess ary to report 
an event as a  DOD if it has already been reported as an AE because it led to a medical 
occurrence for the subject.  
10. Informed Consent Process  
A study site’s Informed Consent Form template  and Informed Assent Form template  with center 
specific/required language must be provided to Advanced Bionics for approval prior to submission 
to the Ins titutional Review Board (IRB). Adva nced Bionics will provide an informed consent and 
informed assent template and assistance in adapting th e template s to conform to local 
requirements (Appendix C). All informed consent  and informed assent  documents and patient 
information sheets must contai n the minimum elements as mandated by [CONTACT_8415] (21 CFR Part 50) 
and will  be subject to approval by [CONTACT_749252] .  
Before enrollment, the study will be explained to eac h prospective study candidate. Candidates 
will be asked to read the app roved informed consent form and given the  opportunity to ask 
questi ons. Once all questions have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the 
individual understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject will be asked to 
sign and d ate the informed consent form. The Investigator will provide a copy of the informed 
consent form to each subject.  The process for pediatric subjects is described in section 11.  
Study subjects will receive a small payment at each visit for their time a nd effort and will be 
reimbursed for travel related cost.  
If an amendment to the protocol changes the scope or activities associated with a subject’s 
participation, or increases the potential risk to the subject, the informed consent  and informed 
assent  forms must be revised and submitted to the IRB for review an d approval. Actively enrolled 
study participants are re -consented accordingly if affected by [CONTACT_29991]. The revised 
informed consent  and informed assent  forms must be used to obtain consent from  any new 
subject who is enrolled in the study after the da te of the approval of the amendment.  
10.[ADDRESS_1024622] (HIPAA)  
All subjects must sign a HIPAA authorization form prior to participation in the study. The 
Investigat or will prepare the HIPAA authorization form according to their institution’s policy 
and provide it to Advanced Bionics for approval. Advanced Bionics will provide a template 
HIPAA research authorization form for reference. All subjects must sign the autho rization 
form prior to participation in the study if the H IPAA information is not included in the 
institution’s informed consent.  
11. Vulnerable Population  
11.1 Pediatric  Subjects  
HiResolution Bionic Ear System is approved for use in pediatric patients between 12 m onths 
and 17 years with profound  bilateral sensorineural hearing loss , and in adults 18 years and 
up with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss . Advanced Bionics 
recognizes that the benefit/risk profiles  of remote fitting  could be differe nt among patients of 
different ag e ranges, especially with regards to pediatric patients at very young ages. 
Therefore remote fitting is intended to be used in follow -up programming of Advanced 
Bionics cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 13 years and older who are  able to self -report a 
preference  for different fitting characteristics (e.g., mappi[INVESTIGATOR_749241]).  The benefits of 
remote fitting are the same for pediatric  subjects as for adults (see section 12.1). While

 Page 22 of 30 audiological care for pediatric patients in this  age range is similar to adults, it is stil l important 
to ensure that remote fitting is a suitable option for these pediatric age group. Therefore 
Advanced Bionics is planning to enroll pediatric subjects 13 years of age and older in this 
study . After info rmed consent is obtained from a parent / legal guardian , informed assent 
will be obtained from the pediatric subject. The informed assent process will closely follow 
the informed consent process for adult subjects.   
Governing IRBs will give special conside ration to protecting the welfare of vulnerable 
subjects  per federal regulations. The study will only enroll pediatric  subjects who have the 
ability to understand the requirements of the study and who are able to communicate 
untoward experience or preferenc e for diff erent fitting characteristics , as determined by [CONTACT_3786] . After exiting the study, pediatric subjects will return to using their personal 
sound processor  and will be followed per standard clinical care.

13. Suspension or Premature Termination  
13.1 Criteria for Terminating the Study  
Advanced Bionics reserves the right to te rminate the study at any time. However, this right 
will be exercised only for valid scientific or busines s reasons, or because of issues related 
to protection of research subjects.  Investigators and IRBs will be notified in writi ng in the 
event of termination.  If the study is prematurely terminated o r suspen ded, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_749242], provide the reason(s) for the termination 
or suspension and changes to the study v isit schedule, as applicable.  Any subjects that 
have not completed the study at the time of t ermination will be required to return the study 
sound proces sor and will resume using their personal sound processor .  
No special follow -up procedures are required following the end or termination of the study 
as subject will be returning the study Naída CI M DS  sound processor  and returning to using 
their personal  sound processor . The same applies to subjects who withdraw consent or are 
lost to follow -up. Should the study be temporarily halted, subjects will be asked to return the 
study Naída CI M DS  sound  processor  until a determination is made whether the study w ill 
continue.  
13.2 Criteria for Suspending or Terminating a Study Center  
After the study begins, Advanced Bionics reserves the right to suspend  enrollment of 
subjects at a study center  or terminate a study center ’s participation in the study  at any time 
if (1)  no subjects have been enrolled, (2) the center has multiple or severe unjustified 
protocol violations or (3) the center fails to follow re medial actions for protocol violations.  
Any subjects enrolled at this center that have not completed the study at the  time of 
termination will be required to return the study sound processor  and will resume using their 
personal sound processor . 
Possible re asons for suspending or terminating a center include:  
• Investigator non -compliance.  
• Repeated failure to complete or su bmit eCRFs in a timely manner.

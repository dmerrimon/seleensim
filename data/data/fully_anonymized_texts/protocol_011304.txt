 Inclus ion/Exclusion Criteria  
 The following are inclusion criteria for the IMPROVE study.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
• A medical indication for induction of labor at a gestational age between 37 
0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks  OR an 
elective or medical indication for induction of labor at a gestational age ≥  39 0/7 completed weeks  
• Participant age ≥ 14 years old  
• Singleton pregnancy  
• Modified Bishop score ≤ 6  
• Vertex fetal presentation  by [CONTACT_292365] 
• Any membrane status  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
• Elective inductions between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 are specifically excluded  
• Known intrauterine fetal demise  
• Any uterine scar including prior cesarean section and myomectomy  
• Known major fetal congenital malformations that may impact neonatal health  
• Other evidence of fetal compromise  (such as  Category 2 or 3 tracing) before the induction begins  
• Prior induction/cervical ripening methods utilized  during this pregnancy  
• Allergy to misoprostol  
• Known u ntreated cervical infection (e.g. Gonorrhea, Chlamydia)  
• Planned cesarean section due to maternal or fetal condition  
• Any other contraindication to labor induction or misoprostol therapy

IMPROVE Study  10 
 
Date: 6/12/[ADDRESS_356806] of two survival 
curves with a limit of 4.5 hours, we will need 143 women in each group (see table below). We will recruit 300 women total to accommodate up to 5% withdrawals. We do not anticipate loss to follow -up as once women 
begin an induction, it is extremely rare  that induction is terminated. Women remain admitted to labor and 
delivery until they are discharged after delivery .

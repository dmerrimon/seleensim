Name(s) of active ingredient(s):  Berberine Ursodeoxycholate (HTD1801)  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is absolute change from Baseline to Week 18 in LFC, or absolute change from 
Baseline to the Early Termination (ET) visit for subjects who terminate the study prematurely. Absolute 
change from Baseline in LFC will be assessed  by [CONTACT_120887], Baseline LFC, and Basel ine ALT.  Comparison of  each active treatment group to 
placebo will be tested at the 5% level of significance without adjustment for multiple tests.  Secondarily, 
comparison of  the 2 active treatment groups with each other will be tested at the 5% level . 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
Relative (percent)  change from Baseline in LFC will be analyzed by [CONTACT_120888].  Normalization of LFC will be analyzed by [CONTACT_120889],  Baseline LFC, and Baseline ALT.  
All additional secondary endpoints are continuous and each will be assessed  by [CONTACT_120890].  All secondary analyses 
(except LFC) will have missing Week 18 values imputed using a multiple imputation procedure for all 
subjects with an available measurement prior to Week 18.  
Safety Evaluatio n 
Safety Endpoints:  
Adverse events and changes in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical 
laboratory values  will be used to evaluate safety and tolerability. Adverse event incidence will be 
assessed during the Double -Blind Treatment Period. Ad verse event type, relationship, severity, onset, 
and duration will be presented by [CONTACT_120891] -Blind Treatment Period.  
Safety Analysis:  
Changes in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory values will be prese nted using 
summary statistics. Numbers and percentages of the first occurrence for each adverse event will be 
presented.  
Sample Size:  
An absolute change in LFC of 5% as measured by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF has been reported to be the minimal 
clinically relevant difference b etween active treatment and placebo that correlates with histological 
improvement in NASH  (Loomba et al., 2015 , Patel et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, Harrison  and colleagues  
reported  a pooled standard deviation  of 6.3%  for changes from Baseline in LFC  (Harrison et al., 2018 ). 
Based on this standard deviation, 35 subjects in each treatment group will provide 90% power to show 
a difference of 5  percentage points  between any 2 treatment groups at the 5% level of significance.  To 
allow for a dropout rate of 10%, 39 subjects will be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.  An 
interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 subjects  complete the assessment of the 
primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size assumptions and futility through conditional power; the 
study will not be stopped for efficacy.

 Page 19 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
HTD1801 is a novel salt formed between berberine (B BR) and ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA) with a stoichiometr y of 1:1.  HTD1801  is currently being developed  as an oral 
treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) . HTD1801 is expected to dissociate 
into BBR  salt and UDCA after oral administration, which suggests that the efficacy 
and safety profiles of HTD1801 can be predicted by [CONTACT_120892] e of the individual components  
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Berberine  and UDCA have displayed wide -ranging biologic activ ity relative to liver 
dysfunction in no nclinical and clinical settings, including immunomodulatory, 
anti-inflammatory, anti -fibrotic, anti -microbial, and hepatoprotective  effects . 
Furthermore, their effects on serum lipid, hepatic lipid, and /or glucose metabolism , all 
of which are implicated in the pathogenesis  of NASH, have been well studied and 
reported in the literature.  
Given  the reported hepatotherapeutic mechanisms of BBR and UDCA , the 
pharmacologic profile of HTD1801 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) may offer patients with 
NASH a safe and effective therapy.  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd. (HighTide) is 
conducting t his proof -of-concept (POC) study  to evaluate HTD1801 in adults with 
NASH and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  by [CONTACT_120893] 
(LFC) over 18 weeks . 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
1.1.1 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis  
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) characterized by [CONTACT_120894] ( i.e., ballooning) with or without fibrosis. While the prevalence of 
NAFLD in the general population is estimated at 20 -30%,  NASH has been reported to 
affect approximately 5%  of the general population . It is generally agreed that patients 
with NASH can exhibit histological progression to cirrhotic -stage disease. 
Furthermore, several studies have reported that the most common ca use of death in 
patients with NAFLD/NASH is cardiovascular disease, w hile patients specifically 
with NASH have an increase d liver -related mortality rate  (Chalasani et al., 2012 , NICE 
CONFIDENTIAL

Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 20 2016 ). The most common comorbidities associated with NASH are reported to includ e 
obesity, T2DM, insulin resistance, hypertension,  and dyslipid emia  (Rinella 2015 ). 
It is hypothesized that different pathogenic factors lead to “multiple hits” during the 
disease progressio n from hepatic steatosis to the hepatic inflammatory  and 
hepatocellular damage components that define NASH  (Adams and Angulo 2006 , 
Weiss et al., 2014 ). Accumulation of hepatic fat  linked to insulin resistance  is 
considered the “first hit.”  Hyperinsulinemia i n the context of insulin resistance leads 
to an increased release of free fatty acids from adipocytes and myocytes, which are then 
absorbed by [CONTACT_120895] . Insulin resistance also 
promotes de novo  triglyceride synthesis  within the liver and inhibits fatty acid oxidation 
thereby [CONTACT_120896]  (Adams and Angulo 2006 ). Additional 
oxidative injury has been proposed as a “second hit,” which manifests the 
necroinflammatory component of steatohepatitis . Factors associated with obesity and 
metabolic syndrome, such as i ncreased circulating free fatty acids , excess iron, and 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth , increase levels of reactive oxygen species and produce 
cytotoxic aldehydes , which further contribute to oxidative stress and promote 
hepatocyte injury, inflammation , and apoptosis  (Basaranoglu et al., 2013 ). As 
hepatocyte injury becomes repetitive and repair dysregul ated, the liver’s normal 
wound -healing process stalls during tissue reconstruction  and progression to fibrosis 
and cirrhosis ensues  (Diehl an d Day 2017 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120863], there are no approved drugs for the 
treatment of NAFLD, or more specifically, NASH. Currently, weight loss is the only 
therapy with reasonable evidence suggesting that it is s afe, beneficial,  and may result  in 
improved histologic features of NASH. Many patients , however,  do not 
achieve  or cannot maintain goals of lifestyle modification for a long -term period  
(Vilar -Gomez et al., 2015 ). Novel pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120864].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Berberine  and Ursodeoxycholic Acid  
Berberine  is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in many different plants, with a long history 
of use in tr aditional Chinese medicine  (Caliceti et al., 2016 , Kumar et al., 2015 ).  
Berberine chloride  (BBR·Cl) is an approved antiseptic drug in China, Japan, and 
Taiwan. In the U nited States (US)  and Australia, BBR is widely used in various dietary  
supplements for a number of advertised health benefits and is grandfathered under the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND [ADDRESS_135381] (DSHEA)  in the US  (Council for 
Responsible Nutrition 1998 ). The reported multi -spectrum activity of BBR, including 
effects on glucose and lip id metabolism, hepatic steatosis , oxidative stress, 
inflammat ion, and  fibro sis suggests that BBR has the potential to treat NAFLD/NASH. 
Furthermore, clinical studies of BBR for the treatment of T2DM , hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
hypertension, and NAFLD  have yielded fa vorable results  (Cicero and Ertek 2009 , Lan 
et al., 2015 ). 
Ursodeoxycholic acid is a secondary bile acid produced by [CONTACT_120897] a 
metabolic by -product, which is approved by [CONTACT_120898] 
(FDA) for the non -surgical treatment of cholesterol gallstone dissolution (Actigall®, 
NDA 019594 ) and the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (URSO 250® and 
URSO Forte®, NDA 020675 ). Similar to BBR, UDCA activity is reported to include 
anti-oxidative stress, anti -inflammatory, anti -apoptotic, and anti -fibrotic effects , as 
well as improvement in liver injury caused by [CONTACT_120899] . In the clinical 
setting, favorable  results were reported for UDCA combination therapy compared  to 
UDCA monotherapy in  the treatment of NASH  (Xiang et al., 2013 ). 
Based on the pharmacological properties and clinical evaluation s of BBR and UDCA  
relative to  NASH and conditi ons that are most commonly attributed to its development, 
BBR and UDCA may present as good “partners” for effectively treating this advanced 
liver disease.  More information about the activity, safety, and efficacy of BBR  and 
UDCA  can be found in the HTD180 1 Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  HTD1801  
HTD1801  is expected to demonstrate a multi -functional pharmacologic  profile 
reflecting the individual actions of its active components, BBR and UDCA . These 
agents target multiple aberrant pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
NASH . The beneficial effects of HTD1801 in patients with  NASH are expected to 
include, but may not be limited to:  
• Improved insulin resistance and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism ; 
• Reduction of fat deposition in the liver ; 
• Restoration of the intestinal barrier function ;

 Page 22 • Anti-inflammatory, anti -oxidative, and anti -apoptotic effec ts; 
• Anti-fibrotic effects.  
Given the unique pharmacologic  profiles of BBR and UDCA, both additive and 
synergistic effects are expected to occur when the 2 products are administered together 
as HTD1801.  More information about the activity, safety, and effic acy of HTD1801  
can be found in the HTD1801 Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacology of HTD1801 was evaluated in vivo  in rodent and primate models of 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]/NAFLD : 
• HTD1801 was evaluated in a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_120865]-fat diet-induced Golden Syrian 
hamsters . After 8 week s, hamsters administered  HTD1801 100 mg/kg or a 
physical mixture of BBR·Cl and UDCA 100 mg/kg (molar ratio of 1:1) had 
decreased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride s, and 
malondialdehyde compared to those of a model (untreated) control group ; 
however,  the effects were enhanced with HTD1801 compared to the physical 
mixture of BBR·Cl and UDCA. Hamsters treated with the physical mixture of 
BBR·Cl and UDCA also exhibited greater decreases in body weigh t and more 
serious adverse effects than the group treated with HTD1801.  
• HTD1801 was further evaluated in a high -fat diet -induced Golden Syrian  hamster 
model of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]/NAFLD.  At doses of 50 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg 
administered intragastrically for 7 weeks , HTD1801  significantly reduced serum 
levels of TC, triglyceride , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -c), the 
ratio of TC/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL -c), and the atherosclerotic 
index value, as well as the ris k of atherosclerosis, in a dose -dependent manner. 
Hepatic lipi[INVESTIGATOR_120866], while 
hepatic  inflammation was ameliorated.  
• HTD1801 was evaluated in mal e Rhesus  monkeys with naturally -occurring 
NAFLD.  Study results indicated a dose -dependent reduction of liver steatosis. At 
30 mg/kg (equivalent to a clinical proposed dose of 1 ,050 mg/70 kg person/day) , 
HTD1801  significantly reduced liver steatosis, while a t 15 mg /kg (equivalent to 
a clinical proposed dose of 525 mg/70 kg person/day) , a decreasing trend in 
CONFIDENTIAL

 Page 23 steatosis was observed after 69 days of administration. Significant lowering of  
LDL -c, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
level s was noted , while a treatment -related decreasing trend was observed for TC, 
apolipoprotein B, and blood glucose levels.  
The nonclinical toxicity profiles of both BBR and UDCA have been extensively 
documented . A full International Conference on  Harmonisati on (ICH) M3 battery of 
nonclinical studies of UDCA was submitted in support of NDA 020675 . The toxicity 
profile of BBR was assessed in a battery o f nonclinical studies conducted and/or 
revie wed by [CONTACT_120900] P rogram. These studies include single -dose oral 
studies in mice and rats, in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxicity studies, and reproductive  and 
developmental to xicity studies in mice and rats  (National Toxicology Program 2002 , 
2003c , a, b, 2010 ). 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity profile s of HTD1801 have been evaluated in 
both rats a nd dogs. T oxicology studies of up to 2 weeks  in rats (non -GLP) and up to 
13 weeks in dogs (GLP)  have been conducted . Combined administration of BBR and 
UDCA as HTD1801 yield ed PK and toxicity profiles similar t o those  of the individual 
components UDCA and BBR. In addition, a 13-week GLP dog study provided data to 
qualify the toxicity profile of BBR  in non -rodents and the safety of the combination of 
BBR  and UDCA when administered as HTD1801.  
Available nonclinica l study data for HTD1801, together with cumulative nonclinical 
study data and clinical experience for BBR and UDCA individually, support  the safety 
and tolerability  of HTD1801 for this  POC study.  More information about the 
nonclinical evaluation of HTD1801  can be found in the HTD1801 Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
1.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Rationale for Study Design  
This 18 -week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, POC , dose -ranging study will 
compare  multiple doses of HTD1801 to placebo.  A randomized, double -blind design 
will enhance study rigor and qualit y relative to assessment of the pre -specified 
endpoints (see Section 3.4). In the absence of approved or recognized therapeutics for 
NASH , a placebo control group will be utilized , as has been reported for  several prior

 Page 24 randomized, placebo -controlled assessments of various pharmacologic agents  
(Loomba et al., 2008 ). 
Since accumulation of hepatic fat is considered the “first hit” in the pathogenesis of 
NASH  (Adams and Angulo 2006 ), change in LFC by [CONTACT_81789] -estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI -PDFF) is an appropriate  primary 
endpoint and is consistent with that used in recent Phase 2 POC studies in NASH  
(Harrison et al., 2018 , Madrigal Pharmaceuticals 2018 ). 
1.2.2 Rationale for Dose and Duration  
Ursodeoxycholic acid  is approved by [CONTACT_120901] a dose of 13 -15 mg/kg/day  (URSO 
250® and URSO FORTE®), or approximately  1 g/day for a 70 kg individual . Berberine  
is widely used in dietary supplements in the US at a recommended dose of 
17-33 mg/kg/day , or approximately  1-2 g/day  for a 70 kg individual . Furthermore, New 
Tantose A®, an over -the-counter combination inc luding BBR (adult dose of 
0.300  g/day) an d UDCA (0.030 g/day), has been approved in Japan for acute diarrheal 
illness  (New Tantose A®), while the therapeutic dosage in most of BBR’s clinical 
experience  is around 0.4 -2.7 g/day orally  for expos ures up to 181 days  (Cicero and 
Ertek 2009 , Lan et al., 2015 ). As shown in Table 3, the UDCA and BBR  content of 
HTD1801 are comparable to doses associated with clinical safety .

b Safety at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day is supported by [CONTACT_120902]  
(Angulo et al., 1999 ). 
c Therapeutic dosage in most of BBR’s clinical experience  (Cicero and Ertek 2009 , Lan et al., 
2015 ). 
d HTD1801 dose of 2 ,000 mg/day is equivalent to 1 ,022 m g/day BBR and 1 ,078 mg/day UDCA.  
Furthermore, data from a f irst-in-human , single  ascending dose  study of HTD1801 in 
healthy subjects  (Protocol HTD1801.PCT002) demonstrated dose proportionality for

 Page 25 UDCA and BBR exposure parameters  at orally administered HTD1801 doses of 
0.5-4.0 g/day. Single doses of HTD1801 were also safe and well tolerated . 
Lastly,  recent Phase 2 POC studies in NASH  (Harrison et al., 2018 , Madrigal 
Pharmaceuticals 2018 ) show  clinically meaningful absolute and relative reductions in 
LFC assessed by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF over 12 -week treatment periods. An 18 -week HTD1801 
treatment period is therefore adequate to assess the study’s primary endpoint  and to 
maximize collection of  exposure and safety related data.

3.1 BASIC DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS  
This multi center , randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, POC  and dose -ranging 
study will compare  multiple doses of HTD1801 to placebo. Upon confirmation of 
eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to  receive 1 of 2 doses of 
HTD1801 or placebo for 18 weeks.  
Subjects will receive 500 mg HTD1801 , 1,000 mg HTD1801,  or placebo  (collective ly, 
the study drug or study drugs) , administered twice daily (BID) during the 18-week 
Double -Blind Treatment Period.  Clinic visits for efficacy assessments and safety 
monitoring will occur at Week 2, then every [ADDRESS_135382] for an assessment of adverse 
events (AEs) and concomitant medications will take place at least [ADDRESS_135383] 
dose of study drug.  An interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 
subjects com plete the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size 
assumptions and futility through conditional power; the study will not be stopped for 
efficacy.  An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  will provide 
additional safety oversight.

The HTD1801 drug substance, berberine ursodeoxycholate, is the salt formed between 
BBR and UDCA with a stoichiometry of  1:1. The  HTD1801 drug product is a 
film-coated tablet containing 250 mg of berberine ursodeoxycholate. HTD1801 is 
expected to dissociate into BBR  salt and UDCA after oral administration.  
4.1.2 Labeling  
The study drugs (HTD1801 [ADDRESS_135396] bo) will be supplied 
by [CONTACT_120904]/ aluminum foil/polyethylene 
(PET/AL/PE)  pouches . Each pouch  will contain 4 HTD1801 250 mg and/or 
HTD1801 -matching placebo tablets  and be affixed with a single -panel label that will 
describe the following information  at a minimum: study drug, dose, kit number, 
Sponsor name, instructions for storage between 36°F and 46°F (2°C and 8°C), and 
includes the statement s “Caution: New Drug - Limited by [CONTACT_120905] ” and “ Keep out of reach of children .” 
An adequate supply of  pouches  will be placed into  kits packaged for weekly use, and 
each subject will receive the appropriate number of kits to provide enough supplie s 
until their next scheduled visit  to the investigational  site. Each kit will bear a label 
describing the following information  at a minimum : kit number, Sponsor name, 
instructions for storage between 36°F and 46°F (2°C and 8°C), and includes the 
statement s “Caution: New Drug - Limited by [CONTACT_120906] ” 
and “ Keep out of reach of children .” 
4.2 DOSING INSTRUCTIONS AND SCHEDULE  
Subjects  are instructed to take the entire conten ts of 1 pouch  of study drug each morning

PROCEDURES, MEASUREMENTS, AND EVALUATIONS 
Study procedures are summarized acr oss all scheduled study visits as indicated in the 
Study Design (Fig ure 1) and the Schedule of Time and Events (Table 1). Unscheduled 
visits may also occur at any time if medically warranted. Study related assessments 
performed at all visits will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Throughout  the study,  clinical  laboratory  (blood  and  urine)  samples  will  be 
collected during a fasting state (i.e., at least 8 hours prior to sample collection) and 
sent to the designated central laboratory for analysis.  Study drug should be taken 
with water and food (e.g., meal or snack). 
For subjects who cannot be contact[CONTACT_120907] a return for a scheduled clinic visit  or

Screening (D ays -28 to -1) 
Prior to any clinical procedures and evaluations, written signed informed consent must 
be obtained.  Screening  procedures  must  be completed  within  28 days  prior  to the 
Baseline visit and can be performed across multiple days during this period. Screening 
clinical  laboratory  tests (see Sections  6.2.2  and 6.3.4 ) may be repeated  once  during 
Screening  if the Investigator  believes  the results  to be erroneous.  In the event  that 
Screening  tests  are repeated,  the most  current  results  will  be used  to determine 
eligibility.  Potential  subjects  who do not meet  all eligibility  criteria  at Screening  will 
be allowed to re-screen once  if the  Investigator believes  that there  has been a change 
in eligibility status. If a potential subject fails to meet eligibility criteria upon re-screen, 
he/she will remain ineligible for the study. 
During  Screening,  the following  procedures  must  be conducted  and assessments 
obtained.  The information will be collected in the investigational site’s standard source 
document s or in source document templates provided by [CONTACT_1034].

6.2 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
6.2.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Magnetic resonance imaging -estimated pr oton density fat fraction  will be utilized as 
the p rimary efficacy measure to quantify LFC.  Proton density fat -fraction , which is a 
fundamental property of tissue that measures hepatic fat concentration  based on the 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
Page 46 6.2.2 density  of mobile  protons  from  fat (triglycerides)  compared  to the total  density  of 
protons from mobile triglycerides and mobile water, is well-accepted as a standardized 
non-invasive biomarker of LFC (Reeder et al., 2012) . 
Corrected  T1 (or iron-corrected  T1) is an MRI-based  technique  that characterizes 
tissue in vivo  based on the fluidity of water protons within the tissue. Relative to liver 
tissue, the T1 m easurement of free water increases with inflammation and fibrosis, but 
must be corrected due to the confounding effect of iron (Banerjee et al., 2014). While 
cT1 will not be utilized  as an efficacy  measure  for this study,  it will be utilized  as a 
biomarker  of fibrosis  to qualify  potential  subjects  given  its reported  correlation  with 
histological parameters of liver disease (Pavlides et al., 2016) . 
Investigational  sites  will  utilize  their local  MRI  facility,  which  will be qualified 
according to a study-specific image acquisition protocol, to acquire the MRI-PDFF and 
cT1 scans.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  scans  will be performed  on the  subjects’ 
abdominal  region  and will last approximately  10 minutes.  Scan  data  will  then  be 
transmitted  electronically  via a secure  portal  to a central  imaging  laboratory  for 
analysis.  Central  imaging  specialists  blinded  to the clinical  data  will use the 
Liver MultiScan  Disco ver™ (LMSD;  Perspectum  Diagnostics,  Oxford,  United 
Kingdom) investigational device to analyze the scans and report the MRI-PDFF, cT1, 
and T2* results to the investigational sites. The MRI-PDFF, cT1, and T2* results will 
be reported at Screening, with MRI-PDFF and cT1 as part of the eligibility criteria. At 
a minimum, clinical metrics for the MRI-PDFF will be reported at the Week 18 or ET 
visit.  Technical  and analysis  specifications  and  procedures,  including  the blinded 
reporting of  any results, will  be detailed in  the central imaging  manual, imaging  charter, 
and/or SPM. 
Efficacy Related Laboratory and Biomarker Assessments 
A central laboratory will be u tilized to perfor m efficacy related clinical lab oratory and 
biomarker assessments as specified in Table [ADDRESS_135412] eligibility at 
Screening and Baseline, as well as continued study participatio n for the duration of the 
Double-Blind Tr eatment Period.  Procedures for sample collection and handling,

 Page 47 including the blin ded reporting of any results,  will be detailed in the central laboratory 
manual  and/or SPM . 
The following laboratory and biomarker assessments will be utilized as secondary 
efficacy measures:  
Fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA -IR, serum triglycerides, LDL -c, and HDL -c will be 
utilized in this study to assess glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and lipid 
metabolism. These measu res are routinely performed in the management of metabolic 
abno rmalities  that underlie  the pathogenesis of NAFLD, including dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_83281] 
T2DM, the latter of which is recognized as a risk factor  for progressive hepatic fibrosis  
(Adams and Angulo 2006 ). 
Aspartate aminotransferase and ALT are liver-associated enzymes  that will be utilized 
in this study to assess  liver biochemistry. These enzymes are markers of liver injury 
that may be useful surrogate measures of NAFLD and NASH, particularly in T2DM 
patien ts (Sanyal et al., 2015 ). 
Pro-C3 and the ELF score  are biomarkers that will be utilized in this study to assess 
liver inflammation and fibrosis . Pro -C3 is a neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_120871], which has been 
reported to reflect the true formation of collagen and to potentially be an accurate 
biomarker for the formation of fibrotic tissue in the liver  (Nielsen et al., 2013 ). The 
ELF score  is a set of extracellular matrix marker s that consists of TIMP -1, PI[INVESTIGATOR_120861] , and 
HA, and has b een reported to show good correlations with fibrosis stages in chronic 
liver disease  (Lichtinghagen et al., 2013 ). 
Total bile acids, C4, and FGF19  are biomarkers that will be utilized in this study to 
assess bile acid homeostasis. Factors implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH, such as 
obesity  or increased BMI , insulin resistance, and elevated AST and ALT serum 
concentrat ions to the dysregulation and increase of serum bile acids. Likewise, 
elevations in  serum C4, an indicator of bile acid synthesis in vivo , have been observed 
in NASH patients.  Conversely, reduced serum concentrations of FGF19, which inhibits  
the rate -limiting enzyme CYP7A1 to regulate bile acid synthesis, have also been 
observed in NASH patients (Zhang and Deng 2018 ). Furthermore, the results of a 
recent study of BBR administered to wild type and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)

ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
The following definition of an AE will be used for this study:  Adverse event means a ny 
untoward medical occur rence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of the investigational product, regardless of whether it is co nsidered to be related t o the 
investigational product.  
The following  are examples of AEs : 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the indication under 
study . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition , including an 
incre ase in frequency or intensity of the condition . 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration , even if they were  present  before  the start of the study . 
• Signs, symptom s, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  with another 
medical product . 
• Signs, symptoms , or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication . 
Overdose should not be reported as an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ), but rather 
the symptoms resulting from the overdose  should be reported as such . 
Examples of AEs do not include  the following : 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy) . The medical 
condi tion that led to the procedure as the  AE should be reported .

 Page 52 • Situations  that are unwanted by [CONTACT_120912] , for example  social inconvenience after admission to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of a pre-existing disease or condition (present 
or detec ted before  enrollment)  that do es not worsen  overall . 
• Expected p rogression of the disease being studied, including signs or symptoms 
of the disease,  unless  progression is more severe than expected for the subject ’s 
condition . 
Adverse events  may include pre -treatment  or post-treatment  events that occur as a 
result of protocol -mandated procedures ( e.g., invasive procedures, modification of the 
subject ’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Adverse events  should be captured even if the y occur during  periods without drug 
treatment, post -treatment periods, known  placebo  treatment , or in a reference or control 
group receiving drug or nondrug therapy.  
The Investigator is responsible for all AE assessments . The Investigator and

 Page 53 7.2 DEFINITION OF A S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
In this study, an SAE  is defined as an AE that  meets any of the following criteria : 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening .  The term life-threatening  in the definition of an SAE  refers to 
an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event.  The 
term life-threatening  does not refer to an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . In 
general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120872] d at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120873]’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084] , but not necessarily SAEs . A medical 
occurrence  or complication that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61375] . When there 
is doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should 
be considered  an SAE . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120874] a preexisting 
condition that di d not worsen  from its original B aseline  level  is not considered an 
SAE. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . This d oes not  include AEs of relatively minor 
medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere 
or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect . This refers to the offspring of a study 
subject . 
• An other important medical event . Medical or scientific judgment should be 
exercised when  deciding whether reporting is appropriate  for other important 
medic al events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120875]. These events 
should also be considere d serious. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood

Clinical Protocol  IND [ADDRESS_135420]  address  the Investigator’s  estimate  of causality.  The Medical 
Monitor will review the SAE to determine if it is an expected SAE (i.e., whether or not 
the SAE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
RECORDING ADVERS E EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERS E EVENTS 
When  an AE  or SAE  occurs,  the Investigator  is responsible  for reviewing all 
documentation  (e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120876],  laboratory,  and  diagnostic  reports) 
relative to the event(s). The Investigator will record all relevant information about any 
AE (including  SAE s) on the AE page  of the eCRF.  It is not acceptable  for the 
Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238] ’s medic al records in lieu of the proper ly 
complet ed AE or SAE pages of the e CRF . These documents should not be sent unless 
they are specifically  requested  by [CONTACT_1034]’s  or designee’s  pharmacovigilance 
department. If  this request  occurs,  all subject  identifiers  and protected  health 
information should be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_120877]. 
The Investigator will also attempt to report a diagnosis, instead of signs, symptoms, or 
other  clinical  information, for  the AE. The  diagnosis,  not the individual  signs  and 
symptoms,  should  be documented  on the appropriate  page of the eCRF  as the AE or 
SAE.  In addition, SAEs  need to be reported  in the SAE report.  Adverse events being 
processed  as SAEs  will also require  additional  documentation.  The SPM (or  other 
applicable instructions) provides additional guidelines about reporting SAEs. 
ASSESSMENT OF INTENSITY 
The Investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study on the basis of his or her clinical jud gment.  The classifications in Table 5 should 
be used in assig ning intensity of each AE recorded in the eCRF.

An AE that is assessed as severe s hould not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a 
category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe 
myocardial infarction ). However, an AE itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, such as a severe headache.  Both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
An AE is considered  serio us when it meets one of the pre defined outcomes described 
in Section  7.2. 
7.[ADDRESS_135422]. The I nvestigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure 
or product  label for marketed products in estimating  the relationship . 
Becau se of reporting timelines, the I nvestigator might have minimal information to 
include in the initial SAE report.  However, the I nvestigator must always make an 
assessm ent of causality for every SAE  before  the transmission of the SAE  report . The

Page 56 Investigator  may change  his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_120878]-up 
information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is a 
criterion  used to determine  regulatory  reporting  requirements  and should  not be left 
blank on the eCRF. The same applies to AEs tha t are to be processed as SAEs. 
Table 6 provides some definitions to use in the assessment.

Possibly related  The AE may be related to the investi gational agent(s) or intervention: the AE 
has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational 
agent(s) or research intervention . 
Unrelated  
(or not related)  The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention : 
the AE has no temporal relationship to the administration of the 
investigational agent(s) or research intervention, and follows no known or 
suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is present.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from Baseline to Week 18 in 
LFC, or absolute change from Baseline to the ET visit for subjects who terminate the 
study prematurely. Absolute c hange from Baseline in LFC will be assessed  by [CONTACT_120922], Baseline LFC, and Baseline 
ALT. Comparison of each active treatment group to placebo will be tested at the 5% 
level of significance without adjustment for multiple tests. Secondarily, comparison of  
the 2 active treatment groups with each other will be tested at the 5% level . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study include the following:  
1. Absolute and relative ( percent ) change in fasting glucose and Hb A1c from Baseline 
to Week 18 , or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
2. A ≥30% reduction in LFC from Baseline to Week  18, or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
3. Percent change in LFC from Baseline to Week 18, or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
4. Normalization of LFC to <5% at Week 18, or to the ET visit for dropouts.  
5. A ≥5-percentage point reduction in LFC from Baseline to Week 18, or to the ET 
visit for dropouts .

Percent change from Baseline in LFC will be analyzed by [CONTACT_120923]. Normalization of L FC, a ≥30% reduction in LFC , 
and a 5-percentage  point reduction in LFC will each be analyzed by a logistic 
regression that includes the effects of treatment group, Baseline LFC, and Baseline 
ALT.  
All additional secondary efficacy endpoints are continuous a nd each will be assessed  
by [CONTACT_120924]. All secondary analyses (except LFC) will have missing Week 18 
values imputed using a multiple imputation procedure for all sub jects with an available

At the subject -level, each AE will be counted only once for a given subject within a 
specified system organ class, prefer red term. If the same AE occurs on multiple 
occasions for a subject, the occurrence with the highest severity and relationship to 
study medication will be reported. Individual AE terms will be reported as separate 
events.  
Changes in vital signs, ECGs , and clinical laboratory parameters from Baseline to end 
of study will be examined and displayed using shift tables (low, normal, high). Shift 
tables for Week 18, or the last available study visit, will be presented relative to  
Baseline for all clinical laboratory parameters.  
9.2.6 Sample Size  
An absolute change in LFC of 5% as measured by M RI-PDFF has been reported 
to be the minimal clinically relevant difference between active treatment and 
placebo  that correlates with histological improvement in NASH  (Loomba et al., 2015 , 
Patel et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, Harrison  and colleagues  reported  a pooled standard 
deviation of  6.3% for  changes fr om Baseline in LFC  (Harrison et al., 2018 ).  Based on 
this standard deviation, 35 subjects in each treatment group will provide 90% power to 
show a difference of 5  percentage points  between any 2 treatment groups a t the 5% 
level of significance.  To allow for a dropout rate of 10%, 39 subjects will be 
randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.  
9.2.7 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 subjects complete the 
assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size assumptions and 
futility through conditional power; the study will not be stopped for efficac y. The 
method of Cui and colleagues (Cui et al., 1999 ) will be used to compute the alpha spend 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND [ADDRESS_135437] deviation for the  change from Baseline  in LFC . 
Conditional power calculations will be performed for the difference between each of 
the 2 active treatment groups  versus placebo for the primary endpoint.  The following 
rules will be applied for the primary efficacy endpoint:  
1. If both conditional powers at the time of the interim analysis are <10%, then the 
study will be terminated for futility.  
2. If either conditional power is ≥10% but both are <36%, then the sample size will 
not be increased and the study will continue based on the original sample size.  
3. If either conditional power is ≥36% but both are <80%, then the sample size will 
be adjusted to retain the original power of 90% or a 50% increase in the sample 
size, whichever is the smallest.  
4. If either conditional power is ≥80%, then the study will conti nue as is.  
The Sponsor will be advised of either futility, no change, or of a specific sample size 
increase , but not about the degree of efficacy per treatment group.  The analys is will be

 Page 1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
(International Conference on  Harmonisation  E6, Section 4.8) 
Informed conse nt must be obtained from every subject  before he or she enters a study. It must be 
given freely and not under duress.  Consent must be  documented by [CONTACT_120937] ’s 
legally acceptable  representative s igning an IRB/IEC -approved ICF. When minors are involved, a 
parent or guardian should sign the ICF. If the minor is an adolescent (12 to 16 -18 years of age, 
depend ent on region, as specifie d in ICH E11, Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the 
Pediatric Population), his or her signature [CONTACT_120945]. Subjects  who do not speak 
English must be presented with a n ICF written in a language that they understand. A copy of the 
signed ICF must be given and made available to Sponsor and represe ntatives of the appropriate 
regulatory authority upon request. If, for any reason, subject  risk is increased as the study 
progresses, a revised IRB/IEC -approved ICF must be signed by [CONTACT_423] . 
Nothing in these regulations is intended to limit the author ity of a physician to provide emergency 
medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or 
local laws. Only in the case of a life -threatening incident may an investigational agent be used 
without prior signed consent.  In such an emergency situation, separate certifications must be 
written by [CONTACT_17588] a physician not participating in the study and the Investigator. The certifications, 
along with the protocol and ICF, must be sent to the IRB/IEC within [ADDRESS_135449]  until informed consent and IRB/IEC approval are obtained.  
BASIC ELEMENTS OF INFORMED CONSENT  
Every ICF must include explanations of each of the following 2 2 elements:  
• The fact t hat the trial involves research  
• The purpose of the trial  
• The trial treatment(s) and the probability for random assignment to each treatment  
• The trial procedures to be followed, including all invasive procedures  
• The subject ’s responsibilities

• The reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the subject  and, when applicable, to an 
embryo, fetus, or nursing infant  
• The reasonably expected benefits (When there is no int ended clinical benefit to the subject , the 
subject  should be made aware of this .) 
• The alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be available to the subject , as 
well as  their important potential benefits and risks  
• The compensation or treat ment available to the subject  in the event of a trial -related injury  
• The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject  for participating in the trial  
• The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject  for participating in the trial  
• The fact t hat the subject ’s participation in the trial is voluntary and that the subject  may refuse 
to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject  is otherwise entitled  
• That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the  IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authority(ies) will be 
granted direct access to the subject ’s original medical records for verification of study 
procedures or data, without violating the confidentiality of the subject , to the extent permitted 
by [CONTACT_120938], by [CONTACT_2960] a written ICF, the subject  or the 
subject ’s legally acceptable representative is authorizing such acc ess 
• That the records identifying the subject  will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted 
by [CONTACT_120939], will not be made publicly available; and if the results of 
the trial are published, the subject ’s identity will remai n confidential  
• That the subject  or the subject ’s legally acceptable  representative will be informed in a timely 
manner if information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to 
continue participation in the trial

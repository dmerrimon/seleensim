Section C:  Background Information
     Critically ill patients often suf fer from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53751]. This condition may originate from Neurogenic (critical
illness Polyneuropathy or CIP) or Myogenic (critical illness Myopathy or CIM) disturbances, or a combination of both
(critical illness Neuro-Myopathy or CINM). Moreover , prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53752] 10% over the 1st week, which leads to functional impairment and complications post-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Prevalence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired weakness varies widely depending on patient population and risk
factors, assessment period, diagnosis method, and patients pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53753] (age-related frailty).
Unfortunately , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired weakness is highly prevalent among COVID-[ADDRESS_565433] of these patients receive concomitant Glucocorticoid therapy . Together
Glucocorticoids and paralytics, lead to Myosin depletion and muscle atrophy . This combination has shown to be a risk
factor for CINM. In a recent JAMA  study on 5700 COVID-19 patients performed in NYC, 72% of the ventilated patients
remained in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and only 3% of this population have been discharged. W e believe that the major reason for this is
the inability to wean from the ventilator and to rehabilitate due to Neuro-Myopathy .
A recent systematic review suggested the major pathways involved in CINM. These major pathways include muscle disuse
due to prolonged immobilization, inflammation, impaired perfusion and oxygen delivery , and hyperglycemia. All these
factors might be magnified among COVID-[ADDRESS_565434].
Muscle weakness and fatigue impede patients¿ capacity to exercise, and are known to delay extubation, extend length of
stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and delay patients to achieve independent mobility . The goal of E-stim in advanced disease states is to
prevent or reverse skeletal muscle wasting for persons who are not able to exercise. Conditions include advanced periods
of mechanical ventilation.
A recent review including [ADDRESS_565435] shown to benefit this specific population. Characteristics include: a) electrode placement in
lower extremity muscle groups bilaterally , hams and calf muscles; b) position for E-stim in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53754]; and c) session frequency is ef fective at 5¿7 d/wk or daily until extubation or D/C from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In this summary ,
Nussbau, et al reported a series of measurements to demonstrate the ef ficacy of E-stim therapy such as: thigh
circumference, strength of lower extremity muscles (isometric or isotonic dynamometry , MRC score), and quality of life
questionnaires. The majority of these studies selected parameters to minimize muscle fatigue. They concluded that E-stim
preserves muscle strength and muscle mass, and reduces rate of muscle degradation. Also, it facilitates maintenance of
functional capacity . Others have suggested that the benefit of E-stim was related to neural adaptations.
Additionally , our previous studies demonstrated that daily use of EE therapy ef fectively improves limb perfusion, oxygen
delivery , Neuropathy , motor capacity (e.g., gait and balance), and mobility (e.g., daily number of steps). Armed with these
preliminary studies, we proposed this current study to examine the ef fect of daily use EE therapy in critically ill COVID-19
patients. Our fundamental hypothesis is that EE therapy is ef fective to maintain the activation of lower extremity muscles
and improve perfusion and oxygen delivery , thus preventing or reversing CINM due to prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .

Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
12/21/22, 2:1 1 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=460134 4/13     This study is divided in two phases.
Phase I (preventive): Unfortunately , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired weakness is highly prevalent among COVID-[ADDRESS_565436] has been associated with pronounced loss of muscle mass that can exceed 10% over the
1st week, which leads to functional impairment and complications post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Physical therapy and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444496]-acquired weakness, but they are often impractical for COVID-[ADDRESS_565437] feasibility and proof-of-concept ef fectiveness of lower extremity electrical
stimulation (EE) therapy to prevent muscular complications of COVID-19 including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired weakness and
neuropathy .
Phase II (recovery): Moreover , we also propose to examine the ef fectiveness of daily use of electrical stimulation therapy
to recover from the long-term neuromuscular side ef fects of prolonged immobilization in patients who were bedbound due
to COVID-19. These ef fects include lower extremity critical illness myopathy and neuropathy . Lengthened periods of
immobilization decreases muscle activity provoking atrophy , weakness, and pain. W e hypothesize that electrical
stimulation will help to increase muscle fiber activation and nerve conductivity , thus, help in recovery of the neuromuscular
condition.

Section F:  Design/Procedure
F1.  Design
Select one category that most adequately describes your research:
     c) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53761]: probability of group assignment, potential for subject
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.
     Phase I: [ADDRESS_565438] been admitted with no more than 48 hours to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444497]. In
some cases, the patients will not able to consent at the time of enrollment. This determines a high grade of severity of
illness. Therefore, a family member/legal representative will be contact[CONTACT_444499]. Participants will be
randomized to intervention (IG) or control group (CG). The entire cohort will receive daily EE in lower extremity (e.g.
Gastronemius, tibial anterior muscle) up to [ADDRESS_565439]. Due to the condition of the patient we are
looking to reduce the interaction with staf f, the device will be placed with no additional requirements. Physical therapy
targets other physical performances, this device is aimed to improve blood flow , tissue perfusion and muscle activation
while the patient is non-responsive to physical activities.
Phase II: 20 additional subjects coming to the COVID-19 clinic at Baylor College of Medicine for treatment of long-term
neuromuscular complications due to severe COVID-19 infection. Patients will begin the study after indication of muscle
weakness, muscle atrophy , fatigue, or neuromyopathy due to prolonged immobilization (i.e. at home or in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for
COVID-19. This assessment can be performed by a critical care and pulmonary specialist at the BCM COVID-19 Clinic.
This is a proof of concept randomized control trial (RCT) study for recovery . The entire cohort will receive daily , at-home
electrical stimulation in the lower extremities (e.g. gastrocnemius, tibial anterior muscle) for up to 1 hour to aid in recovery
from neuromyopathy complications due to prolonged immobilization. Participants will be randomized to intervention (IG) or
control group (CG). EE therapy will be provided using a portable EE device. The EE device will be functional for IG and
non-functional for CG. The primary outcomes include between group dif ference and change from the baseline in muscle
endurance, muscle strength, lower extremity tissue oxygen saturation, neuropathy , and muscle atrophy . The patients will
take the device home up to 4 weeks and will be screened once a week at Baylor College of Medicine McNair Campus for
neuromuscular evaluation. The control group will be unblinded after the 4 weeks are completed with the option of
extending to 4 additional weeks by [CONTACT_444500].
Inclusion Criteria:
     Phase I: Age: Adults age 18 years or older Disease status: COVID-[ADDRESS_565440] positive Critically ill requiring care in the
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
Phase II: Age: Adults age [ADDRESS_565441] been previously bedbound or immobilized due to COVID-
19 infection Patients with muscle pain, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy , and/or neuromyopathy in the lower extremities
Patients will have to be alert and conscious to sign the consent form.
Exclusion Criteria:
     Subject has a demand-type cardiac pacemaker , implanted defibrillator or other implanted electronic device Active wound
infection Below the knee amputations Based on the clinicians decision whether the patient is eligible for the study .
F2.  Procedure
     Phase I:
Aim1 (to understand mechanism of action): Examine immediate benefit of lower extremity EE to improve venous return
flow, tissue oxygenation, and muscle activation (short term benefit). In this study , we will recruit a convenient sample of 20
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53764]-19 (short-term benefit).
Optional: Subjects will be assessed using Doppler ultrasound and near infrared imaging (Kent Imaging System) at pre-,
30min, 60min, and 30min post-treatment (after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53765]). Lower extremity muscle activation will be assessed
by [CONTACT_53778] (electromyography).
Patients will begin the study after being admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53766] 48 hours.
12/21/22, 2:1 1 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=460134 6/13Aim 2 (to examine ef fectiveness): Examine ef fectiveness of daily use of EE to treat CINM, and other associated major
adverse events (MAE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cardiovascular events, and death. Participants will receive
standard of care plus adjunctive daily EE therapy using an FDA  approved bio-electric stimulation technology (BEST)
platform (T ennant Biomodulator® PRO, AVAZZIA, Inc) during the entire length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The device will be
provided by [CONTACT_14721] f.
We will assess incidence of neuropathy and myopathy during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] [ADDRESS_565442].
Neuropathy severity will be quantified using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) test. Myopathy will be assessed by
[CONTACT_53779], weight change from pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], and sEMG. In addition, we
will determine weakness using foot dynamometer and a validated frailty meter . Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53768]
(documented via electronic health record) will be tracked for planning of future studies. Both extremities will have all
measurements and 1 hour electrical stimulation therapy at baseline. Daily treatment will performed up to 3 times per day ,
but no more than 1 hour in total.
Daily electrical stimulation will be administered by a nurse/staf f involved in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]. A chart will be signed to
register each therapy performed and will include a log of day and time of device application.
Both electrical stimulation and EMG devices will have disposable pads, after usage they will be discarded. For the Devices
they will be placed inside a plastic bag that will be disposed inside the room before exiting and sanitized (wipes) based
upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53769].
The researchers will take digital photographs /videos throughout the study . This is done using a special camera for tissue
oxygen detection and visual images. This method is non invasive and does not cause any harm to the patient. **W e will
blur the face out in the photographs/videos. W e will only use videos and photos for scientific presentations or scientific
publications.
Phase II:
Patients will begin the study after incidence of muscle loss, muscle weakness, muscle pain, or neuromyopathy due to
prolonged immobilization for COVID-19. This assessment will be performed by a critical care and pulmonary specialist at
the BCM COVID-[ADDRESS_565443] of home-based
therapy , meaning that the patient will take the device home and attend the clinic once a week for screening and
assessment of therapy .
The protocol will be performed as the following description: This trial will have 20 patients divided in two groups. Group 1
(intervention, n=10): Will receive an active Tennant Biomodulator . Patients assigned the active device (active group; Group
1) at their initial visit (baseline) will only have 4 weeks of study participation (which includes 5 visits: Baseline (week 0),
Visit 1 (W eek 1 of at-home therapy), V isit 2 (W eek 2 of at-home therapy), V isit 3 (W eek 3 of at-home therapy), V isit 4
(Week 4 of at-home therapy). After 4 weeks, the patients will turn back the electrical stimulation device to the research
staff.
Group 2 (control, n=10): Will receive an inactive Tennant Biomodulator for [ADDRESS_565444] agrees to receive the active
device at the 4th week visit (visit 4), then they will only be required to attend the clinic for one more visit (visit 5). For
subjects in this group that were previously enrolled (i.e. V isit 4 completed), they will be contact[CONTACT_444501]/reconsent to have another 4weeks of study participation with an active device. They will have 2
additional visits (visit 5 and V isit 6). V isit [ADDRESS_565445] will receive an active device to take for additional 4 weeks and come back to the clinic for a final assessment
(Visit 6). V isit [ADDRESS_565446] visit (either V isit 5 or V isit 6 depending on the conditions listed above).
Group [ADDRESS_565447] up to 7 visits total with possible phone calls in between. The patient will be compensated $50 per in-
person, clinic visit (total $350), with free parking. Payment will only be available for subjects who participate in Part II.
During V isit 1, V isit 2, V isit 3, the the research staf f will turn the Tennant Biomodulator PRO® on for 5 minutes and
measure any changes in muscle strength, endurance, and blood flow after the therapy .
During Baseline, V isit 4, V isit 5, V isit 6, the research staf f will turn the Tennant Biomodulator PRO® on for one hour and
measure any changes in muscle strength, endurance, and blood flow after the therapy . Once the Baseline is over , the
patient will take the Tennat Biomodulator® home and will be instructed to turn it on for one hour every day for four weeks.
Any study visits may include the following assessments in addition to electrical stimulation: 1) Questionnaires (pain,
weakness, sleep, quality of life, frailty , depression, life and space, beck anxiety scale, Katz-daily living, fatigue) 2)
Musculoskeletal assessments (non-invasive surface electromyography , vibration perception threshold, leg circumference
measurement, ankle strength test) 3) V ascular assessments (non-invasive Near infra-red spectroscopy)
Optional measurements will also be collected to assess subject gait, balance, upper extremity strength, frailty , physical

https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=460134 7/13activity , and oxygen levels (with pulse oximetry).
Gait assessment: Gait performance will be assessed using a validated body worn sensors (LegSys, Biosensics LLC,
[LOCATION_003]). The device uses five sensor modules respectively attached to right and left anterior shins, right and left anterior
thighs, and posteriorly to the lower back. Based on the subject's height and using a two-link inverse pendulum model the
following spatio-temporal gait parameters will be estimated: velocity , stride length, stride time, double support, single
support, stride-to-stride variability , and gait initiation. In addition, the center of mass (COM) range of motion during walking
will be calculated by [CONTACT_363609]-back. Gait will be assessed over a distance of 20
meters under 2 conditions: (1) walking at habitual speed (2) walking at maximum speed (fast walking).
Balance assessment: Balance will be quantified using validated body worn sensors (BalanSens, Biosensics LLC, [LOCATION_003]).
The system measures ankle and hip motion in three dimensions (3D), 2D COM sway as well as RCI in ML  and AP
directions. Balance will be assessed according to Romberg protocol during eyes-open and eyes-closed condition during
double, semi-tandem, and full tandem stances. For those patients who may not be able to do gait and balance test, we will
use alternative upper extremity test, which according to our previous studies provide similar results as gait bit do not
require subject to walk. (See Attachment)
Upper Extremity Frailty Test: Investigators will measure arm motion from each participant by [CONTACT_363610] (e.g. accelerometer , gyroscope) such as LegSys (Biosensics LLC, MA, [LOCATION_003]), Frailty Meter
(Biosensics LLC, MA, [LOCATION_003]), or BioStamp (MC10, MA, [LOCATION_003]). These inertial sensors will assess respectively kinematic of
upper extremities (e.g., arm and shoulder) motion as well as joint coordination. W e will be used at least [ADDRESS_565448] to capture arm motion.
Physical Activity Monitoring: The subject will be given a wearable device (P AMSys) or a smart watch, that will be
measuring several parameters including number of steps taken, duration of sitting, standing, walking and lying, time taken
and number of transitions from sit to stand, and walking speed for [ADDRESS_565449] the device
and send back it to the investigating team.
Oxygen Level Assessment: Oxygen saturation will be measured using a pulse oximeter .
The supervision of this study will be by [CONTACT_53780], and the location will be at Baylor College of Medicine
McNair Campus.
 
Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
     Local: 40              W orldwide: 40
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     Sample size is convenient and selected based on available resources to demonstrate feasibility and the proof of concept
effectiveness of EE therapy for COVID-[ADDRESS_565450]-ICU. W e plan to recruit 40 eligible subjects.
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     P-values of 0.[ADDRESS_565451] unless otherwise noted. All
variables will be tabulated descriptively at each scheduled time point (baseline and discharge date). For each continuous
variable, the analyses will include the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. For each categorical variable,
the summary will include frequencies and percentages. Each variable will be analyzed using all available data. Baseline
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. W e assume that a successful intervention is also helpful to
maintain subjects muscle mass, reduce neuromyopathy signs and increase venous return flow . The measured parameters
(e.g. muscle circumference, sEMG, kent imaging, doppler , etc.) should change substantially from baseline to the end of the
intervention. For example, the EMG amplitude values should show increased voltages. Next, for all continuous variables,
pre-treatment scores will be regressed on post-treatment scores to form residualized change scores (e.g. sEMG, VPT ,
dynamometer , etc). Correlations will then be generated among these scores to determine whether changes in sEMG
factors are related appropriately with increases in (clinically assessed) functional capacities and self-report measures of
activities. ANOV A test will be used to examine significant dif ference between patients with severe risk factors for prolonged
ICU stage (e.g. age, BMI, cardiovascular morbidities). Moderator ef fects will also be examined for exploratory purposes.
Using gender as an example, mixed design ANOV As will be conducted to determine whether mobility factors change over
the course of treatment at dif ferent rates or with dif ferent patterns for men and women. Additional analyses will test
whether changes in muscle strenght and neuropathy (e.g. VPT  and dynamometer assessement at time of discharge).

https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=460134 8/13Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     The risk to participants of this study is considered to be minimal in a controlled environment with an attendant present.
This research routine will not place subjects at higher risk than normal activities of daily living, and no more risk of harm or
discomfort is associated with these tests than the discomfort normally incurred while performing normal muscle stretching.
Subjects will be allowed rest time between trials as needed. The EMG device will detect level of fatigue and based on that
we will determine the length of the sessions.
The devices and technology is completely non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and non-ionizing. The potential risks to subject are
minimal. However , like any battery powered systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor malfunctioning. In addition, the
study devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a cellphone battery), in order to
avoid any risk of shock the monitor should not be submerged or saturated with fluids during operations or cleaning. It does
not emit any radiation to the human body , and does not of fer any significant risk to the subject.
Subjects may experience mild discomfort from the sensor on their legs. W e will inform the subject to please notify the
investigators if the sensor is uncomfortable.
All information we will collect about the subject will be stored in a secure location and coded in a way to maintain
confidentiality . Only study personnel will have access to their records. Data collected during the study may be published
and made publicly available. Data may also be shared with other research groups. However , data that could in any way
identify them will not be made public or shared.
Some of potential risks of using TENS therapy could be: * Skin related discomfort, such as tingling * Skin reaction to
adhesive patch.
If the tingling sensation is too intense for the participant, they have the ability to reduce the intensity for their best level of
comfort.
The risk to participants due to the optional assessments and surveys is considered minimal because all that is required is
simple walking and balance movements in a controlled environment with an attendant present. This research routine will
not place subjects at higher risk than normal activities of daily living, and no more risk of harm or discomfort is associated
with these tests than the discomfort normally incurred while performing normal muscle stretching. Subjects will be allowed
rest time between trials as needed.
Should the subject agree to the optional assessment involving the wearable sensor (P AMSys), the potential risks are
considered minimal as well. This sensor will be used for assessing mobility performance and will perform physical tasks
such as walking, sit-to-stand transitions, standing, physical activity monitoring etc. These assessments are non-invasive,
safe, non-toxic, and non-ionizing as the other procedures described in this study . However , like any battery powered
systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor malfunctioning. In addition, the study devices are not waterproof, and although
they use a low powered battery (similar to a cellphone battery), in order to avoid any risk of shock the monitor should not
be submerged or saturated with fluids during operations or cleaning. It does not emit any radiation to the human body , and
does not of fer any significant risk to the subject. The wearable sensors weigh less than .[ADDRESS_565452] is considered minimal; this device is non-invasive, non-
toxic, and non-ionizing. The device will be placed on the subject's finger , and monitor their oxygen levels.

Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
     There is potential benefit of prevention or improvement of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53771], based on previous studies the electrical stimulation will improve blood flow , tissue perfusion and muscle

https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=460134 9/13activation. The device is used to reduce pain. However , the proposed treatment may assist in preventing or improving
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired W eakness because of prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . In addition, the participation in this study may help the
investigators better understand how COVID19 may impact cause myopathy and neuropathy and how to best help these
patients to recover from prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-stay .
Primary outcomes include neuropathy (assessed using VPT  test); muscle function (assessed using sEMG), and tissue
oxygenation (assessed using Kent Imaging). Secondary outcomes include weakness (assessed using dynamometer);
muscle atrophy (assessed by [CONTACT_53781], calf, and thigh circumference); venous return flow
(Doppler US [optional]); frailty (frailtymeter [optiona]); hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (patient medical record); and major adverse
events (patient health record). The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline (if feasible) and on
biweekly basis up to [ADDRESS_565453]. Appropriate mixed models (linear for continuous
or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) for non-continuous or non-parametric variables) will be used to test the
intervention ef fect for each of the primary (e.g., tissue perfusion, tissue oxygen delivery , neuropathy severity , and
myopathy incident) or secondary (e.g., frailty , weight loss, MAE, etc) outcomes.
Also, participation may help the investigators design a practical assessing method to identify the impact of neuromyopathy
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. This may allow physicians to provide personalized care by [CONTACT_53782][INVESTIGATOR_7577] .
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     As described above, this type of work may allow physicians to provide more personalized care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53772], specially when having a severe illness that includes
medical staf f risk contact.
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     This study brings no more than minimal risk to subjects as it only involves a non-invasive device. There are some risks
associated with lack of comfort from EE, skin allergy to the EE sticky patches that are used for delivering EE therapy , risk
associated with electrical mal-function of EE, and other unknown risks. All EE devices will be checked before any use to
minimize the risk associated with electrical malfunction. All EE devices are FDA  approved for the purpose of pain
reduction. However , these devices have not been used before for purpose of managing COVID-[ADDRESS_565454] of Neuromyopathy in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307](inpatient)
setting.

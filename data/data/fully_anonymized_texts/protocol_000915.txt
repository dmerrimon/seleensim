 
Increasing Kidney Transplant Among Blacks on the Transplant Waiting List  
Trial registration: ClinicalTria ls.gov Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date: December 22, 2019  
 
 
  
 
Background  
Compared to chronic dialysis,  living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) and deceased donor 
kidney transplant (DDKT) both offer decreased mortality, increased quality of life, and lower per 
person per year costs1-4.  LDKT, however,  offers several potential advantages over DDKT.  
LDKT  is associated with better patient and allograft outcomes5, allows the transplant cand idate 
to by[CONTACT_22883] a DDKT , and minimize s (or eliminates) time spent on  chronic 
dialysis .  Therefore, for most end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients, LDKT is the best 
treatment option  for their kidney failure . 
Unfortunately, Blacks are much less likely than non -Blacks to receive LDKTs6-9.  At the 
start of  2018, Blacks comprised 3 2.6% of the DDKT waiting list10.  During 201 8, based on OPTN 
data, Blacks received  32.4% of DDKT s but just 1 2.2% of LDKTs .  Furthermore,  for each year 
since 2000,  the percentage of Black LDKT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22868] 15%.  
Unfortunately, every  transplant center in the U.S. (out of 275)  performs proportionally fewer 
LDKTs among Blacks than non -Blacks8.   
Past i nterventions have sought to help kidney transplant candidates, especially those 
who are Black, to identify living donor s.  Health educators and other staff have intervened  using 
videos, written materials, and in -person discussions  to target patients who are not yet on 
dialysis11,12, patients on dialysis13-15, patients at their initial transplant evaluation16,17, and 
patients on the DDKT waiting list18. Some interventions have targeted chronic kidney disease 
(CKD ) patients early in the transplant process, b efore they appear for transplant evaluation13,19.  
However,  these “proximal” interventions may have difficulty in resulting in  significant increases 
in LDKTs , especially  given the short follow -up periods in most prospective studies13,14,19.  Other 
interventions have targeted CKD patients at transplant centers that usually perform few L DKTs 
in Blacks , often making the se studies  underpowered to demonstrate an increase in LDKT 
among Blacks16,18,20,21.  The only intervention that has been shown to increase LDKT or proxies 
 
for LDKT is h ome visits , but home visits have not been widely adopted due to their cost and 
difficulties in implementing them18.  Overall, almost all i nterventions designed to increase LDKT 
have  been  ineffective22.  
Patients with CKD have reported several barriers that may decrease the likelihood of 
receiving a  LDKT23-27.  These barriers  includ e: lack of knowledge about LDKT23,26,28,29, concerns 
about the donor’s future health23-26,29-34, guilt and concern s about inconveniencing the living  
donor23,25,26, difficulty in asking living dono rs and not knowing how to ask23,25,26,30,35,36, lack of 
medical trust37-43, and lack of interaction with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22869]44-46.  Social, 
behavioral, and educational interventions to increase LDKT, especially among Blacks, would 
ideally  address some or all of these barriers .   
Here, we describe the  protocol of a randomized  controlled trial that is  testing the 
effectiveness of a multi -component educational program  called  “Destination Transplant ”. 
Destination Transplant was designed to  address  some of  these barriers to LDKT and increase  
receipt of LDKTs  among Blacks or African -Americans . Our aims are to: 1)  examine whether the 
educational intervention leads to an increase in Blacks’  readiness to pursue LDKT , and 2) 
examine the impact of the intervention on receipt of LDKTs among Black patients.  
 
Methods /Design  
 
Study Overview  
We designed a randomized clinical trial that will test the effectiveness of an educational 
intervention, Destination Transplant , at increasing , among Black transplant candidate s, both  
readiness to pursue LDK T and actual receipt of LDKT .  The investigators will randomly assign 
kidney transplant c andidates on the kidney transplant waiting list to either: (1) a control group 
that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a group -based 
intervention, as well as monthly mailings and a follow -up phone call by a transplant e ducator.  
 
Prior to initiation of intervention activities,  Destination Transplant was registered on 
clinicaltrials.gov (Protocol #  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).  This study  was approved by  [CONTACT_22884]  (SBMC) (12-69) and Rutgers 
University  (Pro20150001749 ). 
 
Study  population , inclusion/exclusion criteria , and randomization  
Study population  
The target population for this trial will be all kidney transplant candidates who are Black 
and placed on the active waiting list for a DDKT at SBMC.  Whenever possible, at the initial 
transplant evaluation at SBMC or one of our satellite locations,  we wil l “pre-consent ” and explain 
the trial to potential transplant candidates who are Black  and being evaluated for transplant .  We 
will include  potential  transplant candidates who: ●identify themselves as Black; ● are ≥21 years 
of age; and ●give informed consen t.  We will exclude  potential transplant candidates who ●have 
limited English proficiency or ●are unable (e.g. cognitive impairment) or unwilling to give 
informed consent.  An overview of the study design can be found in Figure 1 below.  
For the actual clini cal trial, o ur inclusion and exclusion criteria are identical to the criteria 
for the Pre -consented group, with some additions.  In the  actual trial , we will include  kidney 
transplant candidates who ●are placed on the DDKT waiting list; ●i dentify themselve s as Black;  
●are ≥21 years of age; and  ●complete the baseline questionnaire; and  exclude  kidney 
transplant candidates who ●have limited English proficiency; ●are unable (e.g. cognitive 
impairment) or unwilling to give informed consent; ●lack a working tele phone; ●live >150 miles 
from the transplant center; or ●were en rolled in our prior trial of an educational intervention at 
the time of the initial transplant evaluation17.  
 
Randomization  
 
Patients  who are eligible and consented to the study will be randomly assigned , after 
completing the baseline measurement,  to either Usual Care or the Intervention , in a 1:[ADDRESS_21942] (defined as placement on the waiting list <6 months prior to enrollment) or has alr eady been 
on the waiting list (defined as placement on the waiting list ≥6 mon ths prior to enrollment). 
Random number sequences will be generated by [CONTACT_22885]-site study biostatistician (P.O -S.).  To 
promote allocation concealment, the biostatistician will allocate study participants to their study 
arm at the time of ran domization and  inform the study coordinator of the assigned study arm .  
The study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_22886].   Study participants and the study coordinator will be aware of 
allocati on to Usual Care or the Intervention group, but outcomes assessors will be blinded to the 
allocation group.  
 
Study aims & objectives  
The primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. 
Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial .  Our primary outcome is change in readiness 
to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT af ter 18 months of 
follow -up.  Other  secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that 
modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether the 
intervention affects other precursors of LDKT readiness and receipt, such as knowledge about 
LDKT, self -efficacy, and other social and behavioral factors.    
 
Data collection, follow -up and outcomes  
Baseline Measurement s 
 
After active placement on the waiting list, we will obtain “baseline” measurements of multiple 
social and behavioral attributes, via telephone questionnaires  of all patients enrolled in the study  
(see Figure for flow of patients through the study ).  If we are unable to administer the  baseline  
questionnaires within 2 months of enrollment into the trial (e.g. within [ADDRESS_21943]), then we will not randomize the patient.  This requirement is intended to  
minimize later study dropout.  Study participants will be mailed a $[ADDRESS_21944] for this baseline 
measurement.  
 
Follow -up Measurements : Timing  
Each Usual Care study participant will be matched to one Intervention participant.  For patients 
randomized to the Intervention, we will administer a follow -up questionnaire by [CONTACT_756], 
approximately [ADDRESS_21945]-listing, for b oth Usual Care and Intervention patients, and using the same modality 
(telephone).  A final administration of the study questionnaires will occur at 9 months after 
randomization for patients in both arms.  We will provide $[ADDRESS_21946] of Care  Components  (Usual Care/Control Group ) 
Participants who are randomized to receive the Usual Care engage in the standard education 
and evaluation process given to all patients at SBMC. While on the waiting list, transplant 
candidates are asked to inform the transplant center of important changes in their medical 
condition (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) but otherwise typi[INVESTIGATOR_22870]. Candidates return to the transplant center f or periodic reevaluations by 
 
[CONTACT_22887], usually  every 1 -2 years , depending upon th e transplant candidate’s medical 
comorbidities .  At these reevaluations, transplant personnel usually discuss LDKT.  These Usual 
Care patients will receive  usual conco mitant care but  no additional formal education.  
 
Intervention Components (“ Destination Transplant ”) 
Destination Transplant was developed by a transplant nephrologist, a social psychologist, a 
health communication researcher, and a graphic designer.  Based upon the Transtheoretical 
Model (TTM) of Change47, Destination Transplant is designed to increase both readiness to 
pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Black transplant candidates.  
 
Destination Transplant Education Seminar  
The i ntervention will include  a single, 60 -90 minute educational and motivational 
seminar, delivered to small groups of Black kidney transplant candidates  and their family and 
friends  (see Table 1 for details) . The Intervention seminar will feature  a slide presentation that 
includes brief talks from a physician , patient educator and patient ambassadors (donors and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). We anticipate that each seminar will include 3-5 listed transplant candidate s, as well 
as family and friends. These seminars will b e held at one of our two sites —Saint Barnabas 
Medical Center ( SBMC ), our main site , or our satellite location at Newark Beth Israel Medical 
Center . At the end of each Intervention seminar, we will meas ure the patients’ perceptions of 
the cultural competenc e of the researcher and speakers. Additionally, at various different time 
points throughout the study period, patients will be given educational materials that were 
developed specifically for the Desti nation Transplant program. These education materials were 
modified based on early versions of stage -based, transplant education materials developed by 
[CONTACT_22888] -investigator (A.D.W) for her Explore Transplant and Your Path to Transplant  educational 
programs .  
 
We developed a slide presentation as the main method of education delivery. This 
interactive presentation provides patients with the opportunity to learn general information about 
CKD, the waiting list, and different types of kidney transplant.  Facts abo ut kidney disease, the 
waiting list , and transplant will b e presented in a question and answer format  in the slide 
presentation .  Patients will be asked to respond to true/false and multiple -choice questions and 
receive nearly immediate feedback from the r esearch team and the physician.  The presentation 
focuses upon five types of kidney transplants that the transplant candidates can consider:  
1) DDKT from a “standard” donor  
2) “Nonstandard” DDKT (from donors with either a high kidney donor profile index (KDPI) 
or considered Public Health Service (PHS) increased risk)  
3) Multiple Listing at two or more transplant centers (DDKT at another transplant center in a 
different donation service area)  
4) Direct LDKT  
5) LDKT via Kidney Paired Donation (KPD)  
The slide presentation e ducation is designed to progress through the treatment options 
from least to more difficult, in terms of additional effort needed on the part of the patient.  For 
instance, the first treatment option, DDKT from a standard donor, requires no additional acti on, 
given that each patient is already active on the DDKT waitlist.  Each of the five transplant 
options will be discussed in detail, with concluding statements outlining the necessary steps for 
selecting each option.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22871]:  
 Basic facts abou t CKD, transplant, and the waiting list.   This portion of the 
presentation is designed to increase participant knowledge of CKD, LDKT , and living 
donation.  Specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_22872]: ●basic facts about CKD, ●the 
kidneys, and dialysis; ●benef its of transplant; ●the DDKT waiting list and how it 
 
works; ●types of DDKTs, including high KDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_22873]; ●and how to stay healthy and 
ready for a transplant.  
 The experience of receiving a transplant (by a Black recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a LDKT).   A 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a LDKT who is Black will speak about their own experiences.  The exact 
content of the talk will vary according to the patient, but each talk will discuss the 
following:  ●personal background; ●how the patient developed CKD; ●experience 
while on dialysis or with  CKD; ●how they recruited a living  donor; ●the transplant 
surgery and early post -transplant experience; ●current life with a transplant 
(advantages and disadvantages); ●how their liv ing kidney donor is faring after 
donation; ●misconce ptions about kidney transplant; and ●audience questions.  
 The experience of serving as a liv ing kidney donor (by a Black liv ing kidney donor).   
A living kidney donor who is Black will speak about their own experiences.  The 
exact content will vary according to the donor, but each talk will discuss the following:  
●personal background; ●how the donor became aware of the need for transplant by 
a loved one; ●why the speaker decided to become a live donor; ●testing and 
evaluations to become a donor; ●the actual donation operation; ●life after donation; 
and ●audience questions.  
 Ways to more quickly receive a transplant.   In addition to encouraging LDKT, we will  
encourage study participants in the Intervention arm to consider the following ways 
to more quickly receive a DDKT: ●accept a  high KDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_22875], if deemed medically 
appropriate ; ●accept a  PHS increased risk kidney ; ●get on the DDKT waiting list at 
other tr ansplant centers outside New Jersey and the SBMC donation service area . 
 
Destination Transplant Education Folder  
As a supplement to the slide presentation, patients will be given a folder to take home 
that contains factsheets that provid e an overview of the five t ypes of kidney transplant . Although 
 
the content varies between the factsheets, all factsheets provide patients with instructions or 
further directions on what to do if they are interested in pursuing a particular option.  
 
Destinatio n Transplant Postcards  
During the [ADDRESS_21947]  
per month that  serve s to provide both basic information about kidney disease and additional 
information about the five treatment options. These co lorful postcards feature real recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22876] a donor.  The 9 
postcards address the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
  “Your Exploration of Kidney Transplant Continues at Home” .  Welcomes patients  and 
provides a short list of recommendations for patients who are waiting for a transplant  
 “Consider All Types of Kidneys for Transplant” .  Encourages patients to consider 
nonstandard deceased donor transplant through use of High KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_22877]  
 “Consider  All Types of Kidneys for Transplant” .  Encourages patients to consider 
nonstandard deceased dono r transplant through use of Public Health Service Increased  
Risk donor kidneys  
 “Learn About Living Donation” .  Encourages patients to reach out to others for s upport 
and to consider living donor transplant as a treatment option  
 “Learn Why People Want to Be Living Donors” .  Presents reasons why living donors may 
offer to help out a friend or a loved one.  
 “Compare the Risks and Benefits of Living Donation” .  Provides information about the 
risks (including costs, future impact on health, and risk of death) associated with 
donating a kidney  
 “Consider Getting a Transplant from a Living Donor” .  Provides a list of strategies that 
may be used to help an individual iden tify a potential donor  
 
 “You Can Get a Transplant Even if Your Donor is Not a Match for You” .  Defines and 
explains how Kidney Paired Donation  works  
 “Weigh the Pros and Cons of All Your Options ”.  Provides a side by [CONTACT_22889], deceased donor transplant and living donor transplant  
 
[ADDRESS_21948] -baseline follow -up coaching call   
Approximately 3 months after  the baseline  assessment , patients in the intervention 
condition will receive a follow -up phone call from a coach (transplant research associate) to 
discuss topi[INVESTIGATOR_22878]:  
(1) their transplant plan and decision -making  
(2) what supports they have and/or need to ensure they are able to follow through 
with their transplant plan  
(3) how to discuss LDKT with fri ends and loved ones  
The purpose of the call is to provide additional edu cation and support for patients . These 
conversations also provide additional opportunity for patients to discuss their feelings about and 
willingness to pursue the various transplant options. This call serves as a mini -assessment 
wherein the coach assesses patient readiness to pursue LDKT. At the conclusion of the 
coaching call, patients are given the option to receive additional educational materials designed 
to help bolster their con fidence in potential discussions about their need for an LDKT.  
Patients expressing interest in learning more will be given the option to receive the 
Explore Living Donation Packet  and the Finding a Living Donor Booklet .  Each resource 
provides patients wit h practical, skills -based information to help initiate conversations about 
living donation. Through these materials patients will engage with videos and print materials that 
provide detailed descriptions about how others have found living donors. Additiona lly, patients 
 
are given several sample letters that others have used with family and friends to help them 
identify potential donors.  
 
Evaluation and Statistical Plan  
 
Measures  
 
 Patient information was obtained, mainly via questionnaires, at baseline, int erim follow -
up (as explained above in Follow -up Measurements: Timing ), and 9 months  (Table 2) .  
Descriptions of these measures are below.  Unless otherwise indicated, all measures were 
assessed at baseline, follow -up, and 9 months.  
 
Demographic, clinical, and cultural factors  (baseline only)  
During the baseline assessment, patients will be asked some basic demographic  and cultural  
questions such as their age, biological sex, race, and ethnicity. Clinical information will  be 
collected, including data such as  patient dialysis status and comorbidities such as diabetes, 
hypertension, and polycystic kidney disease.  
 
Transplant derailers  (baseline only)  
Transplant derailers can be described as individual factors that might be sources of delay, 
difficulty, or chal lenge to a patient pursuing transplant. These f actors include  education, job 
status, income, health insurance quality, neighborhood/environmental assessment, financial 
stability, access to transportation, and family obligations.  
 
Transplant knowledge & health literacy  
 
To assess heath literacy, the two -item subjective health literacy and numeracy measure was 
used48. Extent  of previous transplant education and current transplant knowledge measures 
were adapted from  previously developed m easures.[ADDRESS_21949] of actions that people may take related to getting a living donor 
transplant (e.g., talk to people you trust about whether to get a living donor transplant or ask 
potential donors to be tested).  
 
Measures of readiness for LDKT , based upon TTM  
We use previously validated scales49 to measure  readiness to pursue LDKT and the pros and 
cons of living donation. The r eadiness measures assess how ready patients  are to take actions 
to pu rsue LDKT, based upon the stages in the Trans -Theoretical Model of Change (e.g.  “I am 
not considering taking actions in the next six months to pursue living donation ” (Pre -
contemplation) ).  We also measured readiness using the scales developed  by  [CONTACT_22890].21, 
which  also measure readiness for LDKT but use slightly different wording (e.g. “ I am not thinking 
about or considering live donor kidney transplantation ” (Pre -contemplation)  and “I have thought 
about live donor kidney transplantation and I am seriously considering the possibility ” 
(Preparation) ).  The pros and cons assessment asks participants to rate the importance of a 
series of statements about transplant to their decision to pursue LDKT( e.g.,  “I will feel guilty 
having someone donate to me” or “With a living donor transplant, I will be able to contribute to 
my family and friends sooner”).   
 
LDKT Decisional Balance and Self-efficacy  
 
Decisio nal Balance items will measure  the perceived importance  to patients  of the possible 
positive and ne gative outcomes of LDKT .  Patients will be asked  “How important is this 
statement to your decision about  living donor  transplant?” and then be asked to respond to 12 
positive and negative sta tements (e.g. “I will  feel guilty having someone donate to me” , “I will be 
healthier because I spent less time on dialysis” ).  Responses will be measured on a 5-point 
Likert -type scale (1 = "Not important" t o 5 = "Extremely important") . To assess LDKT self -
efficacy , we will use  6 items adapted from prior studies e xploring LDKT49.  Items will measure  
how confident participants are that they could continue their pursuit of LDKT even if they were 
faced w ith a various challenges (e.g. “Y ou don’t know anyone who might be a living donor for 
you” or “Y ou asked someone to donate and they turned you down ”).  Responses to these items 
will also be on a 5 -point Likert scale, (1=”Not at all confident” to 5=” Completely confident”).  
 
Family Support & Living Donor Availability -  
These questions measure  the participants’ support networks. Questions include the number of 
available donors , quality of the potential donors as determined by [CONTACT_22891], number  of 
donor offers and willingness to consider paired donation. Additionally, a brief assessment of 
Unmet Social Support Needs50,[ADDRESS_21950] received in comparison to how much they’ve needed.  
 
General Health Status  
The Centers for Disease Control HRQ OL-452 will be used as a measure of general health 
status. This 4 -item assessment asks participants to report on overall health status (i.e., physical, 
mental, and emotional health) in the last [ADDRESS_21951] Scale (follow -up and 9 months only)  
This scale asks respondents to reflect on the information they received about their treatment 
options and reflect on the option they chose (e.g., I know the risks and side effects of each 
option and I have enough advice to make a choice).[ADDRESS_21952] a review of participants’  medical records to assess transplant -related outcomes  
at [ADDRESS_21953] -randomization . These measures will include:  
 
Receipt of LDKT  
We will determine whether or not trial participants have received a LDKT in the [LOCATION_002] 
during the [ADDRESS_21954] udy participant during the 18 
month follow -up period.  Persons are considered “donor volunteers” after they (1) contact [CONTACT_22892], and (2) 
complete and return a Living Donor Refer ral Form (included in the packet) to SBMC.  
 
Nursing education of donor volunteers  
After returning the Donor Referral Form, donor volunteers must complete an in -person 
education session regarding live kidney donation. As the first step  in the donor evaluati on, 
appearance at the transplant center for this education is a sign of the “seriousness” of the donor 
volunteer’s intent to donate.  For each study participant, we will determine how many (if any) of 
their donor volunteers appeared for an in -person nursin g education session.  
 
Status on the DDKT waiting list  
We will determine the status of study participants still on the waiting list after the 18 month  
follow -up period. Specifically , we will determine whether they are: ●active (Status 1), or 
●inactive (Stat us 7) on the waiting list.  Other patients will have been removed from the SBMC 
waiting list because they: ●died; ●became too sick to transplant; ●refused transplant; 
●transferred to another center; ●improved and no longer required transplant; ●received a 
DDKT; ●received a LDKT; or ●other.  We will determine these reasons, along with the date they 
occurr ed, by [CONTACT_22893].  
 
Statistical analyses  
Our initial analysis will be descriptive.  Our main analysis will use standar d intention -to-
treat principles .  First, we will describe participants’  baseline characteristics  and compar e 
 
summary statistics  of the Usual Care and Intervention groups .  These summary statistics will 
include mean, standard deviation, median, and range for continuous variables, and counts and 
frequencies for categorical variables.  Two -sample t -tests, Wilcoxon rank -sum tests (for non -
parametric variables) and chi -squared tests will be used to test for differences between the 
Usual Care and Intervention group s, as appropriate.  
For our primary outcome (increase in readiness to pursue LDKT), we will compare, using 
chi-square testing, the proportion of participants in the Usual Care vs. Intervention arms who 
have advanced at least one stage in their readiness to pursue LDKT (between the time of 
placement on waiting list and the time of reassessment at 18 months).  For our main secondary 
outcome (receipt of LDKT), we will compare, using chi -square testing, the proportion of study 
participants in the Usual Care vs. Intervention arms who have received a LDKT.  Sensitivity 
analyses will assess the intervention effect, adjusting for clustering of response by [CONTACT_22894] (because failing to account for clustering can reduce power)56,57.   
To determine which baseline factors (e.g. age), if any, modify the effect of the 
Intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes, logistic regression will model the log-odds 
of the outcome as a function of the intervention, while controlling for these factors of interest.  
Tests for modification by [CONTACT_22895] s.  We will perform logistic regression58 
and model -building as we have in prior published analyses59-61. 
To test the effect of the intervention upon other precursors of LDKT readiness and 
receipt (e.g. knowledge abo ut LDKT, self -efficacy, and other social and behavioral factors), we 
will use stratified chi -square tests for categorical variables and linear regression models for 
semi -continuous scales.  The chi -square tests and linear regression models will be stratifi ed by 
[CONTACT_22896] (≤6 months vs. > 6 months).  We will examine 
effects adjusted and unadjusted for baseline value for each respective scale.  
 
 
Power and sample size calculations  
The proportion of Usual Care (control) patients who have increased readiness for LDKT 
could plausibly range from 0.10 to 0.40, while the proportion who receives a LDKT is expected 
to equal 0.14 (based on prior baseline data from our center ).  Assuming ther e are 250 or 200 
(assuming 100% and 80% retention rates) participants in each group, powers for increases of 
0.10, 0.15, and 0.[ADDRESS_21955] >80% power to 
detect a clinically significant increase in LDKT readiness  and receipt of LDKT.  We may be 
slightly underpowered only for very small increases in these two outcomes.  Clustering by 
[CONTACT_22897]56,57,62, but we should have 
sufficient  power to detect an effect of the Intervention upon our LDKT readiness and receipt .

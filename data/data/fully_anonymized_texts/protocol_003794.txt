Version  5.6.[ADDRESS_1022151] a wire into the cancer pre-operatively (in Radiology 
under mammographic, ultrasound or MRI gui dance) and then, in the Operating 
Room, to excise the tissue around the wire.  This technique, initially developed in 
the 1970’s, has several limitations.  It adds a separate procedure to the surgical 
resection, thereby [CONTACT_747092].  Standard 
localization involves placement of one wire as close as possible to the clip left at 
the time of diagnostic core biopsy, or cl ose to residual masses or calcifications.  
Mammographic images are then taken in two projections and the surgeon must 
then estimate the location of the cancer from these wire locali zation films.  In 
many cases this imprecisely localizes t he cancer, resulting in positive margin 
rates from 30-50% (1,2).  Additional pr ecision can be gained by  [CONTACT_747093], but this increases the length of time for the localization procedure (3).  Wire localization is an ineffici ent and imprecise technique.  
 Because of these limitations, effort s have been made to find alternatives 
to wire localization.  Intra-operative ultrasound has been evaluated and been shown to be superior to wire localization (4-6), but over half of mammographically 
visible invasive cancers and most ductal carcinoma in situ lesions are not visible on US.  Targeting the resection at the hem atoma left from the initial core biopsy

has had some success in early retrospective  studies (7,8).  Neither of these 
techniques has been widely adopted. 
 MRI of the breast has been shown by [CONTACT_747094] (9-12) for the detecti on of breast cancer.  Furthermore, 
several studies have demonstrated the ability of MRI to detect mammo-graphically and clinically occult foci of cancer in the ipsilateral breast in approximately 25% of patients (9,13-15).  In many cases the local extent of the 
tumor is better defined by [CONTACT_9268], while in some cases additional foci of cancer are 
seen in other quadrants of the breast.  
While it seems intuitive that a sur geon would want to precisely know the 
extent of disease prior to lumpectomy , some argue that MR I is not justified 
unless it is shown to have a significant c linical impact, i.e., that MRI appropriately 
changes the surgical management, or that t he positive margin rate is decreased, 
or that the local recurrence rate is less in patients who undergo pre-op MRI.  The 
retrospective studies described above did demonstrate that MRI resulted in a 
change in surgical management in 25%  of patients (performing larger 
lumpectomies so as to try to completely  resect the tumor or  excising additional 
multicentric tumors in the breast).  T hese studies did not address whether the 
positive margin rate was decreased by [CONTACT_378341] e of MRI.  This wi ll be addressed in 
the Comparative effectiveness of MRI in br east cancer (COMICE) trial in Great 
Britain, where [ADDRESS_1022152] conservation patients undergoing MRI was lower than that seen in concurrent patients not receiving MRI.  These studies had 
conflicting results.  In one, 215 women w ho had MRIs had a LR rate of 3%, which 
was not significantly diffe rent than the rate of 4%  in 541 women not undergoing 
MRI (16).  In contrast, Fischer found a lo wer rate of in breast recurrence in pts 
who had MRI (1% vs 7%) (17).  In summary, breast MRI has been shown to 
better define the local extent of t he breast cancer than mammography and 
results in changes in surgical management, but has not yet been demonstrated to decrease the positive margin rate or the rate of local recurrence.  While it is 
 
Version  5.6.[ADDRESS_1022153] is a recent Japanese study that evaluated 
resections based on supi[INVESTIGATOR_747079] 24 pat ients with DCIS and compared them to 
28 patients who had prone MRI and wire localiz ed resections (18).  The positive 
margin rate was lower in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_747080] (12% vs 39%, p=0.03) and the 
volume of breast tissue removed was less ( 27 vs 57 cm3, p=0.001).  In this study

Section 2.  OBJECTIVES  
 We propose to use a novel technique ( optical scanning) to correlate the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_747082].  In the first phase of the study, 5-[ADDRESS_1022154] conservation will be randomized to 
either a usual care group, or a group receiving a supi[INVESTIGATOR_747083] (mammogram and prone MRI) and undergoing breast cancer resection without the wire localization technique. 
 The primary objective will be to determine whether the addition of supi[INVESTIGATOR_747084] a lower positive margin rate  in patients undergoing breast conserving 
surgery.  Our secondary objectives will be to determine: 
1. whether there are differences betw een the two groups in the volume of 
breast tissue removed. 
2. whether diagnostic information obtained from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_747085].

head for easy viewing.  This image display will indicate the distances at a particular radian (measured in terms of clock hours and minutes) from the nipple to all aspects (cranial, caudal, medial, la teral) of the tumor.  The image display 
will also indicate the distances from t he skin to the tumor and from the tumor to 
the chest wall.  Measurement s of the distance from the nipple to these edges of 
the palpable tumor at specif ied, measured radians will also will be made by [CONTACT_747096][INVESTIGATOR_747086].   
 
Phase 2.  Patients with  histologic evidence of  invasive carcinoma or ductal 
carcinoma in situ will undergo bilateral breas t MRI in the prone position, as is the 
current standard at Dartmouth.   At the time of surgical  consultation, patients with 
non-palpable breast cancers who desire breast conservation will be invited to be a part of the study.  Consenting patients will undergo randomization,  stratified by

Version  5.6.[ADDRESS_1022158] enhanced supi[INVESTIGATOR_747087], followed by [CONTACT_747098] I (19).  
 Standard radiologic images (mamm ograms, ultrasounds, prone MRI 
images) will be available to the surgeon at the time of surgery for all patients.  
Patients in Group W, the usual care group, will undergo standard of care breast conserving surgery as practiced at our institution for non-palpable breast 
cancers. 
Patients in Group S will undergo a supi[INVESTIGATOR_580536] a convenient time within 
a week of surgery. They will have an optic al scan of the breast surface while on 
the OR table on the day of surgery. Using the methods de scribed and validated 
in Phase I, the scan data will be used to adjust (coregister) the supi[INVESTIGATOR_747088]-operatively into a highly accurate representation of the 
breast and MRI defined tumor mass at the ti me of surgery. This coregistered 
image will be projected on a screen for easy viewing by [CONTACT_11065]. A hand 
held, sterile stylus pointer will be tr acked during surger y and will allow the 
surgeon to point to a specific location on the breast and see exactly where that 
point is on the screen image display. The image display will indicate the 
distances from the nipple to all aspects (c ranial, caudal, medial , lateral) of the 
tumor, as well as the distances from t he tumor to the skin and from the tumor to 
the chest wall. Guided by [CONTACT_747099]. The sterile stylus probe 
may be used during the procedure to relate points in the surgical field to their 
corresponding location on the coregist ered supi[INVESTIGATOR_747089]. The surgeon will 
resect the breast tumor volume that is identified by [CONTACT_747100].  
The surgical specimens will be water di splaced to determine their volume. 
The specimen will then be inked by [CONTACT_747101] 6 different colors to orient the specimen (black: deep, blue: super ficial, green: caudal, orange: cranial, 
yellow: lateral and red: medial), and will undergo specimen mammography. Specimens will then be sent to Pathology.  Margins for invasive cancers will be considered positive if cancer cells ar e present at the edge.  Margins will be

considered positive for DCIS if there are tumor cells < [ADDRESS_1022159] MRI and represent no more additional risk than would be experienced by [CONTACT_747102] (non-research) 
breast care.  The risk of c ontrast enhanced MRI is very low, reflecting the minute 
risk of life threatening allergy and devel opment of nephrogenic sclerosis related 
to gadolinium based intravenous contrast.  Patients deemed to be at higher risk 
for gadolinium induced nephrogenic scleros is because of compromised renal 
function will not be eligible for partici pation.  Patients who experience a 
significant allergic reaction to gadolinium based intravenous contrast at the time 
of their clinical prone MRI will also be cons idered ineligible for study participation. 
 Optical scans will be performed using a GO!Scan 3D optical scanner (Creaform, Levis, Quebec, Canada). This scanner will be able to scan the entire 
breast in 1 minute. It uses white light (L ED) to form the image, like a flashlight. 
There are no anticipated risks associated with the use of this scanner.

Version  5.6.[ADDRESS_1022160] phase will be to determine how closely 
the optical scan adjusted images of the tumor location correspond with the 
location as identified by [CONTACT_747103].  
Precise distances from the nipple to the superior, inferior, medial and lateral 
edges of the tumor will be taken from the adjusted MRI images and then marked on the patient’s skin.  T he surgeon will then palpate the tumor and measure the 
distance between the palpable superior, inferior, medial and lateral tumor edges 
and the spots located by [CONTACT_9268]. An adjust ed image will be considered acceptable if 
all 4 image guided measurement s are < [ADDRESS_1022161] 5 patients on this phas e of the study.  We will move on to 
Phase II when 90% of the measurement s in the previous [ADDRESS_1022162]. Wendy Wells, has performed a detailed 
analysis of the surgical margins for patients who had a core biopsy which was 
positive for cancer or DCI S and then underwent partial mastectomy at Dartmouth 
in the year 2005.  A total of 125 patient s with invasive ductal carcinoma were 
identified: 31 (25%) had positive margins.  Twenty six of 53 patients undergoing partial mastectomy for DCIS had positive margins (45%).  Overall, 57/178 
 
Version  5.6.14 
 11
patients (32%) had positive margins.  A two-thirds decrease in the positive 
margin rate (i.e., from 32%  to 11 percent or less) woul d be clinically meaningful. 
The primary analysis will cons ist of computing the positive margin rate observed 
in the two groups and comparing them wit h a chi-squared test.  Based on a chi-
squared test with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a sample size 
of 69 patients will be requi red in each group.  
We will adopt a sequential testing procedure to assure that possible 
increases in the expected margin rate ar e detected.  After 10% of the patients 
are enrolled, or [ADDRESS_1022163] for proportions will be applied.  If 
proportion of positive margins is greater th an 32% and the p-value for the test is 
less than 0.004, the trial will be stopped as possibly increasing the rate.  This 
procedure maintains the significance level at 0.05 and the power at 80% using 
Pocock boundaries for the Lan and Demets alpha spending function.[20] 
Annually at Dartmouth we care for approximately 300 patients with 
invasive ductal cancer and 100 patients with DCIS.  Approximately ⅔  of these 
patients (266) will undergo breast conserving  surgery.  Approx imately ¾ of these 
patients will have non-palpable tumors ( 200).  We anticipat e that it will be 
possible to accrue one third (67) of these patients per year.  Thus, we expect that 
it will take 2 years to complete accrual. 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed as follows.  The mean specimen  
volume from Group S will be compared to the mean specimen volume from 
Group W using t - statistics.  The concor dance between lesion volumes identified 
on the supi[INVESTIGATOR_747090].  
Relevant data will be saved in Velos ca se report forms.  The NCCC Safety 
and Data Monitoring Committee will m onitor this trial quarterly.  
 
Section 9.  HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
 The patients for this study will be accrued from the population treated at 
the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center .  All patients will sign an informed 
 
Version  5.6.14

consent, which describes the treatment  to be performed and discusses the risks 
and benefits of participation in the study. 
 Risk/Benefit analysis:  
Risks associated with the experimental arm of this study include the risks 
of an additional MRI and all participants hav e potential confident iality risks.  The 
risk of an additional MRI is negligible  and reflects the minute risk of life 
threatening allergy and development of nephrogenic sclerosis related to 
gadolinium based intravenous contrast.  Patients deemed to be at higher risk for gadolinium induced nephrogenic sclerosis  because of compromised renal 
function will not be eligible for partici pation.  Patients who experience a 
significant allergic reaction to gadolinium based intravenous contrast at the time 
of their clinical prone MRI will also be consid ered ineligible for study participation.  
Risk of breach of confidentiality of the medical records of participants will 
be minimized.  Subject identity is numerically coded and is not available to research investigators or otherwise st ored on the databases maintained by [CONTACT_747104].  In this regard, all conventional clinical image data 
is de-identified prior to its use for analys is.  Databases which are used to store 
subject-sensitive information, even though completely de-identified as stored, are 
password-protected and encrypted during file/data transfers from viewing 
terminals.  As further safe-guard, t he Data Safety Monitoring and Accrual 
Committee of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center will oversee the conduct of the 
trial. 
The potential benefits associ ated with the experimental  arm of this study 
include lower positive margin rates,  smaller excision volumes, and less 
discomfort since they will avoid the wire placement.  
The importance of the knowledge to  be gained and the ultimate potential 
for benefit for future patients if this new technology is effective far outweighs the 
nominal risks experienced by [CONTACT_747105] o participate in this clinical study.  
 
Version  5.6.[ADDRESS_1022164] of care.  Thus, any 
woman of child-bearing years enrolled in  this protocol would already understand 
(and have accepted) the surgic al risks to her fertility.  
Only women will be enrolled in th e study because breast cancer is 
predominantly a female disease.  The imaging apparatus is design to 
accommodate the size and shape variati ons associated with the adult female 
breast.  While a very small proportion of  breast cancer appears in males, the 
imaging systems are not designed to image the male breast.  All racial and ethnic 
categories will be recruited commensurate with the racial /ethnic composition of 
the DHMC patient catchment area. 
Patients will be considered “on study ” and will be monitored for adverse 
events by [CONTACT_747106] 2 weeks after 
surgery.

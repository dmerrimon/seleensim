1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)  
Systemic sclerosis  (SSc)  is an uncommon disease, however has the highest case specific 
mortality of any of the rheumatic disease.   The features of this disease include chronic, 
fibrosing , autoimmune responses  characterized by [CONTACT_104698], autoantibody 
production, and fi broblast dysfunction leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix.1 
Systemic scl erosis is further divided into two subtypes defined by [CONTACT_104699]: limite d cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse cuta neous systemic sclerosis2.  
According to LeRoy and colleagues, classification to limited or diffuse disease is based o n the 
extent of skin tightening3.  In limited disease skin tightening is confined to the fingers, hands, 
and forearms distal to the elbows, with or without tightening of skin of the feet and of the legs 
distal to the knees. Proximal extremities and the trunk are not involved. In dcSSc , the skin of 
the proximal extremities and trunk is also involved. Both diffuse and limited SSc  are 
associated with internal organ involvement; however, patients with diffuse SSc are at greater 
risk for clinically significant major organ dysfunction .  
SSc is an or phan disease with an estimated US prevalence of 276 patients /106 4.  
Vascular burden in SSc:  Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) is an almost universal m anifestation 
of SSc, with 95% of all patients being affected.  The burden of SSc -associated vascular 
complications is high, with up to 65% of patients experiencing DU, 10% gangrene or amputation, 15% renal crisis, 15%pulmonary hypert ension and 17% peripher al vascular 
disease
[ADDRESS_116089] which 
patients will develop severe vascular complications. Moreover, there are no FDA -approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104679]- associated Raynaud phenomenon and DU. Identifying a therapy that 
diminishes or prevents the progression of SSc  vasculopathy  and complications would 
significantly improve outcomes, and increase our understanding of the underlying mechanistic abnormalities
7.  
 The goal of the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_104680] a 16 -week 
treatment with atorvastatin vs. placebo in patients with early diffuse SSc and Raynaud phenomenon.   
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: 8 of 34 
 
1.1.2 Atorvastatin  
1.1.3 Mechanism of Action  
Atorvastatin is a HMG coenzyme -inhibitor, which was FDA approved in 1996.  A torvastatin 
is a hydrophobic statin with the ability to ente r endothelial cells and has a long history of 
safety in multiple diseases, including prior use in SSc patients.  Atorvastatin has been shown 
in other rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Behҫet disease) to improve endothelial function and disea se activity
8-10 and is available in a generic form.   
1.2 Rationale of the study  
Raynaud phenomenon affects 95% or more of patients with SSc.  Unfortunately, there are no drugs approved in US for the treatment of Raynaud phenomenon.  Raynaud is felt to represent the earliest signs of micro vascular endothelial dysfunction in SSc.      
 Statins have beneficial pleiotropic effects on the vasculature and may modify all three aspects of the SSc disease process. Statins are known to improve endothelial function by [CONTACT_104700] (NO) production (vasculopathy), down- regulating vascular adhesion molecules 
that subsequently inhibit lymphocyte migration from the vasculature (immune system activation)
1, and inhibiting overproduction of matri x components (fibrosis)[ADDRESS_116090] assessed macrovascular endpoints such as brachial flow -
mediated dilation (FMD) for a microvascular disease.   Of the five studies, two small placebo 
controlled randomized trials of atorvastatin.  The lower dose study (atorvastatin 20 mg daily for 8 weeks) was negative but used patients with late disease (up to 47 years).  The higher dose study (40 mg daily) was positive, but also using late disease patients and found an increase in brachial FMD as a positive outcome.  No studies have evaluated the effect of 
statins on microvascular endothelial function in SSc, although this is the primary vasculature affected in Raynaud phenomenon and early SSc .  In our preliminary work in early SSc 
patients, arteriole -level microvascular changes appear attenuated by [CONTACT_104701] (40% with 
abnormal EndoPAT in statin users versus 100% in non- statin users, p= 0.03) .  Based on this, 
we propose that early  statin intervention will improve microvascular endothelial function and 
thus reduce Raynaud activity.  
 
Benefit -risk assessment  
There are currently no disease- speci fic pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_104681].  Considering the mechanism of action and pleiotropic effects of atrovastatin we 
believe the potenti al benefits of atrovastatin include : 
• Improvement of microvascular endothelial function  
• Decrease sever ity of Raynaud’s attacks.  
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: 9 of 34 
 
• Improvement of microcirculatory flow as evaluated by [CONTACT_104702]  
• Improvement of macrovascular endothelial fun ction as evaluated by [CONTACT_104703] -
mediated dilation.  
• Taking into account the seriousness of the disease as well as the medical need for an 
effective and safe  therapy, on balance the expected benefit to  subjects with this 
condition outweighs potential ri sks. 
2. Study objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the eff ect of atorvastatin therapy on change in 
microvascular endothelial function as measured by [CONTACT_104704].   
The s econdary objectives  of this study are to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with 
atorvastatin 40 mg once daily as follows:    
Secondary objectiv es 
• Change in Raynaud symptoms  
• Change in microcirculatory flow assessed by [CONTACT_104702]  
• Change in macrovascular function ass essed by [CONTACT_104705]

4. Study design  
4.1 Design overview  
In this single -center, (1:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study, a total of 
30 subjects are planned to be randomize d (approximately 15 subjects  to the  atorvastatin group 
and 15 to the placebo group). 
The study design consists  of a single 16 week study treatment phase  
• Screening phase:   up to 4 weeks  
• Main Study Treatment phase:  16 weeks  of double -blind treatmen t  
• Termination Visit a nd Safety follow -up visit: A termination  visit and a safety 
follow -up visit will take place for all patients who discontinue study drug or withdraw 
from the study.  
 
Figure 4 -1: Study Design  
 
4.1.1 Screening  phase  (up to 4 weeks)  
After signing the informed consent document, subjects will undergo a screening to include 
baseline labs (creatinine and LFTs) and review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Screening

as part of routine care within 28 days of the baseline.  
 
4.1.2 Study  Treatment phase ( Week  0 to Week  16) 
At the baseline  (week 0)  visit, subjects who have met all of the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization scheme that will be regulated 
centrally through the UPMC IDS.   Each patient enrolling in the study will be assigned an ID .  
At week 0 patients will undergo asses sment of Raynaud activity/severity and noninvasive 
vascular imaging.  
Patients will have a visit at week 8 to assess safety, tolerability and adverse effects of the study drug.  Raynaud activity/severity and DU will be assessed.   
Patients will have a fina l end of study visit at we ek 16 to assess safety, tolerability and 
adverse effects of the study drug.  They will also undergo assessment of Raynaud activity/severity and noninvasive vascular imaging.

7.4 Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacokinetic will not be performed in this study.  
7.5 Safety  
7.5.1 Adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( ie,any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  T herefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product.  
In the  following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal eg,  physical examination findings, symptoms, diseases, laboratory, ECG . 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  will be  recorded as medical 
history ( eg, seasonal allergy without  acute complaints).  
• Conditions
 that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , will be  
recorded as medical history  (eg, allergic pollinosis) . 
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as AE s. 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threa tening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it  were more severe.  
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: [ADDRESS_116105] one of the following exceptions is met: 
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours  
- The admission is pre -planned  
(ie, elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
- The admission is not associated with an AE  
(eg, social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
Howev er, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifical ly require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another  medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_104709].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_116106] be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Intensity  
The intensity of an AE is classified according to the following categories: 
- Mild  
- Moderate  
- Severe  
Mild is defined as asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate is defined as moderate symptoms present; only minimal intervention indicated. 
Severe is defined as  severe or medically significant symptoms requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104687].  
 
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: 24 of 34 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal R elationship /Definitions of Attribution  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a clinical decision b ased on all available information.  The assessment is based on the 
question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question. 
An assessment of “not related” is defined as an adverse event being clearly not related or 
unlikely to be related.   Adverse events can also be attributed as “possible/probable” defined as reasonably possible or likely to be related, or “definite” defined as the adverse event is clearly related.   
Important f actors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment 
include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event . 
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re- introduction (re -
challenge):  
- Subject’s response after de- challenge or subjects response after re- challenge should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event i n question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in 
question. 
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  The pharmacokinetic  properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of 
the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be  documented using the categories 
listed below.  
- Drug withdrawn  
- Drug interrupted  
- Not applicable  
- Unknown 
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: 25 of 34 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Outcome  
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
- Recovered, without treatment  
- Recovered, with treatment  
- Still present, no treatment 
- Still present, being treated 
- Residual effect(s) present, no treatment  
- Residual effect (s) present, being treated  
- Subject died  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and documentation of adverse events  
The investigator has the obligation to report AEs. All non- serious events will be assesse d and 
recorded during this trial from the baseline visit and until the end of study visit at week 16, 
whether believed to be related or unrelated to the treatment. The record will include clinical symptoms or final diagnosis when available, date of appeara nce, duration, severity, 
relationship to treatment and outcome. A record will also be kept of the action taken and the 
follow -up until resolution of the AE.  For patients who stop study drug or withdraw before the 
end of the trial  (16 week visit) , AE will be re- assessed at 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_104688] a 
follow -up study visit.   For all others, adverse events will be followed for 30 days, with 
patients contact[CONTACT_104710] .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting  of serious adverse events  
The definition of SAEs is given in Sec tion [IP_ADDRESS].  
Investigator’s notification to the Safety Monitor  
All SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  must 
immediately (within 48 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to KAI, NIAMS  
and the internal Safety Officer .  An SAE form  must also be completed within [ADDRESS_116107] be followed up until resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_57129] .   
Notification of the IRB  
Notification of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_104689] ( eg, SAEs , 
suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions [ S[LOCATION_003]Rs ]) will be performed  according to  
IRB regulations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse events, and events of special safety  interest  
Common expected adverse events include: myalgias/arthralgias (> 10%), diarrhea (5 -14%), 
nasopharyngitis (4- 13%), and dyspepsia (3- 6%).   
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: 26 of 34 
 
There are four significant adverse events associated with the use of atorvastatin which include 
1) increase in fasting blood glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus; 2) hepatotoxicity; 3) rhabdomyolysis; and 4) the very rare event of immune -mediated necrotizing myopathy.  
Diabetes mellitus is an exclusion criteria for this study.   
In regards to hepatotoxicity, e levated  serum transaminases have been reported in as high as 2-
3% of patients taking a higher dose of atorvastatin (80 mg once daily), although postmarketing reports of hepatic failure are rare.   These will be monitored at baseline, week 8 
and week 16.  We will discontinue if hepatic enzymes are > three times the upper limit of 
normal.   
Many patients  receiving HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors experience myalgias, and this is an 
expected adverse event.  P atients receiving HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors have developed 
rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure and/or myopathy .   This risk is dose -related and is 
increased with concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors), fibric acid derivatives (eg, gemfibrozil), or niacin (doses ≥1 g/day) ( see Drug Interactions) , 
which will be monitored.  Serum CPKs will be checked at baseline, week 8 and week 16.  We 
will advise patients not to perform unusual or heavy bouts of exercise in the 24 hours before 
visits.  We will discontinue in any patient in w hich CPK levels are markedly elevated (> [ADDRESS_116108]) or if myopathy is suspected/diagnosed.   Patients will be instructed to report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness, or brown urine .  If they develop any of these 
symptoms, they will return for an interval visit with repeat CPK and exam at that time.  
Patients receiving HMB -CoA reductase inhibitors have also been rarely reported to develop 
an immune -mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM . IMNM presents as proximal muscle 
weakness with elevated CPK levels, which persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_104690] -CoA 
reductase inhibitor therapy.  Serum CPKs will be checked at baseline, week 8 and week 16.  
We will discontinue in any patient in which C PK levels are markedly elevated (>[ADDRESS_116109]) or if myopathy is suspected/diagnosed.    
 Declaration of an event as serious should only occur when 1 or more of the serious criteri a 
(as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) are applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse events 
Expected adverse events are those listed as common (incidence > 2%) in patients treated with atorvastatin per the package insert.  These include nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, extremity discomfort and urinary tract infection.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unxpected adverse ev ents 
An adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the package insert for atorvastatin (please see Appendix I of the MOOP ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancies  
A report of a confirmed pregnancy by [CONTACT_104711], although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE.   
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up to completion. 
 
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: [ADDRESS_116110] agree to use 
adequate contr aception when sexually active.   ‘Adequate contraception’ is defined as any 
combination of at least [ADDRESS_116111] one is a physical 
barrier (e.g. condoms with hormonal contraception or implants or combined oral 
contraceptives, certain intrauterine devices) .  The exception will be women who have 
undergone tubal ligation and men who hav e undergone a vasectomy.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_116112] for 15 minutes in a quiet, dark and temperature- controlled room (set at 77 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer).  Measurement of 
EndoPAT™, LSCI and brachia l FMD will be performed  simultaneously.  Measurements will 
be obtained before and after vascular occlusion for all studies to assess endothelial dependent vasodilation.  LSCI and brachial FMD will then be performed before and after administration of 0.[ADDRESS_116113]’s right arm.  
Once the acclimation period has ended, a baseline pulse and flow measurements will then be obtai ned for 5 minutes  for all modalities .  Following this vaso -occlusion will be induced by 
[CONTACT_104712] a pressure of 280 mmHg or 60 mmHg higher than systolic blood pressure (whichever was the highest), for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes the c uff will be 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_104691] 5 minutes.  Subjects will then receive a single 0.4 mg sublingual spray of NTG.  We will then obtain measurements as detailed in the individual vascular studies below over a period of 10 minutes.   
7.5.4 EndoPAT  
Measurement of microvascular endothelial function will be performed using Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT) device (EndoPAT 2000, version 3.3.2, Hamar Medical, Caesavea, Israel).  EndoPAT is a well -validated instrument
18.  After  the vascular assessment acclimation 
period, probes will be placed on the tips of both index fingers.  PAT signal measurement will be performed with the digital probe inflation pressure set at 10mmHg below the diastolic 
pressure or 70 mmHg (whichever is lowest ) (17).  Baseline pulse amplitude will be recorded 
bilaterally on tips of the index fingers for [ADDRESS_116114] -to-pre occlusion ratio of the control arm, w ill be calculated as 
the Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI ).  
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: [ADDRESS_116115] Imaging  
For assessment of LSCI we will use the PerCam PSI system  (Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden), 
which produces a near infrared (780 nm) laser light.  The backscattered light forms a random 
interferen ce (speckle) pattern. Movement, as produced by [CONTACT_104713], causes 
the speckle pattern intensity to change, thus allow ing for quantification of flow. The PeriCam 
PSI system will be used with the camera pl aced 20  cm above the SSc patient’s h and, which 
will be immo bilized by a fluid support.  A region of interest on the 2nd proximal 
metacarpophalangeal joint will be identified prior to beginning assessments.  Baseline LSCI 
measurements w ill be obtained continuously beginning five minutes prior to vaso- occlusion 
until 5 minutes after NTG administration . 
7.5.6 Brachial FMD  
Brachial artery FMD will be performed using the GE Vivid 7 Dimension ultrasound (GE 
Vingmed Ultrasound A/S, Horten, Norway).  Brachial artery diameter will be measured and 
calculated at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 minutes after reactive hyperemia induced by 5- minute 
pneumatic cuff occlusion, and then a t 3, 5 and 10 minutes after NTG administration by [CONTACT_104714] 3 measurements. FMD will be calculated as the percent change (%FMD) in 
brachial diameter from the resting state (100*[hyperemic diameter at selected time−resting diameter]/resting diameter) for reactive hyperemia. Similarly, vasodilator response to NTG will be expressed as percentage change (NTG%) in diameter between baseline and after NTG administration.    
7.5.7 Exploratory Biomarkers 
Samples for exploratory vascular biomarkers will be drawn at the baseline visit and week 16 
(end of study).  Serum biomarkers  will include vascular soluble adhesion molecules (VCAM, 
ICAM, E -selectin and p -selectin), endothelin- 1 (ET -1), vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), angiopoietin - 1 and -2, inflammatory cytokines (C -reactive protein (CRP), serum 
complement levels, interleukin -2, interleukin- 13) and circulating endothelial progenitor cells 
(cEPC).  
We will also assess levels of nitrite and nitrotyrosine at baseline and week 16.   Circulating EPCs will be assess ed at baseline and week 16.  
7.5.8 Raynaud’s attacks assessment  
Raynaud’s attack s will be assessed using the following individual outcome measures:  in 
Raynaud’s condition score and patient assessment of Raynaud’s phenomenon using the 
VAS19 
The Raynaud’s condition score is a daily patient -assessment of Raynaud’s phenomenon 
activity using a [ADDRESS_116116] of Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks, reflecting the overall degree that Raynaud’s has affected use of the patient’s hands 
19. The Raynaud’s condition score, along with details of 
the frequency and duration of Raynaud’s attacks, will be incorporated into the daily diary that subjects will be asked to complete for 1 week (7 days) at the time points shown below.  
The patient and physician assessment assesses the severity of Raynaud’s phenomenon in the past week using a 0 -100 VAS.  
 Investigator Study  Protocol

7.5.9 Digital ulcer  assessment 
Digital ulcers are defined as a full thickness skin lesion with loss of epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. Ulcers should 
be > 3mm in maximal diameter. Healing is defined by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_104692]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_104693]. Also, eschar is not 
considered as DU.  
Digital ulcer will be assessed by [CONTACT_51856]: 
• Visual analog score for patient -reported severity of digital ulcers  
• Ulcer count :  
o Total ulcer counts  
o Distal counts:  distal (fingertip) – any ulcer including skin area distal to proximal 
interphalangeal (PIP) joint 
• Non-ischemic ulcers over the PIP and MCP will also be evaluated for healing as 
secondary outcomes  
7.5.10  Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) / Health-Related Quality of Life 
(HRQoL) questionnaires  
Two patient -reported outcomes  (PROs )—the SHAQand PROMIS -29—will be completed by 
[CONTACT_91566]. In addition, a global for patient and physician should be considered.  
Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ)  
The SHAQ consists of 8 domains from the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ- DI), a HRQoL instrument that  measures self -reported function in [ADDRESS_116117] week. It additionally measures 5 domains specific to scleroderma using a continuous VAS: Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital tip ulcers, lung symptoms, gastrointestinal sympt oms, and a global 
patient assessment
7. The VAS subscales of the SHAQ were shown to be significantly 
correlated with objective parameters,7 and was responsive to change in a cohort and in a 
Raynaud’s phenomenon trial in SSc.7 20 The SHAQ requires  approximately 5 minutes to 
complete.  
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS )-29 
The PROMIS -29 is a validated instrument to measure the health status of SS c patients, 
demonstrating moderate to high correlation with other instruments validated in SSc , including 
the SF -36 physical component score and HAQ -DI.21 It incorporates 7 core domains from the 
PROMIS questionnaire, which specifically relate to physical, mental , and social health 
aspects of chronic illness: pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep, and physical function, as well as one 11 -point rating scale for pain intensity.
21  It contains  8 items with 29 weighted 
responses in total, and requires  approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
Frequency of all PROs: Baseline (Vi sit 1, Day 0) , Visit 5 (week 8), Visit 6 (week 10) and 
Visit 8 (week 16)  
 Investigator Study  Protocol

3 clinical trial of statin therapy in early diffuse SSc , if deemed appropriate .   If not mentioned 
otherwise, all statistical tests will be performed with a type I two -sided error rate of α=5%. . 
8.[ADDRESS_116119] include the following:  
1) Change in RCS  
2) Change in Raynaud VAS  
3) Change in reperfusion peak between the  atorvastatin and placebo  groups.  
4) Change in reperfusion nadir between the atorvastatin and placebo groups.  
5) Change  in brachial FMD between baseline and week [ADDRESS_116120] will be used to compare the mean change in RCS and Raynaud VAS between weeks 
16 and baseline in the placebo and atorvastatin therapy groups.   The means of reperfusion peak and nadir between groups will be calculated and a 95% confidence interval of the difference between means gener ated.  A t -test will be used to compare the mean change in 
brachial FMD between baseline and week 16 between the two treatment groups.   
For all of the above, assumptions of all tests (e.g., normality of residuals) will be evaluated.  If 
violations are identified, transformations will be investigated.   If adequate transformations 
cannot be identified, then nonparametric methods will be used. 
8.2.3 Safety  
Tables of adverse events and serious adverse events will be created.   T hese will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_104715].  The internal Safety Officer will be appointed by [CONTACT_079].  These 
tables will include masked treatment group .  This is detailed in the Safety Monitoring Plan .

8.3 Planned interim analyses 
No formal interim analysis of the main study treatment phase is planned given that it is a 
small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
8.4 Determination of sample size  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  With a total sample of 30 participants (15 per treatment group) , and to 
produce a 95% confidence interval of the difference in means between the two treatment groups, the width of the confidence interval would be +/ - 0.374.    
 
9. Data handing and quality assurance

readily av ailable if required, and in compliance with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_104694].  
According to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348], all study -related documents will be stored for 
7 years.  The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without approval  by [CONTACT_104716].   
9.3 Publication Policy  
Following completion of the TAMER study, the investigators will publish the results of this research in scientific journals.   The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) member journa ls has adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for 
publication.  This policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055].  The TAMER study will be registered prior to commencement.  
 As this is a single -center study, there will be no publications committee.  Authorship 
determination will be made in consultation with the co -investigators of the study (Drs. 
Dezfulian, Reis and Wisniews ki).   
 Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_104717].  Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_104718].   [CONTACT_104726] will maintain contro l of all TAMER -
generated specimens and will decide on the scientific merit of any future sub -studies. They 
will adhere to the letter and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_104695] -funded research.  
 Investigator Study  Protocol   
April 13, 2015  Version  4 Page: [ADDRESS_116122] protected.  All 
linkage materials are stored separately and maintained in a secure area.    
All blood samples will be collected in a de -identified manner using labels generated through 
the Rheumatic Disease Management System (RDMS) system, which is a Division -wide 
system for rheumatologic rese arch. Linkage codes will be maintained by [CONTACT_104719], and these will be kept in a locked filing cabinet located in the Scleroderma Center research office.

implemented deviation or change, the reasons for  it and if appropriate the proposed protocol 
amendment will then be submitted to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348]. Any deviations from 
the protocol  will be explained and documented by [CONTACT_093].  Protocol deviations will 
also be reported biannually to the Safety Monitor.   
10.[ADDRESS_116124] information and consent  
The investigator will discuss that written approval of the IRB has been obtained.  Consent forms, describing in detail the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], procedures, and risks, will be given to the participant, and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting the study agent(s).  Consent forms will be IRB -approved, and the partici pant will be asked to read and review the 
document.  Upon reviewing the document, the study coordinator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  The participants will sign the informed consent document pr ior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  
The participants will have sufficient opportunity to discuss the study and process the information in the consent process prior to agreeing to participate.  Only if the subject voluntarily agree s to sign the informed conse nt form and has done so, may s/he enter  the 
study.  Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_104696].  The subject will receive a 
copy of the signed and dated form.  The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file.   In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline 
study procedures are performed, the study record or subject´s clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to these proc edures.

DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
Ventilatory Support to Improve Exercise Training in High Level Spi[INVESTIGATOR_677956].gov #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Date : 10/17/[ADDRESS_917158] injury (SCI) may be even greater.1 Although regular aerobic 
exercise with sufficient intensity and duration can improve overall health, daily energy expenditure is low 
in those with SCI, due to lack of both motor function and options for accessible physical activity. To 
overcome this, we developed a unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors 
exercise performed by [CONTACT_456940] -bodied. Functional Electrical Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) couples 
volitional arm and electrically c ontrolled leg exercise,[ADDRESS_917159] found improvements in peak aerobic capacity of up to 
50% with FESRT in these patients.2 However , despi[INVESTIGATOR_456930], those 
with high level lesions (C4 to T 4) have the greatest denervation of pulmonary muscle and our preliminary 
work suggests this limits the aerobic capacity that can be achieved with FESRT. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t he ability to 
train the denervated leg skeletal muscle via hybrid FES exercise, the inability to increase ventilation 
beyond limits set by [CONTACT_456941].  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_456931],[ADDRESS_917160] compromise. As a result, the increase in ventilatory 
requirements with FES training results in an imbalance between ventilatory capacity and greater whole 
body skeletal muscle demand after FESRT. Hence, external ventilatory support could improve the ability 
to exercise train and hence enhance the adaptations to chronic exercise in  high level SCI. In obstructive 
and restrictive pulmonary disorders, non -invasive  ventilation (NIV) during exercise training can enhance 
exercise tolerance4, [ADDRESS_917161] access to a large (N>70) and un ique population of individuals with SCI who have been 
enrolled in FESRT for at least [ADDRESS_917162] high level SCI between C4 and T 4.  
 
 
 
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
 Aim 1: To determine the magnitude of improve ment in aerobic capacity after 3 months of 
FESRT+NIV compared to FESRT+shamNIV  in high level spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].  
 Aim 2: To examine the relationship among gains in ventilation and increases in the determinants 
of aerobic capacity - maximal cardiac output and arterio -venous oxygen differe nce after 3 months of 
FESRT+NIV  in high level spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] . 
 Aim 3 : To examin e the acute effect of NIV on  FES-row VO2max in subjects with both high and 
low level SCI.  
  
 
III. SUBJECT SELECTION  
 
FES-Row-Training Group  
Thirty individuals with high level SCI who have FES -row trained for at least 6 months will be randomized 
to (continued) FESRT for 3 months with either NIV or sham NIV. Patients will be medically stable and 
inclusion criteria are SCI at neurological level ≥ T4 with American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_456932] A or B 
or C, aged ≥ [ADDRESS_917163] of FESRT+NIV to improve health and function in those with 
high level SCI.  
 
 
FES-Row-Exercise Testing Only Group  (Cross -Sectional)  
Fifteen  individuals with SC I who have FES -row trained for >6 months will  perform FES -VO2max row tests 
on separate days with and without the use of NIV  to determine maximal aerobic capacity and ventilation . 
Patients will be medically stable and inclusion criteri a are SCI at neurologi cal level C5 -T12 with American 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_456932] A or B or C, aged  ≥ [ADDRESS_917164] 
observed an increase in maximal aerobic capacity at baseline with NIV assisted increases in venti lation . 
This was unexpected; we hypothesized that we would increase ventilation during the test at baseline, but 
that aerob ic capacity would not be higher  because it would be proportional to the voluntary (unassisted) 
maximal ventilation. However, this indicates that maxim al aerobic capacity in these individuals exceeds 
maximal voluntary ventilation. It will be important to determine the consistency of this response and at 
what level of injury it is not observed.  We have a large population of potential subjects who have 
completed six months of FES -row exercise training across a range of SCI level (C5 -T12). Hence, we can 
determine the consistency of the effect and the dependence of the effect on SCI level . (E.g., We could 
obtain data from those with high level SCI who do not  want to enroll in 3 months of training with NIV or 
sham NIV.)  
 
 
Exclusion criteria  for all subjects  are blood pressure>140/[ADDRESS_917165] sites, other neurological disease, peripheral nerve compressions or 
rotator cuff tears that limit the ability to row, and history of bleeding disorder.  
 
Note: Any changes in cardioactive medications d uring the exercise testing or training prot ocols will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_54421] I nvestigator and could lead to removal from the study.  
 
 
IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
 
Research study staff will obtain volunteer consent in accordance with guidelines established by [CONTACT_456942] . Participants will be sent the consent 
form at least [ADDRESS_917166] pressure ventilation applied through a full -face mask (Phillips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Murrysville, [LOCATION_003]). The 
ventilator will be set in a spontaneous mode with a ramp to reach a minimal pressure of 12 cmH2 O during 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_23735] 4 cmH2O during expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. A minimal duration for inspi[INVESTIGATOR_456933]. Parameters will then be adapted according to 
participant’s comfort and ventilatory requir ement during exercise.  
 
Sham -NIV. In the sham group, similar conditions will be used but the ventilator will be applied with 
maximal pressure support of [ADDRESS_917167] will be performed at baseline for inten sity to be 
determined. The goal is for each volunteer to achieve an exercise intensity of 75 -85% maintained for at 
least [ADDRESS_917168] been participating in FES -row training they will also be given t he 
opportunity to continue or start the FES -leg strength training at home concurrently on non FES -rowing 
days (~3 days/week, 30 -60 minutes/session). This will be possible after the subjects have 
demonstrated the knowledge and ability of proper use of the s timulation unit for home use . This will be 
closely monitored, as they will also be FES -rowing three times per week at Spaulding Cambridge.  
 
 
Study Assessments  
 
FES-Row Training Group  
All Assessments will be perf ormed at baseline and after three  months of FES -row training. There will be 
[ADDRESS_917169]  
done at each time point (done at least 48 -hours apart). Both NIV Support and Sham -NIV groups will 
perform tests wi th and without use of the NIV -machine .  
 
FES-Row Exercise Testi ng Only Group  
Subjects will perform FES -VO2max row tests on separate days with and without the use of NIV to 
determine maximal aerobic capacity and ventilation. Both FES -VO2max Row tests will be performed at 
least 48 -hours apart  
 
 
 
Measurements and Testing Protocols:  
 
FES-Row-VO2maxTest ing 
Individuals will refrain from eating for [ADDRESS_917170] with the Innocor rebreathing system (Innovision, Odense, Denmark, see details 
below). A heart rate monitor (Suunto, Valimotie 7 FI -[ZIP_CODE], Vantaa, Finland) will be used throughout the 
tests. The baseline graded FES row test protocol will be based on each individual’s initial FES row 
response, and [ADDRESS_917171] be met: 85% of age predicted maximal heart rate (220 - age), respi[INVESTIGATOR_206326] >1.1 at end exercise, plateau in oxygen consumption despi[INVESTIGATOR_132228], blood lactate 
level (Lactate Plus, Nova Biomedical, Waltham MA) of [ADDRESS_917172] 17 on the Borg scale of 6 to 20, and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_456934] >20W during maximal leg 
stimulation. Peak oxygen consumption will be defined as the highest value achieved over [ADDRESS_917173] and during 
a three to six minute FES -row steady  state exercise bout at an intensity of 80% of peak heart rate.  
Cardiac Output is measured  using the inert gas re -breathing method (Innocor, Innovision, Odense, 
Denmark), a previously validated non -invasive method for rest and exercise measures. Notably, inert gas 
re-breathing measurements of cardiac output do not require steady state conditions and hence can be 
obtained during graded tests. An oxygen -enriched mixture of an inert soluble gas (0.5% nitrous oxide) 
and an inert insoluble gas (0.1% sulphur -hexafluoride) are used to indirectly assess pulmonary blood 
flow and lung volume, respectively. In the absence of pulmonary shunt, cardiac output = pulmonary blood 
flow. Arteriovenous oxygen difference will be derived by [CONTACT_456943]: arteriove nous oxygen 
difference = oxygen consumption / cardiac output.  Subjects will do [ADDRESS_917174] achieved target heart rate.  
 
 
Pulmonary Function Tests   
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_456935], specifically the measurement of the amount (volume) 
and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Specifically, Forced Volume Vital Capacity 
(FVC) and Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV)  tests will be administered.  
 
Regional Cerebral Bl ood F low 
A Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS; PortaLite, Artinis Medical Systems)  probe placed on the forehead 
contralateral to the dominant hand  will be used to measure blood oxygenation during maximal exercise 
testing . NIRS -derived blood oxygenation levels will be used as a measure  of cerebral blood flow at the 
prefrontal cortex.  
 
VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_456936] a simple and straightforward statistical approach to compare changes within 
and between groups. Statistical signi ficance will be set at 0.05, and power at 80%.  Normality and equality 
of variance will be assessed using tests of skewness and kurtosis. Within and between group 
(FESRT+NIV vs. FESRT+shamNIV) comparison of changes will be made using a general linear model  
accounting for potential baseline differences and the intervention effect. Correlations between ventilation, 
aerobic capacity, and hemodynamics variables (cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference) will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_141612]’s or Spearman’s coef ficient depending on the normality of the variables. If 
significant relations are found, appropriate regression analyses will be employed.  
 
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Moderate risks are associated with exercise testing and exercise training. Some discomfort and feeling 
of fatigue will be experienced during these tests. There are other risks associated with these tests 
including abnormal blood pressure responses, faintin g, irregular, fast or slow heart rhythm, and in rare 
instances, heart attack, stroke, or death. Wearing the face -mask during the VO2max testing and FES -
row training may cause feelings of claustrophobia. Exercise training may induce some muscle or joint 
discomfort when beginning an exercise program and could result in tendonitis and/or musculoskeletal 
overuse injuries over time. Subjects may feel lightheaded or short of breath during use of the NIV machine 
and during the cardiac output measurement. The elect rical stimulation unit can cause tingling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_132234], skin irritation, increased muscle spasticity and autonomic dysreflexia 
(signs include: headache, nausea, rise in blood pressure, sweating, and goosebumps). There is some 
discomfort with the lancet used on the finger for lactate measurement and there is a small possibility of 
swelling and bruising at the site(s), there is also a slight chance that individuals become dizzy and even 
faint. Subjects may feel lightheaded or short  of breath during the pulmonary function tests, there is also 
a slight chance that individuals become dizzy and even faint.  
 
 
 
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Volunteers will have the opportunity to participate in a supervised exercise program, which may 
improve  their overall cardiovascular fitness and endurance during activities of daily living as well as 
decrease risk of chronic disease.  
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
The research coordinator will be respons ible for monitoring the completeness of all data and source 
documents. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_456937]. The subject’s 
data/protocol adherence will be monitored by [CONTACT_456944]. Checklists and note pages are used to note any deviations or omissions from the protocols. 
The Cardiovascular Research Laboratory Medical Emergency S afety Plan will be followed in the case 
of an adverse medical event. Any clinical/health related issues would be immediately presented to the 
subject (i.e.  abnormal EKG , etc) to determine appropriate notification (ie . current physician or 
appropriate specialist)  
 
At each visit, study staff will prompt the participant to report any occurrences of health changes or 
problems. Any serious or non -serious adverse event will be recorded in the participant’s study folder 
and adverse event log and reviewed by [CONTACT_978]. Serious and non -serious adverse events will also be 
reported to the Human Research Committee in accordance with Human Research Committee reporting 
guidelines, following the timeframes specified by [CONTACT_456945]’s Guidelines. In case of a 
serious adverse event appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures will be taken, as determined by 
[CONTACT_093].

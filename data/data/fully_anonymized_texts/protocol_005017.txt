CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023 -CL304 Amendment 1  
29 March 2016  
Original Protocol UX023-CL304 (dated 19 June 2015) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_633230] ar e summarized below:  
1. Sample Size: The sample size has been increased from approximately [ADDRESS_633231] 3 subjects from each sex will be enrolled.  
Rationale : The increased sample size and provision for a level of gender balance will 
help to promote a fairly diverse patient population within this small study.   
2. Study Population:  Several changes have been made to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (Section 7.3.1) as indicated below.  
a. Inclusion criterion #1 has been modified to change the age of eligibility to 18 to 65, inclusive.  Previously the age was 25 to 65.  
b. Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_633232] a duplicative value of 60 mL/min. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be ≥ 60 mL/min (using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] [CKD-EPI] equation); OR eGFR of 45 to < 60 m L/min at Screening with 
confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due to nephrocalcinosis.  
c. Inclusion criterion #6 has been updated to add informed consent language for minors enrolled in the study. 
d. In
clusion criterion #9 has been updated with bolded text as follows 
“Participants of child ‐bearing potential or with partners of child- bearing 
potential who have not undergone a total hysterectomy  or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] ‐oophorec
tomy and are sexually active must consent to use of two  
effective methods of contraception as determined by [CONTACT_6962] (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives, vaginal 
ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier methods, surgical hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation, or true abstinence) from the period following the signing of the informed consent through [ADDRESS_633233] dose of study drug. 
e. Exc
lusion criterion #4 has been modified to remove “oral” and restrict use of 
any bisphosphonates in the 2 years prior to Screening.  
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL304  
Amendment 1:  [ADDRESS_633234] of 
prohibited medications for consistency (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1).  
g. Exclusion criterion #9 (previously #7) has been modified to state that patients 
with serum iPTH ≥ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) will be 
excluded. Previously this value was serum iPTH ≥1.[ADDRESS_633235]. 
h. An addition was made to exclusion criterion #19 to state that patients with a history or allergic reaction or adverse reaction tetracycline or demeclocycline 
will be excluded.  
i. A provision has been added to Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_633236] a history of recurrent
 dental abscesses, which are 
known to be associated with XLH.  
Rationale: The modifications to inclusion/exclusion criteria provide clarification and additional guidance for site personnel. The age of eligibility was reduced to allow a more broad patient population and consent language for minors was added because 18-year-olds are considered minors in s ome countries. The requirement for two forms 
of contraception aligns with the ICFs and other studies in the KRN23 program. The additional exclusion criteria prohibit the use of bone- modifying agents with the 
potential to confound study results. The provision to allow individuals with recurrent dental abscesses provides a study population representative of the XLH disease state.  
3. Schedule of Events : The schedule of events has been updated to add that s erum 
1,25(OH)
2D will be assayed at Week 24.  In addition, post-baseline serum FGF23 
assessments will now be at Weeks [ADDRESS_633237]-baseline serum FGF23 
assessments were scheduled for Weeks 4, 22, 24, 36, and 48.  
Rationale:   The additional serum 1,25(OH) 2D measurement at Week 24 will provide 
additional data and aligns with other pharmacodynamic indicators at the time of 
primary analysis; no additional blood draws or blood volume are required for this assessment.  Serum FGF23  levels have been measured extensively following KRN23 
administration in a subset of studies across the adult and pediatric development program. In this study, because KRN23 will be administered at a stable level from the 
beginning of the trial, it is anticipated that post- treatment FGF23 levels will remain 
fairly stable, therefore only two post- treatment assessments samples will be collected.  
4. Investigational Product :  Section 7.4.1
 had been modified to provide additional 
flexibility in SC dosing sites; subjects may receive study drug via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms or  thighs.  
Rationale : This modification in dosing will allow some flexibility in SC drug 
administration for subjec ts. 
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL304  
Amendment 1:  29 MAR 2016 
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 4  
5. Study Procedures and Assessments: Section 7.5 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] have been 
clarified to indicate that tetracycline or demeclocycline may be used for labeling for 
bone biopsy. In addition, the timing of the tetracycline labeling has been clarified: 
The bone biopsy should be performed [ADDRESS_633238] dose should be given on days -20, -19, and -18, and the second dose given on days -8, -7, and -6.  
Rationale : Demeclocycline is a standard label for use in evaluation of iliac crest  bone 
biopsies and i t is more readily available than tetracycline in certain countries of the 
world . The clarification of timing is to be consistent with the procedures of the central 
laboratory being used for biopsy assessments. 
6. General Assessments:   Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_633239]. This testing will include, but not necessarily be limited to, genes for Autosomal Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets (FGF23), Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets (DMP1, ENPP1), X- Linked Recessive 
Hypophosphatemic Rickets (CLCN5), and Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets with Hypercalciuria (SLC34A3). 
Rationale : In subjects with a diagnosis of XLH based on clinical and biochemical 
phenotypic presentation, PHEX mutation analysis results may be inconclusive. For 
any subject with a PHEX  mutation analysis result of No Mutation, Likely Benign, 
Variant of Uncertain Significance, or Possibly Pathogenic, and who provides informed consent, reflexive genetic testing will be performed to assess additional genes associated with phenotypes overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459986]. In addition, Sanger sequencing for the functional 3’UTR variant in PHEX  described in the literature 
(Mumm et al. 2015) will be performed. The additional testing may help characterize 
the genetic disorder associated with the clinical syndrome.  
7. Safety Assessments:   Several  changes have been made to the safety assessments.  
a. Blood pressure (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be obtained twice (2  measurements 
separated by 15 minutes) at indicted clinic visits.  
b. Section  [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to indicate echocardiograms (ECHO) will no 
longer be read locally at the study site. All ECH O assessments will be 
centrally read.  
c. Section [IP_ADDRESS] ( Table [IP_ADDRESS].1) has been updated to add assessment of lipase 
in all subjects.  
Rationale:  The second blood pressure measurement improves accuracy and an 
additional measure of safety.  
 
Protocol Number:  UX023-CL304  
Amendment 1:  [ADDRESS_633240] been observed  in some subjects 
at baseline and during the study. Amylase is produced by [CONTACT_492350]. In ongoing and completed KRN23 studie s at baseline 
mild elevations of amylase (<2x ULRR) have been noted. Post treatment mild shifts in amylase elevation (< 2xULRR) has been noted without association with GI symptoms. No adverse events of pancreatitis have been observed. The testing for serum  lipase when serum amylase levels are elevated will allow a determination of 
whether the amylase elevations are from pancreatic or salivary gland sources.  
 
8. Ethics:   Section 8.1.2 has been updated to state that both the sponsor and  
investigator will make ev ery effort to assure the study described in this protocol is 
conducted in full conformance with those principles, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, and local ethical and regulatory requirements.  
Rationale:  The modificat ion follows guidance received from the Ethics Committee in 
Denmark.  
9. Record Retention : Section  8.4.[ADDRESS_633241] 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with national law.  
Rationale: This administrative change has been made to reflect upcoming changes to EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by [CONTACT_492351].  
10. Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]:  The medical monitor information for this study has 
been updated in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Rationale : Administrative change.

 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023 -CL304 Amendment 2 
07 October 2016  
Protocol UX023- CL304 Amendment 1 (dated 30 March 2016 ) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827]  [ADDRESS_633243] are summarized below:  
1. Overall Study Design: A 48 -week  Treatment  Extension Period was added to the 
study design.  The corresponding Schedule of Events for this period is provided in Table 2.3. 
Rationale: Extending the study by [ADDRESS_633244] been reduced to minimize burden on participants; most variables specifi ed as exploratory will not be followed during thi s additional 
treatment period. Targ eted radiographs will only  be performed at clinic visit(s) 
following newly diagnosed fractures during the Extension Period to minimize radiation exposure. 
2. Primary Analysis : Section [IP_ADDRESS] was narrowed  to focus on osteoid volume 
(osteoid  volume/bone volume, OV/BV) as the primary efficacy endpoint. The other 
histomorphometric parameters were specified as secondary endpoints under Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Rationale : To specify a principal comparison, the primary efficacy endpoint was 
defined to focus on osteoid volume (measured as a percentage of total bone volume) 
as it is the most consistent histomorphometric parameter to quantify the amount of 
osteoid tissue accumulation, which is the hallmark of osteomalacia. Osteoid volume combines both direct measurements of osteoid surface/total s urface plus osteoid 
thickness. The remaining histomorphometric indices – including osteoid thickness, 
osteoid surface, and mineralization lag time – were assigned as secondary efficacy 
endpoints to further assess osteomalacia burden.      
 
3. Contraception Methods: The list of e xamples of highly effective contraception 
methods was updated in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Rationale:  This change was made to better clarify the acceptable methods of 
contraception in compliance wit h the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) 
advice.  
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment 2:  [ADDRESS_633245]  2016  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 3  
 
4. Schedule of Events : The frequency of pregnancy testing in females with child-
bearing potential was increased to every 4 weeks.  
 
Rationale: Pregnancy testing in appropriate subjects will be performed e very 4 weeks 
in compliance with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) advice.  
5. End of Study: Section [IP_ADDRESS] was  updated to clarify that the End of Study is  the last 
subject’s Safety Follow -up Phone Call (12 weeks (± 5 days) after the Final Dose).  
Rationale:  This change was made to define the End of Study. 
 
6. Exploratory Endpoints:  In Section [IP_ADDRESS], language describing the exploratory 
endpoint of pseudofracture  healing has been modified to read: Healing of pre- existing 
pseudofractures and/or Looser zones, as defined by [CONTACT_492352]. Previously this endpoint had indicated “time to healing” of pre- existing pseudof ractures and/or Looser zones.   
 An additional change was made in Section [IP_ADDRESS] to clarify that the endpoints for Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI ) will be based on BFI question 3-Worst Fatigue, and a 
BFI Global Fatigue score calculated by [CONTACT_492353] 9  items on the BFI, rather than 
separate BFI Severity and BFI Interference scores.   
 Rationale : Language has been updated to more accurately reflect the planned 
analy sis.  
 
7. Study Objectives: In Section  6, the Pharmacokinetics Objective has been clarified 
as: Assess the PK of KRN23 throughout the dosing cycle following the first  doses and 
at steady state. It had previously stated, “…following single and multiple doses.” 
 
Rationale : Wording was clarified to avoid misinterpretation as there is no single dose 
treatment in this study.  
 
8. Genetic Testing:  In Section 7.5.3, one gene, for Raine Syndrome ( FAM20C ), has 
been added to the list of genes that may be assessed for mutation in subjects whose 
initial PHEX  mutation analysis is negative or inconclusive and who provide informed 
consent. The wording “not necessarily limited to” regarding the list of genes has been removed. 
Rationale:  This change was made to more precisely identify the genes that may be 
assessed for mutations i f a subject has a negative or inconclusive PHEX mutation 
result.  
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_633246]  2017  
Protocol UX023-CL304 Amendment 2 (dated 07 October 2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827]  3 to extend treatment duration for study subjects in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and 
to describe the data monitoring through the Treatment Extension Periods . Minor edits , 
clarifications,  and typographical corrections have also been made. The major protocol 
changes that impact study design and conduct are summarized below:  
1. Study Design and Duration:   In S ections  7.1 and  [IP_ADDRESS] and other relevant sections, 
a second Treatment Extension Period II that includes an additional up to 
approximately 45 weeks of KRN23 treatment, until end of September 2018, has been 
added for subjects enrolled at sites in the US only.  (The duration of this period will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_492354] 97 through final visit schedule 30 September 2018.)  In addition, in these sections and Section [IP_ADDRESS] and other relevant sections, Safety Follow- up telephone calls (TCs) 
over an interval of up to [ADDRESS_633247] day that protocol- specified assessments 
(including telephone contact) are conducted for the last subjects in the study. 
Rationale: Treatment Extension Period II has been added for subjects at US sites to 
provide KRN23 treatment to these subjects until a time when KRN23 is e xpected to 
be commercially available in the US.  Safety and Efficacy parameters will continue to be assessed while the subjects remain on study drug.  Subjects enrolled outside the US may have access to continued KRN23 treatment after completion of Extensi on 
Period I through various regional mechanisms, in accordance with local laws and 
regulations.  Safety Follow-up TCs have been added after the extension periods to 
collect information as appropriate on ongoing or new adverse events, serious adverse events, and concomitant medications after subjects discontinue study drug but before KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism begins. 
   
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 3  
  
2. Anti -KRN23 Antibodies: In Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 and the Schedule of Events, the t erm 
HAHA (human anti-human antibody) in reference to anti-KRN23 antibody testing, 
has been replaced with the term ADA (anti -drug antibody).  
Rationale : This change is a clarification. The immunogenicity of KRN23 is evaluated 
by [CONTACT_460020]-drug antibodies (ADA), independent of isotype, in human serum. While the study protocol previously used the term “HAHA” for this assessment, it has been replaced with the more correct and specific term, ADA.  
3. Safety Monitoring: Section 7.6.7 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] have been updated to describe 
safety monitoring during the Treatment Extension Periods I and II of the study. 
Rationale :  In this open-label study, the DMC will continue to monitor safety through 
Week 48 as planned.  During the Treatment Extension Periods I and II, safety will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_492355] (SSRT), an internal 
safety review team defined and in place since the original protocol.  
4. Exploratory Efficacy En dpoints: In Section [IP_ADDRESS], the exploratory endpoint of 
healing of pre-existing pseudofractures and/or Looser zones, as defined by [CONTACT_460021]: the number of active pseudofractures and/or fractures as defined by [CONTACT_460022]/fractu res that were healed, partially 
healed, unchanged, and worsened at post-baseline visits, and the number of subjects with baseline active pseudofractures and/or fractures at baseline and the numbers of those subjects who had changes from baseline to healed, partially healed, unchanged, and worsened at post-baseline visits. Also, the descriptions of other exploratory endpoints were updated for clarity.  
Rationale : The section was updated to reflect the exploratory efficacy endpoints 
planned for analysis in this study.  
5. Physical Examination : Section  [IP_ADDRESS] was modified to specify that the 
genitourinary component of the physical exam will be performed as age-appropriate at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Rationale : this modification was added to clarify that the genitourinary scope should 
be non-invasive and as per age-appropriate standard of care, at the Investigator's discretion based on the clinical judgement and/or safety need.

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open -Label , Single -Arm , Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Effects of KRN23  on Osteomalacia in 
Adult s with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH)  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
UX023 -CL30 4 
STUDY SITES:  
Approximately  14 sites globally  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase  3 
RATIONALE:  
XLH is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wasting, and defective bone 
mineralization caused by [CONTACT_492356] (phosphate -regulating gene 
with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome). In the absence of functional PHEX, 
release of fibr oblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by [CONTACT_492357]. Excess 
circulating FGF23 signals the kidney tubules to decrease phosphate reabsorption by 
[CONTACT_100276]-regulating NaPi -IIa and NaPi -IIc in the tubular cells and suppressing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D (1,25(OH) 2D) production, resulting in decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate  
producing hypophosphatemia . In adult s with XLH, a hallmark of the disease is osteomalacia, a 
defect in bone mineralization due to chronically low serum phosphor us. Osteomalacia is 
characterized by a lack o f proper mineralization, a prolonged  mineralization process, and an 
accumulation of osteoid tissue. It is also associated with a reduction in bone remodeling and 
reduced bone quality and is a key contributor to the symptoms of bone and joint pain and the 
non-traumatic pseudofractures and reduced quality of life experienced by [CONTACT_492358].   
KRN23 is a recombinant fully human IgG [ADDRESS_633250] shown incomplete healing of osteomalacia. In addition, there are no systematic studies in adults to show this regimen improves symptoms or outcomes, and there are concerns about the risk of long-term complications, particularly nephrocalcinosis, which increases with dose and duration of therapy. More efficacious, safer, and convenient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492329] -related symptoms and complications.  
A Phase 1 study established the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of KRN23. A Phase 1/2 study and 
associated extension study evaluated the pharmacody namics (PD) of KRN23 on phosphate 
metabolism and related measures of the phosphate -calcium mineral control system. The safety data 
from these studies have shown that KRN23 in single and repeated monthly doses up to 1.0  mg/kg 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_633251] on patient -reported 
and functional outcomes in adults with XLH . The current open-label study will examine the 
efficacy of KRN23 on bone quality, including the effects on osteomalacia at the tissue level , and 
provide an additional assessment of safety .  Long term safety and efficacy data will be collected 
during the Treatment Extension Periods I and II.  
PRIMARY EFFICACY HYPOTHESIS:  
Treatment with 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 monthly  will improve XLH -associated osteomalacia as 
determined by [CONTACT_492359]  (osteoid volume/bone volume, OV/BV).  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Efficacy Objective:   
Establish the effect of KRN23 treatment on improvement in XLH -associated osteomalacia as 
determined by [CONTACT_492359]  (osteoi d volume/bone volume , OV/BV).  
Secondary Efficacy Objectiv es: 
The key secondary efficacy objective is to establish the effect of KRN23 treatment on increasing 
serum phosphorus levels  in adults with XLH    
Other  secondary efficacy objectives are to establish  the effect of KRN23 treatment in adults with 
XLH on : 
• Changes from baseline in additional histomorphometric parameters – including osteoid 
thickness (O.Th), osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS), and mineralization lag time (MLt)  
• Changes from baseline in parameters of bone mineralization including mineral apposition 
rate (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS), bone format ion rate  (BFR), and others  
• Additional  PD markers reflecting the status of phosphorus homeostasis and renal function  
• Bone remodeling as assess ed by [CONTACT_492360]:  
• Examine  the effect of KRN23 treatment in adults with XLH on pseudofracture /fracture 
healing  
• Patient reported outcomes (PROs) assessing skeletal pain and fatigue 
Pharmacokinetic Objective: 
Assess the PK of KRN23 throughout the dosing cycle following the first doses and steady state  
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment 3:  [ADDRESS_633252] 2017  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 6  
Safety Objective:   
Establish the safety and tolerability profile of KRN23 in the treatment of adults with XLH 
including adverse events (AEs) , ectopic mineralization risk, cardiovascular effects, and 
immunogenicity profile  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
UX023 -CL304 is a Phase [ADDRESS_633253] will continue on study but will not undergo the second bone biopsy procedure at Week 48. All  other assessments will be completed as scheduled. The goal of 
the study is to assess changes in  bone quality; histo logic  and histomorphometric evaluation of iliac 
crest bone biopsies will be supported by [CONTACT_492361]23 -mediated processes. 
Pseudofractures and PROs will provide additional information on KRN23 efficacy. Safety, 
immunogenicity, and PK of KRN23 will also be evaluated.  
KRN23 will be administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections mont hly (Q4W, 28 days)  for 
48 weeks.  Subjects who complete the 48 weeks of the Open -Label Treatment Period will then 
continue into an additional 48-week Treatment Extension Period I (until Week 96).  For subjects at 
study sites outside of the [LOCATION_002] (US), the Week 96 Visit will be their End of Stud y (EOS) 
efficacy visit (referred to as EOS I).  For subjects at sites in the US, treatment will con tinue for up 
to an additional [ADDRESS_633254] their EOS efficacy visit (referred to as EOS II).  
(The duration of this period will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_492362] 97 through their EOS II Visit).  For subjects not immediately continuing 
KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism upon completion of study drug 
treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Follow-up telephone call (TC) will occur 
4 weeks (+5 days) after the subject’s final study site visit (ie EOS I [non -US subjects], EOS II [US 
subjects], or Early Termination [ET] visit) to collect information on any ongoing or new AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications.  If the subject is not continuing KRN23 the rapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, an additional Safety 
Follow -up TC will occur at 8 weeks (+  5 days) after the subject’s final study site visit. The end of 
this study is defined as the last day that the protocol specified assessm ents (including telephone 
contact) are conducted for the last subject.  
 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED : 
Approximately [ADDRESS_633255]  
8  subjects with a confirmed  diagnosis  of osteomalacia

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSE , AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION  
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative-free solution supplied in single -use 5 -mL 
vials containing 1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. KRN23 will be administered without dilution. All s ubjects will receive 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 monthly (Q4W, 28 days)  rounded to 
the nearest 10 mg . The amount of drug administered will be calculated based on baseline weight 
and a 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 dose level  (rounded to the nearest 10 mg) up to a maximum dose of 
90 mg. The dose will r emain fixed for the duration of the study, provided serum phosphorous 
levels do not exceed 5.0 mg/dL (1.61 mmol/L) at any time or 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L) on two 
occasions. The dose will be recalculated if body weight changes by [CONTACT_726] 20%  from the 
basel ine measurement. 
Subjects will receive study drug via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms , or thighs; the 
injection site will be rotated with each injection. No more than 1.[ADDRESS_633260] be 
administered, each at a different injection site.    
If serum phosphorus increases above 5.0 mg/dL (1.61 mmol/L) at any time the actual dose will be 
decreased by [CONTACT_2016] . If serum phosphorous increases above the ULN (4.5 mg/dL ; 1.45 mmol/L) but 
does not exceed 5.0 mg/dL  (1.61 mmol/L), the dose will be adjusted only  if a second serum 
phosphorus result exceeds the ULN. Following a downward dose adjustment, t he investigator 
together with the medical monitor should determine how and when to dose titrate up. Unscheduled 
serum phosphorus assessments may be necessary . Based on the totality of the data from studies 
INT-[ADDRESS_633261] subjects were treated with 
1.0 mg/kg KRN23 and no subject experienced an elevation of serum phosphorus that approached 
the 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L) threshold, it is considered unlikely that dose adjustment will be 
necessary . 
 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE , AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
The study is a single -arm, open -label study . All subjects will be on active treatment; no reference 
therapy or placebo will be administered .

DURATION OF TREATMENT:  
The planned duration of treatm ent in this study is up to 96 weeks  for subjects at sites outside of the 
US. For subjects at  sites in the US, the planned duration of treatment is up to approximately 
141 weeks, until end of September 2018.  All Subjects will receive treatment with KRN23 for 
48 weeks as part of the Open -Label Treatment Period. Subjects will then continue  into an 
additional 48- week Treatment Extension Period  I and, if at a US site, up to approximately 
45 weeks, until end of September 2018, in Treatment Extension Period II . The duration of 
Treatment Extension Period II will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_492362] 97 through their end of study visit.

5 INTRODUCTION  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate 
wasting, and defective bone mineralization caused by [CONTACT_492369] P HEX  
gene (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome). In the absence of functional PHEX, release of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by [CONTACT_492357]. Excess circulating FGF23 leads to  decreased reabsorption of 
phosphate and reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)
2D) production, resulting in 
decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Chronic hypophosphatemia leads to defective bone mineralization and consequently to rickets in child ren and osteomalacia in 
adults, the two major pathologic features of XLH. 
Adult patients with XLH have significant morbidity that increases with age. In adulthood, 
XLH progresses into a disease of persistent and often clinically significant osteomalacia as a result of chronic low phosphorus, causing bone and joint pain and pseudofractures in a large proportion of patients (Reid et al. 1989) . With age, osteoarthritis  often develops, in part due 
to degenerative changes resulting from joint misalignment that occurred with childhood rickets. Mineralization of tendons/ligaments (enthesopathy) and recurrent dental abscesses may also occur. Adults with XLH also have muscle dysfunction, likely due to the importance of phosphate in energy metabolism, which may contribute significantly to the fatigue and weakness expressed by [CONTACT_156999] (Reid et al. 1989) , (Veilleux et al. 2012) , (Sabbagh et 
al. 2008) . 
The current standard of care for XLH in children consists of oral phosphate and v itamin D 
(calcitriol) replacement , which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_492337] . Treatment can improve rickets but provides limited benefit and 
does not treat the underlying cause (Carpenter et al. 2011) . No consensus exists regarding 
treatment of  XLH in adults, despi[INVESTIGATOR_492338]. By [CONTACT_492370]23, phosphorus homeostasis could potentially be normalized, offering an effective and safe treatment option for patients with XLH. 
Proof-of-concept studies in a relevant murine model support the use of an anti- FGF23 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a treatment for XLH . Experiments in both juvenile and adult 
hypophosphatemic ( Hyp) mice provided evidence that treatment with an anti-FGF23 mAb 
normalized or ameliorated many of the characteristic abnormalities associated with XLH  
(Aono et al. 2009) , (Aono et al. 2011 ). KRN23 is a fully  human IgG
1 mAb that binds to and 
inhibits FGF23 . The Sponsor and development partner, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (KHK) 
are investigating KRN23 as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of  XLH, a 
disease distinguished by [CONTACT_492371]23. 
KHK has conducted a series of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK) , and 
toxicology studies suppor ting the investigation of KRN23 in adults and children. 
Three  clinical studies have been complet ed in adult patients with XLH : a single dose Phase 1 
safety and tolerability study of KRN23, a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, and an 
associated treatment  extension study. An additional open- label long-term extension study is 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633308] of KRN23 treatment on 
functional and patient -reported outcomes (PROs) including pain, stiffness, fatigue, and 
health -related quality of life. The current open- label study will examine the efficacy of 
KRN23 on bone quality and skeletal health, including the effects on osteomalacia at the tissue level, and provide an additional assessment of safety. 
5.1 Overview of  XLH  
XLH is a rare genetic disorder that is serious, chronically debilitating and represents an 
unmet medical need. This genetic deficiency is estimated to occur in about 1:20,000 live 
births (Burnett et al. 1964 ), (Imel et al. 2005) . XLH is the most common inherited form of 
rickets and the most common inherited defect in renal tubular phosphate transport. XLH is transmitted as an X -linked dominant disorder ( Dixon et al. 1998) . Mutations resulting in the 
loss of function of PHEX form the genetic basis for XLH ( Carpenter et al. 2011) . More than 
[ADDRESS_633309] been identified in patients with XLH ( PHEXdb ); 
however, few definitive correlations have been observed between specific mutations and phenotypic severity.  
Patients with XLH have hypophosphatemia due to excessive FGF23 levels ( Jonsson et al. 
2003) , (Yamazaki et al. 2002 ); however, the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_492372]23 is complex and not fully understood ( Rowe 2012) , (Carpenter et al. 
2011) . FGF23 plays an im portant role as a specific regulator of serum phosphorus; its major 
function is to reduce serum phosphorus levels by [CONTACT_492373]  (Fukumoto 2008) , (Razzaque et al. 2007) . FGF23 also  decreases serum 
1,25(OH)
2D levels by [CONTACT_61670] 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity in the kidney, thereby 
[CONTACT_492374]. The actions of FGF23 on the 
tubular reabsorption and intestinal absorption via vitamin D metabol ism lead to a decrease in 
serum phosphorus levels. 
Patients with XLH often present during childhood with rickets due to hypophosphatemia and 
frequently develop skeletal abnormalities (e.g. bowed legs), impaired growth, and short adult stature  (Tenenhouse et al. 2001) . As young patients age and progress into adulthood, the 
symptom pattern evolves due to decreas ed phosphate requirements for bone growth. 
Adult XLH patients suffer from bone pain and osteomalacia, increased risk of bone fractures, joint abnormalities and joint pain, enthesopathy, and osteoarthrit is (Carpenter et al. 2011) .
 
No consensus exists regarding treatment of adult patients with XLH (Linglart et al. 2014) . 
The use of oral phosphate and vitamin D may be initiated for the treatment of osteomalacia, bone/joint pain and pseudofractures in symptomatic patients, although evidence of efficacy is limited (Sullivan et al. 1992) . This treatment protocol requires frequent and continued 
monitoring of patients . Serum and urine mineral metabolite  levels and imaging studies  are 
required to assess toxicity and secondary complicat ions, including nephrocalcinosis, 
hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism ( Carpenter et al. 2011) .

5.2 Brief Overview of KRN23  Development  
A brief overview of existing information on KRN23  is provided below; a comprehensive 
review of the data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) provided by [CONTACT_492375]. (Ultragenyx) , which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study .  
5.2.1 Brief Descrip tion of KRN23  
KRN23 is a recombinant human IgG 1 mAb that binds to and inhibits the activity of FGF23 . 
KRN23 is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary dihydrofolate reductase- deficient cells. 
The secreted KRN23 antibody is recovered from the culture medium and purified using a 
series of chromatographic and filtration steps. Based on the amino acid sequence, the 
predicted molecular mass of KRN23 is approximately 140 kilodaltons (kDa).  Nonclinical 
studies demonstrated KRN23 possesses high binding affinity to the N- terminal domain of 
FGF23 . KRN23 binds to FGF23 from humans, cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits, but not to 
other species tested.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action  in XLH  
Patients with XLH have hypophosphatemia due to excessive serum FGF23 levels. FGF23 reduces serum phosphorus levels by [CONTACT_492376]  (Fukumoto 2008) , 
(Razzaque et al. 2007 ), (Yamazaki et al. 2008) . The primary me chanism is to inhibit 
phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. The secondary mechanism is to decrease phosphate absorption by [CONTACT_35687] 1,25(OH)
2D 
production in the kidney. 
KRN23 has the  potential to block or reduce FGF23 action and improve phosphate 
homeostasis in XLH patients. KRN23 binds the amino- terminal domain of FGF23 that 
interacts with  the FGF -binding portion of the combination FGFR1/Klotho receptor, 
preventing FGF23 from binding to and signaling from  its receptor. Both intact and 
fragmented FGF23 polypeptides are immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_460001]23 ( Yamazaki et al. 
2008) . By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR) 
from the kidney and increases the production of 1,25(OH) 2D that also enhances intestinal 
absorption of phosphate. Both  actions increase serum phosphorus levels, which is expected to 
improve bone mineralizatio n and reduce the diverse bone and non-bone manifestations 
associated with hypophosphatemia in XLH patients. Bone histomorphometry is the gold 
standard to evaluate changes in osteomalacia as it allow s an assessment of bone quality at the 
tissue level.  
5.2.2 Noncl inical Studies  
The Hyp mouse is a murine homologue of XLH with a deletion in the 3ꞌ region of the PHEX 
gene ( Liu et al. 2007) , (Perwad et al. 2005) . In addition to hypophosphatemia, rickets, and 
associated developmental abnormalities, these animals display elevated serum FGF23 levels and increased expression of FGF23 in the bone. Since KRN23 does not bind murine FGF23, the pharmacological effects of murine anti- FGF23 mAbs  were examined in juvenile and

adult Hyp mice ( Aono et al. 2009) , (Aono et al. 2011) . In juvenile Hyp mice, anti-FGF23 
treatment corrected hypophosphatemia and ameliorated the rachitic bone phenotypes ( Aono 
et al. 2009 ). Histomorphometry of secondary cancellous bones showed improvement in both 
static and dynamic parameters of osteoid accumulation. In adult Hyp mice, anti- FGF23 
treatment increased serum phosphate an d 1,25(OH) 2D levels, and increased grip strength and 
spontaneous movement ( Aono et al. 2011) . These studies provide proof- of-concept that 
treatment with antibodies targeting FGF23 may reverse or ameliorate characteristic 
abnormalities associated with XLH.  
KRN23 binds to human, rabbit, and monkey FGF23 with comparable affinit ies. In a study 
conducted under Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) conditions , KRN23 cross -reactivity was 
evaluated against a full panel of human, rabbit (32 tissues), and cynomolgus monkey 
(33 tissues) tissues by [CONTACT_9064]. No specific KRN23 staining was observed, suggesting untoward direct- effects of KRN23 are not expected in any tissues of  normal 
humans, rabbits, or cynomolgus monkeys.  
A series of nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicity studies have been conducted in 
rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys to support the use of KRN23 in adults and children. Findings of potential clinical signifi cance and relevance to this protocol are summarized 
below; a dditional information is provided in the IB.  
• The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in a 40 -week toxicity study in adult 
cynomolgus monkeys was 0.03 mg/kg KRN23 for males and 0.3 mg/kg KRN23 for females. The NOAEL in a 40 -week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys and a 
single-dose study in rabbits was 0.3 mg/kg KRN23. 
• Soft tissue and organ mineralization was a consistent finding associated with prolonged and excessive serum phosphate levels including the kidney where nephrocalcinosis was observed at the highest dose tested and reversibility of mineralization could not be established.  
• The most prominent pharmacologic actions of KRN23 were dose- dependent changes in 
serum inorganic phosphorus and 1,25(OH)
2D in rabbits and juvenile, adult, and pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
• No gross or histopathological abnormalities were observed at the intravenous ( IV) 
infusion sites or subcutaneous ( SC) injection sites in the 40- week repeat -dose toxicity 
studies in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys.  
• KRN23 demonstrated consistent and predictable PK behavior in both rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on the results of single- and repeat -dose studies where 
exposure was by [CONTACT_492377]. 
The NOAEL was the same in juvenile and adult monkeys suggesting no difference in 
sensitivity to the adverse effects of KRN23 . The results from single- and repeat -dose

Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633312] been completed  in adult patients with XLH: a single dose Phase 1 
safety and tolerability study of KRN23 (KRN23- US-02), a single dose Phase 1 safety and 
tolerability study of KRN23 in Japan and Korea (KRN23-001), a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose 
escalation study (KR N23-INT-002), and an associated treatment extension study 
(KRN23 -INT-002). An additional open- label long -term extension study (UX023-CL203) is  
ongoing. A Phase 2 dose-finding, pharmacodynamic ( PD) and safety study is also being 
conducted in pediatric XLH patients (UX023-CL201). A confirmatory randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 3 safety and efficacy study is being conducted in parallel with this 
study (UX023-CL303). Details of study parameters and available PK, PD, clinical efficacy , 
and safety results are provided in the IB. 
Data from clinical studies to date are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action: that 
KRN23 blocks FGF23 action, leading to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due 
to increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP /GFR) and increased intestinal 
absorption caused by [CONTACT_67191] 1,25(OH)
2D. Single and repeat- dose clinical studies indicate 
SC administration of KRN23 consistently increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and TmP/GFR, without a major impact on urine calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism. 
The data from the extension study suggest KRN23 could provide sustained increases in 
serum phosphorus levels sufficiently such that improvements in bone physiology, structure, and function would be expected.  
Repeated doses of KRN23 up to 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated by [CONTACT_460037] 1/2 dose escalation and associated treatment extension study. No deaths or life threatening treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs) have been reported . 
In the extension study, serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported for 3 subjects were unlikely to 
be or were not study drug related: breast cancer, hypertensive crisis, and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]. Throughout the extension study, treatment- related AEs were reported for 
14 subjects (63.6%) treated with KRN23 and included injection site reaction (5 subjects, 22.7%), arthralgia (3 subjects, 13.6%), restless legs syndrome (3 subjects, 13.6%), and 
injection site pain (2 subjects, 9.1%). No discernible clinically significa nt trends of lab 
abnormalities suggestive of a treatment -related adverse effect were noted . Overall, no 
immunogenicity or patterns of dose- limiting toxicity have been associated with KRN23 
treatment.

5.3 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits  
KRN23, a  fully human m Ab that binds and inhibits FGF23, is being developed as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for XLH, a rare genetic disease associated with hypophosphatemia and 
elevated levels of FGF23. By [CONTACT_460038]23, KRN23 has the potentia l to 
restore phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism homeostasis in patients with XLH, 
thereby [CONTACT_460039], the pathologic hallmark of XLH in adults . This therapeutic 
approach directly targets the inherent dysregulation in XLH (i.e. , excess FG F23). In contrast, 
supplementation therapy with phosphate and/or 1,25(OH) 2D, is only partially effective and 
carries a significant burden and  risk of ectopic mineralization , particularly nephrocalcinosis. 
Clinical studies to date have demonstrated that KRN 23 treatment blocks FGF23 action and 
leads to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased TmP/GFR. Increased 1,25(OH)
2D was also observed, as expected, based on the inhibition of the excess 
of FGF23. Bone formation and resorption marke rs also increased . KRN23 was well tolerated 
in the population studied. No major safety concerns were observed; there was no evidence of 
immunogenicity, and no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) based on 
electrocardiogram (ECG ), even though FGF23 levels were increased following KRN23 
treatment. Although ectopic mineralization is a known risk related to XLH disease and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_492378]/or 1,25(OH)
2D supplementation, KRN23 does not appear 
to be associated with progression of c ardiac or renal ectopic mineralization beyond the 
natural course of pre- existing disease.  
SC doses of KRN23 in the range from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg were able to achieve the desired PD effect in adults, which lasted approximately one month, positioning KRN23 as a drug that could be administered once- per-month by [CONTACT_10530], which is a convenient and acceptable 
therapeutic regimen for a chronic condition.  
In conclusion, KRN23 inhibits the effects of FGF23, restoring phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism homeostasis. By [CONTACT_492379], it is expected 
that the underlying osteomalacia will be resolved, leading to improved clinical outcomes 
including a reduction in pain, stiffness, fatigue, and fracture risk as well as the impact of these f actors on the quality of life of adult patients with XLH. To date, KRN23 has a 
favorable safety profile without evidence of increased ectopic mineralization or other concerns associated with the excess of FGF23. KRN23 has the potential to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with XLH.  
5.4 Study Rationale  
XLH is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wasting, and defective bone mineralization caused by [CONTACT_492356] (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome). In the absence of functional PHEX, release of FGF23 by [CONTACT_492357]. Excess circulating FGF23 signals the kidney tubules to decrease phosphate reabsorption by [CONTACT_100276]-regulating NaPi- IIa 
and NaPi- IIc in the tubular cells and suppressing 1,25(OH)
2D production, resulting in

Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633314] shown incomplete healing of osteomalacia (Sullivan et al. 1992) . In addition, there are no systematic studies in 
adults to show this regimen improves symptoms or outcomes, and there are concerns about the risk of long- term complications, particularly nephrocalcinosis, which increases with dose 
and duration of therapy. More efficacious, safer, and convenient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492329]- related symptoms and complications.  
A Phase 1 study established the PK profile of KRN23. A Phase 1/[ADDRESS_633315] 
shown that KRN23 in single and repeated monthly doses up to 1.0 mg/kg was well tolerated by [CONTACT_492380] . KRN23 sufficiently increased serum phosphorus levels such that 
improvements in bone physiology, structure, and function would be expected.  
A randomized, double-blind, place bo-controlled Phase [ADDRESS_633316] on 
patient -reported and functional outcomes in adults with XLH. The current open- label study 
will examine the effic acy of KRN23 on bone quality, including the effects on osteomalacia at 
the tissue level, and provide an additional assessment of safety .  During the Treatment 
Extension Periods I and II , additional changes in efficacy outcomes and long- term safety will 
be assessed.  
5.5 Primary Efficacy Hypothesis  
Treatment with 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 monthly will improve XLH -associated osteomalacia as 
determined by [CONTACT_492359] (osteoid volume/bone volume, OV/BV) .

6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Efficacy Objective:   
Establish the effect o f KRN23 treatment on improvement in XLH- associated osteomalacia as 
determined osteoid volume/bone volume. 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
The key secondary efficacy objective is to establish the effect of KRN23 treatment on 
increasing serum phosphorus levels in adults with XLH   
Other secondary efficacy objectives are to establish the effect of KRN23 treatment in adults 
with XLH on:  
• Changes from baseline in additional histomorphometric parameters – including osteoid 
thickness (O.Th) , osteoid surface/bone sur face (OS/BS), and mineralization lag time 
(MLt)  
• Changes from baseline in parameters of bone mineralization including mineral apposition 
rate (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS), bone formation rate (BFR), and others  
• Additional PD markers reflecting the status of phosphorus homeostasis and renal function 
• Bone remodeling as assessed by [CONTACT_492381]:  
• Examine the effect of KRN23 treatment in adults with XLH on pseudofracture healing 
• PROs assessing skeletal pain and fati gue  
Pharmacokinetic Objective:  
Assess the PK of KRN23 throughout the dosing cycle following the first doses and at steady state  
Safety Objective:   
Establish the safety and tolerability profile of KRN23 in the treatment of adults with XLH 
including AEs , ectopic mineralization risk, cardiovascular effects, and immunogenicity 
profile

Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633318] bone biopsies will be performed at baseline and Week 48 (or ET if applicable). 
Baseline histologic and histomorphometric assessments of the bone biopsy specimens will be performed as each biopsy is completed to assess sample quality and confirm the presence of 
osteomalacia in at least [ADDRESS_633319] bone biopsies will b e supported by [CONTACT_492382]23 -mediated processes. Pseudofractures and PROs will provide additional information 
on KRN23 efficacy. Safety, immunogenicity, and PK of KRN23 will also be evaluated. 
KRN23 will be administered via SC injections monthly (Q4W, 28 days) for 48 weeks. 
Subjects will then continue into an additional 48-week Treatment Extension Period I (until 
Week 96). For subjects at study sites outsi de of the [LOCATION_002] (US), the Week 96 Visit 
will be their End of Study (EOS) efficacy visit (referred to as EOS I).  For subjects at sites in the US, treatment will continue for up to an additional [ADDRESS_633320] their EOS efficacy visit (referred to as EOS II).  (The duration of this period will vary for individual subjects and will be determined by [CONTACT_35677] 97 through their EOS I I 
Visit).  For subjects not immediately continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or 
another mechanism upon completion of study drug treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Follow- up telephone call (TC) will occur 4 weeks (+5 days) af ter the 
subject’s final study site visit (ie EOS I [non -US subjects], EOS II [US subjects], or Early 
Termination [ET] visit) to collect information on any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs , and 
concomitant medications.  If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, an additional Safety Follow -up TC will occur at 
8 weeks (+ 5 days) after the subject’s final study site visit. The end of this study is defined as the last day that the protocol specified assessment s (including telephone contact) are 
conducted for the last subject. .

Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633322] likely to benefit from treatment: adult 
XLH patients with osteomalacia and pain. The sample size and study population are intended 
to characterize KRN23 efficacy as related to bone quality following up to one year of 
treatment in adult XLH patients .  
The protocol consists of multiple study stages, a 48- week Open -Label Treatment Period 
(Weeks 0-48) and an additional 48-week Treatment Extension Period I (Weeks 49 -96).  
In the US,  the study will also include a Treatment Extension Period II (up to approximately 
45 weeks).  Case reports in XLH and nutritional osteomalacia suggest that healing of 
osteomalacia and resolution of associated symptoms (e.g. , pain) are likely to occur within 
3 to 6 months of restoration of phosphorus homeostasis ( Kang et al. 2014 ), (Shikino et al. 
2014) , (Chalmers et al. 1967 ). Therefore, the 12-month duration of the initial Open -Label 
Treatment Period  enable s a rigorous assessment of improvements in skeletal health  
associ ated with phosphate control.  
Treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D metabolites typi[INVESTIGATOR_492340]- term complications from the treatment, such as 
hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis. No consensus exist s regarding treatment of adult 
patients with XLH, but symptomatic patients —those with bone or joint pain and/or 
pseudofractures—may be treated with oral phosphate and vitamin D replacement therapy 
(Linglart et al. 2014) . However, a double- blind, active -comparator design would be very 
difficult given the differences in the method of administration (oral vs. SC injection for 
KRN23) and the individualized nature of treatment (Linglart et al. 2014 ), (Carpenter et al. 
2011) . Furthermore, bone biopsy assessments and biochemical markers of bone turnover are 
objective, quantitative measures, which will not be impacted by [CONTACT_65464]-label design of the 
study.  
KRN23 treatment normaliz es serum phosphorous levels, directly impacting  the 
hypophosphatemia and consequent osteomalacia that is the hallmark of XLH, and the cause 
of the bone abnormalities t hat result in the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. 
The primary efficacy variable reflects reduction in osteoid volume after 48  weeks of 
treatment. Secondary variables also address the final goals of therapy in adults with XLH , 
which are to restore skeletal health and thereby [CONTACT_492383], fatigue, and 
fracture risk . 
7.3 Selection of Study Population

Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional information on dose adjustments. 
7.4.2 Reference Therapy  
The study is a single-arm, open- label study . All subjects will be on active treatment; no 
reference therapy or placebo will be administered .  
7.4.3 Selection of Doses and Study Duratio n  
The goal of therapy in adults with XLH is to increase serum phosphorus sufficiently to allow 
the bone to fully mineralize, and thereby [CONTACT_492386], structure, and function. The level of serum phosphorus needed to restore bone metabolism home ostasis and 
mineralization is not precisely known, but there is a general agreement that increasing serum phosphorus above the lower limit of normal (LLN) is an appropriate strategy. Another key consideration of the therapeutic goal is related to the safety concerns associated with ectopic mineralization, in particular nephrocalcinosis. The risk of nephrocalcinosis with the current oral phosphorus and active vitamin D therapy increases with higher doses, and is believed to be associated with exacerbated oral phosphate wasting in the urine, and secondary hypercalciuria (Goodyer et al. 1987 ), (Verge et al. 1991) , (Sabbagh et al. 2008) . 
Although mechanistically KRN23 does not increase urinary phosphorus or calcium, the dosing strategy will be conservative, aiming to maintain serum phosphorus above the LLN for the majority of a given dose interval without causing hyperphosphatemia.  
The Phase 3 dose is based on PK, PD, clinical , and safety  data obtained in previous studies 
(KRN23 -US-02, KRN23- INT-001 and KRN23- INT-002). These studies indicate 
normalization of serum phosphorus levels occurs with SC KRN23 doses ranging from 0.3 to 
1.0 mg/dL Q4W. The safety data showed repeated monthly doses up to 1.0 mg/kg were well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_492380].  
Data from KRN23 -INT-002, the longest clinical study to date , is the primary basis of the 
dosing strategy. All subjects in the study responded to KRN23 at doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 
1.0 mg/kg by [CONTACT_492387] . After the initial dose -titration period, the 
majority of subjects (60% to 74%) stabilized on an optimal dose of 1.0 mg/kg KRN23 and 
achieved serum phosphorus levels within the normal range. The maximum increase in serum phosphorus following KRN23 administration was approximately 1 mg/dL from baseline. No hyperphosphatemia (>4.5 mg/dL; 1.45 mmol/L) was detected at any time point. 
Increases in serum phosphorus persisted through much of each treatment interval and

throughout the 12 months of treatment; however, serum phosphorus decreased towards the 
end of each dose interval as KRN23 concentrations waned. Importantly, KRN23 administratio n increased serum phosphorus without negatively affecting other parameters 
such as iPTH and calcium.  
Based on these data, a KRN23 dose of 1 .0 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest 10 mg) 
administered Q4 W by [CONTACT_492388] a reasonable safety margin.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Duration  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is [ADDRESS_633337] s at sites in 
the US , or until one of the following occurs:  the subject withdraws consent, the subject is 
discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is

take place before 30  September  2018. The duration of the period will be determined by [CONTACT_492389] m the start of Week 97 through the EOS II Visit.  
For subjects not immediately continuing KRN23 treatment under commercial use or another mechanism upon completion of study drug treatment or early withdrawal from this study, a Safety Follow -up TC will occur 4 weeks (+ 5 days) after their final study site visit (ie, EOS  1 
[non- US subjects], EOS II [US subjects], or ET Visit) to collect information on whether 
KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. If the subject is not continuing KRN23 therapy 
under commercial use or another mechanism at that time, an additional Safety Follow -up TC 
will occur 8 weeks (+ 5 days) after the subject’s final study site visit to collect informa tion on 
whether KRN23 treatment has been started through another mechanism and, if not, any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications.  
The end of the study is defined as the last day that protocol- specified assessments (including 
telephone contact) are conducted for the last subject. The maximum planned study duration 
(treatment plus safety follow -up) is approximately 149 weeks.

prior to the Week 48 or , if eligible,  the Early Termination (ET) visits. 
All Screening/Baseline assessments and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be satisfied prior to dosing. The Baseline visit should occur no more than 31 days following the Screening visit. If the Baseline visit (BL) occurs mor e than 31 days following the Screening Visit, medical 
history and pregnancy status should be re -assessed. The Baseline, Week 48, and Week 96

The schedule of visits and assessments conducted during Screening and Baseline, and the Open -Label Treatment Period are provided in  Table  2.[ADDRESS_633345]- treatment assessments, with efficacy conclusions based on change from baseline.  
The efficacy variables in this study: OV/BV,  O.Th, OS/BS, and MLt, will provide a 
histomorphometric indicator of KRN23 action. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the reduction in osteoid volume (OV/BV) based on analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies after 
48 weeks of KRN23 treatment . Osteoid volum e (measured as a percentage of total bone 
volume) is the most consistent histomorphometric parameter to quantify the amount of osteoid tissue accumulation, which is the hallmark of osteomalacia.  The primary efficacy measure will be supported by [CONTACT_492391], serum phosphorus levels, along with multiple secondary and exploratory variables, including additional histomorphometric parameters,  biochemical markers, and PROs. Secondary and exploratory endpoints and 
associated analyses are described in Section 7.6.4.  The following section describes the 
assessments that will be performed throughout the study to derive primary, key secondary, secondary, and exploratory variables.

[IP_ADDRESS] Iliac Crest Bone Biops y 
In adulthood, XLH progresses into a disease of persistent and often clinically significant 
osteomalacia as a result of chronic low serum phosphorus, causing bone and joint pain and 
pseudofractures in a large proportion of patients ( Reid et al. 1989) . Preclinical and clinical 
data suggest static and dynamic parameters of osteoid accumulation improve significantly 
following anti-FGF23 treatment in the Hyp mouse model ( Aono et al. 2009) , or 6-9 months 
of supplementation therapy in adults with XLH ( Sullivan et al. 1992) , (Harrell et al. 1985 ). 
Therefore, iliac crest bone biopsies will be obtained to assess OV/BV as the primary outcome 
measure in this study ; by [CONTACT_492392] e and after treatment with KRN23, 
each subject will serve as an individual control.   
A bone biopsy of the iliac crest will be performed to assess OV/BV, O.Th, OS/BS , 
MLt as well as other parameters. Subjects will  receive two courses of tetracycline 
(or demeclocyclin e) lab el prior to biopsy ( see Section  7.5) associated with the Baseline and 
Week 48 (or Early Termination  if it occurs between the Week 24 and Week 48) visits . 
Bone biopsy of the trans- iliac crest will be performed by  a physician trained and experienced 
in the procedure. Baseline bone biopsies will be qualitatively analyzed in real time to assess the presence of osteomalacia. If a subject is determined not to have osteomalacia at the time 
of the initial biopsy, that subject will continue on study but will not undergo the second bone biopsy at Week 48/ET.  
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints derived from these assessments are provided in 
Section 7.6. Refer to the Transili ac Crest Bone Biopsy Manual for detailed instructions on 
bone labeling, biopsy, sample processing, and histomorphometry. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biochemical M arkers  
Osteomalacia is a hallmark of XLH in adults and results from the underlying mineralization 
defect due to hypophosphatemia. Normalization of bone turnover with improved mineralization would be expected to prevent pseudofractures or accelerate their healing. Biochemical markers of bone formation will be evaluated as an indicator of changes in bone metabolism in response to KRN23 treatment. Skeletal health parameters will be used to establish the improvement in biomarker s and modification of pathological features of bone 
disease in XLH .  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Serum Phosphorus  
KRN23 binds to and inhibits FGF23. As a phosphaturic hormone, FGF23 plays an important role as a specific regulator of serum phosphorus levels. Normalization of serum phosphorus directly bears on the hypophosphatemia and consequent osteomalacia that is the hallmark of XLH and the cause of the bone abnormalities that result in the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. The key secondary efficacy variable in this study, serum phosphorus levels at the 
mid-point of the dosing cycle, will provide a biochemical indicator of KRN23 action across 
the dosing interval.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Biochemical  Markers of Bone Turnover  
Biochemical markers of bone turnover in serum, including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide 
(P1NP), carboxy- terminal cross -linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), and 
bone- specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) will be evaluated over time as an indicator of 
changes in bone metabolism in response to KRN23 treatment. Serum samples will be 
collected at the Baseline ( Day -2), Week 12, Week 24, Week 48, Week 72, and 
Week  96/EOS I  visits and, if applicable, EOS II (or Early Termination) as indicated in the 
Schedules of Events ( Table  2.1, Table  2.2, Table 2.3, and Table 2.4).  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_633348] of KRN23 on bone metabolism and phosphate homeostasis, additional PD markers will be assessed, including serum calcium, 1,25(OH)
2D, 
urinary phosphorus, ratio of renal tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (Tm P/GFR), and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP). 
These measures will directly reflect the mechanism by [CONTACT_492393]23 restores phosphorus homeostasis by [CONTACT_492394]23.  
Serum samples will be obtained following a minimum overnight fasting time of 8 hours and 
prior to study drug administration (if applicable). Samples should be obtained in the morning at approximately the same time for each visit due to known fluctuations in serum phosphorous levels associated with circadian rhythm. The time of sam ple collection will be 
noted on the CRF. 
Two-hour fasting urine collection is required to assess phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR 
and TRP) based on simultaneous urine and blood creatinine and phosphorus concentrations. 
Both 2-hr and 24- hr urine will be used  for measurements of urinary phosphorus, creatinine 
and calcium .  The  duration of fasting time for all PD parameters will be recorded on the 
CRF.  
PD markers will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Events (Table  2.1, Table  2.2, 
Table 2.3, and Table 2.4). When possible, samples will be used to assess both PD and safety 
parameters to minimize blood draw requirements and patient burden (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Reported Outcomes  
PROs  will support the effect of KRN23 on patient benefit and clinical outcomes in this 
population. Adult patients with XLH experience a number of symptoms including bone and joint pain due to the underlying osteomalacia and joint pain related to osteoarthritis  that often 
develops in adults with XLH as a consequence of the ongoing loading of joints that became misaligned during childhood due to XLH rickets and bowing. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_492342] I will be used 
to assess the effects of KRN23 treatment on patient -reported and quality of life outcomes. 
PROs will be administered in order of presentation  below at Baseline (Week 0) and 
Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96/EOS I and, if applicable, Q24W during Treatment Extension Period II and at EOS II, as indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table  2.1,

Two dimensions are measured: pain severity  (worst, least, average, and now) and the impact 
of pain on functioning (pain interference with general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep). The BPI [CONTACT_53007] 3 (BPI Q3; Worst Pain) will be administered at Screening to assess eligibility. The complete short -form BPI [INVESTIGATOR_492345].  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Brief Fatigue Invento ry 
The BFI is a self -reported questionnaire consisting of 9 items related to fatigue that are rated 
on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale with a recall period of 24 hours. As with the BPI, two dimensions are measured: fatigue and the interference of fatigue on daily life (activity, mood, 
walking ability, work, relations with others, and enjoyment of life). The BFI was developed to evaluate severity of fatigue due to cancer and cancer treatment (Mendoza et al. 1999 ) and 
has been used in musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (Murphy et al. 2010) , (Murphy et al. 2013) , (Wolfe 2004) . The complete BFI will be 
administered at  Screen ing and at all indicated visits.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Targeted Radiography and Skeletal Survey 
A radiographic skeletal survey will be conducted at baseline to assess healing or resolution of 
current pseudofractures, determine areas of osteomalacia and enthesopathy, and  ident ify the 
number of active fractures/pseudofractures. Standard radiographs will be obtained of the chest, lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], right and left hand/wrist, right and left humerus, right and left radius/ulna, right and left femur/pelvis, right and left tibia/fibula, and right and left foot.  
During the 48 -week long Open- Label Treatment Period, t argeted radiography at locations 
identified by [CONTACT_492396] 12 , 24, 36, and 48 to monitor 
frequency and healing of pseudofractures and/or fracture s. During the Treatment Extension 
Period s I and II  (if applicable) , targeted radiographs will onl y be taken at clinic visits 
following newly diagnosed fractures.   
Post-baseline radiographs will be compared to baseline radiographs using a pre- defined list 
of abnormalities by a trained central reader who is blinded to subject data. Existing and new 
pseudofractures will be graded as not  healed, partially healed, or fully healed.

7.5.3 Safety Measures & General Assessments  
General assessments include medical history, height, and demographics. PHEX  mutation 
analysis will be performed for all qualified subject s even if  they or a family member has a 
confirmed PHEX  mutation . If the initial result for PHEX mutation analysis is negative or 
inconclusive (i.e., No Mutation, Likely Benign, Variant of Uncertain Significance, or 
Possibly Pathogenic) and informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], additional genetic testing will be performed to assess mutations in other genes associated with phenotypes overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_459986]. This testing will include genes for Autosomal Dominant 
Hypophosphatemic Rickets ( FGF23 ), Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets 
(DMP1, ENPP1 ), X- Linked Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets ( CLCN5 ), Raine 
Syndrome ( FAM20C ), and Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets with Hypercalciuria 
(SLC34A3). The investigator will communicate any additional genetic testing results to the 
subject. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_492397], frequency and severity of AEs and SAEs,  
including clinically si gnificant changes from baseline to scheduled time points in vital signs, 
weight, physical examination, e GFR, clinical laboratory evaluations  (including additional 
KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interest) , and concomitant medications. Ectopic 
mineraliz ation safety assessments include renal ultrasound , ECHO and ECG.

phosphate, calcimimetics  or other adjunctive therapy. Medications include investigational, 
prescription, over- the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements. Any relevant concomitant 
therapy, including physical/occupational therapy will be recorded. Use of pain medications will also be recorded.  Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 for prohibited medications during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg ; 2 measurements separated by 15 minutes), heart rate in 
beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Vital signs measurements will be obtain ed at specified visits ( Table  2.1, Table  2.2, 
Table 2.3, and Table 2.4) before any additional assessments are completed .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight and Height  
Weight will be obtained using a scale and recorded in kilograms at specified visits (Table  2.1, Table  2.2, Table 2.3, and  Table 2.4). The measurement  obtained at the Baseline 
visit will be used to  calculate the appropriate  dose of study drug to be administered on a 
mg/kg basis throughout the duration of the study, unle ss weight changes by [CONTACT_726] 2 0%,

include serum 1,25(OH)
2D, calcium, creatin ine, and iPTH; and urinary phosphorus, calcium 
and creatinine.   
Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and regular intervals throughout the study as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  2.1, Table  2.2, Table 2.3, 
and Table 2.4). Fasting for a minimum of 8 hours (overnight) is required prior to each blood 
draw; the duration of fasting will be recorded on the CRF. Twenty -four hour urine collection 
is required to assess urinary phosphorus:creatinine and calcium:creatinine ratios; urinary phosphorus, a PD parameter, will also be obtained from 24- hour urine samples .

that cannot be obtained through other imaging or biochemical studies ( Sullivan et al. 1992) . 
Osteomalacia is characterized by [CONTACT_35708], reflecting a prolonged 
and defective mineralization process (Arnstein et al. 1967) . Specific histomorphometric 
parameters chosen to evaluate changes in osteomalacia with KRN23 treatment include 
osteoid thickness, osteoid surface/bone surface, and osteoid volume/bone volume, which are static parameters providing information about the amount of unmineralized bone ( Dempster  
et al. 2013 ). In addition, mineralization  lag time, a d ynamic modeling parameter representing 
the mean time interval between the formation of osteoid and its subsequent mineralization, 
will be evaluated  (Dempster et al. 2013) . These parameters showed improvement but not 
normalization with oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy in XLH patients  (Sullivan et al. 
1992) , (Glorieux et al. 1980) , (Harrell et al. 1985 ). 
Secondary endpoints have been incorporated in to the design to support the hypothes is that 
achieving phosphate homeostasis ameliorates defective bone mineralization and metabolism and reduces the clinical burden of XLH. Secondary variables have been selected to demonstrate an overall improvement in bone health and metabolism to reduce disease burden and support the efficacy of KRN23 in this patient population. 
Hypophosphatemia is the cause of the consequent osteomalacia and bone abnormalities that 
result in clinical manifestations of XLH. Serum phosphorus levels serve as a surrogate for t he 
final goals of therapy, which are to restore skeletal health , thereby [CONTACT_492400], fatigue, and fracture risk affecting adult patients with XLH. By [CONTACT_492379], the underlying osteomalacia will be resolved, le ading to improved clinical 
outcomes.  
PROs have been included in the design to support clinical efficacy and demonstrate patient 
benefit from KRN23 treatment. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_492347], musculoskeletal pain, and osteoarthritis.  Similarly, the BFI has been used to evaluate fatigue in musculoskeletal condi tions including 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  
The safety parameters to be evaluated in this study include standard assessments such as recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures. Additional safety measures have been incorporated into the study design to perform a risk assessment of ectopic 
mineralization  in this population. PK and ADA samples will also be obtained to gain 
additional information regarding exposure and immunogenicity of KRN23.

7.6.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The study will enroll approximately 14 adult subjects with XLH; baseline histologic and 
histomorphometric assessments of the bone biopsy specimens will be performed as each 
biopsy is completed to assess sample quality and confirm the presence of osteomalacia in at 
least [ADDRESS_633364] 6 paired biopsy specimens are expected at the end of the study.  A reduction 
in excess osteoid is expected to be shown in all subjects with paired biopsies with an  
estimated ≥ 50%  reduction from baseline in osteoid thickness. The sample size and study 
duration are believed to be sufficient to enable characterization of KRN23 effects on bone tissue and skeletal health.   
Information will be used to support the findings of the larger Phase [ADDRESS_633365] patient -reported outcomes.

humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE . For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug  and the AE . 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug. 
Life-threatening AE  or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected 
adverse reacti on that, in the view of either the investigator or Ultragenyx, places the patient 
or subject at immediate risk of death . It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
current Investigators Brochure’s Reference Safety Information (RSI) or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.

• Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) 
are not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]-existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs .  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. 
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wher ever possible, t he severity of all AE s will be graded using the NCI  CTCAE  version 
4.03. The  majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities . Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling. 
• Death (Grade 5): Events that result in death.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633383] 2017  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   Page 69  
provided. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significanc e (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning . Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following descriptions. 
Categories of attributions for “ Unrelated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. 
• Unlikely  Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events:  
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/ procedure.  
• Definitely Related: This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs  deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely  Related  
will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx  
[IP_ADDRESS] General  
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with 
onset after the subject signs con sent for study participation must be promptly documented on 
the AE eCRF via the EDC system. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460010], obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of th e AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633384] signs informed consent through the final 
Safety F ollow -up TC  (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . In addition, the Investigator should 
report any AE that occurs after this time period that is believed to have a reasonable 
possibility of being associated with study drug.  
AEs ongoing at the final Safety F ollow-up TC should have a comment in the source 
document by [CONTACT_492405], recovered with sequelae, or 
stabilized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements 
for Immediate Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported within [ADDRESS_633385]'s treatment assignment or dosage. 
The reporting requirement for SAEs is from the time of signing of the ICF through the final Safety F ollow -up TC .  
SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_35720]. Initial SAE reports must be followed by [CONTACT_3896] . These should include 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_11821] . Telephone reports must 
be confirmed promptly by [CONTACT_6972]. Follow- up SAE  information must be submitted in a 
timely manner as additional information becomes available. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug must be followed to resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected. 
A death occurring during the study, during the per- protocol follow -up period, or through the 
final Safety F ollow-up TC  (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS])  must be reported to Ultragenyx or 
its designee within [ADDRESS_633386] notify the IRB/EC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, as soon as is practicable and in accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local law . A copy of 
this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Reporting  
The regulations governing clinical studies state that the sponsor and investigator are required 
to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations . According to the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, no tably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropri ate urgent safety measures to 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL304  
Amendment  3:  [ADDRESS_633387] . The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
Ethics Committee (EC) is notified at the same  time.”  The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through the final Safety F ollow-up TC  (as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . Investigators are required to report any ur gent safety measures to 
Ultragenyx within 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), Ethics Committees, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. Fatal and life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_633388] knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_633389] knowledge of the event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of KRN23, major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  The reporting period 
for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through the final Sa fety 
Follow-up TC  (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
The i nvestigator will notify the IRBs/Research Ethics Boards (REB)/ECs of SAEs and urgent 
safety matters, in accordance with IRB/REB/EC requirements and local l aws and regulations. 
A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will 
prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic summary reports to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics Committees, as per local laws and regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or Partner  
Pregnancies in subjects or part ners must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event to Ultragenyx or its designee. The reporting period for pregnancies is the period 
from  the signing of the ICF through the final Safety Follow- up TC  (as defined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . Reported pregnancy of a subject or a subject’s partner, while participating in 
the study, will be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for details on the reporting

Proprietary and Confidential   Page 72  
procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy. Pregnancy- associated SAEs will be 
processed and submitted, as necessary, as per the S[LOCATION_003]R reporting process (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Review of Safety Data 
The Ultragenyx SSRT, Medical Monitor, and Investigator(s) will actively review safety data 
during the course of the study. Subsequent safety data review by [CONTACT_492406], as needed.  Safety data for review will, at a minimum, include listings of all SAEs, trea tment -emergent AEs, grade 2 or greater 
laboratory values, deaths, and AEs leading to study discontinuation. 
To facilitate prompt risk mitigation activities, the SSRT will immediately evaluate:  
• Any observations that may materially influence the risk-benefit analysis of KRN23 
• Any significant safety issues that have been identified from cumulative data  
• Any actions taken by [CONTACT_492407]’s Regulatory Authority due to safety issues 
 
Potential safety signals identified during the SSRT reviews or any other process during the 
conduct of the study will be escalated to the appropriate internal Ultragenyx safety governing bodies. Any action indicated by [CONTACT_492408], e.g. Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and 
Investigators.  
An independent DMC will act in an advisory capacity to monitor subject safety through the end of the Treatment Period (Week 48). The DMC may meet on a routine basis, or as needed, to review aggregate safety data and p rovide advice regarding the safety of subjects and the 
continuing scientific validity of the study. The DMC may also be asked to review S[LOCATION_003]Rs that represent changes in the nature or an increase in the frequency of events and may provide recommendations re garding continued subject participation.  
Potential safety signals identified during the DMC reviews or any other process during the conduct of the study will be escalated to the appropriate internal Ultragenyx safety governing bodies. Any action indicated by [CONTACT_492408], e.g. Regulatory Authorities, ECs, IRBs, and Investigators.

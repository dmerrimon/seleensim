dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation

1.1 Objectives: 
i. Determine the  rate of cesarean delivery in women who receive 
high-dose oxytocin regimen (HDOR) compared to women who 
receive low-dose oxytocin regimen (LDOR) for augmentation of 
labor.
ii. Determine the rates  of several measures of maternal morbidity in 
women who receive HDOR compared to women who receive 
LDOR. The measures of maternal morbidity that will be examined 
are labor duration (time interval from admission to labor and 
delivery to delivery of neonate), postpartum hemorrhage, and 
intrauterine infection.
iii. Determine the rates  of several measures of morbidity in neonates 
born to women who receive HDOR compared to women who 
receive LDOR.  The measures will be examined as a composite 
outcome and will include perinatal death, umbilical cord arterial 
pH less than 7.0 or base excess greater than 12, Apgar scores at 
five minutes of less than <=3, admission to neonatal intensive 
care unit (NICU) for greater than 48 hours, severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_271792]/or ventilation 
(intubation, continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal 
cannula) for more than 12 hours, major birth injury (brachial 
plexus injury, bone fractures, other neurologic injury, facial nerve 
injury), neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal seizure, need for 
hypothermic treatment (cooling), and neonatal sepsis (positive 
blood, urine, or cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_63469]; or in the absence of 
positive culture(s), clinical evidence of cardiovascular collapse or 
an unequivocal X-ray confirming infection).
1.2 Hypothesis : The use of HDOR for labor augmentation will lower the 
incidence of dysfunctional  labor and the subsequent need for cesarean 
delivery compared to the use of LDOR. We hypothesize that women who 
receive HDOR will have shorter labor durations, as well as lower rates of 
postpartum hemorrhage and intrauterine infection. Furthermore, we 
hypothesize that there will be no significant difference in morbidity in 
neonates born to women who receive HDOR compared to women who 
receive LDOR.

improvement in maternal and neonatal outcomes.  Rather, the increasing rate has 
become a major health concern, as cesarean deliveries are associated with significant

Page 4 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 2014maternal morbidity, increased  costs, and adverse implications for future pregnancies.2-[ADDRESS_331865] to the increase in cesarean deliveries is the 
increased frequency of labor dystocia (i.e. dysfunctional labor due to ineffective uterine 
contractions).5,[ADDRESS_331866], in 2003, 645,075 
pregnant women (17% of all women in the [LOCATION_002] who gave birth and were 
registered) received oxytocin augmentation.  Though this statistic has no longer been 
reported in the CDC National Vital Statistics Reports since 2003, this percentage has 
likely further increased. While the total dose amount of oxytocin needed to produce a 
clinical response (i.e. progressive cervical dilation) may vary from patient to patient, the 
optimal dosing rate needed to achieve this endpoint has not yet been established. 
Oxytocin dose  protocols have been categorized into ‘high’ versus ‘low’ dose regimens, 
but these terms are to an extent, misnomers because the difference is typi[INVESTIGATOR_271793]. Both protocols titrate the dose of 
oxytocin to achieve a frequency of uterine contractions (usually 4 to 5 contractions in a 
10-minute interval) that is usually sufficient to result in progressive labor, and thus the 
target total dose should theoretically be similar. Numerous oxytocin dose protocols that 
vary in initial dose, incremental dose increase, and the time interval between dose 
increases have been studied. HDOR have been associated with significantly shorter 
labor duration and lower cesarean delivery rates, when compared to LDOR,7-[ADDRESS_331867] lower rates of postpartum hemorrhage and intrauterine infection for the 
mother. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_271794], use of LDOR has become the prevailing obstetric 
practice in the [LOCATION_002].14 The preference for LDOR stems from unsubstantiated 
concerns that HDOR are associated with more uterine tachysystole (defined as more 
than 5 contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window), which could 
lead to higher rates of neonatal morbidity.15-[ADDRESS_331868] refuted this conclusion 
by [CONTACT_271806]. 
However, the adoption of HDOR has been very uncommon due to persisting safety 
concerns and criticisms that prior studies had small sample sizes, inappropriate 
eligibility criteria, and inherent biases in study design.  
As the frequency  of cesarean deliveries performed for labor dystocia continues to 
increase, it is timely and critical to address the controversy surrounding the oxytocin 
dose regimens with an adequately powered prospective randomized trial.  It is 
imperative that the study is double blinded to both care providers and patients to 
eliminate the subjective and unintentional biases that are likely contributing to the slow 
adoption of high-dose regimens that are effectively used for labor augmentation in other 
parts of the world.18

PROTOCOL TITLE: A randomized  double blind clinical trial comparing oxytocin low-
dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation
Page 5 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 2014The overarching  goal of the proposed study is to conduct a double blind 
randomized trial to determine whether the use of HDOR is effective in lowering 
the incidence of cesarean delivery in a manner that is safe for both mother and 
neonate. Our data will allow us to help establish evidence-based guidelines for the 
optimal use of oxytocin for labor augmentation.  Furthermore, this project will allow us to 
build a foundation for a program of research to study other approaches to the 
management of labor dystocia.  Our long-term goal is to conduct research that will 
develop a better knowledge base to guide clinical decisions and encourage policy 
changes that can lead to safe prevention of cesarean delivery, both at Northwestern 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NMH) and nationally. 
3.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria
3.1 Nulliparous  women with singleton gestations who require oxytocin for labor 
augmentation will be recruited for the proposed study.  Pregnant women 
who present to the Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271795]’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NMH-PWH) Obstetric Triage Unit for obstetric evaluation will be 
screened for eligibility.  Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be 
approached for potential recruitment, with the assent of their primary 
obstetric physicians and midwives, once their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a trial 
of labor has been confirmed.
3.2 Criteria
i.Inclusion  criteria: 
oAble to  give informed written consent
oAge ≥[ADDRESS_331869] one of the 
following: cervix greater than or equal to 3 cm dilated or 80% 
effaced OR spontaneous rupture of membranes
oSubject’s  attending obstetric physician or midwife has 
determined that the subject needs administration of oxytocin 
infusion for labor augmentation.  Labor augmentation will be 
defined as stimulation of uterine contractions when 
spontaneous contractions have failed to result in progressive 
cervical dilation or descent of fetus.
ii. Exclusion criteria:
oHistory  of prior cesarean section or uterine surgery

3.3 Special Populations  
i. Adults unable to  consent: Subjects who are unable to consent will not 
be included in our study.
ii. Individuals who  are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers): Our 
study will only include subjects who are adults, and are 18 -45 years of 
age.
iii. Pregnant  women : This population will be included since our study is 
focused specifically on the obstetric population. 
iv. Prisoners : This is not applicable to our study; we will recruit solely from 
the population of pregnant women who deliver at Northwestern 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

the time of enrollment until time of discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271796].
ii. Previous work  by [CONTACT_458] (A.M.P.) showed that Active 
Management of Labor, with HDOR as one of its components, reduced 
the rate of labor dystocia and thus the rate of cesarean delivery, 
without increasing maternal or neonatal morbidity.10 This randomized 
trial was conducted at NMH and recruited 720 patients (75% of eligible 
women participated in the study) in a 12-month period.  Recent

9.0 Procedures  Involved
9.1 Study  Design: We propose a double blind randomized clinical trial:
i.Recruitment : Patients meeting eligibility criteria (as listed above) 
will be  approached for potential recruitment, with the assent of 
their primary obstetric physician or midwife, once their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88910] a trial of labor has been confirmed.
ii. Intervention : After informed consent is obtained, subjects will be 
enrolled if  and when their primary obstetric physician or midwife 
determines that oxytocin is to be initiated for labor augmentation. 
One group, labeled as LDOR, will undergo our primary 
institutional protocol (Protocol #12.0053) with a starting oxytocin 
concentration rate of 2mU/min that can be increased at 
increments of 2mU/min, as per the discretion of each individual’s 
primary obstetric physician or midwife. The other group, labeled 
as HDOR, will undergo our supplemental institutional protocol for 
Active Management of Labor (Protocol #12.005m Appendix A) 
with a starting oxytocin concentration rate of 6mU/min that can be 
increased at increments of 6mU/min, as per the discretion of each 
individual’s primary obstetric physician or midwife. The solutions 
used in the two groups will appear identical and volume infusion 
rates (2mL/hour) will be identical to ensure double blinding.  The 
sole difference between the two groups will be the oxytocin 
concentration, with 30U oxytocin in 500mL of 0.9% normal saline 
(NS) in the LDOR group and 90U oxytocin in 500mL of 0.9% NS 
in the HDOR group.  Once a patient is enrolled, randomized, and 
in receipt of the assigned intervention, further clinical 
management will be left to the discretion of each patient’s primary 
obstetric physician or midwife.  Each subject will have a unique 
drug code, which will remain with her for the trial duration, and

dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation
Page 9 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 2014drug preparations  will be labeled with the same unique code by 
[CONTACT_1714]. 
iii. Randomization : Fixed allocation procedure will assign the 
interventions to subjects  with equal probability using a blocked 
randomization scheme without stratification.  To maintain a 
double blind design, the NMH Investigational Pharmacy will carry 
out the randomization and preparation of oxytocin solutions 
according to the random assignment so that neither the patients 
and their care providers nor the investigators will know the identity 
of the intervention assignment.

9.3 Procedures to  lessen the probability or magnitude of risks:
i. Continuous  external fetal monitoring (EFM) will be required during 
oxytocin infusion for both treatment groups. As per established 
institutional clinical protocol (Protocol #12.0053), each subject will be 
monitored closely during oxytocin infusion. Specifically, in latent labor, 
the subject’s clinical nurse will assess and document contraction 
intensity, duration and frequency as well as fetal heart rate (FHR) 
baseline, variability, and any periodic change every [ADDRESS_331873]’s clinical nurse will assess and document contraction 
intensity, duration and frequency as well as FHR baseline, variability, 
and any periodic change every 15 minutes and with each oxytocin rate 
change.  If a tachysystole contraction pattern (defined as more than 5 
contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window) is 
identified, the oxytocin infusion will be decreased to the previous 
milliunit rate setting and reevaluated in [ADDRESS_331874]’s primary obstetric 
physician or midwife will be required to visualize the EFM recording 
and will determine further oxytocin titration.  For a prolonged 
deceleration (defined as a decrease in FHR from baseline lasting more 
than two minutes), the oxytocin infusion will be discontinued.  If a FHR 
pattern is deemed to be Category 3 (absent baseline FHR variability 
with any of the following: recurrent late decelerations, recurrent 
variable decelerations, bradycardia, or sinusoidal pattern), the oxytocin 
infusion will be discontinued, and the primary obstetric physician or

Category [ADDRESS_331875] oxytocin infusion 
according to the established NMH Clinical Protocol for Induction and 
Augmentation of Labor, Protocol #12.0053 (protocol is attached).  In 
accordance with this protocol, the oxytocin infusion will be started at a 
rate of 2 mU/min (to maintain blinded design, pump rate will be “set” at 
2 mL/hr with a concentration of 30 U oxytocin in 500mL of 0.9% NS) 
for the subjects in the LDOR group. The rate will be increased by 2 
mU/min no more frequently than every 15-30 minutes until a labor 
pattern with uterine contractions every 2-3 minutes of moderate to 
strong intensity is established.  Subjects in the HDOR group will 
receive oxytocin infusion according to the established supplemental 
NMH Clinical Protocol for Induction and Augmentation of Labor, 
Protocol #12.0053 (Appendix A – Active Management of Labor).  In 
accordance with this supplemental protocol, the oxytocin infusion will 
be started at 6 mU/min (to maintain blinded design, pump rate will be 
“set” at 2 mL/hr with oxytocin concentration of 90 U oxytocin in 500mL 
of 0.9% NS) for the subjects in the HDOR group. The rate will be 
increased by 6mU/min (to maintain blinded design, pump rate will be 
“increased” by 2 mL/hr with oxytocin concentration of 90 U oxytocin in 
500mL of 0.9% NS) until a labor pattern with uterine contractions every

11.0 Data and  Specimen Management
11.1 Data  Analysis Plan: All outcome data will be collected and entered into the 
computer database before breaking the code and revealing intervention 
assignment. All analyses will be performed using the intention to treat 
principle. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, proportions) will 
be calculated to check for any major differences in the study groups with 
regard to patient demographics and other baseline characteristics. All 
univariate comparisons will be unpaired and all tests of significance will be 
two tailed. For univariate analysis, continuous variables will be compared by 
[CONTACT_15914]’s t-test. Categorical data will be compared using Chi-square testing 
or Fisher’s Exact Test, depending on sample size.  All values will be 
expressed as the mean + standard error (continuous variables) or as a 
percentage of  the group from which they were derived (categorical 
variables). A p value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_331880] 100 patients will be performed by 
[CONTACT_271809], and the Haybittle-Peto rule will be used as 
a guide for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_271801] a significant difference between the group using a p <0.001. 
The overall type I error rate will be preserved at 0.05.

PROTOCOL TITLE: A randomized  double blind clinical trial comparing oxytocin low-
dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation
Page 12 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 201411.2 Power  Analysis: We based our power analysis on our previous work, 
literature review, and a review of recent institutional data. During the 12-
month period prior to this proposal, the rate of cesarean delivery at NMH 
was 22.4% for nulliparous women with term singletons pregnancies who 
received oxytocin prior to delivery and had fetuses in the vertex 
presentation.  For the purpose of the study design, a slightly lower rate was 
assumed for a population of women delivering at term that excluded women 
with history of prior uterine surgery and those undergoing induction of labor. 
A sample-size calculation suggests that, assuming a cesarean delivery rate 
of 20% in the traditional management LDOR group, 1002 patients (501 
patients per group) would be required for this sample to provide 80% 
power to detect a decrease in the rate of cesarean delivery to 13.4% (one-
third decrease) in the HDOR group. Chi-squared test comparing two 
independent proportions at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 is 
assumed in the power calculation.
11.3 Data  Security: A Data Security Plan will be developed to ensure that 
protected health information and personally identifiable information will be 
entered, stored, transmitted, analyzed, and reported in a manner that 
maintains confidentiality.  All the members of the study investigative team 
will be included on the Authorized Personnel list of the IRB approved 
protocol; only these individuals who are authorized will be granted access to 
the research data.  All members of the study investigative team will be 
trained and certified by [CONTACT_16305] 
(CITI) Program.  Data integrity and confidentiality will be maintained in 
several ways.  Sources of data include patient records (electronic and 
paper), patient care providers, and subjects. All data will be collected using 
standardized data collection forms. Once all data collection forms and 
medical charts have been reviewed, all data obtained will be entered in a 
HIPAA compliant into an electronically (passwords and encryption) 
protected and secure server maintained by [CONTACT_37123]. All identifiers will be 
removed and patient data will be stored and archived in a de-identified 
manner.  The identifiable data will be permanently discarded by 
[CONTACT_271808]. Data will be stored in 
accordance with NUIT File Sharing Policy using SharePoint and 
Northwestern file servers, which are available for storing and sharing 
sensitive research data in order to maintain confidentiality and privacy.  The 
data collected and transmitted to the central server is designed to 
strengthen de-identification and prevent any possibility of linking data to 
specific subjects.  Specifically, subject name, initials, date of birth, date of 
admission, date of delivery, date of enrollment will be removed from the 
database at the earliest opportunity.  We will organize dataset entries by 
[CONTACT_271810] (coinciding with drug treatment code number) 
in an anonymous manner. No patient specimens will be collected.  Only the

11.4 Quality  Control of Collected Data:  Data collection forms will be developed, 
pretested, and used by [CONTACT_271811]. Investigator meetings will be held on a quarterly 
basis, including just prior to the initiation of patient enrollment.  After 
initiation of patient enrollment, investigator meetings will be held monthly for 
the first three months to discuss any questions regarding the protocol, and 
also as needed thereafter. Data will be extracted from the electronic medical 
record system, and investigators and clinical staff will remain blinded to 
group assignment during the data collection process.  Every effort will be 
made to maintain high quality data; as such, institutional resources REDCap 
and NITRO Study Tracker will be used for data entry and monitoring.

from the medical record of each subject (see ‘data collection’ form) and 
will be recorded on a standard data collection form.  Once all data 
collection forms and medical charts have been reviewed, all identifiers 
and protected health information will be removed and research data 
will be stored and archived in a de-identified manner.  The identifiable 
data will be permanently discarded by [CONTACT_271812].
ii. Data  will be stored in accordance with Northwestern University 
Information Technology (NUIT) File Sharing Policy using SharePoint 
and Northwestern file servers, which are available for storing and 
sharing sensitive research data in order to maintain confidentiality and 
privacy. Only the study investigators who are on the Authorized 
Personnel list of the IRB approved protocol will be granted access to 
the research data.
iii. Research data will be retained  and stored for a minimum of three years 
after the conclusion of the study as per the Northwestern University 
Policy. However, research data will be kept for as long as deemed 
necessary to protect any intellectual property resulting from the work.  
The research data will be stored and archived in a de-identified 
manner in accordance with NUIT File Sharing Policy.
iv. Only  the study investigators who are on the Authorized Personnel list 
of the IRB approved protocol will be granted access to the research 
data.
v. The  principal investigator (A.M.P.),the co-investigators [CONTACT_271829] 
and [CONTACT_271831],  and research assistant (A.R.) will serve as 
custodians of the research data, and will be responsible and 
accountable for research data as it is collected, processed, stored, 
analyzed, and reported.

12.0 Provisions to Monitor  the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
12.1 Describe:
i. The  scope of risk to the patient falls under two broad categories: 1) risk 
of breaking confidentiality, and 2) risk for a significantly worse outcome 
in one study arm or the other.  Confidentiality of data will be preserved 
in multiple ways, as discussed earlier. With regard to intervention 
safety, both study arms utilize FDA-approved oxytocin at two different 
dosing rates that are both institutionally approved by [CONTACT_271813].  Therefore, adverse events related directly to 
the drug agent oxytocin are expected to be uncommon. Furthermore, 
emergency unblinding procedures will be established to prepare for the 
event of an adverse event. This study compares two institutionally 
approved clinical oxytocin dosing protocols, and thus the need for an 
ongoing data safety and monitoring and board (DSMB) was deemed 
unnecessary. An independent review board has been established in 
the event the need for review of unexpected serious adverse event 
arises. An interim analysis was planned to be performed by [CONTACT_271814] [ADDRESS_331881] to adverse events, the 
principal investigator (A.M.P.), co-investigators [CONTACT_271829] and [CONTACT_271832], and research assistant (A.R.) will be empowered to 
modify or suspend the trial if they are concerned that significant harm 
has occurred due to the study protocol.  Serious adverse events 
(events felt by [CONTACT_271815]-threatening, associated with death, or specifically 
leads to increased invasive interventions) will be reported to the IRB. 
ii. Statistical tests  will be used to analyze the safety data to determine 
whether harm is occurring.  All univariate comparisons will be unpaired 
and all tests of significance will be two tailed. For univariate analysis, 
continuous variables will be compared by [CONTACT_15914]’s t-test. Categorical 
data will be compared using Chi-square testing or Fisher’s Exact Test, 
depending on sample size.  All values will be expressed as the mean + 
standard error  (continuous variables) or as a percentage of the group 
from which they were derived (categorical variables). A p value of less 
than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The p value will not 
be adjusted for the interim analysis given its early timing.

PROTOCOL TITLE: A randomized  double blind clinical trial comparing oxytocin low-
dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation
Page 15 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 201413.0 Withdrawal  of Subjects*
13.[ADDRESS_331882] the right to withdraw subjects from the study for the following 
reasons: non-adherence to the protocol requirements by [CONTACT_271816]’s primary obstetric physician or midwife, or the subject no longer 
meets the protocol eligibility criteria (see Section 3.1 and 3.2).  Additionally, 
the study may be prematurely terminated, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271802]-
Principal Investigators and/o, there is sufficient reasonable cause. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
failure to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate; insufficient adherence to 
protocol requirements; insufficient complete and/or evaluable data; serious 
adverse events (events felt by [CONTACT_271817]-threatening, associated with death, or 
specifically leads to increased invasive interventions). 
13.[ADDRESS_331883]’s 
withdrawal will be recorded in the data collection.  Subject who withdraw or 
are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  If immediate deviation 
from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects, the investigators will contact [CONTACT_1201], if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action. Any departures from the protocol must 
be fully documented.  Unplanned protocol deviations will be reported to the 
IRB per institutional requirements.  If the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271802]-Principal 
Investigators is that there is sufficient reasonable cause for premature study 
termination, written notification documenting the reason(s) for study 
termination will be provided to the both parties, and to the IRB. 
13.[ADDRESS_331884] to 
the point of withdrawal will remain part of the study database and will not be 
removed. Removal of already collected data would undermine the scientific, 
and therefore the ethical, integrity of the research.  Incomplete data could 
potentially put enrolled study subjects, future study subjects, and users of 
oxytocin at unreasonable risk as a result of inaccurate data/conclusions. 
14.0 Risks to  Subjects*
14.1 Currently,  both dosing regimens compared in this study (LDOR and HDOR) 
are approved by [CONTACT_271818].  However, reasonably foreseeable risks include 
increased rates of tachysystole and cesarean deliveries performed for fetal 
heart rate tracing indications in the HDOR group, increased rates of 
maternal postpartum hemorrhage and intrauterine infections as well as 
increased cesarean deliveries performed for labor dystocia in the LDOR.  
Reasonably foreseeable inconveniences to the subjects include longer labor 
durations in the LDOR group and increased labor pain in the HDOR group.  
The protocol has been designed to minimize risks to the subjects and their 
neonates, regardless of whether they are randomized to LDOR or HDOR

PROTOCOL TITLE: A randomized  double blind clinical trial comparing oxytocin low-
dose and high-dose regimens for labor augmentation
Page 16 of 23 Revised Template: November 10, 2014groups.  All subjects  will sign a form indicating her free and informed 
consent to participate in the study prior to randomization. Given 
randomization of dosing regimens that already have well-established safety 
profiles, we expect a low likelihood of adverse outcomes.
14.2 Investigators  will be required to report any suspected or actual Unexpected 
Adverse Events (UAE) that may occur during study participation.  UAEs will 
be defined as any event that meets the following conditions: the event is not 
a known or reasonably foreseeable risk associated with the study 
procedures (e.g. risks related to administration of oxytocin and confidential 
information specified in the informed consent), and the event, in the 
investigators’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is or could be directly related to the subject’s 
participation in this research protocol.  Events that are the result of a natural 
progression of an underlying disease, disorder, condition, or a predisposing 
risk factor profile for the subject do not qualify as UAEs.  The investigators 
will be responsible for complying with IRB requirements for reporting of 
UAEs.  However, since both dosing regimens compared in this study (LDOR 
and HDOR) have already been in clinical use for labor augmentation at 
NMH, we anticipate a low likelihood of UAE.
14.3 The study  will only include pregnant women (see Section 16), and thus 
potential risks to their fetuses will be considered. Several measures of 
neonatal morbidity have been predefined as safety endpoints in the study. 
However, based on prior work10 showing no increase in neonatal morbidity 
in women assigned to active management of labor using HDOR compared 
to traditional management, we anticipate no increased risks to fetuses in the 
proposed study. 
14.[ADDRESS_331885] HRP-412 has been 
reviewed. As previously discussed, scientifically appropriate clinical studies

specific dosing used in the LDOR and HDOR in the proposed study. The 
risk to the fetus is caused solely by [CONTACT_271819], and any risk is the least 
possible for obtaining the research objectives. Furthermore, only subjects 
carrying fetuses of at least [ADDRESS_331886] 
treatment assignments will remain blinded during the study, and individual 
results will not be shared with the subjects or their primary care providers. 
19.0 Setting
19.1
i. Women  who present to the NMH-PWH Obstetric Triage Unit for a chief 
complaint of “labor” or “spontaneous rupture of membranes” will be 
screened for study eligibility by a trained member of the investigative 
team when it has been determined by [CONTACT_271820]. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be approached for 
potential recruitment, with the assent of their primary obstetric 
physician or midwife, once their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a trial of labor 
has been confirmed. The study will be explained in detail and all 
questions will be answered prior to signing written informed consent to 
participate in the study. 
ii. Once  informed consent is obtained, subjects will be enrolled into the 
study if and when their primary obstetric physicians or midwives have 
determined that oxytocin infusion is to be initiated for labor 
augmentation on the labor and delivery unit.  It is at this point that 
subjects will be randomized into one of two intervention groups, as 
allocated by [CONTACT_271821].

21.0 Prior Approvals
21.1 Approval  for collaboration with the NMH Investigational Pharmacy has been 
established (see attached ‘Pharmacy letter’).  NMH has a dedicated 
Investigational Pharmacy that is a separate division of the NMH pharmacy 
department. The Investigational Pharmacy employs two research 
pharmacists and three research pharmacy technicians who are responsible 
for all research drugs for studies conducted at NMH. The Pharmacy agrees 
to randomize and dispense study medication in a blinded manner to study 
subjects.  Appropriate Pharmacy staff will be trained on the details and 
requirements of the protocol. 
22.0 Recruitment  Methods
22.1 The clinical  trial will be registered in a publicly accessible database 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov) before recruitment of the first subject. Potential 
subjects will be screened for study eligibility by a member of the 
investigative team using a screening script. Patients who meet eligibility 
criteria will be provided further explanation of the study. For patients who 
agree to participate, a member of the investigative team will fully explain the 
study to the subject and obtain written informed consent according to our 
institutional IRB requirements.

23.0 Local Number of  Subjects
We based  our power analysis on our previous work, literature review, and our 
recent institutional data. During the 12-month period prior to this proposal, the 
rate of cesarean delivery at NMH was 22.4% for nulliparous women with term 
singletons pregnancies who received oxytocin prior to delivery and had fetuses in 
the vertex presentation.  For the purpose of the study design, a slightly lower rate 
was assumed for a population of women delivering at term that excluded women 
with history of prior uterine surgery and those undergoing induction of labor. A 
sample-size calculation suggests that, assuming a cesarean delivery rate of 20% 
in the traditional management LDOR group, 1002 patients (501 patients per 
group) would be required for this sample to provide 80% power to detect a 
decrease in the rate of cesarean delivery to 13.4% (one-third decrease) in the

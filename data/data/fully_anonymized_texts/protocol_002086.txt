Title: Effect of Unilateral Ultrasound-Guided Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in
Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy
Researchers: Ying (Amy) Ye, Jordan Wicker, Garrett Burnett, Chang Park, Mike Anderson,

Hypothesis: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients who receive unilateral
ultrasound-guided subcostal transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block will have decreased
opi[INVESTIGATOR_13320]:
Compare amount of intravenous (IV) opi[INVESTIGATOR_13321] 24-hour period amongst
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients who receive the unilateral ultrasound-guided
subcostal TAP block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_13322].
Secondary Objectives:
a. Amount of intraoperative IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]
b. Amount of post-operative IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]
c. Severity of pain at rest using an 11-point numeric pain score Likert scale at 1, 6, 12 and
24-hour marks postoperatively
d. Time to breakthrough pain after surgery
e. Area of pain after surgery
f. Presence of postoperative nausea (yes/no) at 1, 6, [ADDRESS_12901] considerable amounts of pain. The Enhanced
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society recommends a multimodal analgesic strategy for
managing pain for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients so as to improve patient comfort,
and minimize opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], thereby [CONTACT_13345], such as nausea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and reduced bowel motility. However,
there is currently no consensus as to the best pain management strategy for these patients.[ADDRESS_12902] IV patient-controlled (PCA)
opi[INVESTIGATOR_13323]2,3. However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13324]. Furthermore, complications from epi[INVESTIGATOR_13325], dural puncture, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_13326], limiting
routine placement in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.  Rectus sheath blocks have shown
potential to reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgeries, but no
studies have evaluated its specific effects in laparoscopic bariatric surgery4. Local anesthetic
infiltration into trocar sites have also been suggested, but so far has not been shown to reduce
postoperative pain5.
Recently, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks has garnered attention due to the relative
ease of placement and low risk for complications.6The goal of the TAP block is to deposit local
anesthesia in the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles so as
to anesthetize the anterior rami of the T7-L17,8. Studies have found that the classic TAP block,
in which the needle enters at the lumbar triangle of Petit, provided analgesia only up to T10,
making this block more suitable for lower abdominal surgeries9,10, and less ideal for
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Recent studies are now focusing on modified TAP blocks as a
means to provide adequate perioperative analgesia for these patients11,12. Ibrahim et al.
compared the effects of bilateral oblique subcostal TAP blocks, local anesthetic infiltration alone
at port sites, and no block or infiltration; compared to the other two groups, patients receiving
bilateral oblique subcostal TAP blocks had significantly lower pain scores postoperatively for
patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgeries12. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_13327], oblique subcostal TAP blocks are harder to perform than the standard subcostal TAP
block, requiring a longer ultrasound needle and larger volumes of local anesthetic13. Ari et al.
also did not find any difference in pain scores between patients receiving bilateral subcostal TAP
blocks to those receiving both bilateral subcostal and posterior TAP blocks11.
Adequate perioperative analgesia is immensely important for bariatric patients, yet there is still
no current consensus on optimal pain control. Regional anesthesia techniques are showing
promising results. We propose that a unilateral subcostal TAP block, which is easy to perform
with minimal risks to patients, may help in minimizing pain and nausea for patients undergoing
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

Other Aspects that Could Increase Subjects’ Vulnerability
Patients undergoing surgical procedures often have anxiety with surgery. Anesthesiologists will
treat this perioperatively with medications and reassurance.
Safeguards to Protect Subjects’ Rights and Welfare
Perioperative anxiety will be treated by [CONTACT_13346].
Regardless of participation in the study, patients will undergo their scheduled surgery. Patients
will be provided contact [CONTACT_13347]. Researches will ensure that protected health information be kept safe and
confidential.
Duration of Participation
Individual participation in this study will conclude following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13329]. Duration of participation will depend on the length of
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_13330] 1--[ADDRESS_12903] of care; they will not be
included in the experimental protocol. If they choose to withdraw following surgery,
post-operative data collection will stop. Regardless of decision to withdraw from the study,
subjects will receive current standard of care. Collected PHI will be destroyed at the time of
withdrawal.
Procedures for Investigators to Withdraw Subjects
The patient will be informed if they need to be withdrawn from the study. Should this decision be
made prior to the procedure, the patient will undergo the surgery as per current standard of
care; they will not be included in the experimental protocol. If this is decided following surgery,
post-operative data collection will stop. Regardless, subjects will receive current standard of
care. Collected PHI will be destroyed at the time of withdrawal.
How Participants will be Identified
Patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastrectomy procedure with [CONTACT_13352] and [CONTACT_13353] will be identified at at their preoperative surgical visit. The surgery team will
discuss the study and provide written information/consent for the patient to review.
Approximately [ADDRESS_12904]-anesthesia care unit.
Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury
Patients will be provided with a phone number to call for any concerns related to surgery,
anesthesia or the study. Should any complication requiring medical attention arise, patients will
be instructed to return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Subjects injured as a result of the this study will be
treated, with the costs billed to them and/or their insurance company. Patients will not be
compensated for research related injury.
Expected Direct Benefit to Subjects
Patients who receive a subcostal TAP block may experience less postoperative pain. This may
possibly lead to lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and thereby, result in fewer side effects related to
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].
Benefit to Society
Subcostal TAP blocks may be incorporated into an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery protocol
for laparoscopic gastrectomies should this study show decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_13331].
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
De-identified data will be stored on secure, password-protected servers maintained by [CONTACT_13348]. Access to the data will only be available to
Mount Sinai IT administrators and the study investigators. A one-way hash ID will be generated
for each record once the de-identified data set is released for analysis. Only the study
investigators with access to the full data set will be able to match the hash ID to the original
record. All investigators must have completed the HIPAA training pertaining to PHI
confidentiality.
Economic Impact on Subjects
There is no additional cost to subjects for participating in this study. There is no compensation
for participants.
Description of Study Design
Patients who are eligible for this subject will be invited to participate. Written informed consent

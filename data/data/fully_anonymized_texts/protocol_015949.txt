Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 10 Protocol Section  Description of Change  Rationale  
Section  9.1  Specification on the timing of the primary analysis: 
The primary analysis will be performed when all 
patients have completed the Induction Period at Week  16. The Induction Period summary tables for 
primary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints will be 
presented with the unblinded treatment groups. The 
analysis will be p erformed by [CONTACT_123023](s) who is independent from the day -to-day 
study oversight and operation. This is not an interim analysis since patients who responded at Week 16 will 
be re-randomized into the Maintenance period. Only 
overall treatment group results will be presented at this 
time; individual patient treatment assignments will not be released until end of study.  
The final time -course analysis, including the 
maintenance period analysis, will be performed when all 
patients have finished Week 52 and the database has 
been locked. Study tabulation datasets, analysis datasets and data listings will not be distributed, and the double -
blind individual patient treatment assignments for both periods will not be revealed until that time.  
Sensitivity  Analyses:  
Removed the Non-Response Imputation (NRI) as a sensitivity analysis and will conduct an MCMC multiple imputation for all missing values, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275] a s

Removed the Non-Response Imputation (NRI) as a 
sensitivity analysis and will conduct an MCMC multiple imputation for all missing values, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_555734].  Since the primary efficacy analysis assigns baseline values for the use of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_555735],

redundant and has been 
replaced with more appropriate sensitivity analyses.

Placebo,  2 mL injection.  
Study Design:  
This is a rando mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study which is 52 weeks 
in duration. The study is designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as 
monotherapy for moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis utilizing a 16 -week induction trea tment 
period and a 36-week long- term maintenance treatment period . 
Eligible adult and adolescent (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) patients with moderate -to-
severe atopic dermatitis fo r at least one year, defined according to the American Academy of 
Dermatology Consensus Criteria, an Eczema Area and Severity  Index Score (EASI) of ≥16, an 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 and a body surface area (BSA) of ≥10% will be enrolled.  
During the 16-week Induction Period, approximately 400 patients will be stratified and 
randomized 2:1 to either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and Week 2) or placebo by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W) . All study drug 
injections will be administered in the clinic.  
After completion of the Week [ADDRESS_729699] responded to treatme nt [defined as 
having an IGA of 0 or 1 or a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI -
75)] will

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 25 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease that is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_18193], environmental and 
immunologic factors (Werfel,  2016; Simon, 2019 ).  
Genetic studies of AD ( Auriemma, 2013; Bieber, 2012; Weidinger, 2018 ) have shown that genes 
enco ding for cytokines involved in the regulation of the immune system ( IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) , 
are strongly associated with the development of AD (He, 2003; Hummelshoj, 2003; 
Novak, 2002) . In addition, variants of genes that  encode for proteins involved in skin barrier 
function such as filaggrin  (FLG ) and loricrin (LOR)  are also associated with AD 
(Van Bever , 2011) . Since FLG plays a central  role in skin barrier integrity, loss of function 
mutations of the FLG gene is considered a major contributor to the development of early 
childhood AD (Bieber, 2008; Tanei, 2009; Bieber, 2012; Flohr, 2013) .  
Reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_555736] , which represents the first line of protection against the 
environment, is thought to lead to sensitization  to environmental allergens, associated wit h 
elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) ( present in about 50% to 80% of all patients with AD, 
particularly in children [Werfel, 2016] ) and consistent  with  the presence in t he skin of Type 2 
cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IL-25, IL -31, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
[TSLP]) and inflammation . Type 2 cytokines increase epi[INVESTIGATOR_81184], sensitization, 
inflammation, pruritus  and decrea se the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the barrier 
proteins FLG, LOR, and involucrin.  IL-13 in particular can reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_510885], LOR, and involucrin ( Kim,  2008)  and can act on 
keratinocytes in the skin to downregulate their differentiation (Howell, 2008).  IL-13 also induces 
T-cell chemoattractants that mediate T -cell infiltration into AD lesions (Purwar, 2006 ) and may 
also induce IL -5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil 
chemoattractants ( Esche, 2004).  Increased expression of IL -13 has consistently been reported in 
AD skin lesions and is associated with disease severity ( Choy, 2012; Hamid, 1996; Jeong, 2003; 
La Grutta, 2005; Neis, 2006; Suarez -Farinas, 2013; Tazawa, 200 4). The ubiquitous presence of 
IL-[ADDRESS_729713] common chronic medical  diseases—15‒30% of children and 2‒10% of 
adults are affected, and the prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three 
decades (Williams, 2008 ), with some geographic variability. With respect to disease severity, 
about 67% of AD pediatric patien ts have mild disease, 14 to 26% have moderate disease and 2 to 
7% have severe disease (Silverberg, 2017) . Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before 
age 5, with up to 70% of children having spontaneous remission bef ore adolescence 
(Bieber,  2008; Hua, 2014; Illi, 2004 ).  
1.1.2. Clinical Manifestations  
Clinically, AD is characterized by [CONTACT_143205], erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis) , 
lichenification and intense pruritus  (Bieber, 2008) , which along with the distribution, chronicity 
and history of skin lesions, form the b asis for making  the diagnosis AD. F lares are frequently 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 26 triggered by [CONTACT_555762], irritants, and allergens  (Bieber , 2009 ). Several  
clinical patterns, with differing distribution s of skin lesions  in distinct age groups, have been 
noted ( Weidinger, 2016 ; Weidinger, 2018).  
The infantile stage (up to 2 years of age) is characterized by [CONTACT_555763] t o 
the face, scalp, and extensor aspects of the arms and legs.  The lesions are characterized by 
[CONTACT_108135], red, ec zematous plaques, erythema, papules, vesicles, excoriations, oozing, and 
formation of crusts.   
The adult stage (from puberty onwards) is less predictable. Affected patients may have had only 
a few outbreaks since infancy, or they may have had a chronic, re lapsing course. Lesions 
frequently localize to the face and neck (head -and neck dermatitis), as well in the flexures of the 
elbows and knees, and a considerable portion of patients (around 30%) develop atopic hand 
eczema, which may interfere with workplace activities.  Like affected children, adolescents and 
adults commonly have lichenification of the flexures and have facial dermatitis.  
Patients  with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life (QoL) is significantly 
affected.  In one study, AD wa s shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health 
than diabetes and hypertension (Zuberbier, 2006 ). Patients with moderate -to-severe AD have a 
higher prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, w hich are directly related to the 
severity of the disease ( Williams, 2008 ). Depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction not only 
affect patients with AD, but also affect their caregivers  (Zuberbier, 2006 ). Compared with 
psoriasis, another common and debilitating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physical vitality, social fun ctioning, role -emotional, and mental health scores (Kiebert, 2002) .  
1.1.3. Treatment for  AD 
The therapeutic approach to AD consists primarily of trigger avoidance, skin hydration with 
bathing, and use of moisturizers and anti- inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143182] (TCS).  In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of 
symptomatic relief but does not always adequately control the disease.  In those patients who 
have persisten t moderate -to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, t he step -up 
options include topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (T CIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive 
agents such as oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatment of moderate -to-severe AD 
(nationally licensed in ma ny European countries, but not in the US), and its use is limited to 
patients ≥16  years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks. R ecently, a clinically efficacious 
and relatively safe treatment,  anti-IL-4R monoclonal antibody, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] , was approved for the 
treatment of adult and adolescent patients with  moderate -to-severe AD . In spi[INVESTIGATOR_555737], AD remains a major societa l burden and a significant unmet medical need.  
1.2. Lebrikizumab  
Lebrikizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a mutation in the hinge region that  increases stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble 
human inte rleukin (IL) -13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL -13 signaling through the 
IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. Because lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 in a non-receptor binding 
domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), a ntibody -bound 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 27 IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL -13Rα1), but the engaged receptor complex can not be 
activated.  
1.3. Study Rationale and Benefit- Risk Assessment  
1.3.1. Scientific Rationale  
The use of lebrikizumab for AD is supported by [CONTACT_555764] -13 in skin. Moreover, c linical trials 
(a Phase 2a study GS29250 [Section  [IP_ADDRESS]]  and a Phase 2b study DRM06 -AD01  
[Section  [IP_ADDRESS]])  with lebrikizumab  demonstrated significant clinical ben efit in patients with 
AD. Additional detailed discussion of  the lebrikizumab  studies  is provided in the lebrikizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Study GS29250 (TREBLE) 
Study Design 
TREBLE was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double- blind , placebo -controlled trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with 
persistent moderate to severe AD, inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_143208]. The study consisted of 
3 study periods: a run- in period (2  weeks), a tr eatment period (12 weeks), and a safety follow -up 
period (8 weeks). Patients applied emollient at least once daily and TCS of medium potency to 
all active skin lesions twice daily  through the study. A total of 212 patients were randomized  as 
follows: 53 to the leb rikizumab 250 mg, single dose group; 53 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg, 
single dose group; 52 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group; and 54 to the placebo Q4W group.  
Efficacy Results  
• EASI -50 at Week 12 (primary endpoint)  was achieved by [CONTACT_143209] 125 mg Q4W, with a treatment difference between this group and 
placebo) of  20.1% p = 0.0261). 
• Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group demonstrated statistically significant differences 
from placebo in  EASI -75 and SCORAD-50 and adjusted mean change from baseline 
to Week 12. 
Safety Results  
• Injection -site reactions occurred infrequently (1.3% all lebrikizumab treated vs. 1.9% 
placebo); all events were non-serious, lasted a median of 1 to 3 days, and did not lead 
to treatment discontinuation or interr uption. 
• Herpes viral infections and zoster occurred infrequently, but only among lebrikizumab -treated patients (6  of 156 [3.8%]); all events were non-serious, and 
none led to treatment discontinuation or dose interruption of lebrikizumab. 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 28 • Eosinophil- associ ated adverse events ( AEs) were reported infrequently, but only 
occurred among lebrikizumab- treated patients (3.2%); however, all events were 
non-serious, did not result in interruption of treatment, and there were no other 
associated clinica l symptoms noted. 
• Allergic conjunctivitis events were only reported in lebrikizumab -treated patients 
(8 of 156 patients [5.1%] vs. 0% in placebo treated patients); all events were non-
serious, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, all events recovered or resolved, 
and all patients had a history of asthma. Imbalances in allergic conjunctivitis events 
were not reported in previous lebrikizumab trials.  
• The overall incidence of skin infection (noted in the system organ class [ SOC ] of 
infections and infesta tions) was 9.6%  in all lebrikizumab arms combined, compared 
to 22% in the placebo arm. 
Conclusions  
The results of this trial suggest ed that lebrikizumab (on a background of mandatory twice daily 
TCS treatment) provided  some treatment benefit, as measured t hrough EASI and SCORAD, but 
also suggested that higher lebrikizumab dosing might provide greater clinical benefit. In addition, lebrikizumab was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with that 
observed in previous trials conducted in other indications.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Study GS29735 (ARBAN) 
Study Design 
ARBAN was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of lebrikizumab  monotherapy in adult patients (18–75 years of age) with persistent 
moderate to severe AD, who were inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_143208]. A total of 55 patients were 
randomized to treatment: 28 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W and 27 to TCS.  
Efficacy Results  
• EASI -50 was achieved by 53.6% and 51.9% of patients in the lebrikizumab and TCS 
groups, respectively, wit h a treatment difference of 1.7% . EASI -75 was achieved by 
39.3% and 37.0% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively, with a treatment difference 
of 2.3%.  
• IGA s cores of 0 or 1 were observed for 7.1% of patients in the lebrikizumab group 
and 25.9% of patients in the TCS group, giving a treatment difference of −18.8% (95% CI: −37.9%, 0.3%). 
• The percent of patients achieving SCORAD- 50 or SCORAD-75 showed treatment 
differences of − 19.3%  and −7.5% , respectively.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 29 Safety Results  
• AEs were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group 
compared with the TCS group (64.3% vs. 37.0%) ; a higher proportion of patients in 
the lebrikizumab group, compared with the TCS group, had an AE in the SOC of 
infections and infestations (42.9% vs. 25.9%). Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_555738] (14.3% vs. 3.7%).  
• The overall incidence of skin infection (in the SOC of infections and infestations) was 
17.9% in the lebrikizumab group and 7.4% in the placebo /TCS  group. 
• No serious AEs (SAEs), deaths, anaphylaxis, malignancy, protocol -defined parasitic 
or targeted intracellular infections of interest, herpes viral infections or zoster, or eosinophilia- associated AEs were reported.  
Conclusions  
Lebrikizumab was well  tolerated at the dose of 125 mg Q4W; the safety profile was generally 
consistent with previous experience with lebrikizumab in previous trials.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Dose Ranging Study DRM 06-AD01  
Study Design 
DRM06 -AD01 was a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate to 
severe AD.  A total of 280 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (in a 3:3:3:2 
ratio): 73 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 250 mg); 80 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 500 mg) ; 75 to  lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (with a loading 
dose of 500 mg given at baseline and W eek 2) ; 52 to  placebo Q2W.  
Efficacy Results  
• Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups achieved EA SI-50, EASI-75, or EASI-90 at 
Week  16 than the placebo group.  
• A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had both an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a 
≥ 2-point improvement in IGA score at Week 16 than the placebo group.  
• The lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W group had a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of patients who achieved a ≥ 4-point improvement in pruritus NRS 
compared with the placebo group. 
• Positive changes in pruritus corr elated with positive changes in sleep; the 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had statistically significant percent reductions in sleep loss due to itching compared wi th placebo (p=0.0459 and 
p=0.0062, respectively).

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 30 Safety Results  
• The incidences of conjunctivitis (2.6% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), herpes 
infections (2.2% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), and herpes zoster (0.9% all 
lebrikizumab groups, 0 pla cebo) were relatively low.  
• Three patients (1.3%) in the lebrikizumab groups and 2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo 
group had an SAE. Those reported in the lebrikizumab groups were severe chest pain 
(1 patient in the 250 mg Q2W group), femur fracture of moder ate severity (1 patient 
in the 125 mg Q4W group), and panic attack of moderate severity (1 patient in the 
250 mg Q2W group). Those reported in the placebo group were severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, severe edema peripheral, and severe pulmonar y 
embolism. All SAEs were c onsidered by [CONTACT_143210]. 
• Most AEs were considered not related to study drug; those considered related were reported for 16.2% of patients in the lebrikizumab groups and 5.8% of patients in the placebo group  
Conclusions   
This Phase 2b  study showed that higher doses of lebrikizumab provided greater clinical benefit.  
All lebrikizumab doses induced statistically significant reduction s in EASI score s compared to  
placebo , and a good dose response was observed for all primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. T he best response for all endpoints was observed with the highest lebrikizumab dose 
(250 mg Q2W), although the next highest dose (250 mg Q4W) also induced significant 
improvement in virtually a ll endpoints. All doses of lebrikizumab were well tolerated , without a 
dose response noted ; AEs were generally mild or moderate and considered unrelated to study 
drug. These results provided the bas is for dose selection for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of DRM06 -AD03  Phase 1  PK Study  
Study Design 
DRM06 -AD03 was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel -group study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) and safety of lebrikizumab in healthy adult volunteers (18 to 45 years of 
age, inclusive). A total of 41 subj ects were randomized as follows: 21 subjects received two 
1-mL (125 mg) SC injections and 20 subjects received one 2 -mL (250 mg) SC injection. The  
primary objective was to compare the PK (AUC, C
max) of the 2 lebrikizumab dosing regimens. 
Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 
85 and 99 for PK and Day 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for anti-drug antibodies (ADA).   
Pharmacokinetic Results  
For each AUC comparison (i.e., AUC last, AUC inf, and AUC 0-57d) geometric mean ratios were 
close to 1 with 90% CI s within the range of 80% to 125% , except for AUC inf, which was just 
above the upper bound, with a value of 132% . The C max geometric mean ratio was 0.89 with a 
90% CI  of 73% –108% .  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 31 Conclusions  
Both the AUC and C max results indicated similar overall exposure between the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens evaluated in this study, i.e., two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC injections versus  one 2- mL 
(250 mg) SC injection. Data from this study support the use of the 2- mL (250 mg) pre -filled 
syringe with a pre -assembled needle safety device ( PFS- NSD ) in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].  
1.4. Rationale for Dose and T reatment Regimen  
The dosing regimen  of 500 mg loading dose at baseline and Week 2, followed by 250 mg Q2W 
lebrikizumab was selected for study i n the I nduction Period  (baseline to Week 16) in this trial, 
based on an evaluation of safety, efficacy and PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 and DRM06-
AD03 trials (see above) . For the M aintenance Period in this trial, both a 250 mg lebrikizumab 
Q4W dosing regimen and a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W dosing regimen were  selected for  
explor ation , in order to determine whether both regimens , one which involves less frequent 
dosing, might be effective in maintaining disease control over an extended period of time.  
The DRM0 6-AD0 3 PK study conducted in healthy adults demonstrated that a single SC injection 
of 2- mL ( 250 mg)  of lebrikizumab delivered comparable levels of lebrikizumab as did two 1-mL 
(125 mg) SC injections. This simulated the conditions under which study drug wi ll be 
administered in Phase 3, further supporting the dose and treatment regimen for Phase 3 trials, 
lebrikizumab 250mg Q2W with a loading dose of 500mg given at Baseline and Week 2.  
Adolescent Patients  
In this  Phase 3 study, adolescent patients ( ≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) , will be included 
and will receive the same doses of lebrikizumab  described  above for adults. The justification  for 
this approach is as follows:   
Both adults and adolescent patients have similar disease characteristics, typi[INVESTIGATOR_555739] [ADDRESS_729714] similar efficacy outcomes in response to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] ( Simpson, 2018; 
Treister, 2019 ). Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations of lebrikizumab dosing (population 
PK modeling of pooled data from 2259 adult asthma patients and a subsequent external posterior 
predictive check with lebrikizumab PK data from the DRM06 -AD0 1 trial in adult AD patients) 
revealed  similar kinetics for adults and ado lescent  patients, 12 to <18 years of age. The maximal 
exposures are predicted to be slightly (≤ 35%) higher in adolescent patients than in adults for any 
given dose due to the lower adolescent weight ranges  and lebrikizumab exposure dependence on 
weight; however, the safety profile in adolescent patients, based on the exposure-response 
relationship analysis and  on partial extrapolation, is  comparable to that observed in adults.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study which is 52 weeks 
in duration. The study is designed to confirm the safety and eff icacy of lebrikizumab as 
monotherapy for moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis utilizing a 16 -week induction treatment 
period and a 36- week maintenance treatment period  (Figure 1) .  
Eligible adult and adolescent (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) patients with moderate -to-
severe AD for at least one year, defined according to the American Academy of Dermatology 
Consensus Criteria, an EASI Score of ≥16, an IGA score of ≥3 and a BSA of ≥10% will be 
enrolled.  
During the 16-week Induction Period, approximately 400 patients will be stratified and 
randomized 2:1 to either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and 
Week 2) or placebo by [CONTACT_10530] Q2W . All study drug injections will be administered in the 
clinic.  
After completion of the Week [ADDRESS_729716] responded to treatment [defined as having an IGA of 0 or 1 or a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI- 75)] will 
enter the Maintenance Period and will be re-randomized 2:2:1 to one of the following treatment 
groups: lebrikizumab [ADDRESS_729717] of d isease will be assessed using the POEM, DLQI/CDLQI, EQ -5D 
and PROMIS Anxiety and D epression measures . Patients reporting comorbid asthma at study 
entry will complete the ACQ -5.

NOTE: A woman of childbearing potential (WOCB P) is defined as a postmenarcheal 
female , who has not reached a postmenopausal state ( ≥ 12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other  than menopause) and has not undergone 
surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).  
NOTE: The following are highly effective  contraceptive methods: combined (estrogen 
and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, tra nsdermal) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine devic e (IUD), 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occl usion, vasectomized

at the Baseline visit.  The allocation to treatment will be prospectively stratified by [CONTACT_555768] (US versus EU versus rest of world), age (adolescent patients 12 to <18 years versus 
adults ≥18 years) and disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4) . At the Baseline visit (Day 1) , once a 
patient is considered eligible to participate in the study,  demographic and stratification  
information  will be entered  into the EDC  system  to receive a medication number assigning a kit 
to a patient. 
During the Maintenance Period , the EDC will be used to re- randomize a patient to a maintenance 
treatment based on the IGA or EASI score  at Week 16 . 
5.3.1. Induction Period (Day 1 to Week 16) 
Patients will be randomized 2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W: 500 mg lebrikizumab administered at Baseline and 
Week 2 (loading dose ; two PFS- NSD) and 250 mg Q2 W through Week 14  
• Placebo: 4  mL (two PFS- NSD) administered at Baseline and Week 2 and 2 mL Q2W 
through Week 14  
5.3.2. Maintenance Period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
After completion of the Week [ADDRESS_729725] responded to treatment [defined as 
having an IGA score of [ADDRESS_729726] a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI -75)] will be re -randomized 2:2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W: 250 mg lebrikizumab given every 2 weeks through Week 50 
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W: 250 mg lebrikizumab given every 4 weeks through 
Week 50 
• Placebo: placebo given every [ADDRESS_729727] 16 weeks of the study and who are re-randomized to lebrikizumab arms will receive a loading dose of lebrikizumab of either 500 mg 
given at Week 16 or 500 mg given at Weeks 16 and 18, based on the active treatment group assigned in Maintenance. To maintain study blinding, all patients re- randomized in the 
Maintenance period will receive the same number of  injections at all visits throughout the 
Maintenance Period using an appropriate combination of active and placebo injections ( Table  2).

5.4. Study B linding  
The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, study- site personnel, and the patient will be blinded to 
treatment assignment. The integrity of the clinical study will be maintained by [CONTACT_555771]. If knowledge of a patient’s treatment assignment is required for the patient’s clinical  care and/or safety, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to breaking the blind.  
5.4.1. Unblinding T reatment Assignment  
Unblinding the treatment assignment of a patient may only be pe rformed in emergencies where 
knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for management of the patient’s 
medical care. Unblinding the treatment assignment by [CONTACT_555772] a protocol violation. The investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_165555] a patient ’s treatment assignment. In the 
event of any unblinding, emergency or accidental, the sponsor must be notified within 1 business day.

the patient or their caregiver will demonstrate  for site staff proper injection technique  prior to 
beginning at-home administ ration . An instruction card  with details of the injection procedures  
will be provided to the patient/caregiver to take home, and dosing compliance will be captured 
via an electronic diary.  
Patients or caregivers who are not capable of administering study drug at home may continue to 
receive study drug injections in the clinic. 
5.6. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator must keep an accurate record of the number of cartons received, the study drug 
dispensed/used, and those returned to the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor or designee will 
provide forms to facilitate inventory control. All study- drug accountability forms and treatment 
logs must be retained in the Investigator’s permanent study file, and these records must be 
available for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_1034], its designees, or by [CONTACT_17513]. 
The study monitor will perform dr ug accountability for all study drug at the site, and will assist 
in returning all used, unused, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_143187], to the Sponsor/designees, or destroy it 
according to the study site’s standard operating procedure, if accepted by [CONTACT_1034]. 
6. CONCOMI TANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES

• Review compliance report on the eDiary and co llect eDiary  
• Measure vital signs  
• Draw blood samples for laboratory tests, PK and ADA testing  
• Collect a urine sample for urinalysis  
• Conduct urine pregnancy test ( WOCBP only)  
If the Early Termination Visit is during the Induction Period, sites collecting photos will also:  
• Obtain a photograph of the target lesion  
7.21. Safety Follow -up Visit   
Patients who terminate early from the study or do not enroll in the long- term extension study, 
DRM06 -AD07, will undergo a follow up  visit approximately [ADDRESS_729732] study drug

• Update AEs and concomitant mediations and procedures that were ongoing at study 
termination  
• Draw blood samples for PK and ADA testing. 
7.22. Unscheduled Visits  
If an unscheduled visit is necessary, the following assessments should be included in the visit 
along with any as sessments that are the reason for the visit  (e.g., blood draw for a repeat of 
abnormal lab values) : 
• Review and record AEs and update concomitant medication and procedure/therapy information  
• If the reason for the unscheduled visit is a n exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, 
complete the following assessments: IG A, BSA and EASI

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 54 8. DETAILS OF ASSESSMENT S 
8.1. Screening Assessments  
8.1.1. Demographic Information 
Patient age, gender at birth, ethnicity and race will be collected. Race and ethnic ity information 
will only be used to support sub- group analyses assessing phenotype with treatment response.  
The collection of a patient’s race and ethnicity is particularly important, given recent descriptions 
of disease heterogeneity in AD, wi th diverse phenotypes and endotypes described based on age, 
disease chronicity, ethnicity, genetics, IgE status, and underlying molecular mechanisms 
(Czarnowicki, 2019).  
8.1.2. Medical History  
A complete medical history will be collected a nd include  immunization record (for adolescent 
patients),  clinically relevant medical conditions or surgeries , including more specific information 
on a history of conjunctivitis and herpes infection/zoster. Information on the patient’s AD and 
comorbidities  (past history of asthma, allergic rhinitis,  food allergies, alopecia)  will be collected 
and include the date of onset, extent of involvement and past treatments for AD and 
comorbidities .  
8.2. Assessment of Efficacy 
Each patient’s AD will be assessed as specif ied in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. 
Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient  over the 
course of the study. The sponsor will administer training on the required efficacy assessments, detail on the spec ific instruments and training given are recorded in the study training  materials.  
8.2.1. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 
The IGA is a  static assessment and  rates the severity of the patient’s AD . The IGA is comprised 
of a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe)  and a score is selected using descriptors 
that best des cribe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point  (Table  4). It is not 
necessary that all characteristics under Morphological Description  be present. Assessors must be 
trained and certified by [CONTACT_143215]. The IGA must be conducted prior to conducting the EASI and BSA assessments. A single assessor should be assigned to each individual patient for as many  visits as possible, to avoid inter- assessor 
variability in scoring.

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 55 Table  4: Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 
Score  Grade  Definition  
0 Clear  Minor, residual discoloration; no erythema or induration/papula tion; no 
oozing/crusting; no edema.  
[ADDRESS_729733] Clear  Trace, faint pi[INVESTIGATOR_555747]/papulation and

2 Mild  Faint- pi[INVESTIGATOR_555748]/cr usting; minimal induration.  
3 Moderate  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]-red erythema with definite edema of skin papules and plaques; there may 
be some oozing/crusting; palpable induration.  
4 Severe Deep/bright red erythema with significant swelling and ob vious raised borders 
of pa pules and plaques with oozing/crusting; significant induration.  
8.2.2. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  
The EASI  is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores 
ranging from 0 to 72, with the higher values indicating more severe and /or extensive disease. 
Assessors must be trained and certified by [CONTACT_555775] t his assessment.  
8.2.3. Body Surface Area (BSA)  
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and 
is expres sed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by [CONTACT_555776] = 1% rule. Assessors must be trained and certified by [CONTACT_143218]. 
8.2.4. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORA D) 
SCORAD is a validated clinical tool for assessing the extent and intensity of atopic dermatitis. 
There are 3 components to the assessment:  
• The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with  a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the 
overall SCORAD calculation).  
• The severity of 6 specific symptom s of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, 
excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following 
scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total 
points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCO RAD calculation).  
• Subjective assessment of itch and of sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by 
[CONTACT_12906] a VAS, where 0 i s no itch (or sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_729734] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20 (assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculatio n).  
The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103.   
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 56 8.2.5. Pruritus  
Pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_137610] a Pruritus Numeric al Rating Scale (NRS). 
The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by [CONTACT_555777] 24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch imaginable .” 
Assessments will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_555778]. Data will be 
transfer red to the clinical database.  
8.2.6. Sleep -Loss  
Sleep -loss due to pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_102]. P atient s rate their sleep based on a 
5-point L ikert scale  [0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all)] . Assessments will be recorded 
daily by [CONTACT_555778]. Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
8.3. Patient Reported Outcomes and Health- Related Quality of Life 
Patient reported outcome and quality of life measures should all be completed  prior to other 
study assessments.   
8.3.1. Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)  
The POEM is a [ADDRESS_729735] week. The patient is asked to respond to 7 questions on skin dryness, itching, 
flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. All 7 answers carry equal weight with a 
total possible score from 0 to 28 (answers scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2 days = 1; 3 -4 days = 2; 
5-6 days = 3; everyday = 4). A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. POEM respons es 
will be captured using an electronic diary and transferred into the cl inical database.  
8.3.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI is a [ADDRESS_729736] of skin disease on the 
quality of life of an affected p erson. The 10 questions cover the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: symptoms, 
embarrassment, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110149], clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment, over the previous week. Questions are scored from 0 to 3, 
giving a possible total score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life). A high score is indicative of a poor quality 
of life. Patients ≤16 years will complete the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CDLQI)  and should continue to complete the CDLQI fo r the duration of the study. 
DLQI/CDLQI is completed by [CONTACT_555779].  
8.3.3. EQ-5D 
EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and 
anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient’s self -rated healt h on a vertical visual 
analogue scale. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can 
be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecti ng preferability compared to 
other health profiles. EQ-5D is completed by [CONTACT_555779].  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 57 8.3.4. PROMIS® (Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) : 
Anxiety and Depression  
PROMIS® (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information  System)  is a set of person -
centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and 
children. Pediatric and tools for anxiety and depression. Patients ≤1 7 years will complete 
pediatric versions for the duration of the study. The PROMIS measures will be completed by [CONTACT_555780].  
8.3.5. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) 
Patients who report comorbid asthma prior to enrollment will c omplete the Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-5)  in addition to other patient reported outcomes in this trial. The ACQ-5 
has been shown to reliably measure asthma control and distinguish patients with well- controlled 
asthma (score ≤0.75 points) from those with uncontrolled asthma (score ≥1.5 points). It  consists 
of 5 questions that are scored on a 7 -point Likert scale with a recall period of 1 week. The total 
ACQ- 5 score is the mean score of all questions; a lower score represents better asthma control.

AD involvement. Equipment and procedures will be outlined in a separate Photography Manual.  
8.5. Assessment of Safety  
8.5.1. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be conducted at screening and cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, abdominal, 
neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height and weight will also be 
recorded. At subsequent study visits, a symptom- directed physical examination may be 
conducted at the discretion of the Investigator. Findings will be recorded as medical history or AE in the eCRF.  
8.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including body temperatur e, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breath per minute), pulse (beats per 
minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position, after sitting for at least [ADDRESS_729738] chemistry panel (including liver- function tests), total 
cholesterol, standard urine testing, and urine pregnancy test for women who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile. Blood and urine will be collected from each patient as specified

8.5.4. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the 
Investigator and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked about AEs in a 
non-specific manner using open-ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have 
you been since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding r eported AEs will be conducted when 
applicable. All AEs will be documented and recorded in the patient’s eCRF.  
Any patient who has an AE (serious or non- serious) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_143226](s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as 
judged by [CONTACT_737]. A physician, either at the  clinical site, or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_555749]: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 59 emergency room, will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When 
appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of 
event(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting  
Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the study drug will be reported in 
the AE section of the eCRF. Events occurring prior to study treatment with the drug will be 
reported in the Medical History section of the eCRF. All AEs occurring during the study will be 
individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information 
regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will 
be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_294729] [IP_ADDRESS]. Unless an overall diagnosis is described , signs and 
symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis i s preferred.  
The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]). Severity is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (See Section [IP_ADDRESS].)  
The relationship of the AE to  the study treatment should be determined by [CONTACT_143228]:  
Not related : The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug and is most likely 
attributable to another cause. 
Related:  A causal rel ationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Int erest (AESIs)  
The following treatment emergent adverse events are being designated a dverse events of special 
interest (AESI):  
• conjunctivitis 
• herpes infection or zoster  
• parasitic infection or an infection related to an intracellular pathogen  
AESI s should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_729739] of the patient. Di scuss discontinuation of study drug 
or dose changes with the Sponsor or designee prior to implementation.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 60 [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious  Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that,  
• Results in death  
• Is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_555750] (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening, result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on appropr iate medical judgment, it 
jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post- mortem findings/reports will be requested.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of SAEs  
All SAEs, as defined in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS], regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be 
documented to the extent that information is available.  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an SAE occurring outside the specified time window 
(i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug -related, the 
event should be reported with [ADDRESS_729740] be recorded on study- specific SAE form s which will be provided to t he site. The 
minimum information required for SAE reporting includes the identity of the PI, site number, 
patient number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., 
the seriousness criteria), and PI’s assessment of th e relationship of the event to study drug. 
Additional SAE information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form. 
In all cases, the Investigat or should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be 
required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_4885]. 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 61 When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered: 
• Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be 
provided, the Investigator should report the diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term. 
• Death should not be r eported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. 
Although most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143190], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143191]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143192], or for a procedure for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be  reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143193] <24 hours and that do not require a therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral 
antibiotics).  
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criter ia for expedited reporting to relevant 
regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess the likelihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the 
current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug. 
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the s afety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical invest igation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country- specific regulat ory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IEC), and investigators.  
An invest igator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specif ic 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.5.5. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a 
trial intervention. The sponsor collects product complaints on investigational products and drug 
delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Participants will be 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_729741] Complaints  
• Product complaints that result in an adverse event will be detecte d, documented, and 
reported to the sponsor during all periods of the study in which the drug is used. 
• If the investigator learns of any product complaint at any time after a participant has been 
discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonably related to a drug provided for the study, the investigator will promptly notify the sponsor. 
Prompt Reporting of Product Complaints to Sponsor  
• Product complaints will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the complaint.  
• The Product Complaint Form will be sent to the sponsor. 
Follow- up of Product Complaints  
• Follow-up applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention. 
• The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the product 
complaint.  
• New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_41416]. 
8.5.6. Pregnancy  
The investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately regarding a pregnancy in a (1) female 
clinical trial patient  or (2) female partner of a male clinical trial patient.  
Pregnant female patient s must be withdrawn fro m study drug.  
If a female  partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by [CONTACT_143229] , the male patient  will be advised by [CONTACT_143230].   
The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clinically indicated and continue to follow the patient for ≥[ADDRESS_729742] be collected for immunogenicity 
analysis.  The Sponsor or designee should be immediately consulted, particularly  if the 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_729743] that all patients be discontinued. Patients should be scheduled for an Early Termination visit. The entire study will be stopped if:  
• Evidence has emerg ed that, in the collective opi[INVESTIGATOR_555751], or the sole opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], continuation of the study is unnecessary or unethical 
• The stated objectives of the study are achieved  
• The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug 
All data available for the patient at the time of study discontinuation must be recorded in the 
patient’s records and the eCRF.  
8.7.1. Early Termination of Study Patients  
The Investigator will make reasonable effor ts to keep each patient in the study. However, 
patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time  
• Adverse event, laboratory abnorm ality or inter -current illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in the best interest of the patient 
• Serious protocol violation, persistent non- compliance or requirement for medication 
or procedure prohibited by [CONTACT_760] 
• Lost to follow -up 
Patients who are terminated early from the study will have an Early Termination visit scheduled 
as soon as possible (see Section  7.20 ). All information, including the reason for early termination 
will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF.   
Two attempts of contact (e.g., telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of contact [CONTACT_143237] a patient’s study records for all patients who are believed to be 
lost to follow -up.

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_729744] be discontinued for patients who experience the following: 
• Inter -current  illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect 
assessments of clinical status to a significant degree 
• Treatment -related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the 
judgment of the Investigator  
• Unacceptable toxicity  
• Pregnancy 
• Use of systemic rescue medication as outlined in Sectio n 6.[ADDRESS_729745] (DSMB) comprised of members who are independent of the study sponsor and study investigators will monitor patient safety by 
[CONTACT_555781] s afety data that is blinded by [CONTACT_1570]; if 
requested, the DSMB may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested 
data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The DSMB will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The DSMB will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity o f the study 
results during the study execution. 
All activities and responsibilities of the DSMB are described in the DRM06 D SMB charter.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. General Statistical Methodology  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unle ss otherwise stated. Except where 
noted, all sta tistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of 
significance.   
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parame ters, the number and percentage of patient s in e ach category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include number of subjects  (n), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary  efficacy variables.  
The Pruritus- NRS weekly mean will be calculated as follows: The mean of each patient’s 
baseline and post- baseline Pruritus -NRS scores will be computed for each week based on the 
previous 7 days. The weekly mean will be calculated if a patien t has responses for Pruritus -NRS 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_729746] 4 of the 7 days of the week. If the patien t has 3 or fewer Pruritus -NRS responses, the 
mean value for that item will be considered missing.  All Pruritus -NRS efficacy endpoint 
analyses will be conducted on the weekly m ean. The Sleep -Loss weekly mean will be calculated 
similar to the Pruritus -NRS weekly mean.  All Sleep -Loss efficacy endpoint analyses will be 
conducted on the weekly mean. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be as follows for both binary  and 
continuous endpoints: for patients who receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_555752] (per section 6.3) , any

patient’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week  16. Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) multiple imputation will be us ed to handle the remaining missing data. MCMC 
multiple imputation for all missing values, Non -Response Imputation (NRI), Last Observati on 
Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_555753]. Details 
about missing data imputation during the maintenance will be described in the SAP. 
Demographic data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070]. Patients’ 
baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with descriptive statistics 
among treatment groups to ensure comparable results.  
The number of patient s in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal 
during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_1570]. 
A statistica l analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses  (induction and maintenance)  
will be provided as a separate document. The SAP  will be finalized prior to unblinding of the 
study treatments.  
9.1.1. Populations Analyzed 
Approximately 400 patients (includin g approximately 50 a dolescent  patients [ ≥12 to <18 years 
of age weighing ≥40 kg]) will be randomized to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W or plac ebo treatment 
groups in a 2:1 ratio. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population and the per- protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the 
safety population. All patients who are randomized will be  included in the ITT population. 
All patients who are randomized and receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug wi ll be 
included in the safety population. The PP population will include all patients in the ITT population who complete the Week 16 
evaluation without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any patient or Investigator activity 
that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the 
precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population wil l include patients in the safety 
population who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Used an interfering concomitant medication (see Section  6.3 for definitions of 
interfering concomitant medications) or underwent a prohibited procedure; 
• Did not attend the Week 16 visit; 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 66 • Missed more than one post -baseline study visit prior to Week 16; 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., patient s must receive at lea st 
75% of the expected injections of study medication during participation in the study);  
• Out of visit window at the Week 16 visit by [CONTACT_726] ±[ADDRESS_729747] of the trial that result in noteworthy s tudy protocol violations.  
9.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
For FDA:  
The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥ 2-point 
improvement from Baseline  at Week  [ADDRESS_729748] adjusted by [CONTACT_68485] (region, disease severity, age).  
For EMA:  
Both co-primary endpoints: 
• Percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 o r 1 and a reduction ≥2 points from b aseline 
to Week  16, and 
• Percentage of patients achieving EASI -75 (≥75% reduction from Baseline in EASI score) 
at Week  [ADDRESS_729749] adjusted by [CONTACT_68485] 
(region, d isease severity, age).  
9.3. Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For dichotomous secondary endpoints, the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  analysis will be used. 
For continuous secondary endpoint, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used with 
factors of treatment and rand omization strata (region, dise ase severity, age) and relevant baseline 
value.  
9.4. Missing Data  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be as follows for both binary and continuous endpoints: for patient s who receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_555752]  (per Section  6.3), 
receive systemic rescue medication or withdraw from the study due to lack of efficacy, set to the 
patient ’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week 16. MCMC multiple imputation 
will be used to handle the remaining missing da ta. Imputation will be conduct ed within each 
treatment group  independently so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group 
cannot influence missing value imputation  in another treatment group . For each  imputation 
process, 25 datasets with imp utations will be calculated. Each complete data set will be analyzed 
with the specified analysis. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC M IANALYZE.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_729750] been created. Because the MCMC algorithm  is 
based on the multivariate normal model, imputed values for IGA will not generally be one of the 
discrete values used in IGA sco ring (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). There fore, to derive the binary IGA 
response variable, standard rounding rules will be applied to the imputed values. For example, if 
a patient has an IGA score imputed as 1.4 (and assuming a Baseline IGA score of 3), the  imputed 
value would be rounded down to 1, and the minimum change from Baseline of [ADDRESS_729751] 75% was achieved. 
For derivation of the following Pruritus-NRS responses, no rounding will be performed. The 
imputed Pruritus -NRS value will b e compared directly to the observed mean baseline Pruritus -
NRS value to determine whether the response was achieved:  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4- points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 4  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percen tage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 1  
Imputation of continuous data will parallel that of binary variables. The imputed values will be 
used for the following secondary endpoints:  
• Percentage change in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score from Baseline to Week  16 
• Percentage change in EASI score from  Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_729752] b een pre-specified by a random- number generator:

9.5. Sensitivity Analyses 
9.5.1. All Missing Values MCMC Multiple Imputation  
In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed values as collected for visits 
subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed 
using MCMC multiple imputation  for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2-point 
improvement from Baseline at Week 16  and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75 
(EMA  co-primary endpoint) , EASI -90 at Week 16  and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥[ADDRESS_729755] Observation Carried Forwar d (LOCF)  
In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed  values as collected for visits 
subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed 
using LOCF for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥ 2-point improvement from 
Baseline at Week  16 and the following secondary  endpoints: EASI-75 (EMA co -primary 
endpoint), EASI -90 at Week 16 and Pruritus -NRS Improvement ≥4 points, at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 16.  
9.5.3. Non-Response Impu tation  
In this  set of sensitivity analysis, for patients who receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_555752] ( per 
Section  6.3), receive systemic rescue medication , withdraw from the study due to lack of 
efficacy  and any other missing values, set to non-response su bsequent to this time through Week 
16 for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16 
and the following secondary endpoints: EASI- 75, EASI -90 and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥[ADDRESS_729756] of rescue medication and missing data due to dropout, the rates of response and non-
response (including rescue medication use and dropout) will be varied to assess the response 
rates that tip significant differences to  non-significance. The primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 
1 and a ≥2-point improvement from Baseline at Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: 
EASI -75 (EMA co -primary endpoint) , EASI -90 at Week 16  and Pruritus -NRS improvement 
≥4-points, at Week s 1, 2, 4 and 16 will be assessed using the tippi [INVESTIGATOR_18275].  
More details about missing value imputation analysis will be described in the SAP. 
9.5.5. Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the following subgroups: 
Adolescents (Age 12 to <18 years) vs. Adults (Age ≥18 years), sex, race, baseline IGA score (3 or 4), region ( US, Europe, Rest of the World). Subgroup analysis will be conducted on the 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 69 primary endpoint of IGA (0,1), EASI -75, EASI-90 and percent of patients with pruritus 
improvement ≥4 points, all at W eek 16.  
Sensitivity analyses will be addressed in a full statistical analysis plan.  
9.6. Multiplicity  Considerations 
The prespecified graphical multiple testing approach  (Bretz  2011) will be implemented to control 
the overall Type I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 for superiority tests for the hypotheses for 
the primary and major secondary endpoints. The graphical approach is a closed testing 
procedure; hence it strongly controls the family -wise error rate across all endpoints 
(Alosh  2014 ). The major secondary endpoints will be pre- specified in the SAP prior to first 
unblinded efficacy  analysis.  
FDA objectives:  
The graphical testing scheme will test IGA (0,1) first before proceeding to test the major  
secondary endpoints. Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelationships, Type I error allocation for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated 
propagation) will be pre -specified in the SAPs prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis. 
EMA objectives:  
The Week 16 endpoints of IGA (0,1) and EASI -[ADDRESS_729757] IGA (0,1) first, followed by [CONTACT_117942]-[ADDRESS_729758] the major secondary endpoints during induction period. Details of the specific 
graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelationships, Type I error allocation for 
the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre -specified in the SAPs 
prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis. A separate graphical approach may be employed for 
testing the maintenance period endpoints. 
9.7. PK Analysis  
Plasma concentration data will be tabulated and summarized (geometric mean, arithmetic mean, minimum, maximum, SD, and % coefficient of variation) by [CONTACT_143242].   
It is intended that data from this study will be combined with data from other studies to better 
characterize the PK of DRM06, as well as to expl ore the relationship between exposure and 
efficacy and/or safety outcomes. Further details on PK and PK/PD analyses will be provided in 
the PK/PD analysis plan. The results of these analyses will be described in a separate PK/PD 
report.  
9.8. Anti -Drug Antibody Data Analysis  
The ADA variables will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Drug concentration data will be examined and the influence of ADAs on individual concentration- time profile s will be evaluated. 
Assessment of impact of ADA on safety and efficacy may be provided. 
9.9. Immunogenicity Data Analysis 
Listings and appropriate summary statistics will be provided for immunogenicity data. 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 70 9.10. Exposure and Compliance  
The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by [CONTACT_555782], total number of injections, number of missed injections, and 
number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An injection is considered the full set of injections  specified by [CONTACT_194711] a given treatment.  
A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected number of injections while enrolled in the study. 
9.11. Adverse Events 
All AEs occurring during the stu dy will be recorded and coded using the MedDRA dictionary. 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset date on or after the date of 
the first injection of study drug. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], including the 
number of patients reporting an event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship 
to study drug, and seriousness for the safety population. All serious AEs as well as AEs that led to study discontinuation will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  
Three sets of AE t abulations are anticipated, one for the initial period, one for the m aintenance 
period, and one for the combined initial and maintenance period. The denominator used for the treatment period will correspond to the number of patients in the safety population.  
9.12. Other Safety Data 
Laboratory data will be presented in a by [CONTACT_555783]. Any clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities will be captured as AEs. Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory values will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_555784]-up evaluation during the treatment period using 
descriptive statistics or frequency tables as applicable. Additionally, changes from Baseline in 
safety laboratory values will be summarized using shift tables according to normal ranges.  
Vital signs will be presented by [CONTACT_555785].  
Medical histories will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and presented in a by- patient 
listing. Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO-Drug dictionary. Concomitant medications will be summarized by t reatment, drug class, and preferred term. Physical 
examination data will be presented in a by -patient listing. Growth monitoring of adolescents will 
be summarized.  
9.13. Sample -Size Determination  
For FDA:  
In the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non- response sensitivity analysis was 
approximately 34.7% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 7.7% f or placebo. A sample size of 
[ADDRESS_729759] more than 95% power to 
detect a statistically significant difference with a significance level  of .05. However, to ensure 
sufficient safety information is collected  and to ensure sufficient responders for the M aintenance

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 71 Period , the sample si ze will be increased to  approximately  400 in total with a randomization ratio 
of 2:1 lebrikizumab:placebo.  
For EMA:  
In the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 
0 or 1 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non- response sensitivity analysis was 
approximately 34.7% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 7.7% for placebo, and the proportion of patients who achieved an EASI75 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non-response sensitivity analysis was approximately 48.0% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 
11.5% for placebo.  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_729760] more than 95% power to detect a statistic ally significant difference with a significance level  of .[ADDRESS_729761] 90%. 
However, to ensure sufficient safety information is collected and to ensure sufficient responders for the Maintenance Period , the sample size will be increased to approximately 400 in total with 
a randomization ratio of 2:1 lebrikizumab:placebo.  
9.14. Interim Analyses  
The first database lock and unblinding will occur, and the interim analysis will be performed at 
the ti me (that is, a cut- off date) th e last patient completes Week 16 or the early termination visit 
from Study DRM06 -AD0 5. This database lock will include all data collected by [CONTACT_18681] -off 
date.  Only the induction treatment assignment will be unblinded at the time of this interim lock. 
Maint enance treatment assignment will remain blinded.  
The second database lock and unblinding will occur, and the interim analysis including the 
maintenance period will be performed at the time (that is, a cut- off date) the last patient 
completes Week  [ADDRESS_729762] 
either completed the follow -up period of Study DRM06 -AD0 5, or discontinued the Study early, 
or entered the long- term extension Study DRM06 -AD07.

CONSENSUS CRITERIA FOR CHRONIC ATOPIC 
DERMATITIS  
Atop ic dermatitis: Diagnosis recommendations  
Patients with presumed atopic dermatitis should have their diagnosis based on the criteria 
summarized below. On occasion, skin biopsy specimens or other tests (such as serum 
immunoglobulin E, potassium hydroxide preparation, patch testing, and/or genetic t esting) may 
be helpful to rule out other or associated skin conditions.  
Level of Evidence: III Strength of Recommendation: C 
Essential features — must be present: 
• Pruritus  
• Eczema (acute, subacute, chronic)  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_555757]* 
• Chronic or relapsing history 
*Patterns include:  
• Facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children 
• Current or previous flexural lesions in any age group 
• Sparing of the groin and axillary regions 
Important features — seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis: 
• Early age of onset  
• Atopy 
• Personal and/or family history  
• Immunoglobulin E reactivity  
• Xerosis  
Associated features — These clinical associations help to suggest the diagnosis of atopic 
dermatitis  but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting atopic dermatitis for 
research and epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820]:  
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_73263] (eg facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch 
response)  
• Keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785]/ pi[INVESTIGATOR_80166]/ hyperlinear palms/ icthyosis 
• Ocular/periorbital changes 
• Perifollicular accentuation/ lichenification/prurigo lesions 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD05 -A2/ J2T-DM-KGAC  -A2 Lebrikizumab  
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 83 Exclusionary conditions — It should be noted that a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis depends on 
excluding conditions, such as: 
• Scabies  
• Seborrheic d ermatitis  
• Contact [CONTACT_8748] (irritant or allergic)  
• Icthyoses 
• Cutaneous T- cell lymphoma  
• Psoriasis  
• Photosensitivity dermatoses 
• Immune deficiency diseases  
• Erythroderma of other causes

CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 42 1. Introduction and Rationale  
Intracranial aneurysms are a signif icant health problem in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe 
with an incidence rate as high as 6% [1 -3]. If an intracranial aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks 
into the highly sensitive subarachnoid space around the brain, resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The annual risk of rupture of an intact intracranial aneurysm is estimated to be approximately 1.9% [4].  Of all SAH incidences, 85% are attributed to ruptured aneurysms [5] and approximate ly half of all ruptured aneurysms are fatal within 
the first six months [6] . Patients who survive the initial SAH are at significant risk of 
subsequent re -rupture as well.  Various reports indicate that if left untreated, there is a re -
bleeding rate of more than 50% within the first six months from initial presentation of a SAH [4]. In addition, permanent disability is reported to occur in 50% of patient’s that 
survive a SAH and only one- third of patient’s will have a positive outcome [7]. 
Neurosurgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_204493] (IA) prior to the introduction of alternative endovascular treatment options. The International 
Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) was a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial that compared the safety and efficacy of endovascular coiling compared to neurosurgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The ISAT Trial enrolled 2143 subjects with ruptured IA and randomized them to endovascular detachable coil (n=1073) treatment or standard neurosurgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (n=1070) [8]. The primary endpoint was the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 3- 6 
(dependency or death) at one year. The clinical follow -up included assessment for 
rebleedin g and death at 2 months and at one year. An interim analysis was conducted per 
the trial’s steering committee and recruitment was stopped. The outcomes showed a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in favor of the endovascular coiling arm (P=0.0019). Of the 801 subjects treated with endovascular coiling, 190 (23.7%) 
achieved an mRS of 3 -6 at one year. Of the 793 subjects treated with neurosurgical 
clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 243 (30.6%) achieved an mRS of 3- 6. The absolute risk reduction of depende ncy 
or death at one year was 6.9% (95% CI 2.5- 11.3) and the relative risk reduction was 22.6% 
(95% CI 8.9- 34.2) in favor of the endovascular coil arm. The risk of rebleeding from the 
ruptured aneurysm at one year was [ADDRESS_244006] initial study 
procedure [9]. The mRS was collected annually from self -reported questio nnaires and data 
on rebleeding and recurrent aneurysms were also collected by [CONTACT_204508]. The rate of death was obtained from data provided by [CONTACT_204509]. At a 10 -year follow -up, 1003 subjects (n=435 coiling and n=370 clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) had 
returned questionnaires and survival was higher for subjects that were initially treated with 
coiling (82%) compared to the surgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_204494] (78%). Furthermore, subjects from 
the endovascular coiling arm were more likely to be al ive and independent at 10 years 
compared to subjects from the clippi[INVESTIGATOR_204494] (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07- 1.67). The durability 
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_244007] selects, such as patient risk 
factors, rupture status, aneurysm neck diameter  and width, a s well as cerebral vessel 
location [10]. Current treatment options include bare metal coiling, stent assisted coiling, 
balloon assisted coiling, bioactive -hydrocoils, surgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], flow diverters, and more 
recently, intrasaccular devices. Over the past decade, endovascular coiling has now been 
widely accepted for the treatment of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms [9 -17]. Coils 
that are considered to have ‘stiff’ properties are typi[INVESTIGATOR_204495], while softer coils are more effective to complete the packing of 
residual empty spaces with ‘finishing’ coils. Finishing coils are beneficial  to use at the end 
of the aneurysm packing process, because they are designed to fill -in the empty spaces to 
tighten the packing [18-21]. Earlier studies on coils demonstrated that there was a 
correlation between packing density and rates of recanalization [18, 20, 21]. Finishing coils were initially bare -metal, but the development of polymer or gel -coated coils have become 
available. T he Hydrosoft and Hydroframe finishing coils (Microvention, Tustin, CA) were 
developed with a gel that expands when in contact [CONTACT_204510][22].  
The HELPS Trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing Hydrocoils to bare platinum 
coils and initial results showed a significantly higher rate of adverse outcomes in the bare platinum coil arm [23-25]. A subgroup analysis of the HELPS Trial further demonstrated 
that hydrocoils were associated with statistically significant lower rates of major recurrence for subgroups with recently ruptured aneurysms and medium -sized aneurysms[26 -28]. 
There have been varying results pub lished for hydrogel coils in the HELPS, PRET, and 
MAPS trials, but the recent results from the GREAT randomized trial showed favorable outcomes for the hydrogel coil arm [22]. The GREAT Trial enrolled 513 patients (hydrogel=256 and bare platinum=257 patients) in [LOCATION_009] and [LOCATION_013]. The investigators suggested that the significantly higher packing density observed in the hydrogel arm translated to better long -term angiographic results and lower retreatment rates.  
The Hydrogel Endovascular Aneurysm Treatment Trial (HEAT) was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that evaluated the second- generation HydroCoil Embolic 
System (HES) c ompared to bare -platinum coils (BPC) for the treatment of intracranial 
aneurysms [29]. The primary endpoint was aneurysms recurrence over 24 months (defined 
by [CONTACT_204511]). There were six hundred subjects enrolled at 46 sites with ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysms randomized to both arms (n=297 HES and n=303 BPC). The HES arm was superior to bare platinum coils at reducing the aneurysm recurrence rate. The recanalization rate was 4.4% for HES compared to 15.4%  for BPC 
and no significant differences in adverse event rates.  
An analysis of other coils available (Target Ultra Helical, MicroPlex Hypersoft, Axium Helix, ED Coil Extrasoft, and DeltaPlush) were evaluated by [CONTACT_204512]. for area, perimeter, and circulari ty in an experimental model [30].  The authors suggested that Target Ultra 
Helical and MicrPlex may be more suitable for early procedure; Axium Helix and E D Coil 
Extrasoft for mid -procedure; and Deltaplush was better suited for finishing [30]. Therefore, 
coils with varying properties at different procedure t imes and stages may be beneficial.  
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 42 Penumbra, Inc. (Alameda, CA) has developed the Penumbra SMART  COIL® System to 
address the limitations of conventional embolization coil systems . SMART COIL is unique 
from other microcoils, because they do not have uniform  stiffness, they have a tight 
conformational structure, and they have a robust stretch -resistance platform [3 2]. The 
SMART COIL system offers softer coil technology including the WAVE™ Extra Soft coil 
designed for filling and finishing. Penumbra SMART COIL  System has been evaluated in 
multiple publications [3 1-38]. 
A multicenter retrospective review was performed  by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_204496]. [31, 35] to capture data 
on all patients treated with at least one  SMART Coil as part of an endovascular intracranial  
aneurysm (IA) embolization between July 2015 to January 2016. Fifty -nine p atients 
underwent treatment for IAs  with SMART Coils (44% were ruptured aneurysms). The 
mean aneurysm size was 5.9 ± 2 mm by 4.5 ± 2 mm. More th an half (54.2%) of the patients 
underwent coiling with SMART Coils alone; the remainder used either framing  or finishing 
coils of another type. About one -third (3 3.9%) of patients underwent balloon -assisted 
coiling, and  47.5% underwent stent -assisted coiling. Raymond I or II occlusion was 
achieved in 71.2%  of patients . There were no device malfunctions or rebleeds observed. 
Six patients experienced a minor complica tion without clinical sequelae. Occlusion 
outcomes included 33.9% Class I , 37.3%  Class II , and 28.8%. No rebleeds have been 
observed. The authors concluded that the SMART coil progressive design offered 
appreciable clinical advantages during deployment  and demonstrated satisfactory safety 
and efficacy outcomes in treatment of a wide variety aneurysms, both ruptured and unruptured [31].  
Another retrospective study was performed by [CONTACT_204513]. to analyze baseline and initial 
outcomes data on consecutive patients treated by [CONTACT_204514] 2016 to 
January 2017. Thirty -two patients with 33 aneurysms were included in the study; 15.2% 
presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mean aneurysm diameter was 6.0 ± 2.5 mm, with 85% in the anterior circulation. Dome  irregularity an d fusiform aneurysm morphology 
were noted in 33% and 9% of aneurysms , respectively. Coiling was performed exclusively 
with SMART coils in 30 (90.9%) cases. Single - and dual -microcatheter techniques were 
utilized in 16 (48.5%) and one (3.0%) case, respectively. Balloon - and stent -assistance 
were used in three (9.1%) and 11 (33.3%) cases, respectively. T he mean packing density 
was 25.2%. Raymond I or II occlusion was achieved in 75.8% of patients. No serious 
procedural complications were observed, and one device malfunction occurred in a patient with a wide -necked aneurysm  (3.0%).  The authors concluded that initial results showed a 
favorable risk to benefit profile of the SMART coil f or the embolization of IAs [36]. 
Padmanadhan (2017) reported on a retrospective analysis of 75 consecutive patients treated in a single center for cerebral aneurysms with the SMART coil system [3 3]. There were 20 
aneurysms treated exclusively  with the SMART coil and 58 were treated with a 
combination of coils; 252 SMART coils were used ([ADDRESS_244008], 27 S oft, and 212 
ExtraSoft coils). Adjunctive devices were used in 57 cases (41 balloons and 16  stents). The 
results showed that no coil migration, coil stretching, premature detachment, or failure of coil detachment occurred with the SMART coils and three coils were retrieved and not detached. One event of intra -procedural rupture (controlled with balloon inflation) and 3 
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 42 cases of intra- procedural thrombosis treated with IV Absciximab occurred. There three 
patient deaths of presenting subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of delayed procedure related mortality (remote hemorrhage in stent assisted coiling case). The author reported that there was no change in the baseline modified Rankin score (mRS) for the remaining patients. In addition, the 6- month follow -up was available in 39/75 patients and showed 
complete aneurysm occlusion with no remnants in 32 patients and small neck remnants in 7 patients (under observation).The author concluded that the SMART (Penumbra, Inc.) coil system was safe, easy to use, and effective especially in the treatment of otherwise difficult to treat very small intracranial a neurysms [33]. 
A retrospective cohort study was recently completed by [CONTACT_204515]. is to assess the angiographic outcomes at interim follow -up after aneurysm embolization with SMART 
coils  between June [ADDRESS_244009] 2017 [38]. Baseline data and follow-up angiographic 
outcomes using the modified Raymond- Roy classification (MRRC) were reported from 33 
patients with 34 aneurysms . The i nitial mean coil packing density was 26 %, and the initial 
MRRC was I, II, IIIa, and IIIb in 24%, 26%, 35%, and 15%, respectively. The overall complication rate was 12%. At last follow -up (mean duration 7.7 ± 3.2 months), the 
retreatment rate was 14.7%,  the MRRC was I, II, IIIa, and IIIb in 62%,  26%, 3%, and 9%, 
respectively. The authors reported that the majority of residual aneurysms after the initial embolization procedure w ould progress to complete or near -complete occlusion at interim 
follow-up [38]. In conclusion, they reported that the SMART coil wa s efficacious for the 
treatment of appropriately selected an eurysms and had an acceptable risk profile.  
The SMART Registry is a prospective, multicenter registry sponsored by [CONTACT_204516], Inc. 
to assess the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and other neurovascular abnormalities. For eligibility, the intervention must have implant ed at least 75% SMART  COIL , 
Penumbra Coil  400
TM, and or Penumbra Occlusion Device ( POD®) (Penumbra, Inc.) . 
Study endpoints include d retreatment through one -year follow -up, procedural device -
related serious  adverse events (SAE), occlusion status at immediate post -procedure, and at 
one-year follow-up. 
The interim analysis from the first 500 consecutive subjects enrolled include d cerebral 
aneurysms (90.6%, 451/498), of which 31.0% were ruptured; arteriovenous malformations 
(1.4%); fistulae (4.6%); and other lesions (3.4%) [39]. At admission , 70.8% of subjects 
were female, and the mean age was 60.0 ± 13.3 years.  Aneurysms were small (87.7%), 
large (12.1 %), and giant (0.2%), with 64.2% (265/413) having a wide neck. 
The median time of fluoroscopic exposure wa s 36.5 minutes (IQR 24.0-56.0). Stent -
assisted coiling was performed in 29.8%  of patients , whereas balloon- assisted coiling was 
performed in 19.4% of patients . For all aneurysms , the median packing density was 29.5% 
(IQR 21.4-38.3). For all subjects, adequate occlusion at immediate post -procedure was 
achieved for 97.6% (483/495). In aneurysm subjects, Raymond I or II was achieved in 
79.7% (354/ 444) of patients at immediate post -procedure, and 88.6% (124/140) at one -
year follow-up. The retreatment rate through one-year follow-up was 3.8% (6/157).  
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 42 2.2 Detachment Pusher 
The detachment pusher is a stainless steel and polymer 185 cm wire- like assembly 
used to advance and detach the coil at the target location. The coil is loaded onto the distal end of the detachment pusher via mechanical attachment to the distal detachment tip. The coil is detached from the pusher by [CONTACT_204517]. The coil/detachment pusher assembly is provided sterile and is a single use device.  
2.3 Detachment Handle  
The SMART COIL  Detachment Handle is a plastic handle used to mechanically 
detach  the Coil. The Detachment Handle is provided sterile and is intended for use in 
multiple coil detachments performed during a single procedure. 
2.4 Indications  
The Penumbra SMART COIL  System is indicated for the embolization of: 
• Intracranial aneurysms  
• Other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations  
and arteriovenous fistulae 
• Arterial and venous embolizations in the peripheral vasculature 
Embolization coils perform their intended function by [CONTACT_204518]. Achievement of aneurysmal occlusion is based on volume 
filling of the aneurysm, causing blood flow diversion from the aneurysmal sac to the parent artery, leading to secondary clot formation and organization within the target location. 
The Penumbra SM ART COIL  System originally received the CE Mark in December 
2014, FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2015, and Health Canada approval in October 
2015.

7.6 Reporting  
The investigator will be respons ible for reporting the following: 
7.6.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AE)  must be recorded by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator on the CRFs and will be 
monitored during the study. Only a dverse events related to the procedure or device, 
and all SAEs will be collected starting at procedure through discharge for enrolled 
subjects. After discharge only neurological SAEs will be collected. Additional 
information for Symptomatic  Intracranial Hemorrhage and Ischemic Stroke will be 
collected on Event of Interest CRFs.  
Minimum requirements of data to be recorded are: Adverse event term , event start 
date, seriousness, action taken, outcome and procedure /  device- relatedness or 
causality.   
In order to ensure prompt reporting of AEs, a ll reportable AEs (as well as all related 
study data) are required to be entered i nto the EDC in a timely manner . Any 
suspected UADEs should be reported immediately by [CONTACT_204523] S ponsor . All 
device related SAEs should be reported in the EDC within [ADDRESS_244020] report adverse event s to the IRB/EC according to local 
requirements. The investigator is responsible for reporting time frames and 
complying with local or national requirements.  In addition, the investigator will 
report to the sponsor and IRB/EC any device deficiencies that could have led to a 
SAE, if required by [CONTACT_204524].  
For the purpose of reporting within this protocol, pre -existing conditions or planned 
procedures for pre -existing conditions are not report able as AEs unless there is 
worsening of the condition with an increase in severity or frequency during the course of the st udy. All deaths will  be reported regardless of causality. When 
reporting a death, the primary condition or diagnosis that contributed to the fatal 
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 42 outcome should be reported as a SAE with an outcome of death. Only a single cause 
of death should be reported in EDC. If the cause of death is unknown, repor t 
“unknown cause of death” as a SAE.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_244021] related to Symptomatic 
Intracrania l Hemorrhage and Ischemic Stroke will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_35011]. Redacted source documents may be collected for events where the medical 
monitor deem necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions 
• Adverse Event (AE) : any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the study medical device. 
• Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  An adverse event  related to the use of 
the study medical device.  
• Definition of SAE  
An SAE is an event that:  
o Led to death  
o Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the patient that: 
− Resulted in life -threatening illness or injury  
− Resulted in chronic disease  
− Resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or a 
body function  
− Required in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967]  
− Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to arrest 
permanent impairment to body structure or a body function  
− Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality 
or birth defect 
 
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE):  An unanticipated 
adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol , or instructions 
for use . Unanticipated adverse device effect also includes any ot her 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
  
CLP [ZIP_CODE]. C CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 42 [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to the Study Device  
An AE is considered to be device -related when it is reasonable to believe that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_204525]. The f ollowing 
definitions will be used to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study device. G rading for relatedness of ‘probable’ or ‘definite’ will be 
considered device related.  
• Definite :  The temporal sequence is relevant and the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal, or reappearance of the event on repeat device application  
• Probable:   The temporal sequence is relevant or the AE abates upon 
device application completion /removal or the AE cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s condition or comorbidities.  The AE is related 
or most likely associated with the device  
• Possible:  The temporal sequence between the device and the AE is such 
that the relationship is not u nlikely or there is no contradicting evidence 
that can reasonably explain the subject’s condition.  There is a possibility 
of a relationship between the AE and the device 
• Unrelated:   The AE is not associated with the device.   There is no relation 
between t he AE and the device 
Similar grading will be used for assessing the relationship to index procedure , 
target aneurysm, and comorbidities.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_244022] led to a serious adverse 
event if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention has not be made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Device manufacturers are required to report qualifying medical device incidents to the relevant national competent authorities. An incident is defined as “any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well  as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly 
or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.” A deterioration in state of health is not consi dered unanticipated if the condition leading to the event was considered in a 
risk analysis.

 1 Overview  
SURF is a  postmarket, real -world, prospective, multicenter  single -arm study . Its objective is  to 
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the  Penumbra SMART  COIL® System, including the 
WAVE™ Extra Soft Coils  (WAVE) as a fill and finish coil, in the treatment of intracranial 
aneurysms.  An independent core lab will read images to assess aneurysm  occlusion rates , 
facilitating an analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of MRA imaging to detect residual 
aneurysm blood flow at final follow- up as compared to DSA  (Section 8.3  of this document ). 
Approximately 800 patients will enroll  at up to 60 global sites . Each site will be limited  to a 
maximum enrollment of 120  patients (15% of total enrollment) . An estimated 10% of  enrolled  
patients will experience attrition by [CONTACT_204532] -up. 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) elaborates on statistical methods outlined in the study 
protocol and presents  analysis conventions. The SAP will be signed off prior to  database lock.

 3 Interim Analysis  
As there will be n o interim analyses for the purpose of terminating the study  early  for success or 
futility , alpha adjustments will not be made to the confidence intervals  in the final analysis.  
However, i nterim analysis may be performed for the purpose of  publication  or regulatory 
submission  of SURF  results . 
4 Analysis Populations  
4.1 Definitions  
The following analysis  population definitions apply to this study:  
• Screened : All patient s considered for participation in the study, whether  or not they sign 
informed consent.  
• Screen Failure:  All screened patient s who  failed to meet inclusion criteria or met 
exclusion criteria. Patients can be screen failed for general or procedure criteria.  
• Enrolled:  All eligible  patients who obtained informed consent, completed the index 
procedure, and have inclusion -exclusion criteria  confirmed.  
• Intent -to-Treat  (ITT) : All enrolled patients. The primary analysis , including all 
effectiveness, safety, and subgroup reporting,  will be run on this population.  
• Completed:  All enrolled patient s who completed the study  follow- up or were known to 
have died prior to the follow -up. 
5 Statistical Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics : N, Mean 
(SD), Median [IQR] , Range (Min, Max) . Categorical variables will be summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages of patients within each category. Confidence intervals will be 
reported for the following analyses  only: effectiveness, safety, sensitivity, and change from 
baseline. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals  will be reported using asymptotic intervals for 
continuous variables and Wald normal approximation binomial proportion intervals for 
categorical variables.

 6 Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics , including demographics , clinical characteristics, and angiographic 
characteristics, w ill be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables  and 
using frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables.  
7 Patient  Disposition  
To summarize patient disposition outcomes, t he number of patient s in the following analysis 
populations will be recorded:  
 
● Screen Failure  
● Enrolled  
● Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  
● Completed  
The number of patients who do not complete the study will be reported as well, broken down by

8 Effectiveness  Analysis  
8.1 Primary  Effectiveness  Analysis  
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, f requency counts, percentages, and two- sided 95% 
Wald confidence intervals will be reported  using the ITT population:

follow -up: The percentage of patients  assessed as Raymond- Roy Class I or II out of 
patients who had  a Raymond- Roy evaluation done  (Class I, II, or III)  at the  time of  final 
follow- up. Retreatments at final follow -up will be modelled as Raymond- Roy Class III.  
The core lab data supersede the investigator -reported data in primary and secondary 
effectiveness analyses . 
6 
 8.2 Secondary Effectiveness  Analysis  
For the secondary effectiveness endpoints, f requency counts , percentages , and two -sided 95% 
Wald confidence interval s will be reported  using the ITT population:

assessed as each of Raymond- Roy Class I, Class II, and Class III out of patients who 
had a Raymond- Roy evaluation done (Class I, II, or III) at immediate post -procedure.  
• Retreatment rate at final follow -up: The percentage of patients who had the target 
aneurysm retreated since the index procedure out of patients who have data on this 
question (Retreatment, No Retreatment) at the time of final follow- up. Staged 
procedures are not retreatments for the purposes of running all SURF study analyses.   
• Aneurysm Occlusion Raymond I post treatment : The percentage of patients 
assessed as Raymond- Roy Class I out of patients who had a Raymond- Roy evaluation 
done (Class I, II, or III) at immediate post -procedure.  
• Aneurysm Occlusion Raymond I at final follow -up: The percentage of patients 
assessed as Raymond- Roy Class I out of patients who had a Raymond- Roy evaluation 
done (Class I, II, or III) at the time of final follow -up. Retreatments at final follow -up will 
be modelled as Raymond- Roy Class III.  
• Aneurysm recanalization or progressive thrombosis from post procedure to final 
follow -up: The percentage of patients who experienced  a deterioration in Raymond- Roy 
Occlusion Grading ( aneurysm recanalization; Class I becoming II or III, or Class II 
becoming III)  or improvement in Raymond- Roy occlusion ( progressive thrombosis; Class 
II becoming I, or Class III becoming I or II)  out of patients who had a Raymond- Roy 
evaluation done at both time points . Retreatments at final follow -up will be modelled as 
aneurysm recanalization.  
The effectiveness endpoints will be  reported  using only the Raymond -Roy Occlusion Grading 
Scale . However, f requency counts, percentages , and two -sided 95% Wald confidence intervals 
will also be provided  for the Meyers Consensus Grading Scale  Grades 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_244041] residual aneurysm blood flow at final follow -up 
as compared to DSA scans,  based on sensitivity, specificity, and related summary measures . 
For each of Raymond- Roy Class II to III (any residual flow), Class II (residual neck), and Class 
III (residual aneurysm)  at the time of final follow -up, the following statistics will be reported using 
the ITT population and core lab data:  
• Sensitivity:  The proportion of true positives (patients belonging to  each of the three 
Raymond- Roy groups above on DSA ) that are correctly identified as such on MRA as 
well. The percentage s of patients assessed as each of Raymond -Roy (1) Class II to III, 
(2) Class II, and (3) Class III on MRA and DSA out of patients with th e same Raymond -
Roy group assessed  on DSA at the time of final follow -up will be computed . 
• Specificity:  The proportion of true negatives (patients not belonging to each of the three 
Raymond- Roy groups above on DSA ) that are correctly identified as such on MRA as 
well. The percentages of patients assessed as each of Raymond- Roy (1) Class I, (2) 
Class I or Class III, and (3) Class I to  II on MRA and DSA out of patients with th e same 
Raymond- Roy group assessed on DSA at the time of final follow -up will be computed . 
• Positive likelihood ratio (LR):  Sensitivity divided by (1 -  Specificity) . 
• Negative likelihood ratio (LR):  (1 - Sensitivity) divided by [CONTACT_204534] . 
• Cohen’s κ:  Summary measure of agreement between DSA and MRA in detecting each 
of Raymond -Roy Class II and III, Class II, and Class III .

confidence interval s will be reported using the ITT population:  
• SAEs up to [ADDRESS_244046] -procedure : The percentage of patients  who experience 
serious adverse event (s) with start date on the date of procedure  (day 0)  or the next 
calendar day . 
• Device- related SAE up to 7 days or discharge:  The percentage of  patients who 
experience serious adverse event (s) with probable or definite relationship to the SMART 
Coil System from the date of procedure (day 0) through the date of discharge or seven 
calendar days from the date of procedure, whichever occurs earlier . 
10.2  Secondary Safety Analysis  
For the secondary safety endpoints,  frequency counts , percentages , and two -sided 95% Wald 
confidence interval s will be reported  using the ITT population:  
• Major ipsilateral stroke:  The percentage of  patients who experience major ipsilateral 
stroke adverse event (s), as defined in the SURF study protocol . 
• Device related SAE at final follow -up: The percentage of  patients who experience 
serious adverse event (s) with probable or definite relationships to the SMART Coil 
System from the date of procedure  (day 0)  through the final follow -up visit at 1 Year ± 90 
Days  from the date of procedure.  
• All-cause morbidity and mortality : The percentage of  patients who experience either  
of the following events:  
o All-cause morbidity:  mRS 3 to 5 at the final follow -up evaluation or worsening 
of mRS by 2+ points the date of procedure (day 0) through the final follow -up visit 
at 1 Year ± 90 Days from the date of procedure.  If the final follow- up mRS is 
missing, mRS as assessed at the 7 -day and/or discharge visit will be  substituted . 
o All-cause mortality:  Death for any reason from the date of procedure (day 0) 
through calendar day 365  
Adverse events occurring after the final follow -up visit at 1 Year ± 90 Days  and deaths occurring 
after day 365 will be separately tabulated and not included in endpoint and adverse event rates.  
10 
 10.3  Analysis of Adverse Events  
In the SURF study, only device- related or procedure- related adverse events  and serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) will be collected from  procedure through discharge. After discharge,  only 
neurological SAEs will be collected. Additional information for Symptomatic Intracranial 
Hemorrhage and Ischemic Stroke will be  collected on Event of Interest case report forms . 
Frequency counts  and percentages  will be provided for all reportable adverse events and 
broken down as well based on relationship s to the device and procedure.  Reportable  adverse 
event  data will be listed  for each patient , including the type of event/verbatim  term, start date,  
seriousness, action taken, outcome,  and causality  (if appropriate). The onset of adverse events 
will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the da te of procedure.  
The specific categories analyzed will be those that are reported by [CONTACT_204536] (3) percent of 
the patients.  As there is no CEC for this study, all adverse events will be reported based on the 
assessment from the clinical study sites.  
10.[ADDRESS_244047] follow -up date.  Patients who are alive 
at day 365 will be censored at day 365 . The time to death will be plotted with 95% confidence 
intervals .  
Additionally, t he frequency and percent age of deaths for any reason (all -cause mortality) will be 
presented with the two -sided 95%  Wald confidence interval . 
11 Pooling Across Centers  
Analyses will be presented using data pooled across centers. The primary and secondary 
effectiveness and safety endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_204537].  
Pooling analys es will be conducted across study sites on the primary effectiveness and primary 
safety endpoints . Fisher’s exact test (univariate analysis) and stepwise binary logistic regression  
11 
 on study site , adjusted for  key baseline and other appropriate variables  (multivariate analysis) , 
will be used . The multivariate result s will take precedence in  testing  for site heterogeneity.  
To assess the validity of pooling  North America (US/Canada) and Europe sites , logistic 
regression model s will be used for the primary effectiveness  and primary safety endpoints . 
Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression model s with geographic location (North America 
(US/Canada versus Europe), study site, and a subset of key baseline and procedural predictors 
will be used for each primary endpoint to test for heterogeneity across geographic locations.   
Wald odds ratios of the treatment effect s for geographic location and study site  will be 
presented with two- sided p- values to test whether the odds ratios  equal 1.  Centers enrolling  
three or fewer patients will be eliminated from  all pooling analy ses. 
12 Missing Data and Imputation Methods  
The primary analysis will be data as observed, in which  results are reported using  the data that 
are available without imputing  missing  values . 
As sensitivity analyses, t he primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints will be 
recomputed using the ITT population after imputing missing data:  
• Imputation using baseline scores  (run for primary effectiveness only)  
• Imputation using the worst clinical scenario, assuming the subject was assessed as 
Raymond- Roy Class III at the time of final follow -up (effectiveness) or experienced a 
primary safety event (safety)  
• Imputation using the best clinical scenario, assuming the subject was assessed as 
Raymond- Roy Class I and II at the time of final follow -up (effectiveness) or did not 
experience a primary safety event (safety)  
13 Changes  to Planned Analyses  
All changes to this Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be documented  in a revised SAP  or the 
clinical study repor t.

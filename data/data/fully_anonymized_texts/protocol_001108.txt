Amended protoco l 09 (21 December  2020 ) 
This amended protocol (Amendment 0 9) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article  10(a) of Directive 2001/20/ Ethics Committee ( EC) of the European Parl iament 
and the Council of the European Union . 
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The overall rationale for this amendment is as follows : 
• To include the recommendations that were developed for the COVID -19 pandemic period 
and were shared with the sites /Investigators. These recommendations will remain 
applicable after the end of the pandemic, especially the information regarding the post -
infusion surveillance period . 
• To revise the text in Sections 12, 13, and 14 as per the cu rrent [COMPANY_011] protocol template to 
use the updated wordings that are compliant with general guidance, including monitoring 
techniques . 
• To update Section 8.1 for detail s regarding home infusion s to harmonize this text  across 
the different  studies included in  the avalglucosidase alfa develo pment program.

LTS13769  - avalglucosidase alfa  Version number: [ADDRESS_773911]  Requirement for patients to remain in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587709] 2  hours to 1 hour 
and the following text was add ed: “In 
case the patient does not stay for this 
observation period (eg, as part of 
contingency measures for a regional or 
national emergency that is declared by a 
governmental agency), the Investigator  
(or appropriate designee) will contact [CONTACT_587731].”  Due to COVID -19 pandemic restrictions, 
the observation  period after the infusions  
were  performed at the study site  or 
infusion center was shortened or 
skipped for patient’s safety reasons. 
Also to lighten this period after the end 
of the pandemic  and in order  to obtain 
information in case this observation 
period is not performed , the observation 
time after the end of  infusion is reduced 
to [ADDRESS_773912]  Unde r “Home infusion” subsection, the 
text was updated to harmonize with other 
studies included in  the avalglucosidase 
alfa development program . The home infusion text is amended to 
allow patients to benefit from home 
infusion sooner  in case of an 
unexpected e vent (ie, after 6 months 
free of IARs instead of 12 months) or to 
resume home infusion sooner after 
interruption for IAR durin g home 
infusion. Some text is also updated to 
harmonize across  the other studies 
included in  the avalglucosidase alfa 
development program.  
Section 10.4.[ADDRESS_773913] sending of source documents t o

Efficacy  
6-minute walk test (6MWT) . 
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) endpoints . 
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  Refer to study and period flo w charts.  
Medical/surgical history, and Pompe disease history, including GAA 
gene mutations, will be imported from the patient’s prior 
avalglucosidase alfa  study file in the database when possible.  
STATISTICA L CONSIDERATIONS  Out of range laboratory values , vital signs, and ECGs will be flagged by 
[CONTACT_587733] -clinically significant 
abnormalities. The clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded 
as AEs and included in the TEAE counts.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated (counts and 
percent ages). 
Infusion -associated reactions  and discontinuations due to AEs will be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics will be generated by [CONTACT_587734].  
In addition, ra w data and changes from baseline for selected 
parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_451706]/or plots.  
Descriptive statistics for actual values and changes from baseline will 
be generated by [CONTACT_587735] t. 
Data may also be plotted. For the purpose of analysis, baseline will be 
prior to the first dose of GZ402666 in a ny prior avalglucosidase alfa  
study.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters will be summa rized for each dose level 
and study visit by [CONTACT_587736].  
Pharmacodynamics  
Changes over time in tissue glycogen content in the lower extremity 
muscle will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Evaluation of 
intact muscle and fatty  replacement from MRI will be descriptive using  
a grading scale and, if feasible, quantitative using a numeric method of 
determining the degree (%) of overall fatty replacement of muscle from 
the skeletal muscle MRI and an individual (%) measure for the 
quadriceps. A correlative measure comparing the b iopsied muscle and 
its MRI counterpart will also be performed. Relationship between 
pharmacodynamic and efficacy endpoints will be explored using 
graphic display or correlational analysis as appropriate.  
Explo ratory efficacy  
Observed measurements and chang es from baseline will  be provided 
for each endpoint:  6MWT and PFT parameters.  
DURATION OF STUDY (per patient)  The duration of the study for each patient is initially  [ADDRESS_773921] until avalglucosidase alfa  is

4.1 INTRODUCTION  
Pompe disease (also known as acid malta se deficiency or glycogen storage disease [GSD ] 
Type II) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by [CONTACT_587738] 
α-glucosidase ( GAA ), an enzyme that degrades glycogen. Genzyme, a [COMPANY_011] company, has 
developed alglucosidase alfa, which contains the active ingredient recombinant human acid 
α-glucosidase ( rhGAA ), as long -term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT ) for patients with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa treatment is globally approved 
(tradenames: Myozyme® and Lumizyme®) for the treatment of Pompe disease based on its 
efficacy to prolong invasive ventilator -free survival in infants (1) and its ability to improve 
walking distance and to stabilize respi[INVESTIGATOR_587713] 8 years and older and adults (2). 
To achieve these benefits, alglucosidase alfa is administered at high doses (20 mg/kg every other 
week [qow] ), relative to other ERTs. Echocardiogram measurements demonstrate that 
alglucosidase alfa works well in cardiac muscle. There is a more variable response to treatment in 
skeletal muscle. This is thought to be, at least in part, due to the relative low level of  
bis-mannose -6-phosphate (bis -M6P ) on alglucosidase alfa. Therefore, increasing the level of  
bis-M6P on alglucosidase alfa may provide a mechanism to drive uptake into the skeletal muscle.  
Genzyme is investigating a second gener ation therapy for Pompe disease called avalglucosidase 
alfa (neoGAA, GZ402666)  (rhGAA  conjugated with synthetic bis -M6P -Man6 glycan ). 
Avalglucosidase alfa  is a modification of alglucosidase alfa that results in the conjugation of a 
number of hexamannose st ructures containing [ADDRESS_773936] been conducted to support the development of 
avalglucosidase alfa . These include 2 repeat dose studies (2 and 4 weeks) conducted in CD -1 
mice , and 2 repeat dose studies (4 weeks and 6 months) conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. A 
safety  pharmacology evaluation was also conducted as part of the 6 -month toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Additionally, a mouse micronuclei assessment was conducted in GAA 
knockout (GAAKO ) mice to evaluate t he potential genotoxicity of avalglucosidase alfa . 
The toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa  was first evaluated in CD -1 mice in a 14 -day repeat dose 
study. Doses were administered as an intravenous (IV ) bolus at 50  mg/kg every other day for 
14 days. Administration of avalglucosidase alfa  at 50  mg/kg was associated with macroscopic 
findings in the male reproductive tract (none of the male reproductive tract tissues were examined 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]).  
In the liver, minima l to mild multifocal necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates were present after 
administration of avalglucosidase alfa  at 50 mg/kg, although no correlating serum chemistry 
alterations were observed. Terminal elevations in serum calcium, phosphorus, and potas sium were

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group  - strictly confidential  Page 26 observed in males dosed with 50 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa . A definitive relationship of these 
alterations to the test article could not be established because of the possible confounding factor of 
carbon dioxide asphyxiation prior to blood co llection in these animals. The above findings were 
further evaluated in the 28 -day studies in CD -1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, and in the 
26-week study in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa  was evaluated in 28 -day repeat dose toxicit y studies in the 
CD-1 mouse and the cynomolgus monkey. In both studies , avalglucosidase alfa  was administered 
every week for 28 days (4 doses total) at 0, 4, 40, or 120 mg/kg via IV bolus to mice or via a 
6-hour IV infusion to monkeys. Toxicokinetic data a re summarized in Section  4.1.2 . 
Results from the study in CD -1 mice demonstrated that repeated administrations of 
avalglucosidase alfa  were overall well tolerated. One death was  noted and 1 early sacrifice was 
necessary within 1 hour of the fourth avalglucosidase alfa  administration in the 4 mg/kg dose 
group. This was likely due to a hypersensitivity reaction following repeated administration of a 
human protein into a mouse. Ther e were no significant changes noted in body weights, clinical 
observations, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters, or in organ weights and organ to 
body weight ratios. Histopathology of all animals at the terminal sacrifice showed no evidence of 
toxicity related to avalglucosidase alfa  administration.  
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) was established at ≥120 mg/kg in CD -[ADDRESS_773937] article -related clinical signs or changes in body weight, 
body weight change (gain), phys ical examination findings, clinical pathology parameters, or 
macroscopic/microscopic findings that could be attributed to the administration of avalglucosidase 
alfa. 
The NOAEL was established at ≥120 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  
As hypersensitivity reactions are likely to occur in mice in long -term repeat  dose toxicity 
assessments, and no differences in toxicological findings between species were noted in the 
28-day st udies, a 26 -week repeat dose toxicity study was conducted in one species, the 
cynomolgus monkey. Avalglucosidase alfa  was administered every other week for 26 weeks at 
doses of 0, 50, or 200  mg/kg via a [ADDRESS_773938] article -related changes in clinical 
observations, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, ophthalmic evaluations, 
organ weights, or in macroscopic/microscopic evaluations. Furthermore, there were no

The following evaluations were conducted as part of this study for evaluation of safety 
pharmacology and the results are as follows:  
• Central nervous system : There were no changes in activity levels considered related to 
avalglucosida se alfa  administration when compared to controls. All monkeys were 
observed to be in a normal quiet state (score of 2) to a high arousal state (score of 4) 
during the study. Observations for the presence of muscle fasciculations, facial muscle 
movements, a nd visual field were all normal.  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and core body temper ature: There were no changes considered 
related to avalglucosidase alfa  administration when compared to controls.  
• Electrocardiograms  (ECGs) : All monkeys maintained sinus rhy thms throughout the study. 
One atrial and 1 ventricular premature depolarization were noted on Day 155. The 
ventricular premature depolarization occurred in a male animal administered vehicle, and 
the atrial premature depolarization was observed in a male monkey treated with 50 mg/kg 
of avalglucosidase alfa . These rhythm disturbances can occur in normal monkeys and were 
not test article related. Intravenous dosing once every 2 weeks with avalglucosidase alfa  at 
up to 200  mg/kg/dose did not have any toxicolo gic effects on recorded ECG s in this study.  
The NOAEL was established at 200 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  
4.1.2  Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion data  
The pharmacokinetics (PK ) of avalglucosidase alfa  have been evaluated in a number of preclinical 
studies in the GAAKO mouse model of Pompe disease following administration of 20 mg/kg. 
Additionally, toxicokinetic (TK ) evaluations were conducted as part of the 28 -day toxicology 
study in CD -1 mice, the 28 -day toxicology study in non -human primates, and the 26 -week 
toxicology study in non -human primates.  
Average PK parameters in GAAKO mice following  a single IV administration at 20  mg/kg of 
avalglucosidase alfa  are as follows:  the terminal elimination half -life ( t1/2), 26.9 min utes; volume 
of distribution, 29.0 mL/kg; area under the concentration curve ( AUC ), 36.7 min utes*mg/mL; and 
clearance  (CL), 0.55  mL/min utes/kg. 
Avalglucosidase alfa  TK was evaluated following single  and repeat IV administration at dose 
levels of 4, 40, and 120 mg/kg in CD -1 mice ( Table  1). Saturation kinetics were observed at the 
dose levels evaluated. This was characterized by [CONTACT_67191] t1/2, decreased  CL, and increased 
AUC /dose as the dose levels increased to 120  mg/kg. No consistent differences in TK parameters 
were noted when comparing the first and fourth dose, suggesting that there were no meaningful 
changes in TK parameters following repeated IV adminis tration in CD -1 mice.

Values represent mean ±SD.  
Toxicokinetic parameters were also determined for avalglucosidase alfa  in non -human primates 
following the first and fourth infusion at 40 and 120 mg/kg dose levels in a 28 -day toxicology 
study ( Table  2). There were limited serum concentration data available for the 4 mg/kg dose level 
at both the first and fourth doses, which did not allow for the estimation of TK parameters. Across 
both infusions analyzed, avalglucosidase alfa  elimination was either monophasic or biphasic. 
Toxicokinetic parameters were calculated only from the first phase of elimination, as the second 
phase had limited data points for analysis (many animals had avalglucosidase alfa  levels below 
the level of detection at lat er time points).  
At both the first and fourth infusions of avalglucosidase alfa , saturation kinetics appear to be 
present. While this is only a trend at the first infusion, statistically significant differences occur in 
t1/2 and CL at the fourth infusion. This suggests that saturation kinetics may become more 
prominent between 40 and 120 mg/kg after repeated infusions of avalglucosidase alfa . 
No significant differences were noted for TK parameters between the first and fourth infusions at 
the 40 mg/kg dose level, but significant differences in TK parameters (decreased CL and 
increased AUC 0-inf/dose) were noted with repeated administration at the 120 mg/kg dose level. 
This suggests that repeated dosing in the monkey at this dose level affects the TK profile o f 
avalglucosidase alfa . For both dose levels and infusions, avalglucosidase alfa  TKs did not appear 
to differ between male and female monkeys.

Toxicokinetics were evaluated as part of the [ADDRESS_773942], 7th, and 13th  infusion at 
the 50  and 200 mg/kg dose levels.  
Across all infusions and both doses analyzed, avalglucosidase alfa  elimination was biphasic. 
Toxicokinetics parameters were calculated only from the first phase of elimination, as th e second 
phase had limited data points for analysis and represented GAA activity at, or very close to, 
background levels observed in vehicle -treated animals.  
At infusion 1, 7, and 13 of avalglucosidase alfa , saturation kinetics were present ( Table  3). These 
dose-related TK differences reached statistical significance with all 3 infusions analyzed. This

avalglucosidase alfa  in monke ys. 
Intradose TK parameters appeared to change with successive infusions (ie, infusion 1, 7, and 13). 
These changes were characterized by [CONTACT_587739], t1/2, and  AUC , and decreases in  CL. 
Compared to the first infusion of 50 mg/kg, most TK parameters were significantly different for 
both the 7th and 13th infusions. At 200 mg/kg, compared to the first infusion, most TK 
parameters exhibited a trend for differences at infusion [ADDRESS_773943] that

administration procedures can be found in th e pha rmacy manual . 
The follow -up observation period for the end -of-study visit and for treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( TEAE ) is anticipated to be approximately [ADDRESS_773946] an exogenously administered recombinant protein plays a critical role 
in the safety of the compound. The refor e, safety assessments will include blood samples for  
anti-avalglucosidase alfa  antibodies, neutralizing antibody formation in anti-drug antibody (ADA)  
seropositive patients , and anti-alglucosidase alfa immunoglobulin G (IgG ) antibodies (only 
patients who were previously treated with alglucosidase alfa ). 
Additional exploratory safety assessments will be conducted when clinically indicated. In the 
event that a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or  recurrent mild infusion -associated reactions 
(IAR s) suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, additional blood samples will be collected for the 
evaluation of:  
• Circulating immune complex detect ion; and 
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryptase, and complement activation.  
Additionally, skin testing may be performed, as appropriate, in patients who experience an IAR 
that meets the following criteria:  
• Infusion -associated reaction  is suggestive of IgE -mediated hypersensitivity reaction, with 
persistent symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension, and/or urticaria requiring intervention 
OR any other signs or symptoms at the discretion of the Investigator or t he Sp onsor.  
Skin testing may be another predictor of IgE -mediated reaction and may be suggested for 
confirmation of the IgE results.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarkers assessments  
Glucose tetrasaccharide (Hex4 ), a tetraglucose oligomer, has been shown to be elevated in the 
urine of patients with Pompe disease. Hence, determination of fasted Hex4 levels may be a means 
by [CONTACT_587741].  
Fasted plasma samples  and fasted urine samples will be taken for exploration of potential 
biomarkers of disease severity or response to avalglucosidase alfa . 
Skeletal muscle magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) will be taken  to guide site selection for 
muscle needle or open biopsies and to explore the effects of therapy on muscle pathology. When a 
muscle biopsy is available p harmacodynamic activity of avalglucosidase alfa  will be assessed 
through tissue glycogen measurem ents from biopsies of the lower extremity (quadriceps).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacogenomics  
Previous studies in Pompe muscle biopsies have shown a number of RNA species whose 
expression is correlated with di sease  progression. Measurements of circulating muscle creatine 
kinase indicate that muscle cell contents can be observed in the blood of patients with Pompe 
disease, suggesting the possibility of measuring muscle derived RNAs  among the cell -free RNA 
in the  blood, as has been done in cancer and for prenatal diagnosis. If feasible, circulating RNA 
measurement could provide a minimally invasive biomarker for disease progression and severity. 
Therefore, plasma samples will also be collected and assessed for cir culat ing microRNA 
concentrations on both the whole -genome and individual gene levels.  
When a muscle biopsy is available, s keletal muscle tissue samples , taken by [CONTACT_587743] , will be evaluated for exploratory RNA expression. Such data will be us ed to  evaluate if 
transcriptional changes are predictive of disease course and if the pattern indicates response to 
treatment. An additional serum sample will be collected in connection with this analysis. This 
serum sample will be used to assess whether a ny of  the targets that are identified in muscle are 
expressed in serum and therefore could be  assessed as a serum -based marker of Pompe disease.

LTS13769 is an open -label, multicenter, multinational extension study with repeated IV infusions 
of avalglucosidase alfa  (neoGAA,  GZ402666) . Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacogenetic, and exploratory efficacy data will be collected during this long -term study. The 
population will be  patients with Pompe disease who have completed a n avalglucosidase alfa  
study. The gra phical design and study flow charts are presented in  Section  1. 
Patients who have provided signed written informed consent and have met all of the inclusion 
criteria and ha ve no t met the exclusion criterion will be enrolled in the study.  
Safety , pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacogenetic, and efficacy assessments will be 
performed at scheduled visits throughout the extension study. Adverse events and concomitant 
medic ation s will be collected continuously throughout the study.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will review safety information during 
periodic bi -annual safety reviews, as well as on an ad ho c basis as outlined in the DMC  charter , 
which is maintained separately from the study protocol.  An immunologist will be consulted, when 
necessary, to review information and provide treatment recommendations for IARs.

with a pH of 6.2. 
Avalglucosidase alfa  will be administered by [CONTACT_587746] 
a dose of 20  mg/kg body weight  qow.  
The total amount of investigational product administered may be adjusted as needed to account 
for changes in body weight . Most recent body weight shou ld be used for dose calculation. Each 
avalglucosidase alfa  IV infusion will be administered in a ste p-wise manner. The rate will begin at 
a slow initial rate and will be gradually increased if there are no signs of IARs, until a maximum 
rate is reached. The infusion length will be dependent on the dose. Specific details pertaining to 
the infusion volumes  and rates  as well as dose calculation  can be found in the pharmacy manual . 
Prior to each infusion, the patient should be assessed by [CONTACT_29973] 
(ie, qualified physician  with the exception of patients who receive home infusion  of 
avalglucosidase alfa  as outlined below  under the subsection “Home infusion” ) to determine if the 
patient is free of acute illness and is clinically stable to receive the infusion. Infusions will be 
postponed (see Sectio n 8.7.1 ) if the patient is acutely ill on the scheduled day of infusion.  Any 
modification to the dose and/or frequency of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to an AE, in 
which case it is not a protocol vi olation, but the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor in the 
event of a dose change. No dose increase above the maximum recommended dose of 20 mg/kg 
qow will be allowed for any patients .  
Patients will be required to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587718] 
1 hour after each infusion ; see below for the patients receiving home infusion. Patients may be 
required to stay for a longer observation period at the Investigator’s discretion.  In case the patient 
does not stay for  this observation period (eg , as part of contingency measures for a regional or

• The patient must be willing and able to comply with home infusion procedures.  
• The patient has been trained on home infusion process.  
• The patient must, in the Investigator’s (or designee’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], have been clinica lly stable 
with no history of moderate or severe IARs for at least [ADDRESS_773956] be on a stable 
avalglucosidase alfa  dose. In case of unexpected event that prevent infusions to be 
performed at site for a prolonged period, (eg , as part of contingency measures for a 
regional or national emergency that is declared by a governmental agency), with DMC 
agreement, the required period of 12 months with no history of moderate or severe IAR 
may be reduced to 6 months, to allow home infusion to be resumed  sooner . 
• If this reduced period from [ADDRESS_773957] 6 months , is considered safe and after 
confirmation with the DMC  (which will be documented in Trial Master File) , it will be 
considered as a permanent criterion after the unexpected event is resolved (eg , 
contingency measures for a regional or national emergency that is declared by a 
governmental agency are terminated).  
• No infusion rate increases will be allowed while  a patient is receiving home infusions.  
• The patient must have no ongoing (not yet recovere d) SAEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.  
• Home infusion infrastructure, resources, and procedures must be established and available 
according to applicable regional regulations  (see Section  17.1 for regulations applicable 
specifically in [LOCATION_009] disallowing the option for home infusion) . In exceptional 
circumstances, the Investigator may require a local vendor for  home infusion services. In 
such circumstances, the Investigator will attest that this vendor meets the requirements to 
properly manage the home infusion of avalglucosidase alfa, including available resources 
and procedures.  
• Patients experiencing a moderat e or severe IAR while being infused at home will return to 
the study site for their following infusion and will continue to receive infusions at the site 
until the Investigator feels it is safe for the patient to resume home infusion . 
• If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions have occurred prior to  start of 
home infusions or occur  during home infusions , the Investigator should assess whether or 
not it is safe for the patient to start or to continue to be treated via home infusion.  
• The Spo nsor should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient 
experiences IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to  Section  8.8.2 ). 
• In the event  of manufacturing scale change, the patient will be required to receive the first 
infusion at the site. All criteria for return to home infusion will apply.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group  - strictly confidential  Page 43 Patients are restricted from participating in other concurrent investigational protocols that are not 
restricted to data and/or sample collection for pati ent demographic , disease , and/or 
avalglucosidase alfa  treatment purposes.  
8.8.1  Pretreatment for patients with infusion -associated reactions  
In clinical trials with alglucosidase alfa , some patients were pretreated with antihistamines, 
antipyretics , and/or corti costeroids. Infusion -associated reactions occurred in some patients after 
receiving antipyretics, antihistamines , or corticosteroids.  
In general, the use of pretreatment in this study is at the discretion of the Investigator. The routine 
use of pretreatmen t is not recommended, especially in patients with previous IgE -mediated 
hypersensitivity reaction. Antihistamines can mask early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction 
(skin reaction) , making it difficult for the infusion staff to recognize the initial si gns of distress 
and the need to decrease the infusion rate and/or otherwise intervene.  
8.8.2  Management of infusion -associated reactions  
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions (ie, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction.  
Testing for moderate, severe , and recurrent mild IARs will include, if clinically indicated:  
• Assessments for circulating immune complex detection; and IgE, serum tryptase, and  
complement activation, following moderate, severe, or recurrent mi ld IARs suggestive  of 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
• Skin testing if IARs are suggestive of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction (IgE -mediated)  as 
appropriate.  
For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the Investigator may consider the use of pretreatment 
medic ations (ie, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or glucocorticoids), in addition to infusion rate 
reductions, interruptions, or even discontinuation, if necessary.  Please refer to the Investigator 
Brochure for further guidance on the management of infusion -associated reactions.  
If severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of the 
infusion should be considered, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. Severe 
reactions are generally managed with infusion int erruption, administration of antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, IV fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated. In some cases of anaphylaxis, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_326870]. Because of the potential for severe infusion reactions, 
appropriate medical support measures, including CPR  equipment especially for patients with 
cardiac hypertrophy and patients with significantly compromised respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], should be 
readily available.  
The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parame ter returns to baseline or 
until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group  - strictly confidential  Page 60 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT T EMPORARY OR PERMANEN T TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DIS CONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. I n case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the eCRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in th e study as long as possible.  
The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator or Sponsor to discontinue a patient 
from treatment:  
• The patient was erroneously included in the study (ie, was found to not have met the 
inclusion/exclusion criterio n). 
• The patient experiences an intolerable or unacceptable AE.  
• The patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.  
• The patient participates in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization of the Sponsor.  
• The pati ent becomes pregnant.  
• The patient becomes lost to follow -up. 
The Investigator o r the Sponsor (see Section  14.2) terminates the study . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_773985](s)  
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_587759] . Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under 
close and appropriate clinical/and or laborat ory monitoring once the Investigator will have 
considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP in the 
occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still 
met (refer t o Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be r ecorded by [CONTACT_587760] s of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.  Visit and assessment 
schedules will be adapted to the absence of infusion of IMP (refer to Section  1.2 and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
10.3.[ADDRESS_773986](s)  
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re -expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time.

treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this 
may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to document the reasons for 
treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the eCRF.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_773988] follow -up, eg, medical records check. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the 
procedures defined above.  
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented. Prefera bly 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
If possible,  the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end  of study 
visit.  
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to recontact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physi cian, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact [CONTACT_56480]’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted  telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).

10.4.1  Definitions of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical inves tigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death , or 
• Is life -threatening , or: 
- Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more  severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] , or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event : 
- Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587724] ( ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

• Infusion -associated reactions : 
- IARs are d efined as AESIs that occur during either the infusion or the observation 
period following the infusion which are deemed to be related or possibly rela ted to the 
IMP. At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs occurring after completion of the  
post-infusion observation period that are assessed as related may also be considered 
IARs.  Refer to Section  8.8.2  for additional testing in the event a patient experiences a 
moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions and for 
suggested guidelines for the management of IARs.  
• Pregnancy : 
- Pregnancy occurring i n a female patient included in the clinical trial. Pregnancy will be 
recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases. It will be qualified as an 
SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria.  
- Male patients will be instructed to notify the Investiga tor immediately if they discover 
that their sexual partner is pregnant.  
- In the event of pregnancy  in a female participant , IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow -up of the pregnancy is mandatory  in a female participant or in a female partner 
of a male particip ant, until the outcome has been determined.  
• Overdose : 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_587761] d therapeutic interval, adjusted according to the tested 
drug.  
• Clinical laboratory (change from baseline , ie, prior to the first dose of GZ402666 in any 
prior avalglucosidase alfa  study) : 
- ALT or AST increase of ≥3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN ) if baseline is <ULN, or 
ALT or AST increase ≥2 x the baseline  value  if baseline is ≥ULN , 
- A maximum ALT value of ≥400 IU/L or AST value of ≥500 IU/L or an increase in

The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigation s performed, outcome, 
and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by [CONTACT_2203].  
- There is one exception to this rule. In instances where a patient experiences an IAR 
(refer to Section 8.8.2 ), allergic, or anaphylactic reaction, either during infusion or post 
observation period, each of the individual signs and/or symptoms comprising the 
reaction should be captured as individual AE terms . 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patient s. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_181287].  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patien t’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485].

95% confidenc e intervals (CI) of changes will be presented.  
Evaluation of intact muscle and fatty replacement from MRI will be descriptive using a grading 
scale and, if feasible, quantitative using a numeric method of  determining the degree (%) of 
overall fatty replacement of muscle from the skeletal muscle MRI and an individual (%) measure 
for the quadriceps. A correlative measure comparing the biopsied muscle and its MRI counterpart 
will also be performed.

Observed measurements , as well as change from baseline , will be summarized. If a linear trend in 
the change of urine Hex4 levels is observed, a longitudinal model may be  employed to model 
change from baseline over time. In addition, 95% CIs of changes will be presented. Due to the 
small number of patients, nonlinear relationship will not be formally characterized.  
To explore the relationship between PK endpoints and urine  Hex4 levels, scatter plots and linear 
mixed model  may be used as appropriate.  
To explore the relationship between glycogen content and biomarkers, correlational statistics 
(Spearman or Pearson) at each scheduled study visit will be used. In addition, scat ter plots and 
linear regression analysis will be used to describe the relationship between glycogen content and 
each biomarker.  
Similar analyses will be carried out to explore the relationship between other pharmacodynamic  
endpoints, exploratory biomarkers , and exploratory efficacy assessments .

Observed measurements and changes from baseline to each study time point in 6MWT distance 
walked and PFT parameters (%  predicted sitting and supi[INVESTIGATOR_587726], FEV1, MIP, MEP, and PEF) 
will be summarized using summary statistics. In addition, 95% CIs will be used to estimate the 
change from baseline at each study visit. Graphical displays showing data over time will be 
presented.  
11.9 EXTENT OF STUDY TREA TMENT EXPOSURE AND C OMPLIANCE  
Number of weeks in the study, the number of study infusions, and the dose received by [CONTACT_587767]. Frequency and percentage of patients remaining on 
treatment will be summarized quarterly.

In the Clinical Trial Summary table (p age 5) and in section 5.2 (p age 33), exploratory efficacy 
variables are wrongly listed as secondary endpoints.  
In the LTS13769 study  protocol (Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 6), exploratory 
plasma and urine biomarkers and pharmacogenetics assessments are wrongly listed as secondary 
endpoints.  These assessments are clearly exploratory in nature and are not reported in the Clin ical 
Study Report, as also described in the study protocol:  
• Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 50 
9.3.4  Exploratory plasma and urine biomarkers  
Fasted plasma and urine samples will be collected prior to IMP infusion for the assessment of 
explorator y biomarkers. Procedures for the collection, handling, and shipment of all samples will 
be included in the study -specific laboratory manual. Results will be used to inform on biomarker 
targets for future studies and will not be reported in the CSR.  
• Amend ed Clinical Trial Protocol 09, p age 51 
9.5 Pharmacogenetic assessment  
Fasted pharmacogenetic samples will be collected. Refer to the study -specific laboratory manual 
for guidelines on the collection and shipment of whole blood samples.  
9.5.1  Skeletal muscl e RNA expression analysis  
In patients in whom the prior muscle biopsy, obtained in a prior avalglucosidase alfa study, had a 
glycogen content >5% or who show significant clinical decline, muscle tissue samples will be 
taken via biopsy of the lower extremit y (quadriceps) muscle, as indicated in Section 9.3.2. An  
additional serum sample will be collected in connection with this analysis. These serum samples 
will be used to assess whether proteins for any of the mRNA targets that are identified in muscle 
are e xpressed in serum and therefore could be assessed as a serum -based marker of Pompe 
disease. Results will be used to inform on biomarker targets for future studies and will not be 
reported in the CSR.  
9.5.2  Circulating microRNA analysis  
Plasma samples will be collected and assessed for circulating microRNA concentrations on both 
the whole -genome and individual gene levels. Results will be used to inform on biomarker targets 
for future studies and will not be reported in the CSR.

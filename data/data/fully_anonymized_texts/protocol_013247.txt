1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1. Background  
 
Survival in patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has improved dramatically with 
the advent of Highly -Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_639485] -
infection -related survival, the risk of malignancies remain s significant in patients with HIV 
infection.  While Non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is an AIDS -defining diagnosis, a comparison 
of a large cohort of HIV -infected patients to the Sur veillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] 
(SEER) data demonstrates a significantly higher incidence of several cancers that are treated 
with allogeneic HCT, including Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia s in patients with HIV 
infection (Patel).   
 
Prior to the adve nt of HAART, the treatment of patients with malignancy in the setting of HIV 
infection was hamstrung by [CONTACT_639548].  Since the widespread availability of HAART, there have been 
significan t improvements in the capacity to treat this patient population in a fashion comparable 
to that of patient s without HIV infection.  This has, in turn, lead to marked improvements in the 
outcomes of patients with malignancies in the setting of HIV infection .  The prognosis for 
patients with AIDS -related lymphoma is dramatically different in the era of HAART therapy.  In 
a comparison of treatment outcomes for patients treated before and after the advent of HAART, 
there is a statistically significant improveme nt in the overall survival of patients treated with 
HAART (p = 0.002).  While the International Prognostic Index (IPI) remains a useful tool for 
estimating the prognosis of patients with AIDS -related NHL, the CD4 count of less than [ADDRESS_855372] been possible 
previously.  
 
Although HIV disease progression can be rever sed with combination antiretroviral  (ARV)  
therapy, antiretrovirals don’t cure HIV -infected individuals. This is because HIV establishes 
latent infection in long -lived resting memory CD4+ T cells.  This cellular reservoir of latent virus 
is the major barrier to HIV cure. Antiretrovirals only have activity against actively replicating 
virus and therefore “intensified” combinations of [ADDRESS_855373] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903

1-2 1.2. Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients with HIV Infection  
 
Based upon the opportunity  afforded by [CONTACT_639549], high -dose therapy with 
autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been extended to patients with AIDS -
related NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma with results that appear to be comparable to those achieved 
in patients without HIV infection.  Treatment -related complications appear to be comparable to 
those seen in the non -HIV-infected patient population.  Across multiple trials, the probability of 
survival after high -dose conditioning followed by [CONTACT_639550] T for patients with AIDS -
related NHL ranges between 39% to 85% as seen in Table 1.2.

1.3. Allogeneic HCT for Patients with HIV Infection  
 
The experience with allogeneic HCT transplantation for patients with HIV infection has been 
quite limited.  Prior to the advent of HAART therapy, the key limiting factors in the use of 
allogeneic HCT in this patient population was control of the HIV infection and management of 
opportunistic infections.  In a paper published in 1987, 3 patients who were diagnosed with HIV 
infection following transplantation were managed through the use of donor lymphocyte infusions 
and cytokine therapy (Vilmer).  Two o f the patients had undergone prior HCT for aplastic 
anemia and the third had been treated for acute leukemia.  All of the patients demonstrated 
evidence of marrow failure.  Patients were treated with [ADDRESS_855374] using total body irradiation combined 
with cyclophosphamide (Holland).  The patient received [ADDRESS_855375] -transplant.  He achieved engraftment on 
Day + 17 but unfortunately died of complications related to progressive disease on Day + 47.  
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of peripheral blood were negative for HIV at Day + [ADDRESS_855376] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
1-3 and analysis o f multiple autopsy tissues did not demonstrate detectable virus at the time of the 
patient’s death.  
 
Additional case reports from the pre -HAART era demonstrated the feasibility of performing 
allogeneic transplantation for patients with HIV infection who we re treated with multiple anti -
retroviral agents prior to and following allogeneic HCT, but in 2 of 3 cases, the patients remained 
PCR -positive for evidence of residual HIV infection (Torlontano, Giri).  The 1 patient who did 
not demonstrate evidence of pos t-transplant HIV infection had poor count recovery following 
transplant and died of ARDS (Contu).  
 
The availability of HAART therapy seems to have had an impact upon the feasibility of HCT in 
this patient population.  In a review of the CIBMTR registry dat a, 23 patients with HIV infection 
were identified as having undergone allogeneic transplant (Gupta).  Nine of the 23 (39%) 
underwent  allogeneic HCT HIV  after [ADDRESS_855377] remains quite limited.  In a 2002 case report, a 33 -
year-old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission, HIV and 
hepatitis C infection underwent fully ablative CD34 -selected allogeneic graft from a sibling 
donor (Sora).  She was treated with HAART prior to transplant and achieved an undetectable 
viral load.  The transplant course was complicated by [CONTACT_639551] -versus -host disease (GVHD) 
that responded to treatment.  At the time of the report, the patient remained in a complete 
remission with an undetectable HIV viral load at [ADDRESS_855378].  
 
One of the challenges in managing patients with HAART through the transplant course may be 
the risk of HIV -reactivation/graf t infection during periods of antiretroviral therapy interruption.  
In a 2001 report of 2 patients treated with reduced -intensity allogeneic transplant, 1 of the 
patients developed a febrile illness consistent with acute HIV reactivation (Kang).  The viral  load 
rose to 1,000,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL during this time.  This patient eventually died of relapsed Hodgkin 
lymphoma [ADDRESS_855379] -transplant and remains free of disease.  In another case report 
from 2007, a 34 -year-old man with HIV infection and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent 
allogeneic HCT (Wolf).  During inte rruption of HAART therapy, the patient demonstrated a 
rapid rise in his HIV viral load.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the patient engrafted at Day + 18.  He achieved 
viral suppression following retreatment with his antiretroviral regimen.  
 
Conversely there are some data that show that the donor graft may be capable of mounting and 
anti-HIV response mediated by [CONTACT_398]8+ cells (Woolfrey).  Two patients with AML underwent 
allogeneic HCT (1 matched sibling, 1 unrelated donor) following a non -myelo ablative regimen 
(fludarabine 90 mg/m2 and TBI 2 Gray) and were monitored with HIV RNA levels, proviral 
DNA levels and peripheral blood mononuclear cell quantitative HIV cultures post -transplant.  
Antiretroviral therapy was chosen to avoid significant drug interactions and hepatotoxicity

1-4 potentially related to nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and 
mycophenolate.   HAART was administered throughout the transplant course.  One patient 
suffered a relapse of his disease at Day + 44.  Immunosuppression was withdrawn.  This  patient 
died as a result of complications related to GVHD and obliterative bronchiolitis.  Both donors 
had wild type CCR5 coreceptor.  Both patients had undetectable viral loads from prior to 
transplant through Day + 180.  HIV proviral DNA was detected in  1 patient at Days + 56 and 
+180.  Through an analysis of donor T -cell responses to multiple HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], cells recovered 
from patient [ADDRESS_855380] for patients with HIV has expanded with 
the recent publication of the Ohio State University experience (Hamadani).  Three patients with 
HIV underwent allogeneic HCT following conditioning with fludarabine and busulfan with or 
without anti thymocyte globulin (1 patient without).  GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus 
and mini -dose methotrexate.  The patients underwent transplant for AML in 2nd complete 
remission, Burkitt lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma, respectively.  Patients continu ed 
HAART throughout the transplant course without interruption.  One patient developed acute 
GVHD.  At the time of the study publication, all patients were alive, free of disease and off of 
immunosuppressive therapy (range 368 -802 days).  One patient had a  detectable viral load 
beyond [ADDRESS_855381].  
 
The “Holy Grail” for allogeneic transplantation for patients with HIV -infection would be a cure 
of the underlying disorder for which transplant was performed and the concomitant eradication 
of the HIV in fection.  The recent case report of a patient who underwent allogeneic HCT for 
AML and received a graft from a donor with the CCR5 delta32 /delta32  mutation may herald this 
possibility ( Hütter).  One of the key mechanisms for HIV -1 entry into CD4 lymphocytes  is 
chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5).  The delta32  mutation represents a 32 base pair deletion in the 
allele that may confer significant resistance to HIV infection in homozygotes for the mutation.  
In this case report, a 40 -year-old man with AML and concomitan t HIV infection underwent 
allogeneic transplant from an unrelated donor.  At the time of diagnosis with acute leukemia, the 
viral load was undetectable and the CD4 count was 415/mcl.  The patient achieved a complete 
response following standard therapy, but  relapsed 7 months following treatment.  At the time of 
relapse, the patient underwent an unrelated donor transplant using a donor who was a 
homozygote for the delta32  allele.  The patient received a CD34 -selected graft.  GVHD 
prophylaxis consisted of cycl osporine A and rabbit antithymocyte globulin.  The patient 
engrafted on Day + 13.  He experienced grade I GVHD of the skin that responded to therapy.  
The patient relapsed at Day +391 and was treated with a second transplant from the same donor 
following p reparation with 2 Gray TBI.  The patient’s HIV viral load remains undetectable at 20 
months following transplant despi[INVESTIGATOR_639486].   
 
While a graft from a donor with the CCR5delta32/delta32 mutation may result in cure, evidence 
has been eme rging that transplant using such donors may not be necessary for cure.  
Maintenance of antiretroviral therapy throughout the transplant period may prevent infection of 
donor cells and thus prevent the establishment of a retroviral reservoir in donor cells.  
Achievement of full chimerism with replacement of host -derived CD4 T cells with donor cells 
may abolish the host reservoir. The failure to detect residual infectious virus in the Berlin patient 
suggests that no cellular reservoir of infectious virus survi ved transplantation (including donor 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
1-5 lymphocyte infusion). Recent data from [LOCATION_011] suggests that two patients who underwent 
allotransplantation from donors who were not selected to be resistant to HIV, also cleared the 
long term reservoir and have had anti retroviral therapy stopped. As of this writing (October 
2013), they appear to be retrovirus -free off therapy. Thus in the context of the present study we 
may be able to learn whether antiretrovirals can prevent the infection of HIV -susceptible donor 
cells and if infection is prevented, whether the patient  will be cured of HIV as host infected cells 
are replaced by [CONTACT_639552].  
 
Subcutaneous enfuvirtide. The HIV -1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20, Fuzeon), will be 
administered during hi gh-risk periods for n ausea and vomiting, specifically during the 
administration of high dose AR V during alloHSCT when oral medications cannot be tolerated as 
for example during high dose cyclophosphamide or during  periods of severe mucositis. 
Enfuvirtide or T20, is the only available non -oral antiretroviral approved for treatment of HIV -1 
infection,  besides the intravenous form of zidovudine (AZT) which is contraindicated during 
alloHSCT due to bone marrow suppression. In most cases, enfuvirtide monotherapy is not 
sufficiently potent to suppress active viral replication in most patients; however we b elieve that 
the temporary use of enfuvirtide monotherapy in patients undergoing alloHSCT population is 
justified for several reasons. First, it has been demonstrated AR V simplification to less potent 
regimens, such as protease inhibitor monotherapy, is eff ective; this suggests that less 
antiretroviral activity is required to maintain viral suppression compared to the amount of 
antiretroviral activity required to induce viral suppression. Second, patients undergoing 
alloHSCT are likely to be profoundly lymph openic due to conditioning chemotherapy; viral 
dynamic theory states that the amount of viral replication is directly related to the number of 
lymphocytes. Therefore in cytopenic patients with already suppressed plasma HIV -1 RNA 
levels, there should be les s viral replication to inhibit. During any periods of enfuvirtide 
monotherapy, weekly viral loads will be measured using real -time PCR with a sensitivity of 20 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_639487] -1 RNA per milliliter of plasma. If there is virologic failure/breakthrough, defined a s 
2 consecutive measures of > 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_639487] -1 RNA/mL, enfuvirtide will be discontinued. The 
patient would then be off all antiretroviral medications and this would be considered a failure to 
maintain AR V. Enfuvirtide monotherapy does present the risk of d evelopment of enfuvirtide 
resistance. In clinical trials of enfuvirtide monotherapy, it took 14 days for resistance to develop. 
In this clinical trial, we anticipate the use of enfuvirtide monotherapy on the order of days. If 
virologic failure is observed with this strategy, resistance testing for enfuvirtide will be 
performed. If resistance does develop it is highly unlikely to compromise future management of 
the patient’s HIV infection  as enfuvirtide is rarely used in clinical practice due to the availabi lity 
of many other oral antiretrovirals and no cross -resistance  exists  between enfuvirtide and other 
antiretroviral agents.

2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1. Study Overview  
 
The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of reduced -intensity and fully -ablative 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with hematological 
malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have HIV infection.   The goal of the 
study is to assess the 100 day Non -relapse Mortality as well as immunological reconstitution in 
this patient population.  Where feasible, an attempt will be made to identify HLA -compatible 
hematopoietic stem cell donors who are homozygote s for the delta32  mutation of the chemokine 
receptor 5  (CCR5delta32) .  Patients will undergo a treatment plan review prior to registration on 
the trial . All patients will undergo allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor.  In 
addition, the su bcutaneous antiretroviral, enfuvirtide, will be added during any periods when oral 
medications are unlikely to be tolerated due to nausea (e.g. during administration of high dose 
cyclophosphamide) or cannot be tolerated for other reasons (e.g. mucositis).  
 
2.2. Study Objectives  and Rationale  
 
The rationale for this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of allogeneic HCT for 
patients with chemotherapy -sensitive hematological malignancies and coincident HIV -infection.  
In particular the trial will foc us upon the 100 -day non -relapse mortality as an indicator of the 
safety of transplant in this patient population.  Correlative assays will focus upon the incidence 
of infectious complications in this patient population, the evolution of HIV infection and 
immunological reconstitution.  Where feasible (and when this can be accomplished without 
compromise of either the donor quality or the timeliness of transplantation), an attempt will be 
made to identify donors who are homozygotes for the delta32 mutation fo r CCR5.  
 
In light of emerging evidence that it may be possible to prevent infection of transplanted cells 
with HIV, we are also seeking to optimize the antiretroviral strategy so as to minimize or 
eliminate interruptions and to capture detailed compliance information. If it emerges that some 
patients are cured of retroviral infection while others are not, it will be important to determine 
whether the failures were associated with treatment interruptions in antiretroviral therapy or 
other explanat ions.

2-4 4. Active CMV retinitis or other CMV -related organ dysfunction.  
5. AIDS related syndromes or symptoms that pose a perceived excessive risk for 
transplantation -related morbidity as determined by [CONTACT_458].  
6. Untreatable HIV infection due to multidrug antiret roviral resistance.   Patients with a 
detectable viral load > 750 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml should be evaluated with an HIV drug resistance 
test (HIV -1 genotype).  The results should be included as part of the Antiretroviral 
Review (described in Appendix D).  This Review C ommittee will make the final 
determination as to whether HIV viremia could potentially be suppressed with alternate 
antiretroviral therapy. .  
7. Pregnant (positive β -HCG) or breastfeeding.   
8. Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques from the time of 
initiation of mobilization until six -months post -transplant.  
9. Prior allogeneic  HCT.  
10. Patients with psychosocial conditions that would prevent study compliance and follow -
up, as determined by [CONTACT_458].  
11. T-cell depletion (including  ATG or alemtuzumab ) is not allowed.  
12. Use of cord blood as the source of hematopoietic cells is  not allowed.  
 
2.4. Donor Selection Criteria  
 
Patients are eligible for transplantation using either compatible related donors or an appropriately 
compatible unrelated donor as identified through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) 
that meets institutional  criteria.  Allogeneic transplantation using cord blood unit (s) as a 
hematopoietic stem cell source is prohibited under this protocol.  
 
Donor Inclusion Criteria  
1. Unrelated donors will be identified through the National Marrow Donor Program 
(NMDP).  
2. No contra indications to donation of hematopoietic stem cells.  
3. CCR5 delta32  mutation: An additional matching criterion for this study will be the 
presence of homozygosity for the CCR5 delta32  mutation.  When feasible based on donor 
likelihood of CCR5delta32 homozygosi ty and timeliness , potential donors will be 
assessed for CCR5 delta32  homozygosity.  Among equivalently desirable donors as 
determined by [CONTACT_639556], a donor who is found to be a 
homozygote for CCR5 delta32  will be favored as long as such a selection does not 
compromise the optimal timing  of HCT.  HLA matching as a selection criterion will 
always take precedence over CCR5 delta32  homozygosity  (see Appendix E for details) . 
 
2.4.1.  Donor Exclusion Criteria  
1. Monozygotic twin donors.

3. HIV seropositive.  
 
2.5. Study Treatments  
 
In general reduced -intensity conditioning (RIC) is reserved for patients with co -morbidities or 
older patients in whom regimen -related mortality weighs against myeloablative conditioning 
(MAC).  However, the selection of a RIC or MAC regimen in any particular patient is left to the 
discretion of investigators at the participating center in accordance with institutional standards.

(See Appendix F for detailed information on each interaction .) 
 
Recommendations on GVHD prophylaxis are included in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] to 2.5.3. 4. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus doses are adjusted to target whole blood levels between 5 and 15 ng/mL , except 
when the patient is receiving both tacrolimus and sirolimus, in which case it is recommended that 
serum trough levels of tacrolimus do not exceed 10 ng/mL .  When a patient is switched from 
intravenous to oral tacrolimus, the dose is increased by [ADDRESS_855397] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855398] tacrolimus levels are:  
1. Caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, St. John’s 
Wort ( lowers levels ); 
2. Glucocorticoids, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
grapefruit juice, amprenavir, bromocriptine, chloramphenicol, cimetidine, cisapride, 
clarithromycin, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, erythromycin, ethinyl estradiol, 
metoclopramide, metronidazole, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
omeprazole, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ritonavir, saquinavir, theophylline, 
troleandomycin, verapamil ( increases levels ). 
 
Per the tacrolimus package insert, when initiating thera py with posaconazole or voriconazole in 
patients already receiving tacrolimus, it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose be reduced to 
one-third of the original dose and followed with frequent monitoring of the tacrolimus blood 
levels.  Increased tacrolim us levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity.  When 
posaconazole or voriconazole are discontinued, tacrolimus levels should be carefully monitored 
and the dose increased as necessary  (see Appendix F).  Cyclosporine may be substituted for 
tacrolimus i f the patient is intolerant of tacrolimus.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Methotrexate  
 
The regimen of methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis will employ intravenous doses of [ADDRESS_855399] -transplant, and 10 or 5 mg/m2 on Days 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_855400] space syndromes with large accumulation of ascites or pleural 
effusions are a contraindication to the use of methotrexate.  Dose reductions per institutional 
guidelines  shou ld be made for renal, hepatic and mucosal toxicity.  Determinations of blood 
levels are indicated 24 -72 hours after administration in patients with impaired renal function.  
Leucovorin rescue should be considered in patients with decreased clearance, sever e toxicity or 
fluid accumulation/effusions.  
 
Drugs that may increase methotrexate levels are:  
1. Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  
2. Penicillins  
3. Diuretics  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sirolimus  
 
Sirolimus is recommended to be given to adult patients in a loading dose of 12 mg on Day  –[ADDRESS_855401] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
2-12 state.  Frequent monitoring is required if a new medication is initiated or if the patient develops 
renal insufficiency.  The target serum level for sirolimus is 3 -12 ng/mL.  
 
Dose adjustmen ts are based on clinical judgment of the treating physician after considering 
clinical toxicity, serum levels, GVHD, concomitant drug use and the rate of rise or decline of the 
serum level.  For levels < 3 ng/mL, it is suggested, but not required, that the  dose of sirolimus be 
increased by [CONTACT_3450] 25% increments no more frequently than every [ADDRESS_855402] full milligram until the target range is achieved.  Conversely, for levels > 12 ng/mL, it 
is suggested, but not required, that the dose be decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 25% no more 
frequently than every 2 days until the target level is achieved.  Alternatively, sirolimus can be 
held entirely as long as serum levels are monitored and the drug is restarted when the level 
returns to the the rapeutic range and the treating physician feels it is appropriate to restart the 
agent.  
 
Drugs that may increase  sirolimus blood concentrations include:  
• Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem, nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], verapamil.  
• Calcineurin inhibitors: cyclosporine.  
• Antifungal agents: ketoconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole , voricona zole, 
posacona zole.  
• Macrolide antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin.  
• Gastrointestinal prokinetic agents: cisapride, metoclopramide.  
• Other drugs: rifampin, bromocriptine, cimetidine, danazol, HIV -protease inhibitors (e.g., 
ritonavir, indinavir).  
 
Drugs that may decrease  sirolimus concentrations include:  
• Anticonvulsants: ca rbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin.  
• Antibiotics: rifabutin, rifapentine.  
• Herbal preparations: St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) could result in reduced 
sirolimus concentrations.  
 
Due to extreme interactions with sirolimus, voriconazole  is contrai ndicated during sirolimus 
therapy.  In the event of suspected or documented fungal infection, alternative antifungal therapy 
should be used wherever possible (see Appendix F for further details) .  The uses of sirolimus and 
myeloablative doses of busulfan a re associated with hepatic veno -occlusive disease (sinusoidal 
obstructive syndrome) and thus should be avoided.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide with MESNA  
 
Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide with MESNA may only be used with 
fludarabine/busulfan  for non -myeloablative and busulfan/fludarabine for myeloablative 
conditioning regimens.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855403]-transplant cyclophosphamide if the patient 
received a myeloablative conditioning regimen  and the donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639489] 8/[ADDRESS_855404] -transplant cyclophosphamide:  
• Full myeloablative regimen  and donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639489] 8/8 : no additional prophylaxis is 
given  
• Full myeloablative regimen with a 7/8 match and for Flu/Bu non -myeloablative regimen:  
− On Day 5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic Acid 
Mofetil (MMF).  Tacr olimus will be given at a dose of 1 mg IV daily then will be 
changed to a PO dosing schedule once a therapeutic level is achieved or as per 
institutional standards.   
− MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO TID (based upon actual body weight) 
with the m aximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams (1 g PO TID).  
− MMF prophylaxis will be discontinued after the last dose on Day 35 and Tacrolimus 
prophylaxis will be discontinued per institutional standards typi[INVESTIGATOR_639490] 180.  
 
2.5.4.  Antiretroviral Therapy Overview  
 
Based on preliminary results from the Dana -Farber group showing that continuous antiretroviral 
(ARV) treatment may help prevent HIV infection in transplanted cells (ref), ARV treatment 
should be continued throughout the transplant process whenever possible. Antiretroviral (ARV) 
therapy is optimally effective when administered in combination and with consistency. However, 
almost all ARV medications are orally administered.  It should be noted that the integrase strand 
transfer inhibitors (INSTIs, ralt egravir and dolutegravir) are associated with low levels of GI 
toxicity and may be better tolerated in patients experiencing nausea than ritonavir -boosted 
protease inhibitor based -regimens. Elvitegravir, also an INSTI, is co -formulated (Stribild) with 
tenofovir, emtricitabine, and cobicistat. Co -administration of Stribild is contraindicated with 
drugs that are highly depending on CYP3A for clearance due to the cobicistat component. It 
should be used with caution in this study.  
 
Use of Enfuvirtide as a Bridg ing Agent When Oral ARVs Cannot Be Tolerated  
When oral medications cannot be tolerated  due to nausea and vomiting, mucositis, or other 
reasons , the patient should receive the subcutaneous ly administered  antiretroviral enfuvirtide at 
standard doses in order  to maintain HIV suppression. Enfuvirtide monotherapy  may lead to HIV 
resistance if used as monotherapy for prolonged periods of time, but in the short -term, the risk of 
acquired resistance is modest. In addition to subcutaneous administration, the benefits of 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855405] engraftment.   
 
ARVs an d High Dose Chemotherapy  
The ARV guidelines (Appendi ces D and E) are designed to minimize the possibility of drug 
interactions with high dose chemotherapy.   
 
Patients on Myeloablative Conditioning Regimens  Receiving Ritonavir -Containing ARV 
Therapy :  Ritonavir -containing ARV therapy will restart not sooner than  [ADDRESS_855406] doses s hould be administered as a bridging ARV therapy irrespective of 
the conditioning regimen when oral ARV cannot be tolerated until multi -agent ARV therapy can 
be resumed.  
 
Patients on Reduced Intensity Conditioning Regimens :  Patients will continue on oral ARV 
therapy.  Enfuvirtide monotherapy should be administered as above if for any reason, the patient 
is unable to tolerate oral ARV therapy.

Serious and prolonged toxicity is possible for patients concurrently receiving ritonavir -based 
(boosted -PI) therapy and the immunosuppressive agents tacrolimus or sirolimus.  The 
introduction of immunosuppressive therapy must be systematic, carefully monit ored and 
consistent throughout the peri -transplantation period.  At the inception of immunosuppression, 
patients may or may not be receiving antiretroviral therapy based on the conditioning regimen 
selected.  Patients receiving ritonavir throughout conditi oning are to be managed differently than 
those who are not.   This is due to the potent inhibition of CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein by 
[CONTACT_364860], resulting in the delayed metabolism and consequently higher serum levels of 
tacrolimus, and sirolimus.  
 
Daily monit oring of serum trough levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus and sirolimus is the most 
accurate way to provide effective immunosuppression while minimizing toxicity.   In the setting 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
2-16 of less frequent monitoring, dose adjustments can be predicted based on the me tabolic pathways 
for each agent; however, the drug -drug interactions with ritonavir have not been studied 
extensively and must be supported by [CONTACT_639562].  
Only the doses of tacrolimus and sirolimus should be ad justed; antiretroviral therapy must be 
continued at the dose prescribed.  
 
For all patients, the following is recommended:  
1) Intravenous tacrolimus  is preferred  to avoid gastrointestinal cytochrome P450 co -enzyme 
inhibition  during the peri -transplantation period, however oral therapy with tacrolimus, or 
sirolimus is permitted  
2) Serum trough levels should be obtained no later than Day 5 of concurrent 
immunosuppressi ve and antiretroviral therapy  
3) If clinical signs or symptoms of severe toxicity (neurotoxicity) are present OR if serum 
trough levels of tacrolimus/sirolimus exceed the upper limits of acceptable ( tacrolimus 
>25 ng/mL, sirolimus >25 ng/mL ), then BOTH antire troviral therapy and 
tacrolimus/sirolimus  should be held, a level repeated in 24 hours and therapy resumed 
once the level is within the target range  
4) No dose adjustments  are required for mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate  
5) Dosing recommendations based on serum levels are provided below and in Appendix F 
6) Recommended standard dosing (or per institutional standard) : 
a. Tacrolimus

2.5.5.  Initiation of Antifungal Prophylaxis in Ritonavir -Based Antiretroviral Therapy  
 
Detailed information is available in Appendix F Table F-[ADDRESS_855412] moulds.  For patients at high risk for mould infections (such as those with 
cell-mediated immunodeficiency from GVHD ) or those with a prior history of invasive 
aspergillosis, prophylaxis with an anti -moul d agent is recommended.  Given the three -way 
interaction between selec ted immunosuppressive drugs,  HIV medications (especially protease 
inhibitors) and triazole agents (especially voriconazole, itraconazole, and to a lesser extent 
posaconazole) , the echino candins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin) and amphotericin B 
(either the aerosolized or intravenous  formulations) are preferred for prophylaxis .  The 
echinocandins are effective against Aspergillus mould only, whereas amphotericin B has a 
broader sp ectrum of mould activity.  Aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B has been  shown  to 
be effective in reducing invasive pulmonary  aspergillosis in leukemic and HCT patients.

  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
2-19  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Voriconazole  
 
Voriconazole is metabolized by, and inhibits the activities of, human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.  The affinity of voriconazole is the highest for CYP2C19, 
followed by [CONTACT_097]2C9 and CYP3A4; however there is a large degree of inter -individual 
variability in voriconazole pharmacokinetics.  The interactions between voriconazole and the 
antiretroviral agents, specifically ritonavir, are complex.  Concurrent use of high -dose ritonavir 
(400-600 mg twice daily) is contraindicated  due to signif icant reduction in plasma concentration 
of voriconazole.  Low -dose ritonavir (100mg twice daily) has been shown to decrease the 
voriconazole AUC by 39% in healthy subjects after 9 days; however, upon initiation of 
voriconazole, the AUC may be increased by 4.5 fold.  This is due to a time - and dose -dependent 
interaction where ritonavir initially inhibits voriconazole metabolism, followed by [CONTACT_639563].  
 
Moreover, voriconazole may further inhibit the metabolism of immunosuppressive agents, such 
as tacr olimus, sirolimus and cyclophosphamide.  The following is recommended for initiating 
voriconazole prophylaxis in patients receiving protease inhibitor -based antiretroviral therapy:  
1) No high -dose riton avir (contra -indicated due to significant reduction of pl asma 
voriconazole concentrations)  
 
2) Avoid loading doses (due to significant voriconazole effect on calcineurin inhibitors and 
sirolimus levels); initiate prophylaxis with voriconazole 4 mg/kg IV or 200mg PO every 
12 hours  
 
3) Therapeutic drug monitoring of vo riconazole is required within 7 days of concomitant 
therapy (due to significant effect of protease inhibitors on voriconazole)  
 
a. Serum trough levels ≥ 1 mcg/ml are desired for optimal efficacy  
b. Serum trough levels > 6 mcg/ml are associated with greater toxic ity 
 
4) Close monitoring (daily if possible) of serum levels for cyclosporine, tacrolimus or 
sirolimus is strongly recommended (due to significant effect of voriconazole on these 
agents)  
a. In the absence of an appropriate level, administer 10% of the standard dose of 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus (see Section 2.5.4)  
 
5) Monitor closely for signs or symptoms of voriconazole toxicity (hepatotoxicity, CNS 
toxicity)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Posaconazole  
 
Posaconaz ole also inhibits the activity of human cytochrome P450 enzymes especially the 
isoform CYP3A4, which can increase the plasma concentration and exposure of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_75107].  However, posaconazole does not inhibit the CYP450 isoforms 
CYP1A2,  2C8/9, 2D6, or 2E1, and thus potentially has a lower drug interaction potential than 
voriconazole.  Unlike voriconazole, posaconazole metabolism is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_449453].  In general, the metabolic pathways of p osaconazole and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855413] that posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of ritonavir, and 
ritonavir may decrease the plasma concentration of posaconazole.  Posaconazole may further 
inhibit the metabolism of immunosuppressive agents, such  as tacrolimus, sirolimus and 
cyclophosphamide.  The following is recommended for initiating posaconazole prophylaxis in 
patients receiving protease inhibitor -based antiretroviral therapy:  
1) No high -dose riton avir (contra -indicated due to significant reducti on of plasma 
posaconazole concentrations)  
2) Therapeutic drug monitoring of posaconazole is required within 7 days of concomitant 
therapy (due to significant effect of protease inhibitors on posaconazole). Therapeutic 
levels of posaconazole have not been esta blished, but low levels have been encountered 
in the setting of impaired absorption with poor food intake, acute GVHD, or diarrhea.  
3) Close monitoring (daily if possible) of serum levels for cyclosporine, tacrolimus or 
sirolimus is strongly recommended (due  to significant effect of posaconazole on these 
agents)  
a. In the absence of an appropriate level, administer 10% of the standard dose of 
tacrolimus or sirolimus (see Section 2.5.4)

weighed against the risk of the disease for which the HCT is prescribed.  Major risks following 
transplantation include: 1) Infection  which can be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal.  Often, 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
2-21 these infections are life -threatening, partic ularly when caused by [CONTACT_193935], and are 
associated with high mortality in the transplant population.  The published experience shows 
increased risk of CMV viremia, but no increase in mortality related to that virus; 2) Damage  of 
all or any of  the major organs may occur as a result of reactions to drugs (e.g., chemotherapy, 
antibiotics, anti -fungal medications), and as a result of destructive processes (e.g., infection), and 
may have a fatal outcome; brain damage can result in severe loss of co gnitive or neurologic 
function; 3) Relapse or progression  may occur, especially in patients with advanced disease 
status at time of treatment; 4) Unknown toxicities  may occur in any individual patient due to 
multiple events and cumulative effects which may  involve any and all organs, including the 
brain; and, 5) Death . 
 
2.8. Therapy Toxicities  
 
All toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0.  All of the following listed agents are commercially availabl e.  Refer to 
www.fda.gov for full adverse event information regarding the agents listed below.  All of the 
following agents should be administered per institutional standards, and stored per package insert 
instructions.  
 
2.8.1.  Busulfan  
 
Busulfan is a bi-functional alkylating agent.  Toxicities include the following: Severe bone 
marrow hy poplasia, which would be fatal without administration of bone marrow, stem cells; 
nausea and vomiting, which can be decreased by [CONTACT_639564] -emetics; s tomatitis 
and diarrhea, which can be treated symptomatically with fluid replacement and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_639495]; pulmonary fibrosis characterized by [CONTACT_254919], shortness of 
breath and low -grade fever; hepatic damage, which can occur in c ombination with 
cyclophosphamide  or as a single agent and can result in significant hepatic toxicity, which can be 
fatal; temporary hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_639496]; and grand mal seizures, 
which can be prevented by [CONTACT_639565] . 
 
2.8.2.  Melphalan  
 
Melphalan, an alkylating agent, is a phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard.  At high doses, 
the likely toxicities include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia.  The 
duration of profound myelosu ppression decreases with the use of stem cell transplantation and 
colony stimulating factors.  Gastrointestinal toxicity, which includes potentially severe 
stomatitis, esophagitis and diarrhea, may require intravenous narcotics for mucositis -related pain, 
intravenous hydration and alimentation, and antibiotics.  Less likely is hepatotoxicity.  Rare but 
serious toxicities reported include pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis, veno -
occlusive disease of the liver, skin hypersensitivity, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, allergic 
reactions, and a small risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_193896].

2-22 2.8.3.  Fludarabine  
 
a. Neurotoxicity: Agitation or confusion, blurred vision, loss of hearing, peripheral 
neuropathy or weakness have been reported.  Severe neurologic effects, i ncluding 
blindness, coma, and death are seen in 36% of patients treated with doses approximately 
four times greater than recommended; severe CNS toxicity is rarely seen with doses in 
the recommended range for non -transplant therapy of hematologic malignanc ies.  Effect 
of chronic use on the CNS is unknown, although patients have received recommended 
doses for up to [ADDRESS_855414] been used in adult and pediatric patients and increased 
neurotoxicity has not been observed.  
b. Anemia: Life -threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been 
reported after one or more cycles of t herapy in patients with or without a previous history 
of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positive Coombs’ test and who may or may not be 
in remission; no mechanisms for development of this complication have been identified.  
Corticosteroids may or may not  be effective in controlling these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  The majority 
of patients re -challenged developed a recurrence of the hemolytic process.  
c. Cardiovascular: Deep venous thrombosis, phlebitis, transient ischemic attack, and 
aneurysm (1%) are reported.    
d. Fever: 60% of patients develop fever.  
e. Skin Rash: 15% of patients develop a skin rash, which may be pruritic.  
f. Digestive: Gastrointestinal side effects include: nausea/vomiting (36%), diarrhea (15%), 
stomatitis (9%), anorexia (7%), GI bleeding and esophagit is (3%), mucositis (2%), liver 
failure, abnormal liver function test, constipation, dysphagia (1%) and mouth sores.  
g. Some other effects are: Chills (11%), peripheral edema (8%), myalgia (4%), osteoporosis 
(2%), pancytopenia, arthralgia (1%), dysuria (4%), urinary tract infection and hematuria 
(2%); renal failure, abnormal renal function test, and proteinuria (1%); and, very rarely, 
hemorrhagic cystitis and pulmonary toxicity.  
 
2.8.4.  Cyclophosphamide  
 
Cyclophosphamide side effects include: nausea/vomiting, cardiomyopathy, skin rash, mucositis, 
stomatitis, sterility, diarrhea, hemorrhagic cystitis, fluid weight gain/edema, alopecia and 
hemolytic  anemia.  
 
2.8.5.  Total Body Irradiation  
 
TBI can cause: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, parotitis (rapid o nset within 24 -48 hours, usually 
self-limited), generalized mild erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], fever, mucositis, and alopecia.

2-23 Late effects include: possible growth retardation, vertebral deformities, cataracts, probable 
increased risk of secondary maligna nt neoplasms, sterility, nephropathy, interstitial pneumonitis 
and veno -occlusive disease.  
 
2.8.6.  Tacrolimus  
 
Side effects include: reversible renal insufficiency, hypertension, hypomagnesemia, 
hypokalemia, and neurologic toxicity.   A syndrome of thrombotic micr oangiopathy, comprised 
of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction has been 
described in association with sirolimus and tacrolimus use.  In common with all other 
immunosuppressants, it may increase the risk of opportunistic  infections and post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disorders.  
 
2.8.7.  Sirolimus  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_501762], sirolimus is not associated with 
neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity because of its inability to inhibit calcineurin.  Phase III  clinical 
trials have indicated that the primary toxicities are hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, 
mild thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, hypokalemia, elevated LDH, arthralgia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], 
edema, and infections.  Clinically significant elevatio ns in hepatic transaminases without 
sequelae were noted in the prior Phase II study with this drug.   
 
2.8.8.  Methotrexate  
 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with methotrexate use as GVHD 
prophylaxis include ulcerative stomatitis, leucopen ia and suppressed hematopoiesis, nausea, and 
abdominal distress.  Other frequently reported adverse effects are malaise, undue fatigue, chills 
and fever, dizziness and decreased resistance to infection.  Methotrexate may be associated with 
increased rates of pulmonary complications after transplantation.  The risk of infections is due to 
the suppression of hematopoiesis after transplantation.  
 
2.8.9.  Mycophenolate Mofetil  (MMF)  
 
The most frequent reported adverse reactions associated with MMF include infection, up set 
stomach and nausea.  Less common reported adverse effects are low blood counts, vomiting and 
diarrhea.  Some rare but serious reported adverse reactions include serious injury to the gut 
including bloody stools and vomit, secondary cancers such as lymp hoproliferative  disease or 
lymphoma, serious infections of the brain, risks to a baby [CONTACT_639566] (PML).

Definition of maintenance of ARV:  All attempts should be made to maintain the oral ARV 
regimen through the first year after transplantation. Subcutaneous enfuvirtide should be  added 
during administration of high -dose cyclophosphamide (due to the risk of nausea and vomiting) 
and other similarly nauseating regimens and during any other periods when oral ARV is not 
tolerated (e.g. mucositis). If participants are unable to take ora l ARV but are maintained on 
subcutaneous enfuvirtide alone, this will be considered maintenance of ARV. Failure to maintain 
ARV will be defined as ≥ 24 hours after the next scheduled dose is expected to be received  
without  any ARV  therapy . 
 
3.3. Disease Status Assessment  
 
3.3.1.  Lymphoma  
 
Patients at each data collection period are classified into one of the disease statuses specified 
below (CR, PR, SD, PD).  After HCT and until relapse/progression, all disease status 
classifications are relative to the patient’s pre -HCT disease status.  Tests used for evaluation of 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855421], abdomen and pelvis as indicated.   
 
Segments of this section are exc erpts from the Bruce Cheson, et al, article “Revised Response 
Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.”  
 
Complete Remission (CR):  
The designation of CR requires the following (Table 3.1):  
• Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and di sease -related 
symptoms if present before therapy.  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, a post -treatment residual mass of any size is 
permitted as long as it is PET negative . 
• Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on CT to normal size (≤ 1.[ADDRESS_855422] transverse dia meter 
for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_855423] 
decreased to ≤ 1.0cm in their short axis after treatment.  
• The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a 
physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical exam and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear.  Howeve r, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because 
a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged 
spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth 
factors, or ca uses other than lymphoma.  
• If bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample 
that is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of 
clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_639570] a CR until data become 
available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.

3-5 Complete Remission Undetermined (CRu):   
• The use of the above definition for CR and that below for PR eliminates the category of 
CRu.  
 
Partial Remission (PR):  
The designation of PR requires all of the following:  
• At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected 
according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at  least 2 
perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; 
and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved.  
• No increase should be observed in the size of othe r nodes, liver or spleen.  
• Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by  50% in their SPD or, for single nodules in 
the greatest transverse diameter.  
• With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
• Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, 
large -cell lymphoma or small n eoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_37405], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be 
considered partial responders.  When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a 
clinical CR was achieved, but w ith no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients 
should be considered partial responders.  
• No new sites of disease should be observed.  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before ther apy, the post -treatment PET should be positive in at least 
one previously involved site.  
• Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used.  In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle -cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only 
indicated with one, or at most two, residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% 
on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and 
should be considered partial responders.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
3-6 Stable Disease (SD):  
Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following:  
• A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a 
CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive  disease (see Relapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post -treatment CT or PET.  
• Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/ FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change 
in the size of the previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.  
 
Relapsed Disease (RD, after CR)/ Progressive Disease (PD after PR, SD):  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered 
abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 x ≤ 1.0cm will not be considered 
as abnormal for relapse or progressive disease.  
• Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.[ADDRESS_855426] are mostly benign.  Thus, a therapeu tic 
decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic 
confirmation . 
• At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g, splenic or hepat ic nodules).  To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less 
than 1.[ADDRESS_855427] increase by  50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in 
the long axis . 
• At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cm  in its short axis . 
• Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359] -avid lymphoma or the 
lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with 
current PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_855428]).  Measurable extranodal disease 
should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  For these 
recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease.  Disease that is only assessable 
(e.g. pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, 
while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_20478], it is found 
to be histologically negative.  In clinical trials where PET is unavailable t o the vast 
majority of participants, or where PET is not deemed necessary or appropriate for use 
(e.g. a trial in patients with MALT lymphoma), response should be assessed as above, but 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855429] scans.  However, residual masses should not be assigned CRu status, but 
should be considered partial responses.  
 
3.3.2.  Acute Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes  
 
Assessment after transplantation response will be assessment as follows:  
 
Complete Remission:  
• Bone marrow myeloblasts < 5% by [CONTACT_306840];  
• No circulating blasts;  
• Neutrophil count  ≥ 1,000/µL;  
• Absence of previous cytogenetic or molecular abnormality identified prior to 
transplantation in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  
 
Disease Relapse for Patients with AML:  
• Increase in bone marrow blast to ≥ 5% by [CONTACT_639571] (e.g., bone marrow regeneration); or if < 5%, reappearance of blasts with the same 
leukemia phenotype as present at diagnosis.  
• Reappearance of blasts with aberrant phenotype by [CONTACT_4133].  
• Reappearan ce of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood.  
• Reappearance of previous cytogenetic or molecular marker of disease present prior to 
transplantation.  
• The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_13858].  
 
Disease Relapse for Patients with MDS:  
• Satisfying above criteria for evolution into acute leukemia; or,  
• Reappearance of pre -transplant morphologic abnormalities, detected in two 
consecutive bone marrow specimens taken at least one month apart; or,  
• Reappearance of  pre-transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase 
on each of two separate consecutive examinations at least one month apart, 
regardless of the number of metaphases analyzed.

4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATI ON 
 
4.1. Enrollment Procedures  
 
4.1.1.  Screening and Eligibility Procedures  
 
Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN Electronic Data Capture System 
(AdvantageEDCSM).  The following procedures should be followed:  
1. An authorized user at the transplant center  completes the Segment 0 Screening Form 
(patient demographic data and the date that informed consent was signed ).  A study 
number will be generated for the patient with the submission of the Segment 0 Screening 
Form. 
• Potential Unrelated Donor Transplant :  Patients requiring an unrelated donor should 
be enrolled in the Segment [ADDRESS_855430] 3 months 
prior to the proposed start of conditioning.  If this is the case, the patient should be 
enrolled as early as possible but no less than 2 weeks prior to the proposed start of 
conditioning .   
• Potential Related Donor Transplant:  Patients with an avail able related donor should 
be enrolled in Segment 0 approximately 8 to 10 weeks (but no less than 2  weeks ) 
prior to the proposed start of conditioning.  
Note:   There are two reasons for completing the screening enrollment phase early.   First, 
blood specimen s are collected at baseline to address important research questions in this 
study.  Secondly, for patients requiring an unrelated donor , sufficient time is needed for 
the unrelated donor search . 
2. The transplant coordinator at the transplant center should proceed with their institution’s 
standard procedure to identify a sibling donor, if applicable.  If an unrelated donor search 
is to be pursued, then the coordinator should inform the transplant cen ter’s assigned 
NMDP coordinator through the standard procedure for any unrelated donor . 
3. Due to the complex nature of the patient population and the potential for numerous drug -
drug interactions between the antiretroviral regimen and the allogeneic HCT treatment 
regimen, each patient’s treatment regimen must be  review ed with the Treatment Review  
Committee .  Appendix D details the process for getting  Treatment Review Committee  
approval.  This review should typi[INVESTIGATOR_83470] 4 weeks prior to the planned  
transplant date in order to allow sufficient time for any necessary adjustments to the 
patient’s medication regimen.  In some patients ’ circumstances, a 4 -week lead time may 
not be possible ; this alone will not make the patient ineligible for the study.  
4. Prior to initiation of conditioning therapy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1 -2 weeks), an authorized user at the 
transplant center completes Segment A of the Enrollment Form in AdvantageEDC.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014

4-3 and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Data M anagement 
Handbook.  
 
Reporting Patient Deaths:  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639497] 24 hours of knowledge of the patient’s death  on the Death Form .  If the cause of death is 
unknown at that time,  the cause of death field may  be left blank .  However, once the cause of 
death is determined, the form must be updated in AdvantageEDC.   In addition, all deaths must be 
reported via the Unexpected Grade 3 -5 Adverse Event Forms in AdvantageEDC for this study.  
 
CIBMTR Data Reporting: Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and 
post-transplant outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem transplants done at their 
institution during their time of participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant  Research (CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem 
Cell Transplant Outcomes Database (SCTOD).  (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of 
these forms for all US allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)  Enrollment of BMT CTN #[ADDRESS_855433] also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial.  CIBMTR 
forms will be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission 
Schedule.   
 
Weekly GVHD Monitoring :  GVHD should be monitored in accordance with BMT CTN 
guidelines as specified in the Manual of Procedures.  Patients should be assessed weekly until 
Day [ADDRESS_855434]-transplant for GVHD.  Afte r Day 56, patients will be assessed at each follow -up 
visit (Day 100, and 6, 12, and 24 months ) for the presence of GVHD.  For scheduling, a target 
day range has been provided in Table 4.2.1.  
 
4.2.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Unexpected, grade 3 -5 adverse events ( AE) and all deaths will be reported through an expedited 
AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC.  Unexpected, grade [ADDRESS_855435] be reported within three 
business days of kn owledge of the event.  Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.[ADDRESS_855436] conditioning therapy

5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
5.1. Study Overview  
 
This study is designed as a Phase II multi -center trial to assess the feasibility and safety of  
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in HIV -infected patients.  The target 
enrollment is 15 patients.   
 
5.1.1.  Accrual  
 
Accrual will be acros s multiple sites and remain open until 15 patients are transplanted.  It is 
estimated that two years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
 
5.1.2.  Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint for the study is 100 -day Non-Relapse Mortality  (NRM).   
 
5.2. Sample Size Calculations  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639503] 15 patients for this trial.  Allogeneic transplant for patients with HIV is 
considered unacceptable if 100-day non -relapse mortality  probability is 45% or high er.  The 
objective of the study is to show that 100 -day NRM is lower than 45%.  In patients without HIV, 
non relapse mortality probability 100 days after allogeneic transplant is expected to be lower 
than 15%.  Therefore, we framed this objective as a hypothesis te st of the null hypothesis 
H0:p>=0.45, where p is the [ADDRESS_855454] the alternative hypothesis H1:p =0.15.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639504] a 8% chance of concluding tha t allogeneic transplant for patients with HIV has 
less than 45% NRM when in fact the 100 day NRM rate is 45% (type I error), and an 83% 
chance of concluding that the NRM rate is lower than 45% when the 100 day NRM rate is 15% 
(power).  
 
To guard against exc essive mortality, non -relapse mortality will be monitored up to [ADDRESS_855455] transplant and if rates significantly exceed pre -set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in 
order that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are descr ibed in 
the BMT CTN’s Manual of Procedures.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for 
consultation with DSMB for additional review, and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would 
mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.  
 
A truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) based on a binomial test of proportions for 
non-relapse mortality will be used as described below.  This sequential testing procedure 
conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks for NRM.  The SPRT can be represen ted 
graphically.  At each interim analysis, the number of patients enrolled is plotted against the total 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855456] H 0:  = 0 versus H 1:  = 1 where 0 > 1, if the 
graph falls above the upper boundary, accept H [ADDRESS_855457] excessive 
NRM which would make it unl ikely that we could conclude that the NRM is less than 45% by 
[CONTACT_2054].   
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities  and  of rejecting 
H0 when  = 0 and of accepting H 0 when  = 1, respectively, and the expec ted sample size 
E(N|i).  Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite 
sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level.  The test to be used 
in this protocol was developed from the foll owing SPRT:  
 
• An SPRT testing H 0: p = 45 % versus  H1: p = 15%  NRM, with nominal type I and II 
errors of 7% and 30%, respectively.   
• The slope of the parallel lines for monitoring NRM is 0.283 and the intercepts are –1.53 
and 0.74.  
• Note that the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639505] 5.[ADDRESS_855458].  The futility boundary wa s used to ensure that the DSMB 
will be notified if it is no longer likely that we will be able to demonstrate that  100-day 
NRM is lower than 45% , thus protecting against excessive NRM .

B-3 1. Introduction  
We invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research study.  We are doing this study 
because we want to find out  how well allogeneic marrow transplant  (a marrow transplant using 
cells from someone other than the patient)  treats specific blood cancers in people with HIV 
(human immunodeficiency virus).  
 
This study will take at least two (2) years and will include 15 participants.  
 
This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the study, its possible risks and benefits, 
other options available to you, and your rights as a participant in the study.  
Everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name] should know that:  
▪ Being in any research study is voluntary.  
▪ You may or may not benefit from being in the study.  Knowledge we gain from this study 
may benefit others.  
▪ If you join the study, you can quit the study at any time.  
▪ If you decide to quit the study, it will not a ffect your care at [insert name [CONTACT_110916]].  
▪ Please ask the study staff questions about anything that you do not understand, or if you 
would like to have more information.  
▪ You can ask questions now or any time during the study.  
▪ Please take the time you need to talk about the study with your doctor, study staff, and 
your family and friends. It is your decision to be in the study. If you decide to join, please 
sign and date the end of the Consent Form.  
 
You and your doctor will discuss other t reatment choices if you do not want to participate in this 
study . 
 
2. Background  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical 
Trials Network (BMT CTN), are providing staff support and money for this research study.   
 
This study will look at the risks and benefits of allogeneic transplant for people with specific 
kinds of blood cancers and HIV infection.   
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855476] chance to be free of signs of 
disease for a long time (long -term remission).  
This clinical trial will study how well allogeneic transplant works as a treatm ent for people who 
have a blood cancer and HIV.  An allogeneic transplant uses blood -making cells from a family 
member or an unrelated donor  to remove and replace the abnormal blood cells in the patient .  
An allogeneic transplant is a common treatment for patients with a blood cancer that has either 
returned (relapsed) or does not respond well to other treatments (refractory), or is known to be 
likely to return (high risk).   The blood cancers we will include in this study are: acute myeloid or 
lymphocytic  leukemia  (AML or ALL) , myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Hodgkin lymphoma 
and non -Hodgkin lymphoma.  
Conditioning Regimen  
We will use a combination of chemotherapy and in some cases  radiation  as a treatment to destroy 
cancer cells and help donor cells start to grow in your bone marrow.   Depending on the 
combination used, each treatment (or “conditioning regimen”) can have a different intensity or 
strength.  
▪ High intensity treatment  uses a comb ination of chemotherapy that uses strong or higher 
amounts of drugs and sometimes radiation.  This is also called “myeloablative 
conditioning”.  
▪ Reduced intensity treatment  uses a combination of chemotherapy, using less strong or 
lower amounts of drugs and sometimes radiation.  This is also called “reduced intensity 
conditioning”.  
 
Both kinds of treatments are used by [CONTACT_639575].  You and your doctor will decide which conditioning regimen int ensity is 
the best choice  for you .  This study will help us to better understand how to use these treatments 
in people with HIV who have an allogeneic transplant to treat their blood cancer.  
If you volunteer to join this study, the treating physician at t he center will assign you to have 
either a high intensity or a reduced intensity treatment before you receive the blood stem cells or 
bone marrow from your donor.

5. Procedures  
Before you join the study, we will evaluate your general health, medical history, and your current 
medications.  
Study Participation  
Your study participation will last for 2 years  after your transplant.  
Follow -up tests for your transplant (described below) will last as long as you need care.   
We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life .  We would 
contact [CONTACT_639576] a year .  
Following up with you every year helps us learn about the long -term eff ects of the study and 
transplant.  Many transplant centers include this type of long -term follow -up as part of their 
regular medical care.  
Before You Start Your Treatment  
You will need to have health evaluations before you start treatment, while you recei ve your 
treatment, and for several years after you finish your treatment.  These tests are standard care for 
patients with blood cancer and would happen even if you were not part of this study.  It will be up 
to your study doctor to decide what tests you n eed and when.  
If you decide to join, we will ask you to sign this Consent Form, and you will get a copy of the 
signed form to keep.  
You will have several tests to find out if you can be in the study. The tests include:  
▪ Medical history  
▪ Physical examination,  including height and weight  
▪ Blood and urine tests  
▪ Heart function tests, including a  MUGA or a n electrocardiogram (ECG)  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
B-6 ▪ Lung (pulmonary) function tests  
▪ Tests to evaluate your blood cancer including a bone marrow biopsy /aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]   
▪ If you have lymphoma, you will also have PET (positron -emission tomography) and/or 
CT (computed tomography) scans  
▪ A blood pregnancy test if you are a woman able to have children.   If you are pregnant, 
you will not be able to take part in this study.  
 
During The Study   
▪ Study Evaluations  
We will evaluate your health at specific points during your participation.  These tests and 
how often they are scheduled are standard care for patie nts receiving an allogeneic 
transplant and would be done even if you were not part of this study.  
▪ Research Study Evaluations  
Researchers are trying to learn more about HIV and the effect of HCT on HIV.  Much of 
this research is done using blood samples.  A s a result, blood samples will be collected 
from you during the study to help researchers learn more about the effect of HCT on your 
HIV.  
− In patients that do not have any detectable HIV using standard tests, 30 mL (about 
6 teaspoons) of blood will be draw n at two times before your HCT and at [ADDRESS_855478]. Another 180 mL 
(about 36 teaspoons) of blood will also be drawn before your HCT and [ADDRESS_855479] if necessary. This blood will be used to look clo ser at any HIV 
that may still be present in your body.  
− In all patients, 10 mL (about 2 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn at two times 
before your HCT and at [ADDRESS_855480]. Another 
37 mL (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn at [ADDRESS_855481]. This blood will be used to look at how your immune system is 
responding to the treatment.  
▪ Antiret roviral Therapy  
Your antiretroviral therapy (your HIV therapy) will be reviewed.  An outside review 
committee will look at your therapy and discuss with your doctor the best way to adjust 
your therapy throughout your HCT.  Your doctor may or may not adjust your therapy 
depending on what is best for you.  
 
Taking your anti -HIV and transplant -related medicines is very important and the study 
team would like to understand how you are doing taking your medications regularly and 
on schedule . In order to track that, a study represent ative will cont act you weekly , for up 
to two years,  to check in with you and ask if you were able to take your anti -HIV 
medicines and certain medicines used for your transplant. If you have been unable to take 
your medicines for any reason, it is very important to let your transplant team know right 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855482] 
information , it might be necessary to use an internet -based search service to find you.   By 
[CONTACT_639577] 0903 study, you are giving the NMDP, 
CIBMTR, and/or your transplant cent er authorization and instruction to use such a 
service to search public and non -public information solely for the purpose of attempting 
to locate you.  If you change you move or change your contact [CONTACT_3031], you should let 
the study staff know.  
▪ Condition ing Regimen (Chemotherapy)  
The conditioning regimen is a combination of chemotherapy and/or radiation given to 
patients before the donor cells are infused.  This treatment allows donor cells to start 
growing (or “engraft”) in your bone marrow.  The conditi oning regimen also helps to 
destroy remaining cancer cel ls that might not be found in tests.  
Several chemotherapy drugs can be used as part of the conditioning treatment.  The 
choice and amount of drugs or radiation determines the treatment intensity (str ength).  
Common drug combinations used in allogeneic transplant include:  
1) Busulfan and fludarabine  
2) Fludarabine and melphalan  
3) Radiation and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan ) 
Allogeneic transplantation kills cancer through the conditioning regimen and through the 
immune cells from the donor that might recognize cancer cells and destroy them.  
Conditioning regimens with high intensity are also known as myeloablative conditioning  
regimens.  High intensity treatments work very well to destroy remaining cancer cells 
because they use very high amounts chemotherapy or radiation.  High intensity 
treatments can also have more side effects during and after transplant.  
Using a lower or “r educed” intensity treatment before transplant can have fewer serious 
problems from the chemotherapy drugs.  While the cancer killing effects may also be 
lower, studies show that immune cells given during the transplant can help destroy 
remaining cancer cel ls.  Allogeneic t ransplants with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 
regimens are often used for people who cannot have high doses of chemotherapy drugs or 
radiation because of their age or other medical problems.  
Your doctor will decide which type of conditioning treatment is the best choice for you, 
depending on the kind of blood cancer you have and your overall health.  The table below 
lists the [ADDRESS_855483] for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903

▪ Reinfusion of Stem Cells (Transplant)  
We will use your intravenous catheter or central line to give you the blood or bone 
marrow stem cells that were collected before your transplant.  The cells will travel to 
your bone marrow where they will start to make healthy, new blood cells after several 
weeks.  
 
6. Alternative Treatments  
Participation in this study is optional.  If you choose not to participate you may still receive an 
allogeneic tr ansplant for treatment of your disease.  It is possible that the treatment and the 
evaluations you would receive could be very similar to what would be if you were enrolled in 
this clinical trial.  
Your study doctor will talk with you about your options.  If you decide not to participate in this 
research study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.  
Your other choices may include:  
▪ Treatment with other drugs, radiation, or a combination of drugs and radiation without a 
transplant.  
▪ An allogeneic hematopoietic  cell transplant that is not part of the study, or another type of 
transplant.  
▪ Participation in another clinical trial (if available, check with your doctor) . 
▪ No treatment for your blood cancer at this time.  
 
Every treatment option has benefits and risks.  Talk with your doctor about your treatment 
choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.  
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
You will have side effects while on the study.  Side effects can range from mild to very serious.  
The risks and discomforts in participating in this study will be similar to what you may have with 
a blood or bone marrow cell transplant  if you do not parti cipate in this trial.  There are 
differences in side effects from medications based on the strength of your conditioning regimen.  
Myeloablative regimens often cause more side effects early after transplant compared to reduced 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855484] disease 
(GVHD) and infections happen equally in patients who have either type of regimen.  
Your health care team will give you medicines to help lower side effects such as feeling sick to 
your stomach  (nausea).  In some cases, side effects can be long lasting or may never go away.  
A. Side Effects of Allogeneic Transplant  
Short term (days to weeks): During the transplant, you will have a higher risk of infection 
and bleeding from low blood counts.  There is also the risk that your blood counts will 
not recover even though we gave you donated blood stem cells.  This risk is rare, but it 
can happen.  After your transplant, you have a higher risk of infections.   This is because 
the new immune system needs  time to learn again how to best fight some infections and 
because you will need to take medicines that lower immunity to reduce the risk of graft -
versus -host disease (GVHD).  See below for more information about GVHD.  
Long term (years): If you have an all ogeneic transplant, you will have a higher risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_639509].  These secondary cancers can be of any 
type, including blood canc ers such as leukemia.  Your HIV infection also gives you a 
higher risk for some cancers, so the true risk for allogeneic transplant for HIV -associated 
cancers is not yet known.  
B. Risks Related to Medications or Radiation Used in Conditioning Regimens  
All chemotherapy and radiation treatments used as conditioning regimens in this study 
are commonly used in allogeneic hematopoietic  cell transplantation.  The side effects 
may vary, based on the dose that is given.  This applies to busulfan, which is used in 
different amounts for myeloablative and reduced intensity regimens.

C. Risks Related to the Medication Used to Help Prevent Graft -versus -Host Disease 
(GVHD)  
Graft -versus -Host Disease (GVHD) is a medical condition that can become very serious 
and may cause death.  GVHD is a common development after allogeneic stem cell 
transplant.   It happens when the donor cells attack and damage your organ tissues after 
transplant.  GVHD can cause:  
▪ Skin problems including rashes, sores or blisters  
▪ Feeling sick  to your stomach  (nausea)  
▪ Throwing up  (vomiting)  
▪ Abdominal pain  
▪ Diarrhea  
▪ Liver damage  or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)   
▪ There are other side effects that may be seen  
▪ GVHD may be bad enough to cause death  
 
The most common forms of GVHD are relatively mild.  Other forms of GVHD can be 
chronic and last well past your transplant date.  GVHD can be very hard to predict.  You 
will be monitored closely for this condition.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855485] 
of commonly used medications to  prevent GVHD.  Your doctor may choose to use other 
medications  than what is listed here . 
 
▪ Tacrolimus:  This medication is  used to try to prevent GVHD.  The immediate side 
effects you may experience include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) or 
vomiting  (throwing up) when the medications are given orally.  Other side effects 
you may experience include high blood pressure (hypertension), shaking of the 
hands (tremor), increased hair growth and possibly an effect on mental function.   
 
If you have  these ef fects, they generally go away if your doctor lowers  the amount  
of medication you take .  A few patients have had a seizure while on this medication.   
 
Your liver or kidney s might not work as well as they did before.  If this happens, 
your doctor may lower the amount of drug you take or stop giving the drug 
completely .  The effect on kidneys seems to increase when other medications, 
which might cause kidney problems, are given at the same time, especially 
antibiotics.  Occasionally, the kidney damage c aused may require the use of an 
artificial kidney machine (hemodialysis).  
Some patients given tacrolimus develop diabetes and must take insulin while taking 
tacrolimus.  
Rarely, patients receiving tacrolimus may develop low platelets and kidney 
problems th at require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639511], which can increase the risk of 
GVHD.  This condition, called TTP/HUS Syndrome, can also be life -threatening.  
It is very important that you do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice.  
Grapefruit has an ingredient ca lled bergamottin, which can affect some of the 
treatment drugs, including tacrolimus, used in this study.   Common soft drinks 
that have bergamottin are Fresca, Squirt and Sunny Delight . 
▪ Sirolimus:  This medication is used to try to prevent GVHD.  The immediate side 
effects you may experience include fast heart rate, pain during breathing, shortness 
of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting.  Other side effects you may experience 
include pale skin, easy bruising, fever, chills, body aches, night sweats,  swelling in 
your face, stomach, hands or feet, pain or burning when you urinate, headache or 
skin rash.  If you experience these effects, they generally go away when the dose of 
the medication is decreased.

Sirolimus may increase your risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639512].  
Talk with your doctor about your specific cancer risk . 
Rarely, patients receiving sirolimus may develop low platelets and kidney problems 
that require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639513], which can increase the risk of GVH D.  This 
condition, called TTP/HUS Syndrome, can also be life -threatening.  
It is very important that you do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice.  
Grapefruit has an ingredient called bergamottin, which can affect some of the 
treatment drugs, includ ing tacrolimus, used in this study.   Common soft drinks 
that have bergamottin are Fresca, Squirt and Sunny Delight.  
▪ Mycophenolate Mofetil: MMF is a potent immunosuppressive drug that blocks the 
growth of the immune cells that can cause GVHD.  Side-effects you might 
experience include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, infection, low blood counts, 
serious  injury to your gut (digestive tract) including bloody stools and vomit, 
secondary cancers, such as lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma, serious 
infections of the brain, risk to an unborn child, or Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML).  
▪ Cyclophosphamide:  This is a chemotherapy drug that works by [CONTACT_639578][INVESTIGATOR_639514].  Side-effects  you might experience include nausea and 
vomiting , bone marrow suppression , stomach ache, diarrhea,  darkening of the skin 
or nails, hair loss ( alopecia ) or thinning of hair, changes in color and texture of the 
hair, and feeling  tired.  Blood in your urine ( hemorrhagic cystitis ) is a  common 
complication.  Although it is used to treat cancer, it may increase your risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_639515], sometimes months to years after treatment.  
 
▪ Methotrexate:  This is also a medication used to try to prevent GVHD.  
Methotrexate causes damage to cells, and therefore can affect many different tissues 
of your body.  It may cause or can worsen the mouth sores or inflammation of the 
mouth which you may have already developed from the procedures and medications 
used to pre pare you for the transplant.  Methotrexate may slow down the recovery 
of blood cells after transplantation.  Methotrexate can cause kidney damage.  If your 
kidneys are already damaged for other reasons, it can worsen kidney function. If 
kidney damage does occur, the methotrexate dose may be reduced or the medication 
may not be given at all.  
▪ Tacrolimus and Methotrexate:   These medications interfere with the body’s 
defense system (the immune system).  This may cause you to have more infections 
(especially vir al infections and pneumonia) for several months after transplant .

B-14 D. Risks Related to the Transplant Procedure  
The following risks are part of the transplant process and not connected  to any one 
medication or the transplanted donor cells.  
− Bleeding: Platelets help your blood to clot.   Your platelets will be low until the new 
bone marrow grows and, as a result, bleeding may occur.  This can be minor 
bleeding, such as nosebleeds or bruising, but more serious, life -threatening bleeding 
in the lungs and brain can occur if the platelet count  remains low.  Usually, there is 
success in preventing major bleeding problems with transfusions of platelets.  
However, some patients may not respond well to transfused platelets and may be at 
serious risk for bleeding.  
− Veno -Occlusive Disease (VOD):  This can occur as a result of high dose 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or medications used to prevent GVHD.  VOD 
causes severe damage to the liver.  Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin 
and eyes), weight gain, and extra fluid build -up in the a bdominal cavity and other 
parts of the body.  It can often be managed successfully, and completely resolve.  
However, complications can arise that may be fatal.  
− Mouth Sores and Diarrhea:  The large doses of chemotherapy and radiation cause 
irritation in the  lining of the mouth and intestines.  This can result in painful mouth 
sores and diarrhea.  If you have severe mouth sores you will be given medicine to 
help control the pain.  If your mouth sores are severe you may not be able to eat 
normally until the so res are healed.  Mouth sores get better when the white blood 
count starts to rise, and engraftment occurs.  
− Capi[INVESTIGATOR_92306]:  This may occur as a result of chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy.  The blood vessels may become ‘leaky’ and fluid enters the  
abdominal cavity, lungs, and other tissues.  You may gain water weight and not go to 
the bathroom as often as you normally do.  Capi[INVESTIGATOR_639516] , and can be 
life-threatening .  You may die if there is continued fluid collection in the lungs.  
− Unexpected Organ Damage and Other Side Effects:  It is possible you may 
experience unexpected, life -threatening heart, lung, kidney, or liver damage as a 
result of the tran splant.  Occasionally, the high doses of chemotherapy and radiation 
cause severe lung damage that cannot always be treated.  If this happens, you may 
need to use oxygen or even a respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521].  The lung damage may get worse and be life -
threatening.  Rarely, multi -organ failure (such as lung and kidney failure) may occur, 
which is often fatal.  
− Late Effects:  You may experience side effects that occur several months to many 
years after your transplant.  You may experience poor function of the thyroid gland, 
requiring you to take thyroid medication.  As a result of radiation, cataracts may 
occur earlier in life compared to a person who had not had a transplant.  If you 
develop cataracts (cloudiness in the eyes) they may require treatment.  It is rare, but 
your kidneys could be affected, causing anemia (low red blood cell count) or high 
blood pressure.  There is also a risk you may develop a second cancer as a resu lt of 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
B-15 the chemotherapy, radiation and/or underlying disease.  If secondary cancers occur 
they generally do not occur until 10 to 15 years after the transplant.  The long -term 
effects upon heart, lung, and brain are unknown.  
− Fluid Build -up: You will receive  intravenous fluids during the transplant process and 
your body may have trouble eliminating this fluid.  
 
E Additional Side Effects for People with HIV  
Most of the risks in this Consent Form can happen to all patients undergoing transplant, 
but some, such as risk of infection or organ damage, may be different in patients with 
HIV.  There is a risk that a temporary stop to antiretroviral treatment could le ad to HIV 
resistance to the medications you are taking.   
Your HIV viral load will be monitored by [CONTACT_639579], alternate  antiretroviral therapy may be needed.    
Many of the medications used for HIV will react with imp ortant medications to reduce 
the complications of the transplant (HCT).  These reactions may require frequent blood 
checks to make sure the amount of medications in the blood are correct.  It is possible 
those medications interactions will result in compli cations.  
      F    Enfuvirtide  
Enfuvirtide may be given to you  by [CONTACT_639580][INVESTIGATOR_639517] . The following risks are associated 
with enfuvirtide:  
• Injection site reactions:  Almost all people have skin reactions at the site where 
enfuvirtide is injected. Reactions may include:  itching, swelling, redness, pain or 
tenderness, hardened skin, bumps. Most reactions are mild. Occasionally they may be 
severe or rarely associated wi th infections or collection of thick liquid (abscess) at the 
injection site.  Individuals receiving bone marrow transplant may have more serious 
reactions to enfuvirtide because of low blood platelets.    
• Lung infection (pneumonia). You should contact [CONTACT_639581] a cough, fever, or trouble breathing.   
• Serious allergic reactions. Symptoms may include: trouble breathing, fever, nausea, 
vomiting, chills, shakes, skin rash, blood in your urine, swelling in your feet, dizziness, 
severe muscle weakness starting in your feet and quickly moving to your upper body 
(Guillain -Barre syndrome). Contact [CONTACT_639582]. Enfuvirtide 
should not be restarted if your doctor thinks that you had an allergic reaction that was 
related to enfuvirtide.  
• Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet  
• Difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Depression, or anxiety  
• Decreased appetite  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
B-16 • Sinus infections and other infections in other places, including the skin (herpes), and the 
blood  (sepsis)  
• Swollen glands (lymphadenopathy)  
• Muscle pain  
• Constipation     
 
G Infections  
You will need to take several antibiotics to prevent infection.  You will also be watched 
carefully for any infections while you are being treated for  HIV related Leukemia or 
Lymphoma.   Tell your doctors right away if you get a fever, chills, cough or any other 
symptoms that might be a sign of an infection.   Infections may be bad enough to cause 
death.  
H Reproductive Risks  
Risk to the unborn:  The treatments in this study have NOT been proven to be safe at any 
stage of pregnancy.  Therefore, if you are pregn ant or nursing, you are not eligible for 
this study.  Women who have the potential of becoming pregnant must use some form of 
effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy and GVHD prophylaxis.  Effective 
birth control is defined as the following:  
1) Refraining from all acts of vaginal intercourse (ABSTINENCE)  
2) Consistent use of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  
3) Inject ed birth control methods (Depro -Provera, Norplant)  
4) Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy  
5) Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device)  
6) Use, with every act of intercourse, of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or 
condoms with contraceptive foam.  
 
Sterility and future childbearing potential for men and women:  Chemotherapy and/or 
irradiation may affect your abi lity to have children .  Male patients may become sterile 
(unable to produce sperm) and should discuss with their doctor regarding sperm banking 
prior to transplantation.   Female patients who have attained puberty may find that their 
menstrual cycle become s irregular or stops permanently.  However, this DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT BECOME PREGNANT, and you must use some 
effective method of birth control during transplant and afterwards until you are off 
GVHD prophylaxis.  Damage to reproductive tissue may result in infertility (inability to 
have children).  It is not known if the damage could result in birth defects.  
You should discuss risks and options in detail with your doctor before entering this study.

18. CCR5 Donor Screening  
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) uses a protein called CCR5 as a way to get inside of 
cells.  A few people are naturally able to block HIV infection because their body does not make 
the CCR5 protein.  As a result, HIV d oes not have a way to enter their cells and cause an 
infection.  
 
Proteins are in every cell in our body and help keep the blood, skin and other parts of our bodies 
healthy.  Every protein is made by a specific kind of gene.  Every person has [ADDRESS_855489] for 
changes to a gene is mutation.  Changes to the CCR5 gene means the body can’t make the CCR5 
protein.  People who have [ADDRESS_855490] for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855491] Nile virus (WNV) very well.  WNV spreads 
through mosquito bites.  Serious cases of WNV can cause a brain infection.  
 
In addition to doing the standard tests to make sure a donor is a good mat ch for you, we will also 
test possible donors to see if they have the CCR5 gene mutations.  This testing will not slow 
down our search for your donor.  We will let you know i f we find a donor and if that donor has 
the CCR5 mutations.  At that point, you an d your doctor will need to decide if you want to use a 
donor with or without the CCR5 mutations.

Blood Samples for Research (optional)  
Please note:  This section of the informed consent form is about future research studies that 
will be done using blood samples from people who are taking part in the main study described 
above.  You may give small blood samples for these future research studies if you w ant to.  
You can still be a part of the main study even if you say 'no' to giving blood samples for future 
research studies.  You can say "yes" or "no" to giving blood samples for future research 
studies.  Please mark your choice at the end of this section . 
 
We would like to have one small (4 teaspoons or 17 mL) blood sample for future research.  If 
you agree, this sample will be obtained pre -transplant.  It will be kept and may be used in 
research to learn more about HIV, cancer and other diseases.  Usuall y the blood can be drawn 
from your central venous catheter at the time of the other blood collections.  If this is not 
possible, it will be taken from a vein.  When the sample is given to investigators for research, no 
information about your name, address,  phone number or other information that will let the 
researcher know who you are will be provided.  
 
The samples collected for research purposes will be sent to the AIDS  and Cancer Specimen 
Resource Repository.  The samples will be labeled with unique codes  that do not contain 
information that could identify you.  A link to this code does exist.  The link is stored at the Data 
and Coordinating Center for the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT 
CTN).  The staff at the repository where you r sample is being stored does not have a link to this 
code.  Your research samples will continue to be stored at the ACSR Repository until they are 
used up for approved research.

B-22 DNA from your stored blood and tissue samples and your health information mi ght be used 
in genome -wide association (GWA) studies for a future project  either done or supported by 
[CONTACT_7681] (NIH).   
 
Genome -wide association studies are a way for scientists to identify genes involved in human 
disease.  This me thod searches the genome for small genetic changes that are more common 
in people with a particular disease than in people without the disease.  Each study can look at 
hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time.  Researchers use data from th is 
type of study to find genes that may add to a person’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a certain disease.   If 
your coded genetic and clinical information is used in such a study, the researcher is required 
to add the DNA test results and non -identifying information into a public research database.  
This public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed 
by [CONTACT_29070] (NCBI).  The NCBI will never have 
any information that would identify you, or li nk you to your information or research samples.   
 
A new federal law (2009), called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 
generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 
[ADDRESS_855492] on your care.  
 
Things to Think About: The choice to let us have blood samples for future research is up to 
you.  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
 
If you decide now that your blood can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any 
time.  Just contact [CONTACT_639586].  Then any blood that remains will no longer be used for research.  
 
In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more about your 
health .  While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may give the researchers 
reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other 
information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
 
Someti mes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families).  
Even if your blood is used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health

Study Title : Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Hemato logical Cancers and 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes in HIV -Infected Individuals  
 
Protocol : BMT CTN 0903  (AMC 080)  
 
A. Why am I here?  
We are inviting you to join our study because you have HIV (human immunodeficiency 
virus) and you need a transplant to treat your blood cancer.  
 
B. Why are you doing this study?  
We are doing this study because we want to learn how well hematopoietic cell transplant 
treats blood cancers in people like you who have HIV.  The kind of transplant we would do 
for you would use blood or b one marrow from another person who matches you.  This is 
called an allogeneic transplant.  
 
This form gives you information to help you decide if you want to be in this study.  You 
should read this form and ask any questions you have before agreeing to be i n the study.  It is 
up to you to decide if you want to be in the study.   
 
C. What will happen to me?  
Before enrolling on study:  
Your doctor will check to see if you have a type matched donor for your transplant.  You will 
have several tests to see if it is o kay for you to be on this study.  
 
Before the transplant:  
You will have several tests done to check your organ function.  These tests will check your 
heart, lungs, and brain.  Most of these tests are X -rays or scans, questions, or blood tests.  
The doctors  will look at the results of all these tests to make sure that it is okay for you to 
have a transplant.   
 
You will also need to have several tests for research.  We will ask if we can take some blood 
from you up to 4 times (10 -47 mL or about 2 -13 teaspoons) with a very small needle.  Eight 
weeks before your transplant, we will also ask to take more blood from you (about 36 
teaspoons) only if the HIV in your body does not show up in a standard test.  
 
Preparation for the transplant:  
Before the transplant, you will need to receive medicines so that your body can accept the 
new bone marrow cells.  This is called a  ‘conditioning regimen.’   
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855496]-transplant follow -up and care:  
After the transplant you will continue to get medicines to help the donor cells grow.  These 
drugs will also help lower the chance of getting graft -versus -host disease (GVHD).  GVHD 
is a complication that happens when the donor’s cells attack your body.  You will receive one 
or more medicines to prevent GVHD.  You will continue to receive these dr ugs for at least 
six months after the transplant.  
 
You will be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504018].  You will be allowed to 
go home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504019].  After you go home you will 
need to return to v isit your doctors so they can check your recovery.  Your doctors will need 
to check your blood and bone marrow after the transplant to make sure the new blood cells 
are growing in your body.  Your doctors will also do blood tests and other tests to make su re 
your organs are working well. The study team will also check in with you weekly to see if 
you missed any HIV medicines or certain medicines used as part of the transplant.  
 
This study will last for [ADDRESS_855497] several tests for research.  We will take some blood from you up 
to 7 times (about 2 -14 teaspoons each time) with a very small needle.  Also, 13 months after 
your transplant, we will as k to take more blood from you (about 36 teaspoons) only if the 
HIV in your body still does not show up in a standard test.  
 
Optional Test for Future Research  
Between 1 and 3 weeks prior to your transplant, we will ask your permission to take some 
more blo od (about 6 teaspoons of blood) from you to use for future research.  
 
You don't have to be in this research.  If you don't want to give blood samples for future 
research you can still be in the other parts of the study.  Your care will not be changed if 
you decide not to give these blood samples for research purposes.  Please mark your choice 
below (check only one box):  
 
❑ I do agree to give a  blood sample for research .  
❑ I do not  agree to give a blood sample  for research.

B-29 D. Will it hurt?  
When you have your blood taken with a needle, it may feel like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_820].  It will hurt for a 
minute and sometimes the place where the needle went might be red and sore.  You might get 
a little bruise where the blood was taken but it goes away in a few days.  
 
E. What are the risks of being in this study?  
 
The drugs may cause a skin rash, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and infections.  
Your blood counts will fall and you may get fevers, infections or start bleeding.  You may 
also get mouth sores.  These are temporary and you will feel better as you r new bone marrow 
grows.   
 
Since you will not be able to fight infections while your new bone marrow is growing back, 
you may need to get antibiotics.  You may also need to get blood transfusions since your new 
bone marrow will not be making new blood cel ls right away.   
 
Even with medicines to prevent it, you may get GVHD.  This can cause skin rash, vomiting, 
diarrhea, stomach pain, lung and liver problems, swelling of the hands and feet, dry eyes, 
stiff joints, and tiredness.  These problems are usually mild but can become very serious and 
prolonged.  Medicines are given to prevent GVHD during and after transplant.  If GVHD 
occurs even after taking these medicines, other medicines will need to be started and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639519].  The medicines  used to treat GVHD also have side effects.  They can 
cause tiredness, depression, sleep problems and mood swings.  They can also make you get 
severe infections very easily.  Your doctors will do their best to make you feel better and 
keep you safe.  Often  this may require many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].  However, it is important to 
understand that there is a small risk (about a 1 in 10 chance) that you may die as a result of 
one or more of the complications of unrelated donor transplantation.   
 
F. Will the study help m e? 
You may or may not benefit from taking part in this study.  
 
G. What if I have questions?  
You can ask us any questions that you have about the study.  If you forget to ask a question 
and think of it later, you can call me [ insert office number ].  You can also ask your question 
the next time you see me.  
You can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study.  
 
H. Do I have to be in this study?  
It is up to you if you want to participate in this research study.  If you don’t want to be in the 
study, you can tell us and your parent or guardian.  Your doctor will not be upset or angry if 
you don’t want to join.  You can say yes now and change your m ind at any time.  If you

I. Can t he doctor who is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_504020]?   
You can be taken off the study (with or without your consent) for any of the following 
reasons:  
• You need a medical treatment not allowed in this study  
• The investigator decides that continuing in the study would be harmful to you  
• You become pregnant and the study participation could be harmful to the fetus  
• The study is cancelled by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) or the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH)

C-2 APPENDIX C  
 
LABORATORY PROCEDURES  
 
 
1. MICROBIAL TRANSLOCATION MARKERS: CHARACTERIZATION OF THE 
RATES, SPECTRUM, RISK FACTORS, AND OUTCOMES OF INFECTIONS  
 
HCT -related risk factors for infection (time to engraftment, degree of mucositis, duration of 
neutropenia) and HIV -related (CD4, VL, HAART r esistance) risk factors will be 
investigated.  Specimens will be collected to allow the analysis of the relationship of 
microbial translocation markers to febrile neutropenia and infectious outcomes.  
 
Background  
Recent observations that persons with chroni c HIV -1 infection and AIDS demonstrate 
increased microbial translocation (MT) from the gut compared to uninfected persons may be 
related to the massive depletion of intestinal CD4+ lymphocytes within weeks of HIV -1 
acquisition  (1).  Our group also recently  demonstrated that microbial translocation in HIV -
HCV co -infection was strongly associated with more rapid progression of liver cirrhosis.  A 
key finding was that serum endotoxin (LPS) level, a marker of microbial translocation, was 
higher in patients with  more advanced fibrosis (2).  The detection of microbial translocation 
in peripheral blood likely underestimates the higher quantities of microbial products that 
enter the portal venous circulation with resulting sequelae in the liver.   
 
Previous studies have shown that HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639520] -occlusive disease (VOD) (3).  VOD is a condition  that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_639589] s and occlusion.  LPS is known to have a procoagulant effect by [CONTACT_639590], tissue 
factor (4).  Therefore, a high level of circulating MT markers (such as LPS) at the time o f 
transplant could be a risk factor for development of early hepatic VOD.  Moreover, 
monitoring serum levels temporally to explore associations with liver associated morbidity 
including VOD, may provide insights into defining risk factors for VOD.  The lon g-term goal 
of this approach is to provide a rational basis for targeted antimicrobial therapy to reduce 
microbial translocation in patients at higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_254892].   
 
Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that increased microbial translocation in HIV infected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639521] -occlusive disease after 
autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.   
 
Study Objectives  
We propose testing archived sera for microbial translocation markers from HIV -infected 
persons who have received allogeneic stem cell transplant.  Microbial translocation marker 
levels will then be correlated with clinical outcome (hyperbilirubinemia, develop ment of 
VOD, death) as patients are followed longitudinally.

C-3  
Study Design  
Clinical data that will be obtained at baseline will include age, gender, race, HCV RNA 
levels, HIV RNA levels, CD4+ lymphocyte count, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, antibiotic 
usage wi thin the prior 6 weeks, antiretroviral therapy, MELD score, and a history of liver -
related complications.   
 
Microbial Translocation Measurements  
Markers of microbial translocation that will be tested include plasma LPS, LPS -binding 
protein (LBP), soluble CD14 (sCD14), and the polyclonal IgM antibody directed toward the 
LPS core polysaccharide (EndoCAb IgM).  LPS testing will be done using the Limulus 
Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay (Lonza), while LBP (Cell Sciences), sCD14 (R&D 
Systems), and EndoCAb IgM (Hycu lt Biotechnology) assays are all standard plate -based 
ELISA tests.  Microbial translocation markers will be log -transformed to normalize the data, 
as has been done previously.  Values of the LAL assay < 10 pg/mL are considered below the 
linear range of the  assay and will be considered 5 pg/mL (mean of 0 and 10 pg/mL) for 
standard calculations.

C-4 2. HIV SINGLE COPY PCR ASSESSMENT AND LATENT HIV RESERVOIR 
MEASUREMENTS: CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV INFECTION IN AIDS 
RELATED MALIGNANCIES  
 
Background and Rationale  
The effect of marrow ablative and reduced intensity  chemotherapy on the HIV reservoir is 
not known, but the model of AIDS -related malignancies  treatment does provide an 
opportunity to define changes which are associated with HCT.  In the current study, we 
propose to characterize the HIV infection during and after such treatment of h ematological 
malignancies  and Myelodysplastic syndromes , by [CONTACT_639591] [ADDRESS_855502] 
application of this single copy PCR technique to such conditioning therapi[INVESTIGATOR_639522] —although the approach has been used multi -institutional 
studies of antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

3. IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION ASSAYS (RESEARCH): IMMUNOPHENOTYPIC 
AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF IMMUNE RECONSITUTION  
 
Background and Rationale:  
Little is known about immune reconstitution following allogeneic hematopoietic  cell 
transplantation to treat patients with hematologic malignancies in pati ents with HIV infection.  
Multiple variables including adaptive immune dysfunction and chronic viral infections raise the 
possibility that HIV+ patients will encounter more infectious complications compared to HIV - 
individuals following hematopoietic  cell transplantation.  It will therefore, be critical to perform 
correlative laboratory investigations examining adaptive and innate immune surveillance in this 
very unique setting. The use of multiparametric flow cytometry to identify specific adaptive and 
innate immune cell subsets, and use of available pathogen -specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_639525] -ASCT.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
C-6 Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that quantitative and qualitative differences in adaptive and innate immune 
reconstitution will correlate with clinical outcome in HIV+ patients who undergo allogeneic 
hematopoietic  cell transplantation.  Improved understanding of immune reconstitution in this 
very unique setting will lead to advances in the management of HIV+ patients with cancer and 
lead to novel approaches to improve long term survival of these patients.    
 
Study Design:  
Immunophenotypic Evaluation of T and NK Cell  Subset s: To date no compreh ensive mu lti 
time point study has been performed to evaluate reconstitution of adaptive immunity in HIV+ 
patients treated with peripheral blood hematopoietic  cell transplantation.  Examining the nature 
of adaptive and innate immune reconstitution will invo lve use of a multi panel flow cytometric 
assay to track changes in naïve, memory, activated and regulatory T cell subsets. Specifically, 
these studies will involve a detailed in vivo analysis of early, mid, early -late and late activation 
of B and T lymphoc ytes and characterization of T cell subsets including naïve, memory, Th1, 
Th2 and T regulatory cells.  In addition we will evaluate maturation status of NK cells and their 
activation status.  Multiparametric flow analysis will be performed on fresh periphe ral blood 
samples collected at 60, [ADDRESS_855508]  stem cell infusion.  
 
 
 
Samples of ACD (yellow top) and EDTA (lavender top) anticoagulant containing blood will be 
received at the pr oject laboratory within 24h following collection and processed immediately 
upon receipt in the clinical flow cytometry laboratory.  Prior to staining, all samples will be 
analyzed for viability using 7AAD method.   Only samples with mononuclear cell viabili ty 
> 90% will be considered acceptable for further analysis.  Viability of >95% is achieved in ACD 
tubes stored at room temperature for up to 48 hours.  All samples will be stained using a 
PrepPlus2 automated staining system (Beckman Coulter) utilizing a f ive color whole blood 
staining technique with panels of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies (see Tables 1 and 2) 
used in quantities that have been predetermined and standardized in our flow cytometric 
laboratory.  Following 30 minutes of incubation a t room temperature in the dark, red cells will be 
lysed using a Q -prep instrument and Coulter Lyse reagent according to manufacturer’s 
recommendations.  Samples will be analyzed on FC500 flow cytometer equipped with CXP 
software version 2.1 (all equipment and reagents by [CONTACT_639593]).  Multiparametric 
analysis will be performed with a gating strategy based on CD45 staining and light side scatter 

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV + Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
C-7 characteristics that allow adequate separation of lymphocyte, monocyte and myeloid cell 
populations.  Detaile d immunophenotypic characterization of the lymphocyte gate will be 
performed using Prism plot algorithm (Beckman Coulter). The results will be reported as percent 
of lymphocyte gate and as percent of total leukocytes analyzed.  The results will also be rep orted 
as an absolute number of specific cell subset types per microliter of whole blood. Absolute cell 
number will be calculated based on duel platform method using percent of lymphocytes 
expressing specific immunophenotypic profile (derived from prism plo t) and absolute number of 
lymphocytes derived from analysis of each whole blood sample using ActDIFF hematology 
analyzer (Beckman Coulter).  
 
Functional Evaluation of Adaptive Immune Reconstitution : We will serially evaluate 
adaptive cellular immunity by [CONTACT_639594].  We will follow 
responsiveness to HIV as well as common viral pathogens like CMV and EBV.  Studies will use 
pools of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15 -18mer peptides from full -length viral proteins (JPT Technologies) 
encoded by [CONTACT_46064] (pp65), EBV (BZLF1) and HIV (gag).  Aliquots of frozen PBMCs will be 
thawed and enumerated.  1x106 PBMCs will be cultured in the presence of individual viral 
pooled peptide preparat ions (or actin control pooled peptides, 1ug/ml final concentration) in the 
presence or absence of agonistic anti CD28 monoclonal antibody to control for costimulatory 
signals and provide an optimal condition for evaluation of responsiveness.  Following ove rnight 
incubation (in presence of brefeldin A golgi plug reagent), a multi color flow cytometric 
evaluation will identify CD3/CD8 subsets that costain with IFN  or CD107a (degranulation 
marker). Separate controls with 7AAD will evaluate PBMC viability.  1 x 105 CD3+ events will 
be collected using a FC500 flow cytometer and percentage of CD3/CD8+ T cells staining 
positive for IFN  and or CD107a will be determined.  Outcome of these bioassays will be 
correlated with immunophenotypic and clinical patient data.    
 
Functional Evaluation of Innate Immune Reconstitution : Innate immune reconstitution 
studies will examine natural killer (NK) cell responsiveness to cytokines and to Fc RIIIa 
signaling.  NK cell responsiveness assays will be performed on purified NK cel ls that will be 
isolated via rosette -sep immuno selection kits.  To test cytokine responsiveness, 1x105 NK cells 
will be incubated overnight in standard culture medium (supplemented with human AB serum) 
in interleukin 2 (IL -2 10nM) +/ - IL-12 (10ng/ml).  To  evaluate Fc RIIIa responsiveness, 2 
methods will be employed: (i) Immobilized IgG in presence or absence of IL12; and (ii) anti 
FcRIIIa monoclonal antibody treatment +/ - IL12.  For FcgRIIIa signaling studies, 96 -well flat -
bottom plates will be coated wit h 100 g/mL huIgG in cold PBS overnight at 4°C, washed with 
cold PBS, and then plated with immune cells (2 x 105 cells/well) +/ - 10 ng/mL IL -12 (or saline 
control).  At 24 and 48 hours cell -free culture supernatants will be harvested and analyzed for 
level s of IFN - by [CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, 
MN).  NK cells will be checked for viability following the overnight pretreatment period and 
again at the conclusion of the experiment.  The readout for the assay will be IFN - measured by 
[CONTACT_639595]  and CD107a expression determined by [CONTACT_4133] (as in 
adaptive immune reconstitution studies) at 24 and 48 hrs.  FcRIIIa responsiveness can also be 
tested via use of anti Fc RIIIa mAb (clone 3G8) to cross lin k receptors +/ - IL12 and IFN  and 
CD107a detected via flow cytometry.  Positive controls will include PBMCs collected from 
immune -competent individuals, purified NK cells from immune -competent individuals incubated

  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
C-8 with IL2 + IL12, IL -15 + IL -18 and IL -15 + IL -21.  We will correlate the outcome of these 
biologic studies with immunophenotypic studies examining NK cell subsets and clinical patient 
data.  
 
Correlative Evaluation of Immune Reconstitution Studies:  
Immunophenotypic and functional immune reconsti tution studies will produce quantitative and 
qualitative data that can be compared to multiple clinical and laboratory outcomes in this unique 
setting.  Specifically:  
1) Clinical outcome: Recovery of specific T and NK cell subsets and functional immune 
respo nsiveness in the above assays can be compared to (a) documented infections post 
transplant (bacterial, fungal, viral) CR; (b) lymphoma disease free survival; (c) overall 
survival.  
2) Laboratory comparisons: immunophenotypic and functional immune reconstituti on can 
be compared to the following laboratory correlates , such as : chronic viral 
infection/reactivation (EBV, CMV, HIV).  
 
Statistical Components:  
Immune reconstitution results will be summarized at each post -transplant time point using 
descriptive statis tics.  Individual T, B and NK cell subsets identified by [CONTACT_639596].  Statistical evaluation of functional studies evaluating adaptiv e and innate 
immune reconstitution will be reported as percentage of mononuclear cell subsets staining 
positive for IFN  or granzyme B relative to control conditions.  Two sided T tests will be 
employed for evaluation of statistical significance with p <0.05 considered significant.

TREATMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE  
 
 
The treating institution will review patients with the Treatment Review Committee prior to the 
initiation of transplant therapy by a five member review panel composed of experts in HIV drug 
resistance, HIV care, pha rmacology, transplant infectious diseases and oncology.  
Recommendations  for transplant are based on data contained in the patient registration and pre -
transplant forms, as well as in supporting documentation, which includes the following:  
− Current Diagnosi s 
− Past Medical History  
− Prior ARV  History  
− Documented ARV  Drug Toxicities  
− Drug Allergies  
− History of HLA B57 Antigen Testing, if available  
− Current Creatinine and Liver Function Tests  
− Past and Recent HIV Drug Resistance Test Results, if applicable  
− Current ARV  Drug Regimen  
− Current Concomitant Medications  
 
The Committee will review available past and current HIV -[ADDRESS_855518] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855519] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855520] will include prophylaxis for:  
1. Bacteria :  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_83472].  
2. Pneumocystis Jiroveci  Pneumonia:   Prophylaxis will be administered until CD4 counts 
are >200 and for a minimum of 6 months.  Several effective regimens are available. 
Patient tolerance (nausea, allergic reaction, G6PD or other considerations) may 
contraindicate a particular regimen.  Cho ices in order of preference are: 1) TMP/SMX 1 
DS daily; 2) TMP/SMX 1 SS daily; 3) Dapsone 100 mg daily (may be decreased to 50 
mg daily if given in combination with pyrimethamine as described below for 
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis; 4)  Atovaquone 1500 mg daily ; and, 5) Aerosolized or IV 
pentamidine monthly , or per institutional standard . 
3. Toxoplasmosis:   Patients on TMP/SMX do not require additional prophylaxis. If 
toxoplasma IgG is positive and TMP/SMX cannot be used patients should be prophylaxed 
for at least [ADDRESS_855521] and until CD4>100.  This prophylaxis may be either: 1) 
dapsone 50 mg po daily and pyrimethamine 50 mg/week and leucovorin 25 mg/week or 
2) atovaquone 1500 mg daily plus pyrimethamine 25 mg/day plus leucovorin 10 mg/day .  
Since all medica tions for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis are oral, and some patients may be 
unable to take po medications in the peri -transplant period, PCR for toxoplasmosis should 
be checked at least weekly whenever prophylaxis must be held in toxoplasma IgG 
positive patient s for more than a week and the CD4 count is less than 100.  
4. Fungi :  Anti -fungal prophylaxis will be per local institutional practice. It is noted that in 
histoplasma endemic areas (Midwest and Puerto Rico) antifungal prophylaxis is standard 
for CD4 <[ADDRESS_855522] and until 
CD4>150.  (See Appendix F for detailed interactions with antiretroviral medications.)  
5. HSV/VZV:   One of the following regimens should be used for [ADDRESS_855523], unless the patient remains on immunosuppressive Acyclovir 
400 - 800 mg bid, valaciclovir 500 mg bid, or famciclovir 500 mg po bid.  
6. M. Avium Complex (MAC ):  If CD4 less than 50, Azithromycin suggested at 1200 mg q 
week or 600 mg twice weekly.  
7. Hepatiti s: 
a. Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen should be evaluated for viral 
DNA replication (viral load) by a quantitative PCR method before enrolling the 
patient on the study.  
b. Lamivudine or newer generation of anti -hepatitis B agents, like tenofo vir, should 
be started in those with detectable Hepatitis B viral load according to institutional 
preferences.  The goal of the treatment should be achieving undetectable (<500 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) viral load status.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855524] be performed in patients with Hepatitis -B or C infections if the 
severity assessment of liver disease based on Child -Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) 
classificat ion indicates all of the following criteria; Serum bilirubin > 2, serum 
albumin < 3.5, and INR > 1.7 
f. Patients with no pathologic evidence of irreversible chronic liver disease such as 
bridging necrosis and/or significant fibrosis can be eligible for the st udy.

Complex interactions exist between 
ritonavir and cyclophosphamide or 
acrolein. Cyclophosphamide levels may be 
increased when combined with protease 
inhibitors, but the active metabolites may 
be decreased.  
 
NNRTIs may increase levels of acrolein 
through CYP induction.  Other CYP 
inducers like phenytoin have been shown 
to increase the AUC of active metabolites 
by 50%.  
 
 
Strength of evidence: LOW  Raltegravir -Based:  May continue HAART as tolerated  
 
NNRTI -Based: Regimens including NNRTIs should be used

• Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r)  
• Fosamprenavir/ritonavir (fAPV/r)  
• Indinavir/ritonavir (IND/r)  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir (LPV/r)  
• Saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r)  
• Tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r)  ↑↑↑ Sirolimus Levels 3, 8 
 
May result in severe and 
prolonged sirolimus toxicity.  
 
 Potent inhibition of 
CYP3A4 and P -
glycoprotein  Hold sirolimus upon initiation of ARV  and monitor trough levels 
daily  
Based on level:  
• < 3 ng/mL:  Administer 0.4 mg (PO)  
• 3 - 12 ng/mL:  Administer 0.3 mg (PO)  
• >12 ng/mL:  HOLD sirolimus until next le vel 
Once dosing is stable, sirolimus levels may be monitored 
according to local guidelines.  
Protease Inhibitors (unboosted)  
• Atazanavir (ATZ)  
• Nelfinavir (NFV)  ↑↑ Sirolimus Levels 13 
 
May res ult in severe and 
prolonged sirolimus toxicity.  
 Strong inhibition of 
CYP3A4  Hold sirolimus upon initiation of ARV  and monitor trough levels 
daily  
 
Based on level:  
• < 3 ng/mL:  Administer 0.4 mg (PO)  
• 3 - 12 ng/mL:  Administer 0.3 mg (PO)  
• >12 ng/mL:  HOLD sirolimus until next level  
 
Once dosing is stable, sirolimus levels may be monitored 
according to local guidelines.  
NNRTIs  
• Efavirenz (EFV)  
• Nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (NVP)  ↓ Sirolimus Levels  
 
 
 
 Strong induction of 
CYP3A4  Continue sirolimus at the same dose and monitor trough levels 
daily.  
 
Based on level:  
• < 3 ng/mL:  Increase sirolimus daily dose by 25%  
• 3 - 12 ng/mL:  No adjustment  
• >12 ng/mL: Decrease sirolimus daily dose by 25%  
 
Full induction effects may take up to two we eks.  Daily sirolimus 
doses are substantially increased for most patients with co -
administration of NNRTIs.  Efavirenz is a more potent inducer of 
CYP3A4 than is nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  HCT for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855533] on Sirolimus  Mechanism  Recommendation  
NNRTIs  
• Etravirine (ETV)  ↓↓ Sirolimus Levels  
(Thoeretical)  Potent induction of

discouraged.  
NRTIs  
• Abacavir (ABC)  
• Didanosine (ddI)  
• Emtricitabine (FTC)  
• Lamivudine (3TC)  
• Stavudine (d4T)  
• Tenofovir (TDF)  
• Zidovudine (AZT, ZDV)  None  N/A No adjustments necessary.  
 
Monitor sirolimus trough levels 2 -3 times/week.  
 
Frequent monitoring of renal function is required for those 
patients on tenofovir due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity.  
 
For patients with renal impairment, adjust NRTI doses according 
to local guidelines.  
Integrase Inhibitor  
• Raltegravir (RLV)  None  N/A No adjustments necessary.   
Monitor sirolimus trough levels 2 -3 times/week.  
 
Raltegravir based regimens may be preferred over PI - or NNRTI - 
based regimens as it is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation 
and not by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  
Fusion Inhibitor  
• Enfuviritide (ENF, T20)  None  N/A No adjustments necessary.   
Monitor sirolimus trough levels 2 -3 times/week.

Concomitant Medication  Effect on 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy)  Mechanism  Recommendation  
Protease Inhibitors (boosted)  
• Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r)  
• Fosamprenavir/ritonavir (fAPV/r)  
• Indinavir/ritonavir (IND/r)  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir (LPV/r)  
• Saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r ) 
• Tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r)  The conversion of Cy (a prodrug) 
to its active metabolites will be 
delayed, resulting in increased 
levels of Cy in the serum.  Inhibition of CYP3A4  Conversion of Cy to its active metabolites will be delayed, 
resulting in reduced efficacy of Cy.  Certain metabolites may be 
increased or decreased.   
 
Hold ritonavir -boosted regimens during GVHD prophylaxis.  
Protease Inhibitors (unboosted)  
• Atazanavir (AT Z) 
• Nelfinavir (NFV)  The conversion of Cy (a prodrug) 
to its active metabolites will be 
delayed, resulting in increased 
levels of Cy in the serum.  
 Inhibition of CYP3A4  Conversion of Cy to its active metabolites will be delayed, 
resulting in reduced efficac y of Cy.  Certain metabolites may be 
increased or decreased.   
 
The concomitant use of unboosted PIs should be used with 
caution as Cy efficacy may be decreased.  Consultation with 
pharmacokinetic team is required.  
NNRTIs  
• Efavirenz (EFV)  
• Nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (NVP)  Rapid conversion of Cy to its 
active metabolites results in 
decreased Cy concentrations and 
increase levels of active 
metabolites  
 
 
 
 Induction of CYP3A4 
and CYP2B6  Dose reductions of Cy may be recommended to prevent toxicity.  
This has be en shown to be effective with other CYP inducers, 
such as phenytoin.25 
 
Monitor patients closely for toxicity from active metabolites of 
cyclophosphamide.  
NNRTIs  
• Etravirine (ETV)  Rapid conversion of Cy to its 
active metabolites results in 
decreased Cy concentrations and 
increase levels of active 
metabolites  Potent induction of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2B6  Avoid concomitant use due to the unpredictable interaction 
potential.

I. Background – The Sequential Probability Ratio Test  
 
Let 
( ; )fx be the density function for random variable X.  According to the Neyman -Pearson 
theory, the most powerful test of 
o H =:0  versus
1 1: = H  decides in favor of 
1H  if
nLc
and in favor of 
0H if
c Ln , respectively, where 
 10 ( ; ) / ( ; )n
n i i
iL f x f x  = is the likelihood 
ratio, and 
c is determined to have the size
 .  When the sample size is not fixed in advance, 
further improvement is possible by [CONTACT_110910]’s Sequential Probability Ratio T est (SPRT).  The 
SPRT continues to sample as long as 
A L Bn   for some constant 
A B [ADDRESS_855564] , and stops sampling and decides in favor of 
0H as 
soon as 
B Ln . 
 
The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error  probabilities α and

rejecting

For the SPRT with error probabilities α and

patients using 100 -day NRM as the primary endpoint.  To establish safety  we want to show that 
100-day NRM is lower than 45% with a targeted NRM probability of 15%.  This is equivalent to 
testing H 0: p ≥ 0.45 vs. H a: p ≤ 0.15.  To guard against excessive non -relapse mortality, we wish 
to construct stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639535] H 0: p = 0.45 vs. 
Ha: p = 0.15 with nominal Type I error α = .07 and Type II error β = .30.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639536] s at the end of the study.  Otherwise, the trial will continue on.   
 
Let 𝑌1,𝑌2,⋯,𝑌𝑛 be the indicator of non -relapse mortality status at day 100 for patient i where 
𝑌𝑖,𝑖=1,⋯,𝑛, are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with probability p.  Let 𝑋=∑ 𝑌𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 be the 
total number of non -relapse deaths observed by [CONTACT_4475] 100, then X is a binomial random variable 
with probability mass function  𝑓(𝑥;𝑝)=(𝑛
𝑥)𝑝𝑥(1−𝑝)(𝑛−𝑥).  The SPRT is derived based on a 
simple null and alternative hypothesis H 0: p = p0 = 0.45 vs. H a: p = p1 = 0.15 with α = .07 and β = 
.30.  Since the log -likelihood ratio for the binomial,  
𝑙𝑜𝑔[𝑓(𝑥;𝑝1)/𝑓(𝑥;𝑝0)]=𝑥𝑙𝑜𝑔 [𝑝1/𝑝0]+(𝑛−𝑥)𝑙𝑜𝑔[(1−𝑝1)/(1−𝑝0)] 
is a monotone function of x, the test has non -decreasing power function.  Theref ore, the SPRT is 
a one -sided level 0.[ADDRESS_855566] for a composite null hypothesis H 0: p ≥ 0.45 versus a composite 
alternative hypothesis H a: p ≤ 0.15 with power 1 - β = .70.  
 
In this study, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_639537] -relapse mortality is too high that it is unlikely that 
the null hypothesis would be rejected at full recruitment.  The SPRT pauses when the likelihood -

NMDP PROCEDURE  FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CCR5DELTA32 MUTATION 
HOMOZYGOUS DONORS RELATED TO BMT CTN PROTOCOL 0903  
 
 
Background  
 
A recent case report by Hütter et al. (NEJM, 2009) documented the outcome of an allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) performed f or the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) in which the well -matched donor was selected for homozygosity for the CCR5delta32 
mutation.  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639543] -infected prior to developi[INVESTIGATOR_639544] a donor could confer 
natural resistance to HIV infection in the transplanted hematopoietic and immune cel ls.  A single 
HLA -matched don or homozygous for the CCR5delta [ADDRESS_855571] for the treatment of the patient’s 
AML was performed using that donor.  Following the transplant, the re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s antiretroviral 
medications were discontinued and viral titers were monitored.  No subsequent recrudescence of 
HIV replication was detected.  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639545] a second HCT using the same donor was su ccessfully performed with continued primary 
disease remission and HIV control with undetectable HIV viral loads two years following the 
second transplant (Hütter, personal communication).  
 
The of BMT CTN [ADDRESS_855572] incidence in Nort hern Europeans (Galvani and Novembre, 2005); from 
these data, it is apparent that non -European populations manifest homozygosity too rarely to 
warrant evaluation.  Additionally, it is also known that donor ethnicity strongly correlates with 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_639546].  As a consequence, it is expected that only subject enrolled on [ADDRESS_855573] a reasonable likelihood of a suitably HLA -matched donor who also 
has CCR5delta32 homozygosity.  It is estimated that of the 15 patients to be en rolled on study, 
approximately 2/[ADDRESS_855574] a chance of having a CCR5 delta32 
homozygous donor, 30 consecutive Caucasian patients searching for a suitably matched donor 
were assessed for availability of poten tial 5/6 or 6/6 donors at HLA -A, -B, and –DRB1 using 
HapLogic 2. In that study, [ADDRESS_855575] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol [ADDRESS_855576] can be 
managed.  
 
Guiding Principles for Donor Selection on BMT CTN 0903  
1) The first priority for donor selection should be HLA matching such that an 8/8 non -
homozygous donor, including a sibling, for example, would be selected over a 7/8 
CCR5delta3 2 homozygous donor.  
2) If a sibling donor and a well -matched CCR5delta32 homozygous donor are both 
available, then the transplant team and patient should decide together which donor is to 
be selected.  
 
For Whom Will an Assessment of Donor CCR5 delta32 Homozygosity Be Done ? 
1) An attempt to identify a suitably HLA -matched donor with CCR5delta32 homozygosity 
for a patient screened and enrolled on [ADDRESS_855577] when the following minimum 
conditions are met:  
a. There is a donor with at least a 50% chance of having a 5/6 match using 
HapLogic 2 or a 7/8 match (HLA -A, -B, -C, -DR) based on HapLogic 3 
prediction when available  
2) The assumption is that, in parallel with the search for a CCR5delta32 homozygous donor, 
the standard process for identifying a d onor will be followed with typi[INVESTIGATOR_639547] (i.e. donors will be selected by [CONTACT_639607] -HLA factors, 
other than CCR5delta32 mutation status).  
3) The identification of a suitable unrelated donor must not be delayed  by [CONTACT_639608] a donor who is CCR5delta32 homozygous.  
 
Overview of the Process for Identification of a CCR5delta32 Homozygous Donor  
1) When a preliminary search for a patient on [ADDRESS_855578] Team 
will also inform the potential donor that there is a research protocol associated with 
donation and that the research component will be explained by [CONTACT_639609] a separate conversation.  
2) For donors who are available and willing to donate, then the donor information will be 
passed to th e CIBMTR Survey Research Group to inform the donor about BMT CTN 
0903 and the goal of obtaining a CCR5 delta 32 homozygous donor.   The donor will be 
asked to participate in CCR5delta32 screening and those who provide verbal agreement 
will be sent a buccal swab kit by [CONTACT_284176] a consent form to sign and return and an 
instruction sheet with the swabs.  The potential donor will return the buccal swab to the 
NMDP Sample Repository for logging and then batching to the CCR5 research testing 
laboratory.  Donors w ill be informed that CCR5 testing is unlikely to reveal 
homozygosity and unless they are contact[CONTACT_639610], then the 
result did not reveal homozygosity.  If the donor is homozygous, s/he will be counseled 
about the significance of t his finding, irrespective of whether that donor is ultimately 
chosen as the donor for an [ADDRESS_855579] for HIV+ Patients – Protocol 0903  
  Version 3.0 dated February 18, 2014  
 
 
I-3 3) The testing laboratory will provide results to the Protocol Officer or his/her NMDP 
designee and the Protocol Officer or his/her NMDP designee will notif y stakeholders as 
appropriate in the event a CCR5delta32 homozygous donor is identified (as well as all 
CCR5 homozygous donors as described above).  Confirmatory CCR5 testing will be 
performed in CLIA -certified lab at the time of donor work -up. 
4) The Protoco l Officer and/or his/her NMDP designee will assist the NMDP teams with the 
process.

Klinefelter syndrome 
 
Version Date: December 1, [ADDRESS_676023] SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  
Klinefelter  syndrome (KS/XXY) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans (1:650 
males) and represents an excellent model in which to study the interplay between genetic factors and 
reproductive hormones on neurodevelopment.  Males with KS have increased rates of verbal cognitive 
impairments, executive dysfunction, psychosocial problems, and motor skills deficits.  Testosterone deficiency 
develops during adolescence in the majority of affected males, but objective data about the psychological and 
motor effects of testosterone replacement therapy in KS is lacking. Here we propose the first -ever placebo-
controlled study of the psychological and motor effects of testosterone therapy in adolescents with KS .  We 
hypothesize that testosterone therapy initiated in early puberty in KS/XXY will lead to improvements in executive function, psychosocial functioning, and motor skills, while externalizing behaviors will remain 
unchanged. We also hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene influence 
response to testosterone therapy.  
In the proposed research project we aim to: (1) study the psychological and motor effects of 
testosterone therapy in early adolescent males with KS/XXY and (2) investigate genetic factors influencing the clinical phenotype and response to testosterone therapy in KS/XXY, including androgen- receptor (AR) 
polymorphisms and parent -of-origin of the extra X chromosome.   Our preliminary studies suggest that 
testosterone therapy started in early adolescence improves attention and self -report of personal adjustment, 
and does not lead to increased negative behaviors, and that individuals with the short CAG -repeat   
polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene have an improved response to testosterone therapy compared to the long CAG polymorphism.  To accomplish our aims, we will conduct a randomized, prospective, double-
blind, placebo- controlled trial of testosterone replacement therapy in Tanner 2- 3 males with KS/XXY, 
comparing psychological factors (executive function, attention/inhibition, verbal fluency), behavior (social adjustment, aggression) and motor skills (strength, coordination) in testosterone versus placebo after 6 and 12 
months of therapy.  We will also evaluate if polymorphisms in the AR gene and the parent -of-origin of the extra 
X chromosome are related to the clinical phenotype or response to testosterone treatment.  Results will 
influence treatment guidelines for testosterone in patients with KS/XXY and will lead to improved 
understanding of the pathophysiology of KS.  
As a subspecialist in Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics, I am committed to becoming an 
independent investigator with a research program focused on understanding the role of hormonal and genetic 
factors on neurodevelopment and behavior in children with sex chromosomal disorders and other neurogenetic 
syndromes , and in conducting clinical trials to develop evidence- based treatments to improve medical and 
psychological outcomes of children.  This application outlines five primary career development aims that w ill (1) 
lead to specialization in clinical trials design and execution for neurogenetic disorders, (2,3) enhance experience in neuropsychology and molecular diagnostic methods to enhance future research endeavors, (4) increase understanding of current neuroimaging and animal research on reproductive hormone effects on 
neurodevelopment, and (5) enhance abilities to design research in vulnerable populations of children with 
neurodevelopmental and neurogenetic disorders applying current bioethical principles. These aims will be 
reached through direct experience during the research project, mentoring sessions, personalized tutorials, and 
participation in related research discussion groups and research conferences.  Supplementary didactic 
coursework in neuropsychology, behavioral genetics, neuroendocrinology, and biostatistics will also lead to a 
Masters degree in Clinical Science.  
This research project will recruit subjects through a unique clinic called the eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic , 
and will take advantage of strong infrastructure for research and career development support at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521195] -Denver Colorado Clinical & Translational Research Institute.  I have a 
assembled a strong team of mentors and collaborators with broad and successful research careers in psychology, outcomes in sex chromosomal abnormalities, endocrinology, clinical trials, genotype- phenotype 
studies, neurogenetic syndromes, developmental disabilities, bioethics, and molecular biology.  My institution 
has committed to providing protected time for research, additional research supports including research space, research pharmacy services, statistical and database support, bioethical consultation, tuition/fees for 
coursework, and any additional supports needed to successfully complete the research project and to enhance 
my career development into an independent investigator.   
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 INTRODUCTION/SPECIFIC AIMS  
 Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common chromosomal  disorder in males (1:650), and is 
associated with elevated rates of psychological impairments  (executive function, attention, and verbal cognitive 
deficits, social and emotional disorders) and motor skills deficits . KS is associated with primary hypogonadism 
that most often develops during  adolescence, leading to the need for testosterone replacement therapy. Due to 
the lack of objective data about the effects of testosterone therapy during adolescence in KS, there is 
significant variability in clinical practice in the timing of and factors  considered when initiating testosterone . 
Although  KS treatment guidelines describe improvements in various psychological factors following 
testosterone therapy, there is only one 1988 case series in KS adults describing general improvements in 
mood, attention, and social rel ationships. [14] The specific psychological effects of testosterone therapy  have 
not been studied in adolescent males with KS . We hypothesize that starting testosterone therapy in early 
adolescence will lead to improvements in psychological factors and motor skills.  Our pre liminary, uncontrolled 
data suggests  that testosterone  improves attention and self -report of personal adjustment, and does not lead 
to increased negative behaviors.  A prospective, placebo- controlled study is needed to guide management.  
 Genetic factors inv olved in the variability of the KS phenotype have not yet been elucidated.  Preliminary 
studies suggest that polymorphisms in the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the X -chromosome and the parent -
of-origin of the extra X chromosome influence phenotypic severit y.[15-17] The long CAG -repeat polymorphism 
of the AR is less responsive to testosterone, and males with KS with the long polymorphism show more significant features (taller stature,  increased gynecomastia, decreased professional employment) compared to 
those with a short polymorphism. Our new preliminary data suggests that more significant improvements in 
psychological functioning occur in KS males with the more responsive, short pol ymorphism , indicating there 
may be different responses to testosterone therapy that are dependent on the genotype at the AR in males 
with KS . A paternal parent -of-origin of the extra X chromosome may also be associated with a more severe 
phenotype. This st udy will examine whether polymorphisms in the AR  gene or  parent -of-origin of the extra X 
chromosome influence the clinical phenotype and response to testosterone in KS.  
 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if testosterone therapy started in early puberty has beneficial 
psychological and motor effects in adolescents with KS , we will conduct a randomized, prospective, 
double- blind, placebo- controlled trial of 12- months of transdermal testosterone therapy . 
 Recruit 5 0 adolescent males with KS in early puberty (Tanner stage 2 -3) 
 Randomize sample to receive either Testosterone vs. Placebo  
 Evaluate baseline functioning using a battery of standardized assessments carefully selected to evaluate psychological factors (verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills, attention/inhibition, verbal 
fluency), behavior (aggression, irritability, social functioning), and motor skills (strength, coordination) . 
 Compare changes in the T estosterone  vs. P lacebo groups after 3, 6, and 12 months . 
 
Hypothesis 1a:  Testosterone treatment will lead to improvements in executive function (specifically, 
attention/inhibition and verbal fluency).  
Hypothesis 1b : Testosterone treatment will lead to improvements in psychosocial functioning (personal 
adjustment, social skills), while externalizing behaviors (aggression, irritability) will remain unchanged. 
Hypothesis 1c : Testosterone treatment will lead to improved motor strength and motor coordination. 
 
Specific Aim 2: To investigate genetic factors influencing the clinical phenotype and response to 
testosterone therapy in adolescents with KS , including androgen- receptor  (AR) repeat length 
polymorphisms  and the parent -of-origin of the extra X chromosome.  
 Using the battery of assessments outlined in Aim 1, obtain clinical phenotype data on the 30 subjects 
from Aim 1, plus an additional 25 subjects with KS of a broader age range (8- 18). 
 Isolate DNA from blood samples (n=75 total) to determine AR repeat lengt h and parent -of-origin.  
 Compare the clinical phenotype to genetic f indings, adjusting for confounding variables (e.g. SES).  
 For subjects treated with testosterone, c ompare the change in psychological and motor functioning 
from baseline to 1 year in subjects with a short versus long AR polymorphism s. 
 
Hypothesis 2a:   Individuals with a maternally -inherited supernumerary X chromosome will have higher 
cognitive and motor scores compared to the pat ernally -inherited group . 
Hypothesis 2b:  Males with KS  with a short AR polymorphism will have higher cognitive and motor 
scores co mpared to those with a long AR polymorphism. 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 Hypothesis 2c:  After testosterone therapy, males with KS  with a short AR polymorphism will show 
greater improvement in psychological and motor functioning than those with a long AR polymorphism.
 
RESEARCH STRATEGY:  
 
11. SIGNIFICANCE:  
 
11.A. Prevalence, Medical Features,  and Psychological Features in KS  
Klinefelter syndrome(KS)/XXY is the most common chromosomal disorder in males.  With a prevalence of 1 in 
650 male births, there are approximately 235,000 males with KS in the U.S. [21, 22] [23] A recent study 
suggests that prevalence of KS is increasing due to increasing maternal age and environmental factors .[24] 
There is a  need for research on clinical treatments in this very common genetic disorder.  
 
KS is associated with characteristic physical features and medical problems.  The presence of the extra X 
chromosome leads to tall stature, changes in body proportions, small testicles, and infertility. [25] Most males 
with KS start puberty with testicular enlargement at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_124987]  (11-13 years), but then fail to attain normal 
adult testicular size  and testosterone (T) production, leading to the need for T replacement therapy. [26] This 
T therapy is important to complete pubertal development and for long -term health benefits such as improved 
muscle strength, normalization of sexual function, and promotion of bone mineralization.  
 
Psychological studies in KS show verbal cognitive deficits, executive function deficits, attention problems, and 
psychosocial problems . The most comprehensive studies on psychological functioning  in KS w ere prospective 
studies of males  identified by [CONTACT_521229] 1970’s and 80’s who were followed into adulthood. [27-
29] [CONTACT_521263], a primary mentor, was the lead psychologist for the Denver site. Cognitive evaluations showed 
full scale IQ in the average range, however with verbal IQ significantly lower than performance IQ and approx -
imately 10 points less than sibling controls. Language -based learning disabilities are present in 80%. [30-33] 
Verbal fluency is impaired in KS compared to controls, with greater deficits on time-dependent tasks. [27] 
Walzer and colleagues [33] reported on the “behavioral style” of children with KS, noting lower activity 
levels than controls, increased distractibility, and social withdrawal . Social interactions have been described as 
impaired due to decreased self -esteem and anxiety.[34, 35]  A recent study in a self -select ed sample of 51 
Dutch children  showed ADHD in 63% , increased  social difficulties , and autism spectrum disorders in 27%. [36] 
Studies of adults with KS have found executive function impairments, [37] especially in areas of att ention, 
working memory, and verbal executive function. I n children, a small study of 3 patients noted problems with 
inhibition, but not concept formation, problem solving, or set shifting ability. [38] Another recent study described 
language deficits, and attention problems without impulsivity in a cohort of [ADDRESS_676024] en.[39] 
 
Motor function is impaired in KS.  Hypotonia typi[INVESTIGATOR_521196], and early gross motor delays are 
common with an average age of walking independently of 14.5 months, compared to 12.4 months  in typi[INVESTIGATOR_521197]. [40] A controlled study of motor development in 14 males with KS showed deficits in overall gross 
motor c omposite scores, as well as upper extremity coordination, speed and dexterity. [41] A recent larger  
study of 50 children demonstrated deficits in both gross and fine motor skills, with significant deficits in upper 
limb speed and dexterity, running speed, and strength in the adolescent group. [39] Intention tremor is 
associated with KS and other sex chromosome disorders, which can also affect motor skills. [42, 43]  
 
In summary, previous studies have shown neuropsychological, behavioral, and motor skill deficits in 
males with KS. Studies on intervent ions that impact psychological and motor problems are lacking.  
 
 
11.B. Testosterone Treatment in KS  
Testosterone (T) deficiency develops in adolescence in males with KS.  Most individuals with KS develop T 
deficiency during adolescence or young adulthood. There is strong evidence and consistent recommendations 
for T replacement therapy for normalization of bone density, pubertal maturation, muscle development, and 
sexual function in KS .[25, 26, 44 -47] In typi[INVESTIGATOR_521198], puberty begins with increasing levels of pi[INVESTIGATOR_521199] (FSH) and l uteinizing hormone (LH) , and LH stimulates  production of T from the 
testes. In males with KS, FSH and LH typi[INVESTIGATOR_521200] y puberty, but then commonly rise into 
the elevated range afte r age 12 due to testicular unresponsiveness. [48, 49]  In most cases, serum T increases 
above prepubertal levels, however total T levels  either remain at the lower limits of normal or drop below the 
normal range as shown in FIGURE 2. 
 
[ADDRESS_676025] sources support  
therapy when LH and FSH begin to rise in early puberty, [50-55] others support waiting for a plateau or 
decreasing T level, [48, 56]  and others initiate fo r symptoms of T deficiency. [54] While Wikstrom et al . questions 
whether T is needed in early  puberty prior to significant deficits in serum T  (Time 1 in Figure 2 below) ,[56] 
these authors noted findings of gynecomastia and exaggerated GnRH responses  in early puberty ,[56] and 
describe that “a relative T deficiency from midpuberty onwards is obvious…Consequently, although it seems 
that androgen supplementation from midpuberty onwards is necessary, to date, placebo -controlled studies 
showing the benefits of early T substitution are lacking, especially regarding the positive effects of early T 
therapy on cognitive and behavioral parameters.” [48] If psychological and motor deficits in males with KS 
improve with early T, this would support earlier initiation of T replacement therapy.  
 
 
 
FIGURE 2 . VARIABILITY IN TIMING OF TESTOSTERONE (T) TREATMENT.  T levels in KS (dashed area) compared to 
normal males (gray). Question marks ( ?) indicate variability in practice in the timing of T  therapy. Current 
recommendations are variable and include: (1)  Beginning of puberty, (2)  Mid-puberty at plateau or decrease in T with 
elevated LH/FSH, (3) fall in testosterone levels or (4) clinical signs/symptoms of deficiency.  
 
Previous studies of psychological and motor effects of T in KS are limited and lack rigorous, controlled study 
design. However they suggest a positive effect on attention, executive function, motor skills, self -esteem, and 
verbal fluency.  In a descriptive case series of  adults with KS , T therapy was shown to have a positive impact 
on self -esteem, mood, energy level and general well- being in one long- term study. [57] A recent cross -sectional 
study of [ADDRESS_676026] improvements in some motor skills (p=0.08 in agility, visual -
motor control and running speed) in the 11 patients who had received androgen treatment compared to the 
untreated group. [39] Another  study describes neuroimaging and verbal fluency in 10 XXY adults who had been 
identified by [CONTACT_336696], and 5  were currently or had been previously treated with T, while the other 5 
had not. In the treated group, temporal lobe gray matter was increased and verbal fluency scores were higher than the untreated group. [58] These are the only studies that have examined the effects of T therapy on 
psychological or motor features specifi cally in  KS. Other  studies in hypogonadal adults described significant 
improvements in mood,  verbal and spatial memory, and muscle strength  after 2- 6 months of treatment .[59-61]

not report increased aggression, so perhaps  changes in self -report reflect increased feelings of assertiveness 
by [CONTACT_521230]. Other studies in androgen- treated adolescents with pubertal delays found  improvements in 
adult social outcomes, self -esteem, and personal adjustment ,[65] while others report no significant effects on 
adult outcomes, [66] spatial performance, [67] and behavior. [68] It is important to note that typi[INVESTIGATOR_521202], so T may have different psychological effects.  
In a group of males with Prader -Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder also associated with hypogonadism, 
cognitive deficits, and behavioral problems, there were no detrimental effects on behavior after T treatment. [69] 
 
New evidence suggests that androgen deficiency may be present in infancy and early childhood in KS.  
Two studies have reported a lower neonatal T surge in prenatally diagnosed KS infants compared to XY 
controls. [16, 70]  However, 1 study reports conflicting results with high -normal concentrations in 3 month old 
infants .[71] In 22 children less than 2 years old, Ross reported shorter phallus length, smaller testicular size, 
lower neonatal T, and hypotonia as evidence of early testicular failure.[16]  Thus, if androgen deficiency is  
present in early child- hood, initiation of T therapy should be considered at an earlier age than current practice  
in late adolescence or adulthood.  While the  proposed study does n’t include prepubertal children, these recent  
findings support that T replacement may be needed at a younger age tha n current practice, supporting  the 
need for the current study.  
 
 
11.C.  Genetic Factors in KS  
The specific genes on the sex chromosomes and the genetic mechanisms involved in the variability of the 
phenotype of KS are not yet known.  Proposed mechanisms have included gene dosage effects of sex chromo-
some genes that escape X- inactivation, polymorphisms of sex chromosome genes, and imprinted regions that 
would show differential phenotypes based on the parent -of-origin of the extra chromosomes [72].  
 
Studies of polymorphisms in the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the X -chromosome suggest a correlation 
with the physical phenotype and social functioning in KS. The AR gene has a polymorphism in the CAG (cyto-
sine-adenine- guanine) repeat number in the coding sequence, and the length of the CAG repeat (CAGn)  
inversely correlates with receptor responsiveness to T.[73]  Adult males with KS with a high CAGn (long 
polymorphism, receptor less respons ive to T) were  shown to have more significant physical features of KS 
(taller adult height, more gynecomastia), and decreased employment and social outcomes .[74] A study in 
children with KS also found a correlation between CAG n and penile length. [75] Thus, a goal of our study is to 
examine if males with KS with long AR CAGn polymorphisms  have more significant physical or psychological 
impairments, and to evaluate if there are differences in the response to T t reatment. We hypothesize that those 
with a short AR CAGn polymorphism will have a better response to T, and our preliminary data supports this.  
 
Parent -of-origin of the extra X chromosome may impact phenotype through mechanisms  of imprinting . A study  
in 45,X  showed that females with a maternally -inherited X were more likely to have social deficits and autistic 
behaviors  compared to a paternally -inherited X. [76] In KS, the additional X chromosome is maternally inherited 
in approximately 50% of cases .[77, 78]  Two studies suggest that a paternally -inherited extra X is associated 
with a more severe phenotype, including delayed pubert y,[79] and impaired language and motor skills .[80] 
Other studies have not found associations with cognitive, motor, or psychiatric condit ions.[81]

12.A. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500027]. The eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic  was started in 
2007. [CONTACT_521264] is the clinic director, and t eam members include endocrinology ([CONTACT_500047]), 3 
psychologists, genetic counseling , speech therapy, and occupational therapy. In addition to providing 
comprehensive clinical care for children with X&Y  chromosome disorders, the clinic  also serves as an excellent 
base for recruitment into clinical -translational research and represents a unique resource potentially 
unparalleled in other centers nationally . Referrals,  clinic visits , and the waiting list  have increased steadily 
since 2007. See FIGURE [ADDRESS_676029]. Tartaglia’s  previous research during fellowship training included over 200 subjects in 3 years  with 
different X&Y chromosome disorders. She is involved as a speaker and advocate for this patient group. The 
strong infrastructure  and her reputation with this population optimize  the chances of successful recruitment.

12.B. This topic has been identified as a research priority by [CONTACT_521231] 
(KS&A) and by [CONTACT_521232]. In 2003, an NIH meeting co- sponsored by [CONTACT_84465]&A ( www.genetic.org ) 
and March of Dimes identified a research priority to “determine the relationship between hormonal therapy, neurodevelopmental outcome, and time of onset of treatment.” [82] This priority was reiterated at the May 2010 
International Meeting for Klinefelter Syndrome in Copenhagen, where international researchers across disciplines discussed research priorities. KS&A supports our efforts and will aid in recruitment . (Appendix  A). 
 
 
12.C. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_521203] T estosterone  Therapy in Males with KS. Preliminary, 
prospective data was obtained in a convenience sample of 16 adolescents with KS starting on T therapy and 
followed for 12 months . For this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the T treatment regimens varied due to differences in clinical c are 
by [CONTACT_521233]. P atient s and parent s each completed a standardized questionnaire (Behavioral 
Assessment System for Children–2) at baseline and after 12 months of therapy . The BASC -2 parent -report  
includes subscales of externalizing behaviors (aggression, hyperactivity, conduct)  and Attention  problems . The 
self-report (completed by [CONTACT_469753])  includes a score of Personal Adjustment, which includes domains of 
relations with parents, interpersonal relations, and self-esteem . Scores are  reported as T -scores, with a mean 
of 50 (s.d.10). Scores <40 or > 60 are in the “at -risk” range. Results were analyzed by  [CONTACT_54959] t -test and are 
shown in FIGURE 4. There were no differences in externalizing behaviors after [ADDRESS_676030].  Studies of T in hypogonadal adults show  
statistically significa nt changes in psychological domains  after 2- 6 months .[59, 61]  
Molecular studies were conducted to establish the molecular techniques for analysis of the AR CAG n 
polymorphism, to establish a median for data analysis, and to determine if response to T was dependent on CAGn . We conducted AR CAGn  analysis on 40 males wit h KS, inc luding the 16 in our T pi[INVESTIGATOR_521204] 13.E.2. Our findings of a median repeat length of 21- 22 are consistent with the general 
population and previous studies in KS. [73-75]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_521205] (CAGn≤21) 
and long (CAG≥22) polymorphisms. Results  in FIGURE 4  show  that improvements in attention and personal 
adjustment were significantly higher in the subgroup with the short, more- responsiv e AR polymorphism.

12.D. Building on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_521206]. My previous studies have been either 
descriptive or pi[INVESTIGATOR_521207]. The preliminary results 
presented are based on parent -report questionnaires from an uncontrolled study of a convenience sample of 
patients starting on T. The aims of the following proposed project build on pi[INVESTIGATOR_521208]. Conducting a double- blind, placebo-
controlled trial is new to this investigator  and more rigorous in design than the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The proposed study 
also builds on previous experience by [CONTACT_521234]. Further study of these 
preliminary findings in a rigorous are indicated since these results may change management of KS.

Rationale for selection of psychological and motor assessment battery:  The above battery was chosen 
because it provides a comprehensive assessment of relevant areas of neuropsychological, behavioral, and 
motor function. Specifically, it includes verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities (Wechsler scales), reading 
(TOWRE), and both verbal and nonverbal executive functioning (EF) tasks (Verbal Fluency, DKEFS Color 
Word Interference vs. Design Fluency, WCST, Wechsler Memory Spatial Span, Tower of London, TROG- II 
and CELF subtest). Attention and EF  will be measured directly, as well as through subscales on parent and 
teacher questionnaires (Conners’, BRIEF). Daily living c ommunication skills will be measured using the  
Children’s Communication C hecklist - 2. Motor tasks have been chosen to focus on areas previously shown to 
be affected in KS, including motor coordination, dexterity, and strength.[39, 41]  Adaptive functioning will be 
measured using the Vineland- II, includ ing communication and social subscales. To characterize behavioral 
and social domains commonly affected in KS, we will  assess externalizing behavior problems (BASC -[ADDRESS_676033] questionnaire ), ADHD symptoms (Conners’ subscales),

11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 and psychosocial functioning (BASC -2 self -report, Vineland- 2 Social Domain, Social Responsiveness Scale)  
and the Clinical Global Impression Scale by [CONTACT_521237]. Likert Scales of Mood Parameters  
identified  significant differences in mood and energy in studies of T in hypogonadal adults.[59]  The BASC -2, 
SRS, and VMI have been used in previous KS research to identify clinically significant differences in behaviors, 
ADHD symptoms, and motor skills. [11, 104, 105]  Parental education and occupation will be collected to control 
for SES. [103]  All tests are normed on appropriate age- stratified popul ations , and show  acceptable reliability 
and validity.  See Appendix B for all testing protocols and questionnaires being administered . 
 
 
13.D.  AIM 1 METHODS – Randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial of testosterone in KS  
13.D.1.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria: A dolescent males of all ethnic and racial groups with nonmosaic KS in pubertal stage 
Tanner 2 or 3 will be included in Aim 1.  Rationale : We decided to use pubertal stage as entry criteria instead of  
chronological  age because of the variable age of pubertal onset in typi[INVESTIGATOR_521209] (there can be 
signif icant differences in pubertal development between two individuals of the same age). With the  entire study 
group sharing physiologic changes of early puberty, t here will be less variability in  pubertal development within 
and between groups at baseline, and less concern of differential responses in prepubertal vs.  pubertal males . 
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria include non -English speaking individuals because many psychological 
questionnaires are not available in other languages. Individuals with a history of deep vein thrombosis, cancer 
or other medical problems that would interfere in their ability to complete the assessment are also excl uded.  
 
 
 
 
 
13.D.2.  Study Protocol  
Randomization/Blinding: Participants will be randomized to either receive Testosterone (T) (n=30) or 
Placebo (P) (n=20) as  shown in FIGURE 5 . A coded randomization scheme will be provided from the CTRC . 
All individuals (patient, parent, evaluators) will be blinded, except for the treating endocrinologist ([CONTACT_521272]) and research pharmacist. [CONTACT_521272] will remain unblinded in order to adjust the dose of the T group to achieve 
target serum T levels (see below), and so that he can monitor for P patients who meet criterion to “escape” to 
treatment (s ee Placebo section). We considered the option of having [CONTACT_521272] remain blinded, however it is 
important for him to be unblinded to ensure the intended differences in serum T levels between groups.  There 
is individual variability in the absorption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T, and the T dose  needed to obtain target  serum levels  will 
different between subjects . For the P  group, a plan for ‘dose’ changes has been developed to maintain blinding 
(see Placebo).  To maintain blinding, [CONTACT_521272] will not be informed of results of psychological assessments, 
and evaluators  will not be t old of details (i.e. dose changes) that may compromise blinding. A coding system 
will be developed for interim data safet y monitoring. B linding will be maintained until study completion.  
 
Treatment group:   T therapy will be delivered using transdermal gel  (Androgel; Abbott Pharmaceuticals) .  
Androgel that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_521210] a pump system that delivers 1.25g per pump.  The starting dose will be 1.25g (equivalent to 1 pump per day).  For this study, the gel will be repackaged into syringes (to allow for delivery of a placebo gel in an identical delivery system).  The syringes will deliver 17.5g of Testosterone per 
syringe. This is equivalent to a [ADDRESS_676034] is on the starting dose of 1.25g per day, or a 1 week supply if the dose is increased to 2.5g per day. The subjects and their parents will be instructed how to 
dispense a single dose with each visit and understanding will be confirmed during each phone call This 
treatment protocol has been developed based on publications by v arious experts in KS.[106, 107] . The gel  was 
selected over injections  because it is the formulation most likely to result in steady blood levels of T (compared 
to peaks and troughs of injections ), it allows delivery of a noninvasive placebo formulation to a pediatric 
population, and it can be discontinued easily in case of adverse events.  Initial T dose will be 1.25g/day and 
increased at 1 month intervals until target levels are obtained. Target levels for the T group will be the mid-
range for pubertal stage as defined by [CONTACT_521238]:  
Tanner 2 goal =150 ng/dL+/ -50 (Normal 2- 300) Tanner  4 goal =400 ng/dL+/ -75 (Normal 90-840) 
Tanner 3 goal =200 ng/dL+/ -75 (Normal 30- 390) Tanner 5 goal =500 ng/dL+/ -100 (Normal 280- 1000) 
If a change in the treatment protocol needs to be made for unanticipated clinical concerns , [CONTACT_521272] will 
make decisions preserving the best clinical care, and alterations in the protocol will be noted. We will continue 
to collect data in a blinded manner, and changes will be taken into consideration during data analysis.  
 
10 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 Placebo Group:   The Placebo (P) group will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_521211] T group  starting at 1 pump per day. To maintain blinding, the ‘dose’ of the P group will be increased at 
variable rates as determined by [CONTACT_521239] T and P groups . To maintain blinding, both  groups will follow the same education and monitoring plan 
(see below) so administration and side effect monitoring are equivalent . We developed a plan for patients in 
the P  group to “escape” to the treatment arm if there are negative clinical consequences of delaying T (see 
FIGURE 6  in Human Subjects) . The criterion for  ‘escape’ to treatment is the development of persistent 
gynecomast ia (>90 days) . In adolescents with KS , persistent gyn ecomastia is a clinical indicat ion for initiation 
of T because T  may minimize  gynecomastia and associated psychological  distress in adolescent males. Based 
on clinical experience, we anticipate that this will occur in 1- [ADDRESS_676035] accounted for this loss in 
our power analysis. These patients will be followed for the duration of the study and included in Aim 2.  
 
Medical History and Physical Examination:  An interview detailing  medical, psychological, and family history  
will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tartaglia at baseline, using a datasheet created for the study . Examination will include 
assessment of height, segment ratios, BMI, Tanner pubertal staging , grip strength and neurological 
examination. We will request  that psychiatric disorders are stable prior to enrollment , and that no changes to 
psych iatric  medications are made during the study  unless there is decompensation requiring clinical treatment .

TABLE  6.  Components of Study Visits  and Safety Monitoring Plan * 
*Telephone follow -up will also occur at [ADDRESS_676036] Education and Monitoring Compliance:  Upon enrollment, each subject and their parents 
will receive an education session on the application of the gel and will be required to demonstrate proper 
technique in the dispensing and applying the gel. They will receive verbal and written instructions about timing 
of application, guidelines around use (i.e. showering, swimming) after application, potential side effects, and 
care to prevent transmission to others . The possibility of acne in early adolescence with or without T therapy 
will be discussed to  maintain blinding.  Lab draws for serum T levels will be drawn consistently in the morning 
before the daily dose. A fixed quantity of gel (T or P) will be dispensed at 2 -month intervals, and the remaining 
gel will be measured by [CONTACT_521240] 2 month interval to monitoring compliance.  
 
 
Monitoring Plan for Adverse Events:  Possible  risks with T treatment include acne, a skin reaction at the 
application site, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] , headaches, and a  risk of hormonal effects in caregivers or partner s with  improper 
application techniques . If supraphysiologic levels are reached, behavioral agitation, polycythemia, and liver 
function abnormalities are additional risks.  The current protocol provides T at conserv -ative dosages and with 
close monitoring as  outlined in TABLE 6.  The safety m onitoring plan, including responsibilities of the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) , is described in the Human Subjects  section.  A copy of the finalized DSMB 
protocol has been added as Attachment 1.  
  
 13.D.3 Aim 1 Outcome Measures  and Data Analysis Plan 
Hypothesis 1a:  T will lead to improvements in executive function (specifically, attention and verbal fluency).  
11 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 Primary Outcome Measures:   Attention/Inhibition:  Conners’ Parent & Teacher Rating Scales ADHD DSM -
IV subscale ; Verbal Fluency:  Delis -Kaplan Executive Function System Verbal Fluency Tasks  
Secondary Outcome Measures:   Attention/Inhibition:  TOVA Continuous Performance Task, BRIEF, BASC -
2 Attention subscale; Verbal  Fluency : Vineland- 2 Communication Domain  
Analysis Plan:  The primary outcomes of interest are  the change s in scaled s cores from baseline to 12 mos  
in the Delis -Kaplan EF scores, and the change in raw scores on the Conners’ ADHD scales. We will test 
the patient specific change in a 2- sided, 2- sample t-test, comparing T to P groups. The mean scores for the 
Delis -Kaplan subtests in the normal population are [ADDRESS_676037] deviation of 3. We will assume a 
clinically significant average change of 4.5 (1.5 s.d.) with a range of 0–9 . Allowing for 15% drop -out, we will 
have greater than 80% power to detect a change of 4.5  units with a significance level of 0.05.  To analyze 
the difference in the Conners’ ADHD raw scores at [ADDRESS_676038] 80% power to detect differences of 8 points with current sample sizes. [98, 99]   
A multivariate mixed model will also be employed to incorporate the 3 measurements (baseline, 6 
months, and 12 months) on each child, allowing for the inclusion of covariates  including age, race/ethnicity, 
and socioeconomic status .[108]  Exploratory analyses will be performed to determine if baseline cognitive 
function or the secondary measures are associated with response to therapy.  
 
 
Hypothesis 1b:  Testosterone will lead to improvements in psychosocial functioning (personal adjustment, 
social skills), while externalizing behaviors (aggression, irritability) will remain unchanged.  
Primary Outcome Measures:   Psychosocial:  BASC- 2 personal adjustment scale (self -report), Social 
Responsiveness Scale (parent) ; Externalizing behavior : BASC- 2 Externalizing Composite (parent ) 
Secondary Outcome Measures:   Psychosocial : Vineland- 2 Socialization scale; Externalizing behavior : 
Conners’ Emotional Lability Index  
Analysis Plan:  For psychosocial functioning, power considerations and analysis plan are similar to Aim [ADDRESS_676039] of means will be 
used. T he current sample will achieve 80% power to conclude that the T and P group s are within one s.d . 
 
 
Hypothesis 1c:  Testosterone treatment will lead to improved motor strength and motor coordination.  
Primary Outcome Measures:  Motor Strength:  Bruininks Test of Motor Development -2 (BOT -2) Strength 
subscale; Motor Coordination:  BOT-2 Motor Coordination subscales  
Secondary Outcome Measures:  Motor Strength:  Grip strength ; Motor Coordination:  Beery VMI Motor score  
Analysis Plan:  We will use analyses similar to those in Aim 1a. 
  
13.E.  AIM 2 METHODS – Investigating genetic factors influencing the phenot ype and response to T.  
13.E.1.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria: An additional  25 males age 8 -18 with KS of all ethnic and racial groups will be included.  
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria  are the same as Aim 1 but males with KS who are already on androgen 
treatment will also be excluded (to prevent confounding variables) . 
 
13.E.2.  Methods.   DNA will be extracted from v enous blood samples  and analyzed for CAG  repeat length 
in the AR gene  (HUMARA). [109]  The CAG  motif in exon- [ADDRESS_676040] will b e 
analyzed by  [CONTACT_521241] n by [CONTACT_521242]. The weighted CAGn mean 
of the 2 X chromosomes will be calculated as per the protocol described in Zitzman et. al. [74] 
 
For parent -of-origin of the X chromosome, DNA will be extracted from cheek swab, blood or saliva samples. 
Pyrosequencing (PSQ) assays will be used to identify a set of [ADDRESS_676041] and parent samples to determine 
parent -of-origin.   
 
13.E.3.  Outcome Measures and Data Analysis Plan  
Hypothesis 2a:  Males with a maternal extra X will have higher cognitive/motor scores compared  a paternal  X. 
 Outcome Measures:  Wechsler verbal and nonverbal IQ, BOT -2 Motor Scales  
12 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 Analysis Plan:  T-tests will be used to test for differences between outcome measures in the maternal vs. 
paternal groups. Assuming approx . 50% maternal and 50% paternal , we have 80% power to detect a 
difference of at least 0.[ADDRESS_676042] 
for age, race/ethnicity and SES.  
 
Hypothesis 2b:  Males with short CAGn will have hig her cognitive and motor scores compared to a long CAGn.  
Outcome Measures:   Wechsler verbal and nonverbal IQ, BOT -2 Motor Scales  
Analysis plan:  Spearman correlation coefficients will be calculated and p -values reported. The group will 
be split in short vs. long CAGn based on median value in preliminary data (21) and o utcomes  compared 
by t-tests. Additional multivariate analyses will be performed to adjust for age, race/ethnicity and SES.  
 
Hypothesis 2c:  After T , males with a short AR CAGn will show greater improvement  than the long AR CAGn . 
Outcome Measures:   Post-treatment change in Wechsler verbal and nonverbal IQ, Vineland- 2 adaptive 
composite, Executive function composite score, BOT -2 Motor Scales  
Analysis plan:  The change from baseline in psychological and motor function scores will be modeled using 
repeated measures regression techniques, with an interaction term for treatment arm and AR 
polymor phism length. P patients will be included as controls. Linear contrast will be used to test slopes in 
specific groups. We have 80% power to identify  response differences between the short vs. long groups . 
 
 
13.F. ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES . We have taken great care to 
emphasize our strong infrastructure, experience, and patient numbers to support our abilities to recruit target 
numbers for this project. I f goals are not met during the first 2 years , we will e xpand r ecruitment to regi onal 
medical centers in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, and  other professionals involved in the KS community. 
Recruit ment of minorities has been a challenge because of primary recruitment from internet -based sources . 
We will also broadly recruit from regional genetics and community clinics where more minorities  are seen. 
Since there is variability in the natural production of T in early pubertal males with KS, it is possible that 
there will not be significant difference s in the serum T levels between T and P groups (i.e. some P patients will 
have endogenous serum T levels that are equivalent to the T group). We will compare serum T levels between 
groups at [ADDRESS_676043] will generate results that will lead to important follow up studies and 
new hypotheses. If results show  that there are positive changes in the T group compared to P , this will support 
earlier initiation of T therapy , and results will need to be confirmed in a multicenter design that broadens the 
physical out come measures (i.e. bone density , gynecomastia) and also more deeply explores psychological 
domains that change with T using more specific neuropsychological constructs and other modali ties s uch as 
neuroimaging. If there are differential effects of T based on the AR polymorphism, then future studies  will be 
needed to establish if there are different dose response curves based on AR polymorphism, and if higher T 
dosages in patients with the less responsive receptor can lead to similar physical, psychological, and motor 
improvements  (i.e. personalized medicine) . If our hypotheses  are not supported, then studies investigating 
genetic, medical, neuropsychological, and social factors that predict im proved psychological outcomes in KS 
are needed so that  interventions other than androgen treatments can be developed and tested. Future 
directions also include development of  a protocol f or XXYY and XXXXY where there  is often reluctance to start 
T treatment due to more significant cognitive and behavioral difficulties.  Training and experience in design and 
executi on of  clinical trials will also allow  investigation of other interventions, including psychological/academic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_521212].

14. Protection of Human Subjects:  
 
14.1 Risks to Human Subjects 
 
14.1.a   Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
Seventy -five males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS)/XXY will be included in this protocol. All subjects will be 
between the ages of 8 and 18. Review of previous genetic testing results showing 47,XXY karyotype will be 
confirmed prior to participation in the study.  
 Inclusion criteria include English speaking male adolescents age 8- 18 with 47,XXY syndrome. For Aim 1, 
50 adolescents in early puberty (Tanner 2 -3) will be included.  Participants in Aim 1 will be randomized 
through a randomization scheme developed by [CONTACT_521245] 2 groups, either Testosterone (T; n=30) or Placebo (P; n=20).  The T group is larger to allow for improved power to analyze for differences in 
response to testosterone depending on subgroupi[INVESTIGATOR_521214]. 
For Aim 2, 25 individuals age 8 -18 will be included.  All ethnic groups and racial groups will be included.  
 Exclusion criteria include non- English speaking individuals because many of the standardized 
psychological questionnaires are not available in other languages. Individuals who are already on 
testosterone therapy will be excluded from Aim 2.  Individuals with medical problems that would interfere in 
their ability to complete the assessment are also excluded from the study.  Individuals with a medical 
history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or cancer are also excluded.  Mosaic karyotypes will also be excluded because they often show milder neuropsychological problems, and we would like to opti mize 
potential effect sizes for this study.

For subjects in Aim 1 in the T group, transdermal testosterone will be initiated usin g transdermal gel  
(Androgel) that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_521210] a pump system that delivers 1.25g per pump.  The starting dose will be 1.25g (equivalent to 1 pump per day).  For this study,  the gel will be repackaged into syringes (to 
allow for delivery of a placebo gel in an identical delivery system).  The syringes will deli ver 17.5g of 
estosterone per syringe. This is equivalent to a [ADDRESS_676045] is on the starting dose of 1.25g 
per day, or a 1 week supply if the dose in creased to 2.5g per day. The subjects and their parents will be 
instructed how to dispense a single dose with each visit and understanding will be confirmed during each

Appreciation for Participation:  Patients will receive gift cards of $5 per lab draw, $15 for psychological 
assessments, $ 20 at the 12- month evaluation. Teachers will receive a $[ADDRESS_676046], his parent(s) and teacher. Teacher 
questionnaires will be sent directly to the teacher with a letter providing parent consent to the teacher 
participation (see attachment 4). Blood samples will also be collected at each study visit for safety 
monitoring (laboratory testing), serum testosterone levels to determine dosage changes, and DNA 
analysis.  Cheek swab samples will be collected at the baseline visit to collect DNA samples for parent -of-
origin analysis. Only members of the research team and the data safety monitoring board will have access 
to identifiable private information about the subjects.  For patient safety, all data will be kept in a research 
file in a locked drawer, in a locked office.  All computer files will be password- protected on an encr ypted 
server.  
 These materials will be collected by [CONTACT_521247].  
 
14.1.c   Potential Risks  
There is an increase over minimal risk to the patients due the study population being children, and a 
portion of the study population having cognitive impairments. The psychological and motor assessment 
protocol includes assessments that cause little increased risk to the participant above standard medical 
care, since psychological assessments are also often clinically indicated in this age group in this population.   
 Testosterone therapy is being initiated in this protocol in adolescents in early puberty.  There is significant 
variability in the published recommendations about when to initiate testosterone replacement therapy in KS/XXY, and some sources recommend initiation of testosterone in early adolescence (as it is being done in this study), while others recommend waiting for more significant symptoms later in adolescence or 
adulthood.  
 As with any medication, there are risks and potential side effects associated with treatment. Possible 
common risks with testosterone treatment include acne, a skin reac tion at the application site, and 
headaches. There is a small risk that topi[INVESTIGATOR_521217]-
to-skin c ontact after application. If excess testosterone is applied and supraphysiologic levels are reached, 
behavioral agitation, abnormalities in liver function, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], and polycythemia are additional increased 
risks. There is also a potential risk that supraphysiologic levels of testosterone will lead to fusion of the 
growth plates and decreased final adult height. Close monitoring will occur to follow for elevated serum 
testosterone levels as shown in the monitoring plan in TABLE 6 below (copi[INVESTIGATOR_521218]).

TABLE 6.  Components of Study Visits and Safety Monitoring Plan*  
*Telephone follow -up will also occur at [ADDRESS_676047] medical practice for 
children with KS/XXY in early puberty (where they would typi[INVESTIGATOR_521219] 1- 2 blood draws 
per year to monitor for serum testosterone levels). 
 
At the baseline visit, cheek swab samples will be collected from the participant and at least [ADDRESS_676048] or their 
parent(s) may experience mild discomfort however there are no additional risks associated with this 
procedure.  
 At baseline and [ADDRESS_676049] assessments used by [CONTACT_521248]- behavioral pediatricians in clinical practice. The full research assessment will take 
approximately 6 hours to complete, depending on the skill level of the participant (those with higher 
cognitive functioning take longer to assess.  However, those with higher cognitive functioning are generally 
more likely to tolerate a longer assessment period, as well). Some of these hours will involve interview of 
the parent or completion of standardized questionnaires by [CONTACT_7071], decreasing the demand placed 
upon the child. These assessm ents put the subject at risk for frustration and fatigue.  
 Loss of confidentiality is a risk to all research participants. Please see below for further discussion of 
protections against risk.  
 
Alternative treatment would be to withhold testosterone replacement therapy in early adolescence and 
monitor serum for physical exam changes (gynecomastia), lack of pubertal development, or low serum 
testosterone levels to determine when therapy should be initiated.  This is essentially being done in the 
placebo arm of the current study to better answer the question of when testosterone replacement therapy should be initiated.  
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_676050] Risks  
 
14.1.2a  Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Participants will be recruited through postings of a COMIRB- approved recruitment flyer on internet 
websites and in newsletters of KS/XXY support organizations, and postings in endocrinology, child 
development, and genetics clinics at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521220].  The study will also be posted on clinicaltrials.gov website as required.   
 We will also recruit patients through a web- based clinical research recruitment site called 
Recruitsource.com.  Many patients with XXY have registered with Recruitsource and indicated the types of trials they are interested in participating in.  This database allows researchers to search for 
[ADDRESS_676051] with Susan Howell (genetic counselor and 
research coordinator in eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic ) for further information and instructions. This initial 
contact [CONTACT_521249].  Susan Howell will contact [CONTACT_521250], and will emphasize the differences between clinical care and 
research.  [CONTACT_521264] will be available to answer questions as needed.  [CONTACT_521273] will not inform [CONTACT_521274] of families who have declined participation as to not affect the clinical relationship or influence 
or clinical care.   
 
Consent will be obtained in a private room in the CTRC Research Clinic.  The CTRC is a research clinic 
that is in a different building than the clinical visits for the eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic , further 
distinguishing research from clinical care.  At the first study visit, the consent and assent form will be 
reviewed with the subject and their parents by [CONTACT_521251], and they will be given the opportunity 
read the protocol, and to ask additional questions about the protocol. Comprehension and autonomy 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_521252]., and participants 
will be given as much time as they feel is necessary to have the study goals and methods explained to 
them, and have their questions answered prior to signing the consent form.  
 Since all participants in the study are under 18, additional research procedure for research in children 
will be followed.  Each child participant  will also be assented using language and content appropriate 
for their developmental level. This will include information about the research goals, methods, risks, 
benefits, and confidentiality delivered using developmentally -appropriate language. Since participants 
in this study will be children over age 7, the official assent form will be reviewed and signed with a witness present.  For adolescents whose capacity to understand resembles that of adults, the assent procedure will include the information similar to what would is provided for informed consent by [CONTACT_67022].  
All children will have the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and the child will be asked to 
explain the goals and procedures of the study in their own words.  During the assent process, the child 
will be advised that they can terminate their participation in the study at any time without a ffecting their 
clinical care.  Assent will be obtained in a private room in the CTRC and participants will be given as 
much time as they feel is necessary to have the study goals and methods explained to them, and have 
their questions answered prior to signing the assent form.  
 The subject will be asked to provide consent if they turn [ADDRESS_676052] (DSMB), who are very experienced in assessment of mental health and developmental disabilities.  If decisional capacity is assessed to be impaired during the psychological testing after the consent process, consultation with the parent/guardian and the (DSMB) will be sought to determine whether individual has the decisional capacity to provide assent.

parent/guardian, and the investigator will sign the consent form, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_521221].  
 
14.1.2b  Protection against Risk  
 
a.  Neuropsychological Assessment  
The protocol includes a battery of tests evaluating developmental milestones, cognitive functioning, 
social -emotional functioning and motor skills.  Associated risks can include: 
 1) Fatigue or frustration by [CONTACT_2252]/research participant 
Plan to minimize risk: Assessments will be administered by [CONTACT_521253], and who have been trained in techniques to prevent fatigue and frustration in the assessment of individuals with 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_521222].  Examples include motivational strategies 
and rewards, offering and taking breaks as needed, providing snacks, and making the 
assessment as enjoyable as possible.  If these strategies are not successful, participants and 
their parents/caregivers will be given the option to postpone or discontinue the assessment.  
 
2) Discomfort or sadness by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver of the research participant  
The parent/caregivers of the subject may experience distress or discomfort because some of the questions and questionnaires will be about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_521223]’s developmental skills and 
behaviors, including questions about maladaptive behaviors.  Sometimes talking or answering questionnaire questions about a child’s difficulties makes parents feel sad or overwhelmed. 
Plan to minimize risk: The professionals involved in this study are trained and experienced in 
this situation, since it also occurs in our clinical practices.  This risk will be discussed during the 
consent process, and parents/caregivers will be told that they can refuse to answer any 
questions and to postpone or stop the interview at any time.  They will also be offered the opportunity to talk further with members of the research team about their questions and 
concerns, which will also minimize risk.  
 
b.  Medical Treatment/Procedures  
 
1) Testosterone therapy  
Testosterone therapy is being initiated in this protocol in adolescents in early puberty.  There is 
significant variability in the published recommendations about when to initiate testosterone replac ement 
therapy in KS/XXY, and some sources recommend initiation of testosterone in early adolescence (as it is being done in this study), while others recommend waiting for more significant symptoms later in adolescence or adulthood.  However, as with any medication, there are risks and potential side effects 
associated with treatment as described above.  Possible common risks with testosterone treatment 
include acne, a skin reaction at the application site, increased erections and libido, and headaches.  
There is a small risk that topi[INVESTIGATOR_521224]- to-
skin contact [CONTACT_521254].  If excess testosterone is applied and supraphysiologic levels are 
reached, behavioral agitation, abnormalities in liver function, and polycythemia are additional increased risks.  There is also a potential risk that supraphysiologic levels of testosterone will lead to fusion of the 
growth plates and decreased final adult height.  
Plan to minimize risk:  The current protocol provides testosterone at very conservative dosages 
to avoid potential complications from supraphysiologic levels.  Research participants will be 
informed of  the possible associated risks with testosterone therapy.  All subjects and their 
parents/caregivers will participate in a session at the beginning of the study to review proper 
application techniques and how to minimize risk of spread to caregivers or female partners 
(rubber gloves, avoiding skin- to-skin contact [CONTACT_521255] 6 hours after application, etc.)  
Parents/caregivers will also be provided with a one- page instruction sheet with directions on 
24 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 how to administer the gel with proper techniques and minimizing spread (see Attachment 2 for a 
copy of this instruction sheet provided to families). In addition, families will be provided with a dosing diary to track the amount of gel administered daily and identify any problems leading to 
missed doses (see attachment 3 for a copy of the dosing diary provided. Phone follow -up will be 
conducted 2 weeks after starting the study, and follow -up monitoring visits including medical 
history, physical examination, and blood draws will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after 
starting treatment.  Levels will be monitored at these times to ensure that levels are maintained at a therapeutic dose but well below the supraphysiologic range.  If supraphysiologic levels are 
identified, testosterone therapy will be discontinued for 2 weeks and additional monitoring will be 
performed at that time to determine serum testosterone levels and whether testosterone therapy at a lower dosage should be initiated.   
 
TABLE 6  above outlines the plan for follow -up medical history, physical examination, and 
laboratory testing developed for the purpose of safety monitoring, as well as follow -up phone 
call to monitor for side effects and answer questions about the treatment.  Assessment of adverse events will occur at each study visit for both Testosterone and Placebo groups using a 
standardized AE form.  
 
2) Venous blood draws  
There are five venous blood draws associated with the study, which exposes the subject to risk of pain, 
bruising and infection as a result of the venipuncture.   However, this risk is not elevated above the risk 
with a clinical venipuncture.  
Plan to minimize risk:  All venipunctures will be performed by [CONTACT_521256]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521225].  
 
3) Cheek swab collection  
During the cheek swab collection from the participant and the parent(s), they may experience mild discomfort however there are no additional risks associated with this procedure.  
 
 
c. Loss of Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
1)  Violation of privacy  and loss of confidentiality are both risks to which research participants are 
exposed.  The possibility of these risks increases when protected health information is collected.  
Plan to minimize risk: All study evaluations will be conducted in a room that is private so as to 
not increase this risk.  Any research that is conducted about a specific genetic condition may be 
considered stigmatizing since there is the potential for discrimination related to the genetic disorder.  We are very sensitive to these concerns due to our previous work with this population.  
In addition to the standard safeguards, we protect privacy by [CONTACT_521257].  For example, after initial contact [CONTACT_521258]/individual with 
KS/XXY, our correspondence by [CONTACT_521259].  Instead, 
wording such as "We are calling to confirm your appointment with Dr. T tomorrow," or "….research study at Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]…." are used.  Since some parents and adults ar e often 
private about the genetic diagnosis, we discuss this with each family or individual participating in the study to determine the most appropriate wording for the research report, correspondence, 
etc. to respect their privacy and minimize risk.  
  
Confidential ID numbers will be developed for each subject, and this number will be used for all 
study questionnaires and testing results.  Personal information will not be included in the 
computer data files, and only a confidential ID number will be used for computerized data.  A 
database for study results will be developed through RedCap with the help of the CTRC Data Management Team, and this file will be on a secure network, password- protected, and backed 
up according to standard accepted CTRC protocols.   Paper research files containing other 
medical records that are pertinent to the study will be kept in a locked file cabinet in Dr. 
25 
 
11-0874 Tartaglia Protocol v12.1.2015 Tartaglia's locked office.  All members of the research team will be COMIRB certified to ensure 
full education about resear ch risks.  
 
d. Risk to the Investigators  
There is no known risk to the investigators.  
 
14.1.3  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects 
 
The potential benefits for the patient is testosterone treatment by a team with experience in their  
specific genetic disorder with careful monitoring and follow -up.  The information gained from the 
psychological assessment protocol may be very useful in a clinical setting to identify cognitive strengths 
and weaknesses that may inform educational interventions, may identify challenges that would respond to various interventions such as speech or occupational therapy, or may identify important psychological diagnoses that would benefit from treatment such as anxiety disorders or ADHD.  These assessments are also conducted by a team of professionals with experience and background in KS/XXY.  This expertise is rare in the U.S., and allows participants and their parents to ask questions related to the specific diagnosis, and to receive feedback from professionals with experience treating individuals with these conditions. 
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_676054] clinical care of individuals with KS/XXY by [CONTACT_521260]/or negative psychological and motor effects of therapy.  Even if no significant improvements in psychological or motor factors are identified, documentation of either the presence or absence of worsening behavioral problems with testosterone treatment will be an important contribution to the medical literature.  In this population, parents of children with KS and associated behavioral difficulties often experience reluctance to start therapy by [CONTACT_521261], and literature resulting from this study will help clinicians and parents be more informed about testosterone treatment in this population.  Additionally, results of this study may show differences in the response to testosterone that are dependant on the polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene.   If this occurs, 
this would influence the clinical care of males with KS and would suggest that testosterone replacement doses may need to be adjusted depending on the genotype at the AR gene in males with KS.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_676055] ([CONTACT_521272]) in the study is not blinded to the treatment, and thus 
he will be able to determine if the treatment or placebo protocol is clinically harmful to an individual and if there is a clinical indication for a different treatment.  
 Also, if statistical significance favoring one treatment method over the other is identified pri or to 
completion of the study, and we feel there is harm to those not in that treatment arm, we will discontinue the study and publish results on the significant findings.  
 All adverse events will be reported to the IRB, and to other agencies as required including the FDA as per their protocol.  
 Table 6 above (copi[INVESTIGATOR_521226]), outlines the plan for follow -up medical history, 
physical examination, and laboratory testing developed for the purpose of safety monitoring, as well as follow -up phone call to monitor for adverse events.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_676056]:   The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_521262][INVESTIGATOR_521227] (CCTSI) CTRC which adheres to 
standard practices to assure human participant protection and data integrity.  Members of the DSMB 
will include a statistician, endocrinologist, child psychologistand human subject advocate. The DSMB 
will monitor the numbers of participants being followed in each of the two arms  (treatment and placebo) 
to assure the planned numbers per group, and will advise the PI [INVESTIGATOR_521228].  The DSMB will monitor the occurrence of laboratory abnormalities, medication side effects, and increases in externalizing or negative behaviors in participants to assure that negative effects of testosterone are 
minimized.  If side effects, laboratory abnormalities, or behavioral changes are deemed intolerable or 
negatively impact health of the study participant, the participant will be removed from the study and 
provided with appropriate medical or psychological follow -up.  See Attachment 1 for a copy of the 
finalized DSMB protocol.  
 
4.1.5  ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
If funded, this trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). However, such 
ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of enhanced bleeding , the risk of which increases in a 
graded fashion with prolonged exposure to DAPT. Recent studies have shown that 
withdrawing aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436953] P2Y [ADDRESS_553598] shown to of particular benefit in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, 
if an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -free approach can be considered after this time frame is a matter of debate. In 
fact, current guidelines recom mend maintaining P2Y 12 inhibiting therapy for high risk 
patients but which all imply background use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. P2Y 12 inhibitors for long -term 
(beyond 12 months) secondary prevention mainly include clopi[INVESTIGATOR_43696]. In 
particular, the dosing regi men for clopi[INVESTIGATOR_436954] 75 mg qd, whereas

3. Background and Significance:   
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y [ADDRESS_553601] of care 
for the prevention of thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1]. However, such ischemic 
benefit occurs at the expense of enhanced bleeding, the risk of which increases in a graded 
fashion with prolonged exposure to DAPT [1,2]. In light of the adverse prognosis associated 
with bleeding, there has been much attention toward identifying antithrombotic regimens that 
can reduce the risk of bleeding while maintaining  efficacy post -PCI [3,4]. Among these, 
maintaining P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy, after a brief period of DAPT, has emerged as a 
promising bleeding reduction strategy in a number of investigations [5]. Such aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -free 
approach has been postulated based on pharmacodynamic investigations demonstrating that, 
on background of potent P2Y [ADDRESS_553602] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 antiplatelet effect and may therefore mainly contribute to bleeding potential [5]. Recently, the 
Ticagrelor Wi th Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436955] -Risk Patients after Coronary Intervention 
(TWILIGHT) trial showed that among high -risk PCI patients, after 3 months of DAPT, 
P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with ticagrelor 90 mg bid (without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) reduced bleeding 
without increa sing ischemic harm after [ADDRESS_553603] to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [6].  
Although the TWILIGHT trial provides important insights on the benefits of an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -free 
approach within the first year after undergoing PCI , it does not address how to manage 
patients after this time frame. Current guidelines recommend maintaining P2Y 12 inhibiting 
therapy for high risk patients but which all imply background use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [1]. P2Y 12 
inhibitors for long -term (beyond 12 months ) secondary prevention mainly include 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_43696] [1]. In particular, the dosing regimen for clopi[INVESTIGATOR_436956] 75 mg qd, whereas ticagrelor dosing is recommended to be reduced from 90 mg bid 
to 60 mg bid [1]. In light of the i mproved outcomes associated with a ticagrelor [ADDRESS_553604]. Importantly, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have shown that the 90 and 60 mg 
ticagrelor regimens provide similar platelet inhibitory effects [7 -9]. However, the 60 m g 
regimen has been associated with an overall more favorable safety profile which is the 
rationale for it being recommended for long -term secondary prevention  in patients with 
CAD, irrespective of whether they underwent PCI  [10]. However, the PD effects of  ticagrelor 
[ADDRESS_553605] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are known to be at high -risk for both ischemic and 
bleeding complications post -PCI [11,12]. A number of factors which commonly affect 
patients with D M contribute to these observations, including the complexity of coronary 
interventions, endothelial dysfunction, concomitant comorbidities, and dysregulation of 
hemostatic and thrombotic processes [11,12]. Importantly, the prevalence of DM (mostly 
type 2) in the past decade has increased by 30% globally, an observation also reflected in PCI 
trials wherein DM is a more frequently encountered risk factor, and is projected to markedly 
increase in the upcoming decades [13]. These observations highlight the impo rtance of 
defining optimal post -PCI pharmacotherapy in patients with DM. Of note, a pre -defined 
subgroup analysis of the TWILIGHT trial showed that among patients with DM patients 
undergoing PCI, ticagrelor monotherapy significantly reduced clinically rele vant bleeding 
compared with ticagrelor plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], without increasing the risk of ischemic events [14]. In 
particular, the reduction in net adverse cardiac events in DM patients treated with a ticagrelor 
monotherapy strategy was markedly greater than tha t observed in non -DM patients [14]. 
While the potent level of P2Y [ADDRESS_553606] levels of P2Y 12 blockade induced by [CONTACT_8311][INVESTIGATOR_436957] [15]. Because DM patients are likely 
to continue with more potent antithrombotic treatment regimens for long -term secondary 
prevention beyond 12 mo nths [1,16], defining the optimal antithrombotic approach for these 
patients is of critical importance. In light of the above made observations, patients with DM 
represent an ideal population to define the antiplatelet effects of a ticagrelor [ADDRESS_553607] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
4. Specific Aims:   
The aim of this study is to assess the PD effects of ticagrelor [ADDRESS_553608] antiplatelet strategy when transitioning patients to 
long-term antiplatelet treatment.  
  
5. Research P lan: 
Research Design  
This will be a prospective , randomized , open -label study conducted in patients with CAD 
and diagnosis of DM. Patients can be on any background antiplatelet therapy, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436958] P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticagrelor or prasugrel). The study will be performed at the 
Division of Cardiology of University of [LOCATION_012] Health, Jac ksonville, [LOCATION_012] and patients will be 
recruited within the Cardiovascular services of our Institution. Patients will be screened by 
[CONTACT_8288], who will verify that all candidates meet inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Results from blood t ests performed within the last 90 days will be considered valid for 
screening purposes.  If these are not available, a blood sample will be collected for the screening 
phase after the patient has signed informed consent.  
Eligible patients will enter a 7-10 day run -in phase with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg/ qd plus ticagrelor 
[ADDRESS_553609] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 monotherapy for 10±3 days. After this period, patients will be randomized  using a randomly 
generated computer  sequence  in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment groups: a) ticagrelor 60 
mg bid monotherapy; b) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg  qd plus ticagrelor 60 mg bid; c) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg qd plus 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg qd. Randomized treatment will be maintained for 10±3 days. The app roach of 
having a run -in phase with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259940] 90 mg followed by [CONTACT_436969] 90 mg 
monotherapy is in line with the TWILIGHT trial  to assess for tolerability and compliance with 
ticagrelor therapy [6, 17 ]. The approach of having an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259940] 60 mg regimen as 
well as an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436959] -
term secondary prevention  [1,16]. The current investigation will test the hypothesis that the 
experimental strategy of ticagrelor 60  mg monotherapy will not result in significant changes in 
P2Y 12 inhibitory effects compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436960] 60 mg and will provide more 
effective platelet inhibition compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259941] . The study de sign is 
illustrated in Fi gure 1 and a further breakdown of what will occur during the course of the study:

Laboratory assessments  
Laboratory assessments will be the same for all time points  and will include:  
1. VerifyNow PRU  assay  
2. Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)  
3. Light transmittance aggregometry ( LTA ) 
4. Serum thromboxane B2  
5. Total Thrombus -Formation Analysis System (T -TAS)  
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8, dated 27Oct 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
Blood sampling : Peripheral venous blood samples (10 mL) will be drawn  through a short venous 
catheter inserted into a forearm vein and collected in anticoagulated and serum tubes at each 
study time point for all PD assessments. The first 2 -4 mL of blood will be discarded to avoid 
spontaneous platelet activation.   
 
Descripti on of laboratory assays  
1) VerifyNow PRU assay : The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection 
system which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance 
(Accriva, San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according  to manufacturer’s instructions [15]. The 
assay is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents for the pathways of interest. 
The instrument measures this change in optical signal and reports results in P2Y 12 Reaction Units 
(PRU).  
2) Whole b lood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP):   VASP phosphorylation (VASP -
P) is a marker of P2Y12 receptor signaling. VASP will be assessed the ELISA VASP -P kit 
(Biocytex Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) as previously described [15]. After a first step of par allel 
whole blood sample activation with PGE1 and PGE1+ADP, platelets from the sample are lysed, 
allowing released VASP to be captured by [CONTACT_2017] -human VASP antibody, which is coated in the 
microtiter plate. Then, a peroxidase -coupled anti -human VASP -P ant ibody binds to 
phosphorylated serine [ADDRESS_553614] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 to P2Y12 leads to Gi -coupled inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Therefore, the addition of ADP to 
PGE1 -stimulated platelets reduces  PGE1 -induced VASP -P levels. If P2Y12 receptors are 
successfully inhibited, addition of ADP will not reduce the PGE1 -stimulated VASP -P levels. The 
platelet reactivity index (PRI) will be calculated after measuring VASP -P levels.   
3) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) : Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood will be collected in citrated (3.8%) tubes. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel 
aggrego meter (Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described 
[15]. Platelet agonists will include ADP (20 µM), arachidonic acid (1 mM), collagen (3µg/ml), 
TRAP (15 μM) , and a combination of 2 µg/ml collagen -related peptide + 5 µM ADP +  15 µM 
TRAP (CAT). The reagent cocktail CAT will allow to assess the overall platelet response to a 
combination of agonists that leads to activation of multiple platelet pathways  (platelet -mediated 
global thrombogenicity) . PRP will be obtained as a superna tant after centrifugation of citrated 
blood at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C before use. Platelet 
poor plasma (PPP) will be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood fraction at 2800 rpm 
for 10 minutes. Light transm ission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP and to 100% for the PPP 
for each measurement. Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and platelet aggregation will be 
determined as the maximal percent change (MPA %) in light transmittance from baseline using 
PPP a s a reference.  
4) Serum thromboxane B2 : The concentration of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_8296]2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), as 
previously described [ 15]. Briefly, samples will be diluted with EIA buffer to bring their 
concentrations within the range of the standard curve. A standard curve will be established by 
 
[CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8, dated 27Oct 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 serial dilution of TXB2 between 1000 pg/mL and 7.8 pg/mL using EIA buffer as the matrix. The 
concentration of TXB2 in the samples will be calculated from a logistic [ADDRESS_553615] concentrations versus percentage bound/maximum bound.  
5) T-TAS: T -TAS is an automated microchip flow chamber system for the quantitative analysis  
of the thrombus formation process under blood flow conditions. T -TAS allows measurement of 
thrombus formation using the PL -chip (Diapharma, West Chester Township, OH) [18]. The PL -
chip contains 25 capi[INVESTIGATOR_181831] (width 40 μm, depth 40 μm) coated with type I c ollagen and 
is specifically designed for quantitative analysis of platelet thrombus formation, including 
platelet adhesion and aggregation, granule secretion, and thrombus growth in the absence of 
coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. In measurements using  the PL -chip, a blood sample 
collected in a hirudin containing blood sampling tube. The platelet aggregates gradually increase 
in size and, in the process, occlude the capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], resulting in an increase in flow pressure. In the 
present study, total platel et-derived thrombogenicity is expressed as the area under the flow 
pressure curve for the first [ADDRESS_553616] -chip tested at a flow rate of 18 μL/min (PL18 -
AUC10). Low PL18 -AUC10 reflect reduced thrombus growth and rapid breakdown of the 
thrombus.  
 
Study endpoints, sample size calculation and statistical analysis  
The primary end -point of the study is the comparison of the PRU determined by 
[CONTACT_436973][INVESTIGATOR_259940] 60 mg and ticagrelor 60 mg 
monotherapy at 10  ± 3 days (trough effect) . We hypothesize that ticagrelor monotherapy will be 
non-inferior to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259940]. Under the assumption of [ADDRESS_553617] 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 per group will allow for the 95% confidence interval (CI) to stay within 45 PRU  with a 80% 
power and alpha=0.025. Considering ~15% of invalid samples due to haemolysis, technical 
issues or drop out , and the 3 arms of treatment a total of 87 patients will n eed to be included. 
Non-inferiority will be assessed using a 95% CI of the difference in mean PRU  between the 2 
strategies . The sample size has been calculated according to data previously published [19]. A 
PRU of 45 was arbitrarily chosen for the noninferiority margin for the upper 95% CI limit of the 
difference  in line with prior similar investigations [ 20-22]. Secondary end points will include 1) 
the comparisons of platelet reactivity, measured by [CONTACT_436974]  (see 
Descriptio n of laboratory assays for details) between the different randomized treatments ; 2) the 
comparisons between ticagrelor 90 mg monotherapy  and the randomized treatments ; 3) the 
comparisons between groups of rates of high on -treatment platelet reactivity , defined according 
to consensus definitions [ 23]. Continuous variables will be expressed as a mean ± SD or median 
[IQR]. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. An analysis of 
variance method with a general linear model, with treatment as the main effect will be used to 
evaluate the primary non -inferiority endpoint as well as all superiority between -group 
comparisons at each time point. Least squares mean (LSM) di fferences in PRU between groups 
and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference will be obtained based on the analysis 
of variance model and used to assess non -inferiority.  Chi-square test and McNemar test will be 
used to compare categorical varia bles between groups. Statistical analysis will be performed 
using a SPSSv24 .0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).  
The PD population will include all patients with PD data and without a major protocol 
deviation thought to affect significantly the PD of ticagr elor or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. The PD population 
will be used for analysis of all primary and secondary PD variables. Erroneously treated patients 
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8, dated 27Oct 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 (eg, those randomized to one treatment but actually given the other) will be accounted for based 
on the actual treatmen t received.  
All patients who will receive at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safety 
population. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_436975] (including bleeding and 
ischemic). Adverse events will collected up to completion of the study. Bleeding events will b e 
classified according to BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) criteria [24]. Stent 
thrombosis will be classified according to ARC (Academic Research Consortium) definitions 
[25]. MI, including peri -procedural MI, will be defined according to the u niversal definition [26]. 
Ischemic stroke will be defined as an ischemic cerebral infarction caused by [CONTACT_436976] a major intracranial artery. Death will be considered cardiac in origin 
unless obvious non -cardiac causes can be identified.   
 
6. Possible Di scomforts and Risk : 
In clinical trials, the most important adverse effect associated with the use of ticagrelor 
was bleeding. The risk of major bleeding with ticagrelor 90 and 60 mg was 2.8% and 2.3%, 
respectively ; the combined risk of intracranial hemorrh age or fatal bleeding was <1% [7,27]. 
However, such bleeding prevalence occurred in the setting of long -term trial (median follow -up 
of 9 and 33 months  in PLATO and PEGASUS) with bleeding events that accrued over time, 
while our study is limited to only 30  ± 3 days of therapy. Ticagrelor will be compared with 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], which is also associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with placebo 
[28]. We do not anticipate that ticagrelor will significantly increase the risk of bleeding 
compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Dyspnea has been reported as the main non -bleeding side effect with 
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8, dated 27Oct 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 ticagrelor and occurs in up to 15.8% of patients [7,27]. Below is a complete lists of potential 
medication risks:  
• Bleeding  
• Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• Headache  
• Cough  
• Mild to  moderate diarrhea  
• Nausea  
• Hypotension (low blood pressure)  
• Hypertension  
• Dizziness  
• Non-cardiac chest pain  
• Back Pain  
• Fatigue  
• Cardiac (heart) chest pain  
 Patients who discontinue ticagrelor therapy will be switched back to their standard of 
care treatment reg imen.  
All clinical events described above, if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and  urgent revascularization proce dure with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_87258].  All serious adverse events will be sub mitted to the [COMPANY_008] 
Product Safety mailbox. Bleeding data will be collected using BARC  definitions [ 24]. The study 
will have a DSMB , comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), not directly involved in 
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8, dated 27Oct 2022    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 the research. In the event of a report of a serious adverse event the local committee will meet and 
antiplatelet treatment management will be managed according to physician recommendation.

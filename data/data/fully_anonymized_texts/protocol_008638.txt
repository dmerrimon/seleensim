Protocol Body
1.[ADDRESS_1168011] cancer can be cured by [CONTACT_44850], radiation and systemic 
therapy, once the disease has spread to distant organs it is not curable by [CONTACT_840536][INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patients with metastatic disease whose tumors spread the estrogen receptor (ER) or the progesterone receptor (PR) can be effectively palliated using a range of endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These include tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Chemotherapy is reserved for patients with hormone-insensitive or hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Endocrine and chemotherapeutic agents are also not curative in most patients with late stage breast cancer, in part because women who progress to stage IV often become refractory to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Consequently, patients with refractory stage IV disease are often treated primarily with palliative intent.
The median survival of patients with stage IV breast cancer is approximately two years. However, the 
outlook for survival in stage IV patients who have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen is often fewer than [ADDRESS_1168012] cancer, and the poor prognosis for this disease population, it is clear that new therapeutic options for treatment should be investigated.
2.2 Letrozole
Letrozole molecular weight is 285.31. It is freely soluble in dichloromethane, slightly soluble in ethanol, 
and practically insoluble in water. In human liver microsomes, femara strongly inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2A6 (CYP 2A6) and moderately inhibits the CYP isoenzyme 2C19 (CYP 2C19). Letrozole has not been shown to affect synthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, aldosterone, or thyroid hormones. Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_840523]. Absorption is not affected by [CONTACT_8208]. The volume of distribution (Vol D) is approximately 1.9 liters per kg of body weight. It is biotransformed in the liver, by [CONTACT_840537] 3A4 and 2A6 (CYP 3A4 and CYP 2A6), to an inactive carbinol metabolite and its ketone analog. Its half life is approximately 2 days. Time to steady-state concentration in the plasma is 2 to 6 weeks. Letrozole is eliminated renally, approximately 90% of a dose (approximately 75% as the glucuronide conjugate of the inactive metabolite, 9% as two unidentified metabolites, and 6% unchanged). Letrozole does not go under any metabolism through the CYP450.
Letrozole (4,4'-(1H-1,2,4-Triazol-1-ylmethylene)bis-benzonitrile) is a synthetic achiral benzydryltriazole 
derivative. It is an orally active highly selective non-steroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system. Aromatase inhibitors block the aromatase enzyme, consequently lowering estrogen 
levels and thereby [CONTACT_233773]. Letrozole effectively inhibits the conversion of 
androgens to estrogens in both in vitro  and in vivo . This property makes it in particular suitable for 
postmenopausal women whose main source of estrogen is via peripheral aromatization of androgen precursors.
Letrozole is up to 150-[ADDRESS_1168013] generation aromatase inhibitor 
Aminoglutethimide (AG), in vitro  and more than 10,[ADDRESS_1168014] cancer, daily doses of 0.1 to 5 mg Letrozole 
suppressed plasma levels of estradiol, estrone and estrone sulfate to 75-95% from baseline. A study done in postmenopausal breast cancer patients comparing Letrozole to Anastrozole concluded that 
Letrozole suppresses plasma estrogen levels more completely than Anastrozole 
2. Letrozole was 
statistically superior to Anastrozole in reducing plasma levels of both estrone sulfate (p=0.019) and 
estrone (p=0.0037). Patients switching from 6 weeks’ Anastrozole to 6 weeks’ Letrozole consistently achieved further estrogen suppression. Conversely, patients switching from 6 weeks’ Letrozole to 6 weeks’ Anastrozole experienced an increase in estrogen plasma levels.
2.2.1 Clinical Experience with Letrozole
A Phase III global, multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluated Letrozole (2.5 mg/day) as a first line 
hormonal therapy as compared to the present standard of treatment, tamoxifen (20 mg once daily)
 3. This 
trial accrued 907 postmenopausal women with ER and/or PR positive or unknown receptor breast cancer 
and locally advanced disease, metastatic disease, or loco-regional recurrence not amenable to treatment by [CONTACT_140955].  Patients received treatment until disease progression or discontinuation for any other reason.
The primary endpoint was time to disease progression.  Letrozole was superior to tamoxifen in TTP, 
reducing the risk of progression by 30% [hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.82, P=0.0001, Cox regression], with median time to progression 41 weeks for Letrozole and 26 weeks for tamoxifen.  Fewer patients progressed on Letrozole (69%) than on tamoxifen (77%). Secondary endpoints included overall tumor response rate, clinical benefit, and time to treatment failure.  Overall tumor response rate (complete and partial response) was significantly higher with Letrozole (30%) than with tamoxifen (20%) (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 2.31, P=0.0006, Mantel-Haenszel) with higher response rates seen irrespective of dominant site of disease.  Clinical benefit (CR, PR or stabilization of disease lasting at least 24 weeks) was significantly superior for Letrozole as compared to tamoxifen [P=0.001, Mantel-Haenszel].  Time to treatment failure (P=0.0001, Cox regression) was significantly superior for Letrozole compared to tamoxifen.  At the time of the analysis cutoff, 178 patients remain in the core portion of the trial (111 patients on Letrozole and 67 patients on tamoxifen).
Tolerability was similar in both arms of the trial, with 2% of patients on Letrozole and 3% of patients on 
tamoxifen discontinuing core therapy due to adverse events. In conclusion, Letrozole  has a highly favorable toxicity profile and is superior in TTP and CR compared to tamoxifen in patients with locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Based on this study and other supportive data, FDA approved Letrozole for first-line hormonal therapy in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in January 2001.
A recently completed randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing the efficacy of 4 months of 
therapy with Letrozole and tamoxifen as primary treatment in the pre-operative setting, confirms the 
superior efficacy of Letrozole over tamoxifen 
4. Response rate assessed by [CONTACT_235313] (primary 
endpoint) was 55% for Letrozole compared to 36% for tamoxifen (p 0.001). Response rates were 
similarly significant in favor of Letrozole when assessed by [CONTACT_840538].
2.3 Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec)
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a phenylaminopyrimidine derivative and is  a member of a new class of 
drugs collectively known as signal transduction inhibitors. More specifically, it is an inhibitor of several 
protein-tyrosine kinases that are believed to play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells. These include the tyrosine kinases associated with Bcr-Abl, the PDGF-R and c-Kit. Because these kinases are either uniquely or preferentially expressed in tumor cells, it is reasoned that the use of compounds causing inhibition of these targets may result in fewer or less debilitating side effects than those associated with standard anti-cancer chemotherapy.
The Bcr-Abl fusion protein, with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, is an end product of a reciprocal 
translocation between chromosomes [ADDRESS_1168015] in the role of PDGF in cancer stems from the finding that the transforming protein of the simian sarcoma retrovirus (v-sis oncogene product) is highly related to the B-chain of PDGF (c-sis proto-oncogene product). Expression of the v-sis or c-sis genes in cells expressing the PDGF receptor has been shown to cause cellular transformation and tumorigenicity in vivo . Dysregulation of PDGF-R signaling in tumors can lead to either autocrine or 
paracrine stimulation of cell growth. The PDGF-R pathway has been implicated in the growth of tumors of mesenchymal origin, most notably sarcomas and gliomas.
SCF is thought to play a central role in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. SCF synergizes 
with other growth factors to stimulate formation of both differentiated progenitor cells and primitive multi-lineage progenitor cells of the myeloid and erythroid lineages. Dysregulation of SCF receptor signaling has been implicated in some human cancers including SCLC, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, testicular and gynecological cancers. c-Kit and SCF over-expression is seen in most SCLC cell lines and primary tumors, raising the possibility of an autocrine loop. In GIST and mastocytosis mutations in c- kit resulting in ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor have 
been reported.
Accumulating evidence for the involvement of protein-tyrosine kinases in human proliferative disorders 
has led to a search for specific inhibitors. Imatinib Mesylate has been identified as a potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at the in vitro , cellular and in vivo  level. Furthermore, the compound inhibits 
PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events. These findings provided a cogent rationale for testing imatinib in human cancers where dysregulation of these pathways may contribute to malignant growth.
2.3.1. Clinical Experience with Imatinib Mesylate
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of Imatinib Mesylate have been evaluated in healthy subjects and in population 
pharmacokinetic studies in over [ADDRESS_1168016]-dose. Mean absolute bioavailability for the capsule formulation is 98%. Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of imatinib and its major active metabolite, the N-desmethyl derivative, were approximately 18 and 40 hours, respectively. Mean imatinib AUC increased proportionally with increasing dose in the range 25mg - 1000mg. There was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation is 1.5-2.5 fold at steady state when Imatinib Mesylate is dosed once daily. At clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma proteins in in vitro  experiments is approximately 95%, mostly to albumin and a
1-acid glycoprotein. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of imatinib. Other 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, play a minor role in its 
metabolism. 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Proof of activity was first obtained in a phase I clinical trial in patients with chronic and acute Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias 5. This was followed by [CONTACT_840539]+ leukemias as well 
as patients with a range of solid tumors.
Three international, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 studies were conducted to determine the safety and 
efficacy of Imatinib Mesylate in patients with Ph+ CML: 1) in the chronic phase after failure of Interferon 
(IFN) therapy 6, 2) in accelerated phase disease 7, or 3) in myeloid blast crisis 8. Doses administrated and 
efficacy results are shown in Table 1.

Imatinib Mesylate is indicated for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy. 
Chronic Phase, Newly Diagnosed
An open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study  of Interferon vs. STI571 (IRIS)  has been 
conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML within 6 months of their initial diagnosis 9. In the 
Imatinib Mesylate arm, patients were treated with 400mg daily. In the IFN arm, patients were treated with a target dose of IFN of 5 MIU/m
2/day subcutaneously in combination with subcutaneous Ara-C 20 mg/m2
/day for 10 days/month. A total of [ADDRESS_1168017] been randomized. An interim analysis done at the 
time when all patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months was presented at the ASCO 2002 Meeting (Abstract #1). Response data are shown in Table 2. Complete hematologic response, major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response were significantly higher in the Imatinib Mesylate arm compared to the IFN + Ara-C arm.

Targeted therapy offers the promise of reduced toxicity by [CONTACT_840540]-defined pathways. The 
estrogen receptor (ER) is one of the best characterized targets for breast cancer therapy. Successful ER-directed approaches include antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors. A randomized phase III clinical 
trial showed that Letrozole is superior to tamoxifen as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer 
3. 
Overall, 49% of patients treated with Letrozole had an objective response or were stable for longer than 6 
months. However, half of the patients did not respond to Letrozole despi[INVESTIGATOR_840524]/or progesterone receptors. The mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy are complex and not well defined. One such mechanism involves the overexpression of tyrosine kinase receptors such as  EGFR and HER-2. C-kit, a 145-kd transmembrane glycoprotein, is a member of tyrosine kinase subclass III. It is structurally related to other receptors of the same family; those include platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and flt-[ADDRESS_1168018] ductal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Expression of c-kit protein has been 
demonstrated in 10% to 20% by [CONTACT_4729]; c-kit mRNA has been detected in 80% of primary breast tumors in one study. Studies have also shown that co expression of c-kit and its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), is seen in the majority of surgical breast tumor specimens as well as in the 
majority of established breast tumor cell lines.  In particular, MCF-7 cells (that naturally express ER and 
SCF) transfected with a c-kit expression vector exhibit enhanced growth in serum-free medium 
supplemented with IGF-[ADDRESS_1168019] that co expression of SCF and 
kit may be involved in the response to erbB ligands through activation of MAPK and PI3K. 
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is composed of two chains, A and B, held together by [CONTACT_840541], AB, BB 16. The dimers bind to two receptor types:  and . 
The  receptor has a ligand-activated protein kinase. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is secreted 
by [CONTACT_840542]; PDGF has been demonstrated in malignant breast tissue and 
mostly localized in the periepi[INVESTIGATOR_410289] 17. Recent studies of plasma and tissue PDGF concentrations 
in breast patients indicated that PDGF levels predict for shorter survival times and a lower response to chemotherapy
 18. 
Imatinib Mesylate is a known inhibitor of the c-abl, bcr-abl, PDGF receptor and c-kit kinase activity 19. 
Imatinib Mesylate showed antitumor activity in the syngeneic BN-[ADDRESS_1168020] carcinoma model. When 
administered at 50mg/kg/ twice daily for four weeks, the compound inhibited primary tumors transplanted orthotopi[INVESTIGATOR_840525]. This drug is presently being investigated in hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. 
As mentioned previously, abnormalities in growth factor signaling pathways may account for the 
endocrine-resistant phenotype and thus may represent a target for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840526]. For example growth factor signaling via tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family (EGFR and HER2) may be up-regulated during endocrine treatment and 
thus allowing cells to grow in a hormone-independent manner 
20. In lines with that, it was shown that the 
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD-[ADDRESS_1168021] cancer patients 4, 
especially in those tumors which express higher levels of the tyrosine kinase receptors (Erb-B1 (EGFR) 
and Erb-B2 (Her-2/neu). Preclinical studies have shown that hormone-resistant MCF-[ADDRESS_1168022] additive effects, but might also, by [CONTACT_840543], synergistic effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Imatinib Mesylate in combination with Letrozole in patients with ER and /or PgR positive and C-kit and/or PDGFR positive metastatic breast cancer.

6.0 Expected Adverse Events/Dose Modifications
Expected Adverse Events Associated with Imatinib Mesylate
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The majority of Imatinib Mesylate-treated patients experienced adverse events at some time. Most events 
were of mild to moderate grade, but drug was discontinued for adverse events in 2% of patients in chronic phase, 3% in accelerated phase and 5% in blast crisis.
The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, and 
muscle cramps (Table 3 for newly diagnosed CML, Table 1-5 for other CML patients).  Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by [CONTACT_840545]. The frequency of severe superficial edema was 0.9%-5%.

With the exception of grade1/2 edema (but not grade 3/4), there were no obvious differences in the 
incidence of AEs in patients treated at [ADDRESS_1168031] that many patients were dose-escalated over time and in all studies AEs were 
analyzed according to starting dose. Patients aged 
 65 years also experienced a higher incidence of 
edema.
Less than 50% of patients required dose reduction at any time. Temporary treatment interruptions were 
required in 25-40% of patients. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_840527], the overall median dose-intensity (expressed in mg/day) in each study remained close to the initially planned dose.
Clinically important adverse events
Because of their relative frequency and clinical significance, several AEs occurring during the phase II 
leukemia trials were analyzed in greater detail, as summarized below.
Edema and fluid retentionSuperficial edema was one of the most frequently reported AEs but was rarely severe (2-5% Grade 3/4). 
The most frequently involved sites included the periorbital region, face and lower limbs. The edema usually appeared within the first two months of treatment. A minority of patients with severe edema required dose reduction. 
A minority (<5%) of patients developed central collections of fluid (described collectively using the term 
‘fluid retention’) including one or more of the following: congestive heart failure, pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion and pulmonary edema. It is unclear if the mechanisms underlying peripheral edema and fluid retention are the same. Fluid retention was usually managed with diuretics and/or dose reduction, or with temporary treatment interruption. 
Gastrointestinal and CNS hemorrhagesIn toxicology studies, imatinib was shown to be a local irritant and for that reason, the pattern of GI tract 
hemorrhages was carefully reviewed. These events were rare, and severe (Grade 3/4) cases were reported only in advanced CML patients. GI hemorrhages occurred in 3-5% of patients with advanced CML, were considered drug-related in 0-2% and severe in <1.5%. Contributing factors such as severe thrombopenia, the use of concomitant NSAIDS and a history of gastric ulcer were present in most but not all cases. Upper GI ulceration (esophageal, gastric or duodenal) or gastritis/duodenitis were visualized at gastroscopy in approximately 50% of patients with GI bleeding. Less than 1% of patients discontinued therapy as a result of these events. 
Cerebral hemorrhages (including subdural hematomas and hygromas) were also reported almost 
exclusively in advanced CML patients (1-7%). The majority occurred in the context of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574], with concomitant thrombocytopenia.. 
Skin rashAn erythematous, pruritic, maculopapular skin rash, most prominent over the forearms and trunk but 
occasionally present also on the face, was reported in up to 44% of patients treated with imatinib. Onset was generally within the first month of therapy. Eosinophilia was rarely seen and skin biopsies showed the typi[INVESTIGATOR_86862] a toxic drug reaction with a mixed infiltration of cells. Occasional patients reported pruritus without accompanying rash. In most cases, the rash was mild, easily manageable with antihistamines and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], and gradually subsided without interrupting therapy. However, a troublesome skin rash was the most frequent reason (in <1% of patients overall) for the permanent discontinuation of therapy. Approximately 3% of patients developed severe skin rashes, some with an exfoliative component. Re-challenge was usually but not always positive.
GIST
Treatment with Imatinib Mesylate was generally well tolerated, although nearly every patient experienced 
at least some minor adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events were edema, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, rash, headache, and abdominal pain. Most events were of mild to moderate severity. Superficial edema, most frequently periorbital or lower limb edema, was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by [CONTACT_840545]. Severe (CTC grade 3/4) superficial edema was observed in 2 patients including face edema in one patient. No major differences were seen in the severity of adverse events between the 400mg or 600mg treatment groups, although overall incidence of adverse events was somewhat higher in the 600mg treatment group. Adverse events with a suspected relationship to therapy occurring in greater than 10 % of patients in any group are presented in Table 5.

6.5 Concomitant Therapy
In general, concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840528], such as biphosphonates, are allowed, provided their use is documented in the patient records and on the appropriate case report form. The administration of any other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840529], however, permitted. Similarly, the use of other concurrent investigational drugs is not allowed. 
Because of the inherent risk of either reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of the concomitant medication 
and/or Imatinib Mesylate, drugs known to interact with the same CYP450 isoenzymes (2D6 and 3A4) as Imatinib Mesylate should be used with caution.  Patients using concomitant medications known to be metabolized by [CONTACT_86944] p450 enzymes will not be excluded from the study. (See Appendix D)  However, the patients must be carefully monitored for potentiation of toxicity  due to individual concomitant medication Special care has to be given to the concomitant use of acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol or Percocet, paracetamol Panadol, etc.) with Imatinib Mesylate. Any use of concomitant medication must be captured in the concomitant medication CRF.
Since warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 system, no therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin 
(e.g. Coumadin
 or Coumadine ) will be permitted in patients participating in this study.  As an 
alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using low-molecular weight heparin (e.g. Lovenox) or heparin.  A mini-Dose coumarin derivative (equivalent to 1 mg QD Coumadin
) is permitted 
for prophylaxis of central venous catheter thrombosis, at the discretion of the treating physician.  In general, the use of Coumadin
 is discouraged on this protocol.
The routine use of systemic corticosteroid therapy is not permitted. Prophylactic anti-emetics should be 
withheld until the patient has experienced grade 1 nausea or vomiting.
Prophylactic use of loperamide  (e.g. Imodium  , with suggested  dosing as start: 4mg p.o. x 1, than 2mg 
p.o. after each loose stool, max 16mg/d)  is recommended for patients experiencing grade [ADDRESS_1168041] and abdomen and bone 
scan (correlating bone X-rays is required if bone scan is positive), or PET scan.
7.1.4 Baseline laboratory studies will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver functions, 
tumor markers (CEA and CA 27.29), creatinine.
7.1.5 Laboratory tests: Week 1 2, 3, 4, 6, 8: Complete blood count, liver, electrolytes and creatinin. 
These laboratory tests will be performed monthly thereafter.
7.1.6 Clinic visits with physical exam: Baseline, months 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 (Tumor markers (CEA and CA 
27.29) will be drawn during these visits. 
7.1.7 Radiologic imaging/restaging: Months 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 : Affected area will be evaluated. Patients 
with stable or responsive disease will be followed every 3 months thereafter.
7.1.8 Correlative studies: Serum for angiogenic molecules and cytokines including: serum vascular 
endothelial growth factor (sVEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Interleukine-8 (IL-8), 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), E-selectin, tumor-necrosis factor-  (TNF-), 
tumor-necrosis factor-  (TNF-), IGF-II and IGFBP-3 and proteomic analysis:  Baseline and 
months 2 and 4.
8.0 Efficacy Assessment
8.1 Definitions
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205-216, 2000].  
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided 
below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy
8.1.[ADDRESS_1168042] one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded) as 
10 mm with conventional techniques (PET, CT, MRI, x-ray) or a 
with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457].  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).
8.1.2 Non-measurable disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable.
8.1.3 Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of 
all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].
8.1.4 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers 
per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
8.[ADDRESS_1168043] of a treatment.
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x-ray.  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_699246].  For CT, cuts of 7 or 7.5 mm  slice thickness (contiguously), for MR 6-[ADDRESS_1168044], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck 
tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.
Ultrasound (US).   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, US should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of 
superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].
Tumor markers .  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
8.3 Response Definitions:
Complete Response (CR).   Disappearance of all evidence of tumor for at least one 
cycle of therapy (four weeks).  Bone lesions must have improved by [CONTACT_840546] x-ray.  The patient must be free of all symptoms of cancer.  Markers must be normal.
Partial Response (PR).  30% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of 
diameters of all measured lesions persisting for at least one cycle of therapy or [ADDRESS_1168045] 30%.  No lesion may increase in size and no new lesion may appear.  Bone lesions must have improved by [CONTACT_840547] x-ray.  Markers must have improved.
Minor Response (MR).   A measurable decrease in measurable lesion(s), which is too 
small or too brief to qualify as a Partial Response.  MR is considered a failure, but should 
be noted as a possible signal of biologic activity.
Progressive Disease (PD).   Any increase of 
 25% in the sum of the products of 
diameters of any measurable lesion or in estimated size of non-measurable lesions or 
appearance of an unequivocally new lesion. Patients should have received at least two cycles of therapy before a designation of progression is made.  An increase of 50% or development of unequivocally new lesions between the first and second cycle will be considered progression without repeat measurements.
No Change (NC).   No change in tumor size, or 
25% increase in size.
MR and PD  are considered failures.
Development of a new brain lesion will be considered progressive disease.
Confirmation of Response. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_54672] [ADDRESS_1168046] be made to determine the reason(s) why a patient fails to return for the necessary visits or is discontinued from the trial. Information regarding the reason for not completing the trial will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms.
It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If for any patient study 
treatment or observations were discontinued the reason will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Reasons that a patient may discontinue participation in a clinical study are considered to constitute one of the following:
1. adverse event(s)
2. abnormal laboratory value(s)3. abnormal test procedure result(s)4. unsatisfactory therapeutic effect5. subject's condition no longer requires study drug6. protocol violation7. subject withdrew consent8. lost to follow-up9. administrative problems10. Death.
Any patient who receives at least one dose of trial medication will be included in the 
safety analysis.
10.[ADDRESS_1168047] or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug (or therapy). Study drug (or therapy) includes the drug (or therapy) under evaluation, and any reference or placebo drug (or therapy) given during any phase of the trial.
if it is unclear what study treatment includes, list all drug(s), other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], changes to existing 
therapy, diagnostic procedure, etc. that are specified by [CONTACT_840548]/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form are recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are recorded.
Serious adverse events
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form. To ensure patient safety each serious adverse event must also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:1. is fatal or life-threatening2. required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]3. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect5. are medically significant, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:
routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in 
condition.  
treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen
treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
Pregnancy, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also be reported on a serious adverse event form or pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities.
Any serious adverse event occurring in a patient after providing informed consent and until [ADDRESS_1168048] medical treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of 
concomitant medication).
10.[ADDRESS_1168049] dose of study medication  and 
on or before the final visit, will be reported on the Adverse Experience form in the patient's CRF. 
7.2.1 At each visit/assessment, adverse experiences will be evaluated by [CONTACT_3786]. Adverse experiences not previously documented in the study   
will be recorded in the adverse experience record form within the patient's CRF.  The nature of each experience, date and time (where appropriate) of  onset, outcome, course (i.e. intermittent or constant), maximum intensity, action taken with respect to dosage and relationship to treatment will be established. Details of changes to the dosage schedule or any corrective treatment will be recorded on the appropriate pages of the CRF. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1168050] 
10.3 Instructions for rapid notification of serious adverse events
Reporting responsibility
Each serious adverse event (but not pregnancies) must be reported by [CONTACT_840549] 
[ADDRESS_1168051] also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of receiving it. If the serious adverse event has not been previously documented (new occurrence) and it is thought to be related to study drug (or therapy), the Medical Safety Expert of the Clinical Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (CS&E) Department may contact [CONTACT_433051]. If warranted, an investigator alert may be issued, to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug (or therapy) that this serious adverse event has been reported.
Reporting procedures
The investigator must complete the Serious Adverse Event Report Form in English, assess the 
relationship to study treatment and send the completed form by [CONTACT_6791] [PHONE_2024] within 24 hours to the 
local [COMPANY_001] Clinical Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (CS&E) Department ensuring that the form is accurately 
and fully completed, must then fax it to [COMPANY_001] CS&E Department within [ADDRESS_1168052] be retained. Pregnancy follow-up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities or birth defects.

Amendments affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC/REB approval but the IRB/IEC/REB of each center must be kept informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not requiring formal protocol amendments and IRB/IEC/REB approval that can be treated as administrative amendments include:

Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, Hong Kong 1989, Somerset West 1996).
The investigator agrees, when signing the protocol, to adhere to the instructions and procedures described in it and thereby [CONTACT_54957].
12.[ADDRESS_1168055]/Independent Ethics Committee
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information 
to subjects, must be reviewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC/REB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB must be given to [COMPANY_001] before study initiation. The name [CONTACT_269808]/IEC/REB must be supplied to [COMPANY_001]. Any amendments to the protocol, other than administrative ones, must be approved by [CONTACT_91736].
12.[ADDRESS_1168056] (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the 
study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.
This informed consent should be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non-technical 
language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may be made or signature [CONTACT_89447] [CONTACT_423]’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained.
The informed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol, and must be submitted by [CONTACT_128927]/IEC/REB approval.
13.[ADDRESS_1168057] cancer.   A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued at MDACC at an expected rate of  2  patients per month, taking into consideration recent historical experience for this category of patients.  The accrual period should thus be completed within 24 months.  The maximum sample size of 45 patients will provide an estimate of ORR with 90% credibility interval (assuming targeted rate of 40%) of width 0.24.  The final analysis will also report a summary of time to disease progression, any toxicities observed during treatment, and separate estimates of objective response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_840550].  All patients who receive any dose of therapy will be included in assessments of all outcomes, with patients removed from trial for any reason counted as failures in computing ORR.
Further investigation of Imatinib Mesylate is warranted only if its addition can substantially improve the 
efficacy of Letrozole alone.  In a large randomized trial, single-agent Letrozole resulted in objective responses in 136 of 453 patients (30%).  The trial will be monitored using a Bayesian method and with cohorts of size 15; termination will be recommended if there is strong evidence that ORR is unlikely to be more than 10% greater than with Letrozole alone.  (Formally, the trial will be terminated after 15 or 30 
patients if Pr[ORR (Letrozole + Imatinib Mesylate) 
 ORR (Letrozole) + .10  data]  0.05.  The 
comparative response rate for Letrozole alone is represented by a distribution of beta (136, 317), and a 
beta (0.60, 1.40) prior distribution is assumed for ORR of the experimental group.  Maximum sample size is set at 45 patients.)
The first interim analysis will be conducted after the initial [ADDRESS_1168058] been observed among 30 patients.

14.0 Correlatives Laboratory Studies
14.1 Tissue biopsies (fresh and fixed) (Optional)
Imatinib Mesylate is expected to affect the activation status of sensitive receptor tyrosine kinase targets 
and associated  signaling effectors. In patients with disease amenable to biopsy (Chest wall, Skin, LNs, or some visceral disease) patients will have a biopsy (at baseline and at approximately 8 weeks) in order to assess mechanisms of anti-tumor activity through analysis of receptor activation (phosphorylation) and downstream signaling through known pathways (EGFR, HER-2/neu, kit, phospho-kit, akt, Stat, phospho-akt, MAPkinase, phospho-MAPkinase).

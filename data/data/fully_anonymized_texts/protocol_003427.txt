Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October [ADDRESS_1183658] -Acting Antiviral  Treatm ent Of Hepatitis C -Negative 
Patients Who Receive Kidney Transplants From Hepatitis C-Positive Donors  
Clinical study phase  II 
Study objectives  This study is being conducted to determine safety and efficacy of transplanting 
kidneys from HCV virus  (HCV) -infected  donors into HCV -negative patients on the 
kidney transplant waitlist, who will then be treated with Zepatier , Mavyret,  Epclusa, 
or another appropriate antiviral treatment status post -single kidney transplantation. 
Primary aim:  
1. Primary efficacy objective :  to determine sustained virologic response ( SVR) 
rates of open -label Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate 
antiviral treatment in HCV- negative patients who receive a kidney transplant 
from an   HCV- infected  donor, leading to post -transplantation de -novo HCV  
infection.  
 
2. Primary safety objective :  to determine the safety of administration of open -
label Zepatier , Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral treatmen t 
among HCV- negative patients who receive a kidney transplant from an   
HCV- infected  donor and develop post -transplant HCV  infection.  
Secondary aims:  
3. To determine 1 -year graft survival rates of HCV -negative kidney transplant 
patients who receive a kidney transplant from a n  HCV -infected  donor, 
including those who spontaneously clear HCV ( and those who receive open -
label Zepatier , Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral treatment  
upon development of de -novo HCV.

Study design  Open -labelled pi[INVESTIGATOR_267828]  (MK-5172 and MK -8742 /Grazoprevir + 
Elbasvir) , Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral treatment  in HCV-
negative subjects with end -stage renal disease receiving a kidney transplant from a 
HCV- positive donor . Eligible subjects will receive a kidney transplant from a deceased -
donor with detectable  HCV  nucleic acid , and then will receive  Zepatier , Mavyret , 
Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral treatment after kidney transplantation when 
infection with HCV is confirmed in these kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . For Zepatier, 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 2020 
4 treatment will be complete after 12 weeks. * For Mavyret treatment will be complete 
after 8 weeks, and Epclusa treatment will be complete after 12 weeks.  
 
* Patients with Genotype 1a and Genotype [ADDRESS_1183660] polymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, L31, and/or Y93, treatment with 
Zepatier will be extended to 16 weeks, rather than 12 weeks, and renally -adjusted 
Ribavirin at the clinician’s discretion will be initiated, and continued for the remainder 
of therapy (until the 16 week mark). Such a strategy will provide optimal treatment, 
without d elaying therapy prior to receipt of results of NS5A drug resistant testing.

time points during follow -up.  
• Fibroscan at screening, post -transplant (prior to treating HCV ), and post -
treatment  
• HCV RNA  prior to treatment, on treatment, and 4 and 12 weeks after 
completing Zepatier .

Number of subjects  Estimated   75 HCV -negative subjects transplanted with a  kidney from an HCV -
positive donor  
Plan for statistical 
analysis  Primary endpoint:  
• Post -treatment sustained virologic  response ( SVR)  
Secondary endpoints:  
• Determine if there are major adverse events attributable to HCV  therapy in 
post -kidney transplant patients.  
• Evaluate 1 -year kidney graft survival in HCV -negative patients who receive a 
kidney transplant from an HCV- positive donor  
• Determine the rates of spontaneous HCV  clearance among HCV -negative 
patients with end -stage renal disease receiving a kidney from an HCV -
positive donor  
 Data analysis:  
The primary analysis will be based on a calculation of SVR rates (number of 
subjects with SVR-12; negative HCV  RNA  12 weeks after completing Zepatier , 
Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral treatment) / (number of 
subjects treated with Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral 
treatment  post -kidney transplantation)

[ADDRESS_1183665] kidneys from donors with HCV  because of the many complications caused by [CONTACT_851309]. However, new antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851277] >95% for all HCV genotypes  should prompt transplant leaders to view HCV -positive organs as a valuable 
opportunity both for transplant candidates  with chronic HCV  and for u ninfected patients awaiting 
transplantation. The resulting expansion of the donor pool has the potential to save hundreds of lives annually. 
In many regions of the us, average waiting times for kidney transplantation surpass five years, especially for patients with blood types A, B, or O. Current regulations from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS, the 
organization that oversees the US system of solid organ transplantation) and the Health Resources and S ervices 
Administration (HRSA) do not prohibit the use of HCV -positive kidneys for HCV -negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851278] -positive organs

within the first four weeks post- transplantation, and do not require treatment, subjects will be added until there

2020 
8 4 CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
4.1. Background 
The scarcity of organs for kidney transplantation and high death rates on the waiting list have led some patients 
to accept kidneys with elevated risks of disease transmission, including infection and cancer. In certain cases, 
such as the transmission of cytomegalovirus, physicians can anticipate these events and institute preventive measure s. In contrast, transplant teams often discard kidneys from donors with HCV because of the many 
complications caused by [CONTACT_851310]. However, new antiviral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851277] >95% in all HCV genot pyes  should prompt transplant leaders to view HCV -positive 
organs as a valuable opportunity both for transplant candidates with chronic HCV  and for uninfected patients 
awaiting transplantation.
1-[ADDRESS_1183666] death rates are 4% per year, and much higher 
among diabetics and the elderly.  The kidney transplant waiting list exceeds 100,[ADDRESS_1183667]-transplant HCV 
complications, both hepatic (e.g., cirrhosis) and extra- hepatic (e.g., glomerulonephritis that can injure the kidney 
transplant), but largely from low efficacy rates of interferon -based regimens, which also carried a substantial risk 
of transplan t rejection due to interferon. However, new all-oral HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851279] -infected  donors ..
6  Importantly, early evidence suggests that response rates to 
new HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851280] -transplant sett ing 
(based on data on liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851281] 2014 AASLD liver meeting7 and our own 
publications in the Annals of  Internal Medicine and the American Journal of Transplantation ).8,9 
 Current regulations from the United Network for Organ S haring (UNOS, the organization that oversees the US 
system of solid organ transplantation) and the Health Resources and S ervices Administration (HRSA) do not 
prohibit the use of HCV -positive kidneys for HCV- negative rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and it has been done in rare cases for the 
last 20 years.    Based on national registry data, from 2005 -2014, among 3,273 HCV -positive deceased donors (yielding a 
potential 6,546 kidneys) consented for organ donation, 2,402 (37.0%) of these kidney s were transplanted, while 
4,144 (63.0%) were discarded. These discarded HCV -positive kidneys could have led to a lifesaving transplant to 
[ADDRESS_1183668] in which ‘high -risk’ 
organs are viewed for transplantation. Importantly, with regards to treatment of these patients and post -
transplant renal function, based on publis hed data, approximately 90% of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851282] ≥30ml/min/1.73m
2. However, some patients will not achieve this 
threshold, and/or will require treatme nt for their HCV prior to week [ADDRESS_1183669] –transplant. Thus, treatment of these 
patients with Zepatier  in the setting of genotype [ADDRESS_1183670] been released that are safe to use in individuals

These medicati ons include Mavyret and Epclusa.

2020 
9 4.2. Rationale of the study  
We will perform an extension of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_851283] -infected  organs for 
HCV- negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], by [CONTACT_302449]  75 HCV -negative subjects with kidneys from HCV -infected  
donors, and then treating these subjects’ with Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa, or another appropriate antiviral 
treatment  in the early post -transplant phase in order to cure their HCV .  
4.3. Zepatier  for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851276] 1 or 4 HCV 
Open -label Zepatier (grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg) will be administered.3,4 Zepatier is a fixed- dose 
combination tablet without ribavirin. GZR  is an HCV  NS3/4a inhibitor while EBR is an HCV  NS5A  inhibitor. Both 
grazoprevir and elbasvir are direct -acting antivirals, which together form an effective therapy for HCV  and 
reduce the likelihood and effects of long -term liver -related HCV complications. GZR/EBR exhibits broad in vitro 
activity against most HCV genotypes and in vitro activity against many clinically relevant RAVs .3,[ADDRESS_1183672] been  carried out, which led to FDA approval for Zepatier  as a treatment for genotype 1  or 
4 HCV. 
As of July 1, 2015, a diverse population of over 1000 HCV  patients has been exposed to Zepatier  either as a 
single agent or in combination with ribavirin or sofosbuvir in phase I/II/III studies . Zepatier  has been generally 
well tolerated at doses of 50 -100 mg GZR and 50 mg EBR orally once daily . It has been comparably effective 
across all subgroups it has been tested in, including non -cirrhotic and/or treatment -naïve subjects .3,[ADDRESS_1183673] Zepatier  trials, the majority  of the adverse events 
were reversible. These adverse  events are usually grade 1 or 2 mild or moderate events.  
The dosage in our study (100/50 mg daily ) is a commonly attainable dose in clinical practice. Zepatier  has shown 
to be safe for subjects with chronic kidney disease or who are on hemodialysis. Less  than 1% of Zepatier  is 
excreted renally. In [COMPANY_006]  C-SURFER,  a phase [ADDRESS_1183674] demonstrated a 94 -100% success rate achieving HCV  RNA  levels of <15 IU /ml after 12 weeks 
of treatment (SVR -12) among genotype 1  or 4 HCV patients .3,4  
 
HCV g enotype (either on donor sera or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_269846]) will be confirmed by [CONTACT_851311][INVESTIGATOR_71971].  
 4.4. Mavryet or Epclusa for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851284] 
2, 3, 5, or 6  
For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302415] a kidney  from a donor with genotype 2, 3, 5, or 6, the treatment regimen will be 
either 8 weeks of Mavyret  (glecaprevir 100 mg and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 40 mg ) or Epclusa (sofosbuvir 400 mg and 
velpatasvir 100 mg).   Mayvret is similar to Zepatier and has demonstrated SVR -12 (cure) rates of genotype 1 and 4 HCV of 99%.
[ADDRESS_1183675] cure rates of 95 -99% in patients with genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6, and 
thus is considered a pan -genotypic regimen.[ADDRESS_1183676] -transplant patient who is extubated, stable, and taking medications.   
The Epclusa  treatment regimen, similar to Zepatier, has demonstrated SVR- 12 (cure) rates of genotype 1 an d 4 
HCV that exceeds 95%. However, Epclusa has also been shown to have cure rates of 95 -100% in patients with 
genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6, and is thus considered a pa n-genotypic HCV regimen.

12 6 CHAPTER 3: SCREENING AND SUBJECT SELECTION  
6.1. Recruitment: identification and screening process  
The trial’s phases can be categorized as “screening phase,” (when patients are  consented and will undergo 
evaluation for enrollment), “waiting list phase” (when patients are enrolled and are waiting for an offer of 
transplantation) and “transplantation phase” (after a HCV -positive kidney has been received and transplanted ). 
 Subject s will be recruited for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_199537]- label clinical trial. Potential subjects will first be identified by [CONTACT_851312], clinical staff, and/or research staff evaluating patients at the transplant nephrology clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. There will be two key methods to identifying potential subjects. On the day of a patient’s evaluation for waitlisting for a kidney transplant, the transplant nephrologist will identify patients as potential subjects for the study . Additionally, the research coordinator will review the kidney 
transplant waitlist every two weeks with a study investigator to identify potential subjects who have  ≤2555 
(blood group A, B, or O) and  ≤1825  (blood group AB) days  of waitlist or dialysis  time  by [CONTACT_294819] . Updates on 
transplant status will be continued to followed for these patients even after initial review and noted as apart of study data.  
 Potential subjects will be contact[CONTACT_851313]/or research staff to gauge 
interest. In addition, we will obtain  permission  from the transplant nephrologists for their patient ’s 
participation, through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851285]. The n ephrologists will be instructed in the e -mail that if we do not hear an 
objection within 48  hours, then that is commensurate to their assenting that their patient is appropriate for 
study participation . Potential subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to attend an 
informational meeting /presentation either in -person or by [CONTACT_152577]  (in accordance with University of 
Pennsylvania Office of Clinical Research regulatory guidance) , where the study investigators and research sta ff 
will explain the study and its risks and benefits. If the patient is interested in participating in the study, informed consent will be acquired by [CONTACT_16133], at which time the subject can formally be screened for entry.    Patients who are scr eened will be tracked in  a pre -screening log to facilitate the screening process . The study 
team has worked with their department’s Information Technology Team and their recommendations for protecting potential subject health information will be put into p lace.  
 During screening, the investigators will review the list of patient’s medications and identify medications that might be contraindicated with potential direct acting antiviral treatments (example: atorvastatin, which 
interacts with Mavyret). If clinically appropriate, the investigators may recommend to the patient and primary 
provider to stop or change the medication in anticipation of future treatment for hepatitis C virus infection.   
 6.1.1.  Disenrollment criteria  
Subjects who are designated statu s 7 (temporarily inactive and unable to receive any kidney offers until 
reactivated) will continue to be followed . If the subject is reactivated, his/her status, based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_851314] . 
Additionally, as stated below, an inclusion criterion is ≤2555 days of accrued waiting time at the time of 
enrollment  for blood group A, B, or O and ≤ [ADDRESS_1183678] remains enrolled at the 
time he/she has accrued 2920 days  (for blood group A, B, or O) or 2190 days (for blood group AB)  of 
waiting/priority  time, he/she will be disenrolled, but will stay on the kidney transplant waiting  list at Penn. If a 
subject reaches  66 years of age, he/she will be disenrolled from the study. Once a subject is disenrolled from the 
study, his/her UNOS status will be changed to reflect that they are no longer accepting hepatitis C -positive 
kidneys.

6.3.1.  Donor Evaluation 
To remain in the study,  subjects will receive a kidney transplant from a confirmed HCV -infected  donor as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_851315].  
 
6.3.2 .  Donor Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (when possible) 
We will accept donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851286]. The ability to obtain donor blood for HCV genotype testing prior to transplant will not be required.  
Where available,  donor genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_851287] -of-Life, the local organ procurement organization . These specimens will be taken 
from potential kidney  donors once the organ procurement organization  has been notified of the potential donor 
and will be qualified for testing by [CONTACT_851316] -of-Life.  
 
In other instances, we will perform genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_851288].  
The assay that will be used for HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a laboratory -developed assay that was validated by [CONTACT_267871], MD, PhD . The validation process entailed testing multiple past 
clinical samples with known H CV genotypes, as well as purchased HCV genotype controls, and assessing 
concordance between the results obtained and the expected results.16 This assay (the eSensor® HCVg Direct  
Test, GenMark Diagnostics) has also been validated by [CONTACT_267872]: Covance Central Laboratory Services (482 samples, 98.6% concordance), Un iversity of Minnesota (135 samples, 
96.4% concordance), and the University of Washington (77 samples, 97.4%).
17-[ADDRESS_1183681], ov erall, the 
assay was able to genotype all purchased controls correctly (n=15, HCV genotypes 1 through 6, concordance = 100%). It was also able to correctly genotype the vast majority of prior clinical samples (n=[ADDRESS_1183682] ance = 92%). Resolution of discordant samples showed that the limitations of 
the assay, as determined by [CONTACT_267873], included decreased ability to genotype samples with: low viral loads, mixed genotype infections, or HCV genotype 4f infection. These li mitations are felt to be minor as low viral load 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
15 specimens are not expected from HCV -untreated organ donors, and mixed genotype / genotype 4f specimens 
are very rarely encountered in the [LOCATION_002]. The validation samples were pi[INVESTIGATOR_851289] d the 
limitations of the assay and so had a higher proportion of mixed infection samples (n=6) and rare genotype 
samples (e.g., Type 4f, n=1) than what is encountered clinically. A retrospective review by [CONTACT_267874] a 14 -month period (July 2014 to October 2015) by [CONTACT_267875][INVESTIGATOR_124365] (Siemens VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0) found a total of 6 mixed  infections and one genotype 4f 
infection out of 1,551 samples tested (~0.4% and 0.06%, respectively ).  
6.3.2.  Drug Resistance Testing  
Participants with Genotype 1a and Genotype [ADDRESS_1183683] uses reverse transcription p olymerase 
chain reaction (PCR)  and DNA  sequencing to detect  mutations [resistance associated variants (RAVs) ] in the NS5a 
inhibitors . It has not been  cleared or approved by  [CONTACT_851317]. 
The test will be performed by a lab qualified by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_302412].  It has an a nalytical sensitivity  of 
>95% for viral loads ≥1800 IU/mL .20 Reported results include mutations and polymorphisms associated with NS5A 
inhibitor resistance (only if HCV genotype 1a,  1b, or 1 detected)  as well as a patient specific  interpretation :  
• Resistance predicted: ≥1 mutation predicting NS5A inhibitor resistance detected  
• Resistance not predicted: no mutations predicting NS5A inhibitor resistance detected

16 7 CHAPTER 4: TREATMENTS  
7.1. Zepatier  (grazoprevir and elbasvir)  for kidney  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302404] 1 or genotype 4 infectio n 
Zepatier tablets will be provided by [CONTACT_267878]-initiated protocol funded by [CONTACT_44873] . Open -
label Zepatier  (grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg) will be administered once daily by [CONTACT_5555] [ADDRESS_1183684] polymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, L31, 
and/or Y93  as determined by [CONTACT_267879] C Viral RNA Genotype [ADDRESS_1183685]. In this case , 
treatment with Zepatier  will be extended to 16 weeks and renally -adjusted Ribavirin will be initiated at the 
clinician’s discretion , and continued for the remainder of therapy (until the 16 -week  mark) . Such a strategy will 
provide optimal treatment, without delaying therapy prior to receipt of results of NS5A drug resistant testing.  
Grazoprevir ( GZR)/ elbasvir ( EBR) is a fixed -dose combination tablet without ribavirin.  
 
GZR is an HCV  ns3/4a inhibitor while EBR is an HCV  NS5A  inhibitor. Both are direct -acting antivirals, which together 
form an effective therapy for HCV  virus and reduce the likelihood and effects of long -term liver- related HCV 
complications. GZR /EBR exhibits broad in vi tro activity against most HCV  genotypes and in vitro activity against 
many clinically relevant  resistance -associated variants (RAVs).   
 
Zepatier (GZR/EBR) has been evaluated globally in multiple phase I, II, and III trials to treat HCV . Randomized, 
placebo -controlled trials have been completed and led to obtain FDA approval for Zepatier  as a treatment for 
genotype 1 or 4 HCV. As of July 1, 2015, a diverse population of over 1000 HCV  patients has been exposed to 
Zepatier either as a sing le agent or  in combination with ribavirin or sofosbuvir in phase I/II/III studies . Zepatier  
has been generally well tolerated at doses of 50 -100 mg GZR and 50 mg EBR orally once daily . It has been 
comparably effective across all subgroups it has been teste d in, including non -cirrhotic and/or treatment- naïve 
subjects. 
Headaches, fatigue, and nausea represent the most common adverse drug reactions with Zepatier . Other drug-
related adverse events have included arthralgia, insomnia, diarrhea, dizziness, pyrexia, and asthenia. Drug -
related serious adverse events are uncommon, but include allergic reactions, possible adverse interactions with 
other medications, or e levated liver enzymes. In past Zepatier  trials, the majority of the adverse events were 
reversible. These adverse events are usually grade 1 or 2 mild or moderate events.  
The dosage in our study (100/50 mg qd) is a commonly attainable dose in clinical practice. Zepatier  has shown to 
be safe for subjects with chronic kidney disease or who are on hemodialysis. Less than 1% of Zepatier  is excreted 
renally. In [COMPANY_006]  C-SURFER , a phase [ADDRESS_1183686] demonstrated a 94 -100% success rate achieving HCV  RNA  levels of <15 IU /ml after 12 weeks 
of treatment (SVR -12) among genotype [ADDRESS_1183687] -line therapy, rather than other approved 
agents (i.e., Sofo sbuvir/Ledipasvir, trade name [CONTACT_267898]), as Zepatier has been shown to be safe and efficacious 
in patient with significant renal dysfunction. As a result, if a subject’s kidney function has not fully recovered when treatment is initiated, the investigationa l agents can safely be administered, unlike other approved agents.

17 7.?. Mavyret for kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302414] 2, 3, 5, or 6  infection  
For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302415] a kidney  from a donor with genotype 2, 3, 5, or 6, we will consider a treatment 
regimen of 12 weeks of Mavyret ( glecaprevir 100 mg and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 40 mg).  This would be administered as 3 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_851290] 8 weeks.   
Glecaprevir (G) is a NS3/4A protease  inhibitor, while pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (P) is a NS5A inhibitor. Both  are direct acting 
antivirals that have a high barrier to resistance in vitro and in combination have synergistic antiviral activity.   G/P 
has been evaluated globally in multiple phase I, II, and III trials and has been approved by [CONTACT_851318].   It has been studied as a single agent and in combination with ribavirin.  It has been effective 
across all sub -types, including treatment experienced and patients with cirrhosis.  
 
The dosage in our study (3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930] 100/40 mg qd) is a commonly attainable dose in clinical practice. Mavyret has 
shown to be safe for subjects with chronic kidney disease or who are on hemodialysis without any need to dose adjust. Mavyret  is primarily cleared by [CONTACT_851319] a negligible amount is cleared by [CONTACT_8212].  In 
EXPEDITION -4, a phase [ADDRESS_1183688] excellent 
efficacy with SVR rates of > 98% .  
 The most common side effects documented with Mavyret were headaches, fatigue, and less commonly nausea.  Drug- related serious adverse events are uncommon, but include allergic reactions, possible adverse interactions 
with other medications, or elevated liver enzymes. In past Mavyret  trials, the majority of the adverse events 
were reversible. These adverse events are usually grade [ADDRESS_1183689] demonstrated a 95 -100% success rate achieving HCV RNA levels of <15 IU/ml after 12 weeks 
of treatment (SVR -12) among patients with HCV genotypes 1 -6. It was approved for the treatment of hepatitis C 
genotypes 1 -6 by [CONTACT_34033] 2017.  
  A specia l consideration for Mavyret is that the drug’s absorption may be impaired if crushed. For that reason, 
we will avoid administering the medication through a feeding tube. A second consideration is contraindicated medications including simvastatin and atorvastatin. These medications will not be co -administered with 
Mavyret.   
7.?. Epclusa for kidney  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302414] 2, 3, 5 or 6  infection  
For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302415] a kidney  from a donor with genotype 2, 3, 5, or 6, we  also will will consider  a 
treatment regimen of 12 weeks of Epclusa ( sofosbuvir  400 mg /velpatasvir  100 mg ). This treatment regimen, 
similar to Zepatier, has demonstrated SVR -12 (cure) rates of genotype 1 and 4 HCV that exceeds 95%. However, 
Epclusa has also been shown to have cur e rates of 95 -100% in patients with genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6, and is thus 
considered a pan -genotypic HCV regimen.  
 Sofosbuvir is an NS5B polymerase inhibitor and velpastasvir is a NS5A inhibitor.  Both are direct acting antivirals that have a high barrier to resistance in vitro and in combination have synergistic antiviral activity.  G/P has been evaluated globally  in multiple phase I, II, and III trials and has been approved by [CONTACT_851320] 6 HCV genotypes.    It has been studied as a single agent  and in combination with ribavirin.  It has been effective across 
all sub -types, including treatment experienced and patients with cirrhosis.  
 Epclusa has been shown to be safe to be administered in patients with renal dysfunction.
21,22  
For individuals with renal impairment (GFR <30), we know that velpatasvir pharmacokinetics are not impacted.  However, for inidivudals with a GFR <30 sofosbuvir can  potentially  accumulate and historically individuals with 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
18 CKD were excluded from trials.  Sof osbuvir has been used off label in real -world case series without any safety 
concerns identified.  A phase II single arm study of sofosbuvir /velpatasvir with 50 patients on hemodialysis 
showed that the drug was safe and well tolerated with SVR rates >95%. 
   
Epclusa  trials have demonstrated a 9 5-100% success rate achieving HCV RNA levels of <15 IU/ml after 12 weeks 
of treatment (SVR -12) among patients with HCV genotypes 1 -6.  Epclusa was approved by [CONTACT_851321] C genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in 2016.   
7.1.1.  Administration of Zepatier  
[COMPANY_006] & Co  will manufacture , package, and label Zepatier  drug that will be provided to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851291] [ADDRESS_1183690] will receive a minimum of six  bottles with each bottle containing a 14-
day supply ( 14 capsules ) of 100/50 mg Zepatier tablets . Daily dose will be one tablet.   
The Inves tigational Drug Services  (IDS)  pharmacy, directed by [CONTACT_267880] , PharmD , will only be required 
to store and distribute  the study drug. Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin will be purchased and sourced locally.  Both of 
these medications will be purchased and stored by  [CONTACT_267881]. Ribavirin will be generic and the 
manufacturer will vary depending on monthly price fluctuations.   
Zepatier will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_267831] ( IDS) pharmacy by [CONTACT_52903] 28 -day 
intervals. The study staff will deliver the medication to the subjects  at their study visits (patients expected to be 
at home by [CONTACT_267882] -
transplant/study visit) . Treatment with the study drug will begin  within  [ADDRESS_1183691] has received  Zepatier , he or she will be treated with a second regimen that includes 
Zepatier plus Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir) and Ribavirin . Any patient (male or female) receiving ribavirin as part of the 
first- or second -line regimen will be required to use two methods of birth control while on Ribavirin therapy, 
with continuing two forms of birth control for up to [ADDRESS_1183692]  at the research pharmacy. A replacement bottle with the appropriate amount  of 
study medication will be made available at the research pharmacy.  
7.1.3.  Destruction and return  
At the conclusion of the study, remaining medication from the study patients (and left -over medication) will be 
destroyed at the clinical site, after approval is gran ted by [CONTACT_851322]. 
Destruction will be documented in the drug accountability form.  
7.1.4.  Zepatier  Initial Treatment Failures  
Study subjects with treatment failure, defined as virologic breakthrough (when an undetectable viral load while on treatment becomes detectable or a ≥ one log increase from nadir HCV RNA) or virologic relapse 
(undetectable viral load after completion of treatment that during the [ADDRESS_1183693]- treatment follow -up period 
becomes detectable) will be provided open -label Zepatier  + Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) 400 mg + Ribavirin  (generic), 
renally dosed based on creatinine clearance per the manufacturer guidelines . Any subjects who experience 
treatment failure will repeat  the original study lab visit and visit protocol  once they begin their secondary 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
[ADDRESS_1183694] serum NS5A resistance (RAV) 
testing.  
7.2. Administraton of Mavyret or Epclusa for kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_302405] 2, 3, 5, or 6 HCV infections   
Upon receiving the results of gen otype testing of the donor and/or kidney  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851292] 1 nor genotype 4 (genotypes 2, 3, 5 or 6), PIs will coordinate treatment with  Mavyret or 
Epclusa that will be locally sourced by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_4601]. In the unlikely event that the patient has a 
contraindication to Mavyret or Epclusa, another optimal antiviral regimen will be selected.  
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] (HUP) will provide the antiviral treatment and coordinate the application to the subject’s insurance company for coverage of the antiviral treatment. In the event that the subject’s insurance company denies coverage for the antiviral treatment, HUP will provide the  entire HCV 
treatment regimen at no charge to the subject. In the event that the subject fails to be cured of HCV with the initial treatment regimen and the subject’s insurance declines to pay for a second antiviral treatment, HUP will provide the second H CV treatment regimen at no charge to the subject.

20 8 CHAPTER 5: DATA COLLECTION  
8.1. Study visits  
Study visits are scheduled to occur following subjects’ standard post -transplant follow -up visits. Since treating 
nephrologists do not always require stable post -transplant patients to attend these visits, subjects may be asked 
to come in solely for study visits. These visits will be encouraged, but not required unless the study drug is being 
dispensed that day. For all other study visits, a missed visit by a stable s ubject who has had necessary labs drawn 
will not be considered a protocol violation.  
8.1.1.  Informed consent  
During the screening phase, p otentially eligible , interested  subjects will be invited to attend an informational 
session /presentation either in -person or  by [CONTACT_152577] , consistent with University guidelines . The 
following procedures will be performed during the screening process:  
• Sign and date the ICF and HIPAA authorization – this signing can be done in -person or electronically  
(eSign)  using University approved procedures (e.g., REDCap)  
• Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Schedule for screening visit  
 After completing the informational session and signing the informed consent, the subject will be scheduled for a screening visit within [ADDRESS_1183695] meets inclusion/exclusion criteria thus far. The study staff will call 
the subject [ADDRESS_1183696] to not eat or drink 
(except water) and to avoid heavy exercise for [ADDRESS_1183697] that requires 3 hours of NPO prior to testing . According to the recommendations of use and 
based on safety and efficacy matters; patients with ascites (fluid in the abdomen), persons with active implantable medical devices, and persons with a waist size more than 100cm will be excluded from having a 
Fibroscan performed.  
8.1.2.  Screening  
The following procedures  and activities  will be performed during the screening process , after the informed 
consent is signed : 
• Review medical history  
• Vital signs  
• Physical exam  
• Fibroscan  
• Review current medications  
• Labs/phlebotomy: hepatic function panel, HCV  RNA , HBV DNA , and HIV  antibody  if these labs have not 
been checked within the last 365 days , as per the transplant center protocol for yearly testing of these 
labs (to ensure patients are up to date with the all center requirements for lab testing)  
• Updated transthoracic echocardiogram if one is needed for a patient to remain updated as per the transplant center protocol  
• Completio n of health status questionnaire (RAND -36) 
• Provide instructions on recording of new m edications and dose changes

[ADDRESS_1183698] -Kidney Trans plant  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post -Kidney Transplant Visits  
Patients , after receiving a kidney transplant are followed very closely by [CONTACT_851323] d nephrology team.   
 
As apart of standard of care visits, the following procedures activities  will be performed:  
• Phlebotomy  
• Vital signs  
• Physical exam  
 The study staff will follow procedures and activities closely along with transplant team and this information (vital signs, physical exam, and phlebotomy results) will be collected as apart of data collection.  In addition to these 
standard of care procedures and activities , the study team will also perform  specific research related activities  at 
specific time points .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post -Kidney Transplant Research Phlebotomy  
Research laboratory blood draws will take place along with standard of care blood draws outlined in Section 8.2.1. The study staff will call the research subject to coordinate research blood draws appropriately. In additio n, 
study staff will assess for adverse events/side effects  and obtain current medication data.  
 As outlined in Section 8.2.1, patients with a positive HBV Core Antibody, HBV -DNA levels will be checked every 6 
weeks while on Zepatier and LFTs will be close ly monitored . HBV therapy may  be considered the transplant 
team as medically appropriate.  
 
Additional laboratory testing will be done if the PIs feel it is necessary for patient safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visit 1: P ost-kidney transplant  (between days 2 – 7) 
The study staff will meet the subject in their HUP  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] , three days after their kidney transplant.  
 
Initiating antiviral treatment  
Treatment with the study drug will begin when the patient has a detectable HC V RNA post -transplantation  and 
the donor and/or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851293] . As appropriate,  subjects 
being discharged will be provided with a sufficient  supply of the study drug and instructed to begin treatment 
once HCV RNA is confirmed, which may occur any time between weeks [ADDRESS_1183699]’s primary nephrologist and primary care physician.  During the initial 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the HUP pharmacy staff will commence the process of assessing the patient ’s insurance and 
first-line DAA regimen in the event of an HCV genotype that is not appropriate for Zepatier treatment.  
 As with any scientific protocol, safety will be considered before treating the patients. The treating physician will evaluate the patient’s overall condition and make a judgment on whether initiating treatment is safe . 
 The following research procedures and activities will be performed:  
• Assess for Adverse Events  
• Obtain medication data  
• Research Phlebotomy , including the NS5A drug resistance assay testing as appropriate (See Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_1183700])

Blood samples for immunologic t-cell assays will be processed and banked or shipped .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Management of patients with  genotype [ADDRESS_1183701] polymorphisms at positions M28, Q30, 
L31, and/or Y93, treatment with Zepatier will be extended to 16 weeks, rather than 12 weeks, and renally -
adjusted Ribavirin at the clinician’s discretion will be initiated, and continued for the remainder of therapy 
(until the 16 week mark). Such a strategy will provide optimal treatment, witho ut delaying therapy prior to 
receipt of results of NS5A drug resistant testing . Under such a scenario, all of the study procedures 
referenced above and below will be extended by 4 weeks. Any patient (male or female) receiving ribavirin as 
part of the first - or second -line regimen will be required to use two methods of birth control while on 
Ribavirin therapy, with continuing two forms of birth control for up to [ADDRESS_1183702] dose of the study drug.

HCV Non -Transmission  
It is possible that a subject may not develop chronic HCV infection, either due to non -transmission or 
spontaneous clearance of HCV by [CONTACT_5875] 4 (defined as an initial positive HCV RNA and subsequent undetectable HCV RNA without  treatment) . If a subject has an undetectable HCV RNA based on the week 4 HCV RNA, a repeat 
HCV RNA will be checked at week 8 to ensure non -infection with HCV, rather than a false -negative HCV RNA . If 
the week 8 HCV RNA confirms lack of infection (undetect able week 8 HCV RNA), then no further treatment will 
be needed . Subjects will be assessed at a study visit and HCV RNA levels re -checked at week [ADDRESS_1183710] them in order to meet our planned treatment sample size of 10.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visits 5  & 6 (day 42± 7, day 56± 7) 
Visit #5 should occur 6  weeks ( 42±7  days) after the subject’s kidney transplant and will immediately follow the 
subject’s regularly scheduled post -transplant follow -up visit . Visit #6 should occur 8  weeks ( 56±7 days) after the 
subject’s kidney transplant and will immediately follow the subject’s regularly scheduled post -transplant follow -
up visit .  
 For both visits, t he staff will call the subject [ADDRESS_1183711]  and 
remind him/her  to not eat or drink for three hours before the study visit. 
 The following procedures and activities  will be performed:  
• Assess for Adverse Events  
• Obtain medication data

8.1.5.  Long -term outcomes and Future research  
We will collect long -term outcome data beyond the end of the [ADDRESS_1183727] in order to identify and track problems with 
organ function or other health problems that may develop, related to the transplant  and study participation . 
This data will be stored safely  like all other data, with all necessary precautions.  
 Subjects will also be approached to provide optional blood sample for testing of viral kinetics (HCV RNA), donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267836] -28B polymorphisms , and alloimmune responses (T - and B -cell function) . Samples w ill be stored 
in a locked freezer, using encrypted patient IDs.   
 
De-identified samples from subjects may be sent to other investigators for their research. These samples may 
include information such as sex, age, health history, or ethnicity. These samples  will not be sold. Some future 
studies may need health information (such as smoking history or present health status) that may require 
contact[CONTACT_267885].

number.  
 An adequate record of receipt, distribution, and return of all study drugs must be kept.  Subject adherence  with 
the treatment and protocol includes willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, and to have blood collected for all safety evaluations.   
 The research staff and physician will explain the importance of adherence  with the study protocol a t each 
subject contact. If a subject fails to comply with a study visit, the staff  will contact [CONTACT_267887].  
 
We have considered how to minimize non -adherence  with therapy. We will strongly emphasize the importance 
of complying with the study d rug treatment. Nonetheless, we will perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_302423]. If a subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) (whether 
related to study drugs or not), we will continue to follow -up with the  subject for study assessments to assist with 
safety monitoring and to avoid the problems introduced by [CONTACT_11368]. The inclusion of such follow -up data 
will allow for analysis by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat.  If a study subject withdraws consent, he/she will no longer be

31 9 CHAPTER 6: ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND OUTCOME MEASURES  
9.1. Assessments of Efficacy  
The primary aims of the study are to determine sustained virologic response rates (SVR) of open -label Zepatier, 
Mavyret, Epclusa or another appropriate antiviral treatment  administered to HCV -negative patients with end -
stage renal disease who receive a kidney transplant from an HCV- infected  donor, leading to post -transplant de -
novo HCV infection.   
9.1.1.  Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)  
SVR will be based on the standard definition of SVR -12, defined as an undetectable HCV  RNA in a subject’s 
serum 12 weeks after completing treatment for HCV  ([ADDRESS_1183732] dose of Zepatier, 
Mavyret, Epclusa or another appropriate  antiviral treatment ). 
9.2. Secondary Outcome Measures  
• To determine safety of administering Zepatier , Mavyret, Epclusa or another appropriate antiviral 
treatment  to kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267839] -negative, but developed de-
novo HCV after receiving a kidney transplant from an HCV- infected  donor  
• To determine 1 -year graft survival rates of HCV -negative kidney transplant patients who receive 
a kidney transplant from a n HCV- infected  donor, including those who spontaneously clear HCV  
and those who receive open -label Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa or another appropriate antiviral 
treatment  upon development of de -novo HCV. 
• To evaluate rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV  among HCV- negative patients who receive a 
kidney transplant from a n HCV-infected  donor.  
9.2.1.  Safety  
Subject safety and adverse events will be based in CTCAE Version 4 criteria, listed in Section 13, and will include 
adverse events and serious adverse events, related both to receipt of a kidney transplant from an HCV -positive 
donor among HCV -negative subjects with end -stage renal disease, and adverse events related to administration 
of Zepatier , Mavyret, Epclusa or another appropriate antiviral treatment . 
9.2.2.  Graft Survival  
Graft survival will be based on standardize United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) criteria, with a graft failure defined as subject death, re -transplantation, or chronic dialysis within the first year post -transplantation.  
9.2.3.  Spontaneous Clearance or Non -Transmission of HCV  
Spontaneous clearance  or non -transmission  of HCV  will be based on an undetectable HCV  RNA level at post -
transplant weeks 1- [ADDRESS_1183733] who experiences spontaneous clearance of HCV or non -
transmission of HCV will still be tested for HCV RNA at week s 8, 16, and 28, to ensure that their levels are still 
undetectable .

2020 
32 10 CHAPTER 7: STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Study Design  
This open -label trial involves one primary and several secondary objectives . Post -transplant HCV status will be 
monitored, and patients will be treated with 8 to 12 weeks of therapy  with Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa or 
another appropriate antiviral treatment , after which time, treatment will be complete, barring instances of 
treatment failure, which would require an additional course  of therapy .*   
10.2. Disposition of Subjects and Baseline Comparisons  
Summaries of all subjects screened, recruited, and enrolled will be provided, according to the CONSORT 
guidelines. The treatment groups will be evaluated at baseline with respect to demographics and baseline measurements related to efficacy and safety without formal statistical testing.  
10.3. Analyses of Outcome Measures  
The primary analysis will evaluate SVR -12 rates of HCV -negative kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317328] a 
kidney from an HCV -infected donor and subsequently develop de -novo HCV . All patients will be assessed for 
toxicity and included in the safety analysis. This analysis will include summaries of the incidence and grade of toxicities. Patients will be evaluated for serious adverse events. Safety interim analyses will be performed and reported at each DSMB meeting.  
10.4. Missing Data and Dropouts  
We will attempt to minimize missing data;  however we have planned for its occurrence. For subjects lost to 
follow -up, we will use all of the information available until the end of follow -up. Subjects who withdraw consent 
will no longer be followed in this protocol . Patients will receive care from the patients’ clinicians . 
 For patients lost to follow -up, we will use all the information available up to the time of loss to follow -up. For 
the primary end point, we will perform an analysis of completers only. We will als o perform additional sensitivity 
analyses using imputation to assess the impact of missing data for the primary and secondary end points.  
10.5. Protocol Violations  
Serious protocol deviations  such as discontinuation of experimental treatment unrelated to adverse events (AEs) 
will be carefully recorded and regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_3252] -Principal Investigator s. Remedial changes in procedure 
will be recommended where feasible to reduce the incidence of such  deviations . The causes and circumstances 
of all violations will be documented where known for purposes of future secondary analyses and interpretation. Because all primary analyses will be intent -to-treat, it is essential that violations be kept to a minimum, 
especially where it is possible to influence their rate of o ccurrence.  A missed study visit will not be considered a 
protocol violation unless the study drug was scheduled to be dispensed at the visit, the subject did not have 
necessary labs done, or the subject has not been stable.  
10.6. Safety Analysis  
All patients will be assessed for toxicity and included in the safety analysis. This analysis will include summaries 
of the incidence and grade of toxicities. Safety interim analyses will be performed  at days 14, 30, 60, 90, 118, 
and 184,  and will be  reported at each DSMB meeting . SAEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4318] .

33 11 CHAPTER 8: QUALITY CONTROL AND DATA HANDLING  
 
11.1. Personnel Training  
Prior to enrolling the first subject in the study protocol, the PIs will ensure that the Investigator staff has 
completed appropriate training and that all documentation including IRB approval is completed and available. The purpose of training is to ensure that study personnel are carrying out the protocol in a consistent way and adhering to good clinical practice guidelines. Staff will have current Human Subjects Training Certification on file. 
Before enrollment begins, study staff  who will perform the outcome assessments will be trained in all 
procedures, including completion of the REDCap database.  
 The co-PIs and research staff will constitute the first line of monitoring of the safety of the human participants. 
Surveillance for AEs will consist of questioning subjects about potential AEs at every study contact, having subjects report any AE to the stud y team, and having subjects undergo vital sign checks and physical exams 
during each study visit. Laboratories will be performed at selected visits and checked.  
 All study personnel are required to read the consent form, the protocol , and the  IB. 
11.2. Data Qual ity  
The co-PIs and research staff  will perform continuous monitoring of data quality and completion of CRFs . 
Summary statistics from the screening logs will be sent to [COMPANY_006] quarterly or as requested. Finally, [COMPANY_006] staff reviews the reporting, documentation and follow -up of SAEs to assure that these events were handled according 
to required study procedures . All data on AEs and SAEs will be made available to the DSMB, as per the timeline 
outlined in the DSM B Charter. 
11.3. Audit and Inspection  
Inspect ions may be carried out by [CONTACT_209567] [i.e., FDA] as well as the  IRB. 
11.4. Archiving  
Essential documents shall be archived safely and securely in such a way that ensures that they are readily available upon authorities’ request.  Patient (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) files will be archived according to local regulations and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice.

Informed Consent will be obtained for enrollment from participants. For each consent process , whether in -
person or by [CONTACT_152577] , study personnel will discuss the details of the study, the risks and benefits, and 
the subject’s rights and responsibilities if they choose to participate in the trial and their right to refuse to participate . It will be made clear that their clinical care will not be affected by [CONTACT_220862].  
 Each subject will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.  
 Only after the subject consents  voluntarily and agrees to sign , in-person or electronically  (eSign),  the ICF and has 
done so, may he/she enter the study . Additionally, the investigator and other information provider (if any) will 
sign and date or digitally affirm the form . The subject will receive a paper  or digital copy o f the signed and dated 
form , as appropriate . All eConsents  will adhere to current Office of Clinical Research  approved procedures  and 
regulations.  
 The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file.   If the patient is not ca pable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can also be given in the 
presence of an impartial witness (independent of the investigator) . This is to be documented by a signature [CONTACT_851326] a signature [CONTACT_23686].  
 The ICF and any other written information provided to subjects / legal representatives or proxy consenters will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and / or the ICF. The investigator will inform the subject / legal representative or proxy consenter of 
changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confir m his/her participation in the study by [CONTACT_2960], in -
person or electronically (eSign),  the revised ICF . Any revised ICF and written information must receive the 
IEC/IRB’s approval in advance of use.  
12.2. Institutional Review Board Process  
Study staff will obtain IRB approval before any study procedures are initiated.  
 12.3. Insurance  
The kidney transplant itself will be paid for by [CONTACT_1766]’  insurance carriers, and does not require any additional 
pre-authorization because of the potential to receive a kidney from a hepatitis C -positive donor . The costs of all 
visits and tests described above will be billed to the insurance carrier, except for : 1) the blood draw for research 
purposes (which includes the hepatitis C genotype test , which is based on a laboratory -developed  test using 
materials purchased from the commercial entity that developed this test, and will be paid for by [CONTACT_5051]), 2) the study dru g Zepatier in the event of infections with genotype 1 or genotype 4 HCV, which will be 
provided by [CONTACT_44873], and 3 ) other antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851298] 1 nor 
genotype 4; these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_302426]’s insurance provides coverage for the drug. In the event that the subject’s insurance d enies coverage for the treatment, HUP will 
provide the full course of appropriate HCV therapy as well as a second treatment course of antiviral therapy for HCV if the first treatment fails.   
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
35 Subjects  are still responsible for any deductibles or applicable co -pays for routine office visits, blood work and 
scans (except for the liver Fibroscans listed above). We do  not expect subjects  to have health insurance 
coverage/payment issues due to becoming infected with hepatitis C, per se, and the study is designed so 
subjects  do not require additional study visits post -transplant, provided there are no adverse events.  
 12.4. Laboratory Values  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be measured and repeated at time points specified in schedule of procedures (section 8.2.1) and as clinically indicated.  
12.4.1.  Chemistry  
• Hepatic function panel including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, and albumin.   
• Basic metabolic panel including BUN and creatinin e. 
12.4.2.  Serum virologic testing  
• HCV RNA  (with Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267840])  
• Hepatitis B surface antigen  
• HIV antibody  testing .  
• HBV Core Antibody (as needed)  
12.4.3.  Pregnancy Testing  
Blood and urine pregnancy tests will be performed (as appropriate) per the schedule of procedures (section 5.2).  
12.4.4.  Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics  
Each time standard of care laboratories are drawn, subjects may have one additional purple -top tube drawn  
(4cc of blood) . This blood test is considered optional.  The research coordinator will process the tube and store it 
in a - 80◦ freezer in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine [ADDRESS_1183734] for HCV antibodies, HCV core 
antigen, and HCV  RNA. These additional tests will be included in the informed consent process for all subjects. 
Abbott will perform these tests free of charge to University of Pennsylvania once both are able to reach a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA).  
12.5. Zepatier Related L aboratory Abnormalities and Drug Interactions  
Laboratory Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities were observed in studies done with Zepatier : 
 Late elevations in aminotransferase levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal generally occurred in around 1 -
3% of patients in previous Zepatier clinical trials; these increases were rarely associated with hyperbilirubinemia. These 
abnormalitie s were reversible and had no major clinical consequences.  
 Effects of Zepatier  on antiretrovirals:  
• Atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100mg co -administered with MK -5172 200mg daily somewhat increased atazanavir 
exposure (AUC increased 43%, Cmax increased 12%, C24 increased 23%). Co -administration of these 
medications is not recommended.  
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
36 • Darunivir/ritonavir 600/100 mg co -administered with MK -5172 200 mg was not significantly altered by [CONTACT_267888]-5172 or MK -8742. However, due to DRV/r effects on Zepatier  exposure, co -administration is not 
recommended.  
• Efavirenz was not significantly impacted when co -administered with Zepatier , though it may negatively impact 
Zepatier exposure.  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir exposures were not significantly impacted when co -administered with Zep atier. However, 
due to LPV/r effects on Zepatier  exposure, co -administration is not recommended.  
 
Effect of Antiretrovirals on Zepatier : 
• Atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100mg co -administered with MK -5172 200mg significantly increased exposure 
of MK -5172 (AUC inc reased 10.58- fold, Cmax increased 6.24 -fold, and C24 increased 11.6 -fold). These 
findings were similar when ATV/r was combined with 50mg MK -8742. MK -8742 AUC geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) was 4.76, probably due to ATV/r CYP3A4/Pgp inhibition and possible inhibition of OATP -
mediated disposition of MK -8742. Co -administration of these medications is not recommended.  
• Exposures of MK -5172 were significantly increased when MK -5172 200 mg was co -administered with 
darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg daily. MK -5172 AUC inc reased 7.5 -fold, Cmax increased 5.27 -fold, and 
C24 increased 8 -fold. MK -8742 exposures were also significantly increased when combined with DRV/r 
600/100 mg daily. MK -8742 AUC GMR following co -administration was 1.66. This increase is likely 
caused by [CONTACT_097]3 A4/Pgp inhibition by [CONTACT_267889]/r and possibly inhibition of OATP -mediated disposition of MK -
8742. For these reasons, co -administration of Zepatier  and DVR/r is not recommended.  
• Efavirenz 600mg co -administration with MK -5172 200 mg decreased MK -5172 AUC by 84%, most likely 
due to CYP3A4 induction. The same dose EFV combined with MK -5172 50 mg also decreased MK -8742 
AUC 54% for the same reasons. Co -administration of these medications may cause sub -therapeutic MK-
5172 exposure.  
• Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 400/100 mg co -adm inistered with MK -5172 200 mg significantly increased MK -5172 
exposure. MK- 5172 AUC increased 12.86- fold, Cmax increase 7.31 -fold, and C24 increased 21.7 -fold. 
When the same dose of LPV/r was administered with MK-8742 50 mg, MK -8742 AUC GMR was 
increased to 3.71. LPV/r likely impacts MK -8742 exposures due to CYP3A4/Pgp inhibition and possible 
inhibition of OATP -mediated disposition. Co -administration of these medications is not recommended.  
 Effect of Zepatier  on Other Drugs:  
• Rosuvastatin [ADDRESS_1183735] ered with Zepatier  200/50 mg increased rosuva statin exposure. 
Rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax were increased 59% and 325% respectively when exposed to MK- 5172 
alone and 126% and 449% when exposed to the combined Zepatier  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. The most likely cause of the 
increase is pre -systemic inhibition of rosuvastatin efflux in the liver and/or gut due to BCRP inhibition. 
Clinicians may want to avoid co -administration of Zepatier and rosuvastatin.  
• Midazolam 2 mg/mL combined with mul ti-dose MK -5172 200 mg daily decreased midazolam AUC to 
34%. MK -5172 is likely a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
• Multiple oral doses of rifampin did not significantly affect MK -5172 AUC, but reduced C24h by 85%. This 
decrease was presumably due to the combined eff ect of OATP inhibition and CYP3A4/Pgp induction by 
[CONTACT_267890]. Clinicians should avoid co -administration of these medications until 
further data becomes available.  
 Effect of Other Drugs on Zepatier : 
• Rosuvastatin 10 mg co -administered with Zepatier  200/50 mg did not significantly alter MK -5172/8742 
exposure. However, due to Zepatier  effects on rosuvastatin exposure, clinicians may wish to avoid co -
administration.  
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
37 • Ketoconazole  (CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor ) approximately tripled MK -5172 AUC. In healthy male subjects 
taking 400 mg multi-dose ketoconazole, MK- 8742 AUC increased by 31%.   
• Combining MK -[ADDRESS_1183736] dose of Mavyret and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 2 weeks following 
discontinuation of study drugs.  
Table: Prohibited Medications and Supplements  
Medication  or Supplement  Name  
• Red yeast  rice (monacolin  K), St. John's  Wort  
• Ethinyl estradiol  
• Atorvastatin,  lovastatin,  simvastatin  
• Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  phenytoin,  pentobarbital,  phenobarbital, primidone,  rifabutin,  
rifampin  
• Astemizole,  cisapride,  terfenadine  
  
 Use of high dose (0.035mg) ethinyl  estradiol containing oral contraceptives  with  Mavyret
 combination  was 
associated  with  asymptomatic ALT increases  (one Grade 3, and one Grade 2) without concurrent bilirubin increases in  2 
healthy  female  subjects. Therefore hormonal contraceptives  (including oral,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [including vaginal rings],  
injectable  or implantable  varieties)  containing any ethinyl  estradiol may  not be used  from  [ADDRESS_1183737] -menopausal  hormone  replacement  therapy,  such  as with  esterified  or conjugated  estrogens,  i.e., 
not containing ethinyl  estradiol,  may  be used  with  Mavyret  at the discretion  of the Investigator.  
Mavyret  may be initiated in subjects receiving cyclosporine ≤100 mg per day.  Concomitant administration of 
Mavyret  with cyclosporine doses of greater than 100mg per day is not  recommended.  
 
12.7. Epclusa Related Laboratory Abnormalities and Drug Interactions  
Effects of  Epclusa on Other Drugs:  
• Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporters P -gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. Coadministration of Epclusa with drugs that are substrates of these 
transporters may increase the exposu re of such drugs.  
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
38 • Fluctuations in INR values may occur in patients receiving warfarin concomitant with HCV treatment, 
including treatment with Epclusa. Frequent monitoring of INR values is recommended during treatment 
and post -treatment follow -up. 
Effects  of Other Drugs on Epclusa:  
• Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P -gp and BCRP while GS -331007 (the 
predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir) is not. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir 
by [CONTACT_097]2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 was observed.  
• Drugs that are inducers of P -gp and/or moderate to potent inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g., 
rifampin, St. John’s wort, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir, leading to reduced t herapeutic effect of Epclusa. The use of these agents with Epclusa is not 
recommended. Epclusa may be coadministered with P -gp, BCRP, and CYP inhibitors.  
Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions:  
• See Table on next page.

40 12.8. Other Events  
We will not discontinue study drug for clinical events not thought to be serious drug- related AEs. For example, a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267843]. Such events could 
result in missing data for primary and secondary endpoints, comprising the integrity of the analysis. This trial 
does prohibit certain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], thus there may be a reason to stop study drug participation under such 
circumstances. Even if subjects are withdrawn from the study drug, ou tcome assessments will continue, allowing 
analysis by [CONTACT_104992] -to-treat.  
12.9. Safety and Adverse Events  
12.9.1.  Definitions  
 Adverse event (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the protocol procedures, whether or 
not considered product or process related . Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study . Inter -current illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs . Abnormal 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnorma lity: 
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious AE  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_371511] (SAE):  Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious . A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the o ther 
serious outcomes noted above . For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186994].  
 All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious AEs . 
 Suspected adverse reaction:  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug/investigational product caused the adverse event. For reporting purposes, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug/investigational product and the adverse event.  
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
41 other unanticipated seriou s problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
12.9.2.  Classifying Adverse Events  
Severity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.23  Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the 
AE:  
CTCAEv4 Grade 1 : mild ; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention is not indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 2 : moderate ; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; limiting to age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, m anaging money, etc. ). 
CTCAEv4 Grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267845]; disabling; limiting to self -care  ADL ( self-care  ADL refers to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4 : life-threatening  consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 5 : death due to an AE.  
 
Expectedness  
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
 Expected:   an AE /ADE  known to be associated with the intervention or condition under s tudy.  
 Unexpected:   an AE /ADE  for which the nature or severity is not consistent with information about the condition 
under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
 OHRP defines an unexpected AE as any AE occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB- approved informed consent document, and b) 
other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
 
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 
Relatedness  
1) Definite: the AE /ADE  is clearly related to the research procedures  
2) Probably: the AE/ADE is likely related to the research procedures  
3) Possible: the AE/ADE may be related to the research procedures  
4) Unlikely: the AE/ADE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
5) Unrelated: the AE/ADE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
 For each identified AE/ADE , an entry on the AE/ADE form will be completed. Reporting procedures should be 
started immediately upon learning of a SAE /ADE . 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
[ADDRESS_1183738] be reported is normally defined as the time of consent to the end of the 
study treatment follow- up. H owever, for this study,  the AE reporting period  will be divided based on the three 
phases of the study.  
 
a. Screening phase: When all screening tests have been done, we will assess for any AEs related to the screening tests at the time of communication with the subject about whether he/she is official eli gible or 
ineligible for the study .  
Preexisting Condition:  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study . A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
b. Waitlist phase :   We will only capture AEs that are pertinent to the study. Specifically the following will be 
captured:  
1. Patient death ,  
2. Patient develops a condition that would exclude them from the study,  
3. Patient is de -listed (taken off the kidney transplant waitlist),  
4. Patient is made inactive on the transplant waitlist,  
5. Patient is transplanted with a non -HCV kidney.   
In order to ascertain these events, we will review the patient’s medical record once a month , and will 
contact [CONTACT_102] (by [CONTACT_648], e -mail, or in -person) every [ADDRESS_1183739] -transplant phase : All AEs will be assessed at every clinic visit when the subject  is seen by a member of 
the study team.   
 
d. Post -study: At the last scheduled visit, t he investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent 
event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
All unresolved AEs considered possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow- up, or the AE is otherwise 
explained . The investigator  will notify the IRB of any death or AE occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study . The IRB will 
also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 General Physical Examination Findings  (screening, post -transplant, and post -study phases)  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition . At the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.  
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  (post -transplant, and post -study phases)  
A clinical laboratory abnor mality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following  conditions is met:  
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
43 • The laboratory abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_24099] [INVESTIGATOR_267846] a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of 
the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706]  (post -transplant and post -study phase)  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66301] a serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol, with the e xception of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267847] a kidney offer and/or kidney transplant . Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as 
an AE if the condition meets the criteria for and AE.  
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition . Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the 
surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851300].  
12.9.4.  Reporting Procedures for Unanticipated Problems , Adverse Events , and Adverse Device Effects  
Principal investigators  should notify the local IRB, in an expedited manner, of those events related to study 
participation  that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
Researchers should submit reports of the following problems : 
Any AE /ADE  or UP (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -site or off-site) that  occurs any 
time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]:  
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the I RB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, 
and the current IRB -approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as 
product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND

46 • Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity 
or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than initially expected. 
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected. 
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_827].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 
Unanticipa ted Problem  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPRSO):  Any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all of the following criteria:  
1) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, informed 
consent document, or investigators brochure; and b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied;  
 
2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related to participation in the research means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459].); and  
 3) Suggests that the research places subjects or other s at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
12.10. Subject Withdrawal  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study entirely at any time for any reason without prejudice to 
future medical care by [CONTACT_267894]. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study in the event of concurrent illness, AEs, or other reasons deemed to be in the subject’s best interest.  
 Subjects must be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the following reasons:  
• Subject withdraws consent for study treatment and study procedures . A subject must be removed from 
the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable representative. At any 
time during the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further. The 
subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
• Subject becomes pregnant while undergoing treatment —therapy will be stopped as there are no 
human safety data of the study drugs  during pregnancy . There are no adequate and well -controlled 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
[ADDRESS_1183741] ugs in pregnant women. No effects on embryo -fetal development were 
observed in rats or rabbits at grazoprevir or elbasvir exposures higher than exposures in humans at the 
recommended clinical dose. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human 
response, DAAs  should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potent ial risk 
to the fetus . Because the transmission rates of HCV from mother to fetus are very small, and HCV can 
be treated after pregnancy and delivery, therapy will not be continued during pregnancy. Patients will continue with the regularly scheduled study  visits, but will not be eligible to receive continued therapy.  
• Subject develop s a condition that it is life threatening or any other significant risk as judged by [CONTACT_21422].  Patients will not receive study drug, but will continue with study visits as scheduled.  
• Zepatier, Mavyret, Epclusa, or other appropriate antiviral treatment is no longer produced by [CONTACT_105741], or if a decision is made to stop the study  patients will not  receive study drug, but will 
continue with study visits as scheduled.  
 Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable.  
 In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded  in the CRF and in the subject's medical records.  
 In order to preserve the integrity of the intention -to-treat analysis, even if the subject is withdrawn from the 
treatment portion of the protocol (either due to subject, physician, or investigator decisio n), it is imperative to 
continue with the scheduled follow -up assessments both for the safety of the subject and for completeness of 
data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of 
adherence  with study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial. If the treatment is permanently withdrawn, 
the subject will return to the center for safety assessment (history, physical examination, and clinic al 
laboratories, if necessary).  
12.11. Confidentiality of Study Data  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) . Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing th e subject of the following:  
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization . For subject s that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subject’s statement 
of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the 
appropriate individual.  
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
[ADDRESS_1183742]. 
There is a risk of bruising, hematoma, and infection after phlebotomy, which are possible but not considered 
serious AEs. Fainting may occur, which is unlikely but considered a serious AE. The removal of <[ADDRESS_1183743]- transplant period is a potential risk; however this amount is routinely 
taken from subjects for clinical indications without adverse effect. Stu dy medications will be delayed until after 
phlebotomy on each study day.  
 Because we may store subjects’ blood samples, there may be confidentiality risks associated with the storage and analysis of those  samples or the information resulting from the analysis of those  samples. Samples may be 
used for genetic testing. Under some circumstances, it can be a risk for genetic information to be known. To help 
ensure confidentiality, samples will be coded and stored in a secured facility. While situations cannot be 
foreseen where potentially sensitive genetic information is revealed or where people who should not have this information could obtain it (representing a loss of confidentiality), however, it is possible that presently unforeseen situations may arise where this could happen.  
 The risk of undergoing screening includes potential identification of new health problems that subjects were unaware of. If we discover new health problems, we will answer subjects’ questions and try to arrange 
appropriate treatment if any is needed. If new health problems are discovered, it is possible that subjects  would 
not be able to enter this stu dy. It is also possible that subjects  would no longer be eligible for kidney 
transp lantation based on the results.  
 The risks associated with an echocardiogram are often none or include mild skin irritation or rash at the site of electrode placement.  
 
The risks associated with a Fibroscan are that the probe used on the abdomen during the  Fibroscan may lead to 
mild soreness in the area for about a day.  
The risks of kidney transplant surgery include blood loss, infections, and deep vein thrombosis.  There are also 
risks related to immunosuppression and standard anti -infective therapy.  
 The risks of any transplant include primary graft non -function, delayed graft function, acute rejection, and 
death.  Re-admissions within 30 days after a kidney transplant are expected in approximately 40% of patients.  
 There may also be a small risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_302442] (FSGS) after receiving a kidney from HCV positive donor. However, this condition can also develop in patients who do not have HCV. 
After transplant, we will monitor all patients for FSGS and similar conditions.  
12.12.2.  Risk of Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267860] a risk of failure of the  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_267861] . In that case, the investigators will 
use their judgment to select the most appropriate empi[INVESTIGATOR_302445].  
There is also a risk of the  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_851304] . The risk to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267863], in 
this event, is that they receive the  transplant , but are possibly unable to be adequately treated for HCV 
positivity. Failure of the LDT to give an accurate genotype co uld be due to a mixed infection (e.g. genotype 1 and 
2) or HCV genotype 4f infection in the donor sample .   
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
[ADDRESS_1183744] does not report any one of the four pertinent polymorphisms, even 
though they are present (the presence of which  would be rare) . In this case, the patient would receive  only 12 
weeks of Zepatier (r ather than 16 weeks of Zepatier + renal- dosed Ribavirin), and potentially  fail first -line 
therapy , requiring second -line therapy.   
 A false positive result is less likely to happen than a false negative result. The risk of a false positive test result 
wou ld be if the test reports a polymorphism  when the subject does not have one. Hence, the subject would be 
exposed to Zepatier for 4 weeks longer than needed as well as Ribavirin , and potentially experiencing the 
products’ side effects .  
12.12.4.  Risk of Study Drugs  
Zepatier  
In subjects receiving Zepatier  for [ADDRESS_1183745] commonly reported adverse reactions of all intensity 
(greater than or equal to 5% in placebo -controlled trials) were fatigue, headache, and nausea. In subjects 
receiving Zepatier  with ribavirin  for [ADDRESS_1183746] commonly reported adverse reactions of moderate or 
severe intensity (greater than or equal to 5%) were anemia and headache.  
24-26The greatest risk is failure to 
achieve SVR12 after treatment with Zepatier , leading to chronic HCV . 
 There is a risk of fetal harm and birth defects should any woman taking Zepatier become pregnant while on the 
drug.
24-26 Due to the age of the participants, this is a small risk, as all will be over 30 and few are likely to become 
pregnant. However, to mitigate this risk, all pre -menopausal women with a uterus will be screened for 
pregnancy before enrollment and instructed to use a highly effective form of birth control (e.g. abstinence, 
intrauterine device, etc.). Highly effective forms of birth control will be defined by [CONTACT_267895] (REMS) , a standard protocol used for post -transplant patients at Penn being 
treated with Mycophenolate.   Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir)  
The most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 20%, all grades) observed with Sovaldi in combination with ribavirin were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events observed with Sovaldi 
in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.
[ADDRESS_1183747] been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Therefore, ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partn ers of women who are pregnant.
28  
 Mavyret  
In subjects receiving G/P for 8, 12, or [ADDRESS_1183748] commonly reported adverse reactions of all intensity % 
were headache, fatigue  and nausea .
[ADDRESS_1183749] common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) observed with treatment with Epclusa  for [ADDRESS_1183750] common adverse reactions (incidence 
Transplanting HCV Kidneys into HCV Negative Kidney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851275] V 6.0, October 
2020 
50 greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) observed with treatment with Epclusa  and ribavirin for 12 weeks in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis are fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, insomnia and diarrhea.  
 
12.12.5.  Risks of Developi[INVESTIGATOR_851305] H CV include severe acute inflammation of the liver that could lead to liver failure requiring a 
liver transplant. HCV may also cause a severe type of acute infection called fibrosing cholestatic HCV , that can 
cause severe liver injury, jaundice (yellowing o f the eyes and skin), and progressive liver dysfunction.  
 12.13. Risk of HCV Transmission  
There is a small risk of transmission of HCV from the study subject to intimate partners during sexual activity. 
This risk is very low and should be reduced even further due  to requirements for subjects to use barrier 
protection during sexual activity.  
12.14. Potential Benefits  
The results from the study could be applied in the future to subjects (including those in the study) who stand to benefit from the information. Subjects will experience clinical benefits as their kidney function and quality of life 
should vastly improve following transplant. The study involves the risks of phlebotomy, echocardiography, Fibroscan, development of chronic HCV, and loss of confidentiality, but the re is a potential for future benefit for 
both subjects in the study and for future subjects, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  
12.15. Alternatives  
The use of the medications for this study requires that certain other medications not be used. Therefore, the 
alternative is to not participate in this study and to continue having the option to take these medications . 
12.16. Ethical Considerations  
The main ethical considerations in this trial are non -maleficence, respect for persons, and autonomy. Our 
selection criteria are designed to select subjects who are at substantial risk of death and health complications because of end -stage renal disease and chronic dialysis treatment. Transplantation with a HCV -positive kidney 
and then treatment for HCV also involve risks, but it is plausible that survival and quality of life will still improve after transplantation compared to the alternative of multiple additional years on dialysis . Our informed consent 
procedures are designed to enable individuals to make decisions that are consistent with their values. We will enumerate the many possible risks and plausible benefits. The processes of informed consent in this study will be conducted so that patients can ask questions, confer with their primary nephrologists and develop a full understanding of the trial procedures and risks, all of which is consistent with respect for persons. Lastly, subjects in the trial will retain the ability to consider organ offers and decide whether to accept an organ based 
on their own judgment about the value of that particular organ and after getting advice from their transplant 
team.

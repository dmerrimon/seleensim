 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
  
3.1. Introduction  
 
Eyenovia, the Sponsor of this study, is a specialty pharmaceutical company pursuing development of a 
variety of ocular topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910] , including a pupil dilation medication with a fixed combination 
formulation of phenylephrine 2.5 % and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 %, for microdose delivery.  Eyenovia’s drug 
formulations are administered using a proprietary system called the Microdose Deliver y Dispenser 
(MiDD), which is designed to accurately deliver precise low -volume doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401030].   
 Phenylephrine is an α
1-adrenegic receptor sympathetic agonist that has been used for more than 70 years 
to dilate the pupil for diagno stic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures. Systemically, phenylephrine , when 
administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_401031], is known to cause serious cardiovascular reactions including ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and elevated blood pressure in some patients
1,2. 
These risks are especially relevant when more  mydriasis is required , and phenylephrine  10% is used, 
rather than the lower 2.5% concentration.   Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401032] a synthetic derivative of tropic acid that 
became available for ocular use in [ZIP_CODE].  It is an anticholinergic mydriatic agent that acts by [CONTACT_401063].  As an anticholinergic related to 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_401033], systemically absorbed tropi[INVESTIGATOR_535654], particularly in the pediatric population.   Eyenovia’s formulation ( fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5 %-tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 %) is a proprietary 
investigational  product that utilizes microdosing technology to facilitate accurate topi[INVESTIGATOR_401035] a controlled quantity of mydriatic agents in a precise manner  to maximize therapeutic control and 
minimize systemic absorption and loss to washout.  
 
3.2. Pupil Dil ation  
 A variety of ophthal mic evaluations require pupil dilation to provide an unobstructed view of the lens, 
retina, and optic nerve. The degree of pupil dilation required depends on the procedure being performed.   
For routine diagnostic procedures , and  in conditions where short term pupil dilation is desired, the goal is 
to achieve adequate mydriasis for visualization with minimal cycloplegic effect.

 3.3. Existing Mydriatic Options  
 
Dilation of the pupil is currently produced with parasympathetic anticholinergics  such as tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] , 
cyclopentolate, homatropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ; or with sympathetic agonists (sympathomimetics) such as 
phenylephrine4. 
 Parasympathetic antagonists block acetylcholine activation of muscarinic receptors, t hereby [CONTACT_401064]. The result is an enlarged pupil; however, at the same time, the ciliary muscle that regulates visual accommodation can be paralyzed, resulting in blurry vision that can persist for hours. Additionally, rare but serious systemic side effects have been observed after ocular administration of 
anticholinergics such as tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424], particularly in infants and children
5,6. 
 
Sympathetic agonists produce dilation by [CONTACT_535662]. Although phenylephrine does not induce blurry vision, at lower concentrations ; e.g., 2.5%, 
it generally does not dilate the pupil as well as parasympathetic agonists. Where full mydriasis is required, higher concentrations of phen ylephrine ; e.g., 10%, are required.  Higher concentration phenylephrine , 
however, has been known to cause cardiovascular effects after systemic absorption , which include  
hypertension, tachycardia, and more rarely, arrhythmia and stroke, especially in patie nts with pre -existing 
heart conditions
7.  
 To maximize dilation efficacy and minimize side effects, most ophthalmologists employ a combination of both classes of mydriatic agents.  
 
3.4. Phenylephrine and Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_535655]’s MiDD is designed to del iver precise microvolumes of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401037] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -generated microdroplet spray. When the dispenser is actuated, a precisely calibrated single 
microdose is delivered.  It is anticipated that microdosing of ophthalmic drugs will enhan ce drug 
bioavailability and efficacy while minimizing systemic absorption and any associated side effects.  
 
Phenylephrine ophthalmic solution is currently marketed with 2.5% and 10% concentrations  (Paragon 
BioTeck; Akorn , Inc. ) for dilation of the pupil.  Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_535656] 0.5% and 1.0% concentrations (Alcon Laboratories; Bausch & Lomb; Akorn, Inc.).  
Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution formulation uses 
US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) -approved formulations of phenylephrine  2.5% and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 
1.0%.  The drug is administered in approximately [ADDRESS_697069] and intraocular lens surgery:

 containing a combination of phenylephrine  and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401040] (Mydrin -
P, Japan; Phenyltrope, Canada); no similar drugs are formulated for microdosing.  
 
Ocular microdosing with the MiDD has been evaluated in humans using phenylephrine  2.5%, 
phenylephrine  10%, and t ropi[INVESTIGATOR_535657] 1.0% solutions , individually.   
 
3.5. Ophthalmic Microdosing  
 
The rationale for Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution 
development is the desire to optimiz e mydriasis while reducing systemic side effects, improving local 
tolerability, and decreasing the amount of medication lost to drainage from increased tear turnover rate.  
 
The average tear volume of an adult eye is 6−7 μL8,9. The estimated maximum volume of eyedrops that 
the cul de sac can contain, albeit momentarily, is approximately 30 μL ; this is reduced to 10 µL with 
normal blinking10.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_401041] (either unit dose or multidose) , however,  provides drops that

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697076] DESCRIPTION 
 
This study will evaluate the  safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401046] a fixed 
combination of phenylephrine  2.5%-tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 % ophthalmic solution for  mydriasis in routine 
diagnostic procedures and in conditions where short -term pupil  dilation is desired.  
 
4.1. Findings from Non -Clinical and Clinical Studies  
 
Detailed information on nonclinical and clinical studies of fixed combination phenylephrine  2.5%-
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 % ophthalmic solution is pro vided in the Investigator Brochure  (EYN- MYD- TP-3-
1/32) . 
4.2. How Provided  
Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution is contained 
sterile in the Eyenovia MiDD , which i s designed  to accurately deliver precise low -volume doses of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_401047].  As shown in Figure 2, t he MiDD is composed of a  “cartridge  
assembly ” (shown in white in the the image below) and the base unit (shown in gray in the image below) .  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Eyenovia MiDD  Front (L) and Back (R) View  
 
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the MiDD base unit and cartridge assembly.  The cartridge assembly is the primary container closure system, which contains a vial filled with sterile fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -  tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution.   At the time of initial MiDD actuation, the 
seal on the vial is punctured to allow the drug to flow to the MiDD delivery system.  The cartridge 
assembly also  contains a pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -delivery system designed to drive delivery of the drug through the Spray 
Nozzle  in discrete pulses repeated in a discrete cycle of duration ≤  100 milliseconds, which is  the average 
involuntary blink response time.

Prior to initial MiDD use, fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% solution is aseptically 
transferred from the 2R vial in which it was received into the MiDD vial, the MiDD vial is inserted into 
the cartridge assembly, the cartridge and base are clipped together, and the seal on the vial containing the 
drug is punctured by [CONTACT_401084].  Puncture of this seal creates a fluid path for the 
drug.  Depression and release of the Load  Button 5 times primes the system for drug delivery.  At the time 
of dosing, the Load Button is again pressed and released to activate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_401048].  When the Dose Button is pressed, approximately 8 µL of  the drug is delivered 
through the Spray Nozzle to the cornea.

 5. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  Eyenovia’s  fixed combination 
of phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution administered with the MiDD for dilation of 
the pupil as compared to  
 placebo.  
  6. STUDY DESIGN 
 
This trial is a multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled, cross -over superiority study evaluating 
Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution versus placebo .   
 
Volunteer participants  from 2 – 3 US -based investigational sites will be screened for study eligibility 
during a Screening Visit and enrolled after signing the study- specific informed consent form (ICF).  
Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be scheduled for [ADDRESS_697078] 2 days,  but no more than 7 days apart.  A 2 sequence, 3 period crossover design will be 
used.  At each of the three treatment visit s, baseline measurements will be taken, then either the 
investigational drug or t he placebo will be administered to  both eyes (OU)  in two separate instances, 
approximately [ADDRESS_697079] -study drug administration  ophthalmic assessments on that day.

drug dose versus baseline, as measured by [CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051] .  The highly 
photopic condition will be established using a fully- charged transillum inator (muscle light) at the 
brightest setting.  The difference in mean change in pupil diameter will be compared  between  Eyenovia’s 
fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  and placebo.    
 
The study’s sample size will provide 95% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_697081] with a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  
 
Additional exploratory outcomes  (also to be measured in highly photop ic conditions)  include:  
 
• Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 6.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 7.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Mean change in pupil diameter at other timepoints ( 20, 50, 65, 80,  120, and 180 minutes)  
• Distribution of pupil diameters  at 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 120, and 180 minutes  
• Time from baseline to maximal pupil dilation

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697086] be used for administration of informed consent.  Dependent on IRB 
requirements for subjects under 1 8 years of age, an IRB -approved study assent form may be supplemental 
to the study ICF.   
 
The investigator or designee will explain  the study purpose, procedures and responsibilities to the 
potential participant and provide sufficient opportunity to ask questions, while allowing adequate time for 
consideration of the information provided.  Written consent  (and assent, if applicable)  for study 
participation must be present prior to initiation of any study- specific procedure ; subjects will be 
considered enrolled in the study upon their (and/or their parent’s/guardian’s, if applicable) signature [CONTACT_401100](s) .  It is the responsi bility of the Investigator to complete the informed consent process, 
maintain a copy of the signed consent/assent forms in the subject’s medical records, and provide each 
subject with a copy of their fully- executed consent documents . 
 
9.2. Subject Selection and Screening Procedures  
 
Study participants will be recruited from the Investigator’s  patient population, referrals, or other outreach 
methods .  Written recruitment materials directed to potential study participants must be approved by [CONTACT_5040].    
 
Where possible, candidate participants  may be pre -screened via review of their medical charts to evaluate 
potential eligibility based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  During the informed consent discussion, 
the potential participant’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be evaluated.  
Those  who elect to sign the study consent form(s)  will be considered enrolled in the study and given a 
study identification code.   At/after the time of enrollment, t he subject will be evaluated  at the Screening 
Visit  for study eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion requirements established in Sections 8.1  and 8.2.  
Subjects who fail to qualify for the study will be considered “screen failures” and exited from the study.  
Subjects who successfully complete the Screening Visit will be scheduled for their next visit at which the first study medication will be adminis tered.   
 
9.3. Randomization to Study Drug  Administration Sequence   
 
Each eligible subject will be randomly assigned to receive one of 2 sequences (ABB or BAA) of study drug administration where either investigational drug or placebo will be administered in both eyes at each of the [ADDRESS_697087] of the study.  The  drug  assignment 
sequence (Study Drug A BB or BAA ) will be provided in paper fo rmat contained in a sealed envelope for 
each subject who randomized to treatment .

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697088], the investigator , and study staff  
administering performing clinical assessments.  The Sponsor (or designee) involved in day- to-day study 
management will also be masked to study drug assignments.   
 
9.3.1.  Procedure for Unmasking Study Drug  Assignment Code  
 
Unmasking of study drug  assignments can  only occur in the event of a medical emergency or occurrence 
of an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants such action.  In the absence of medical need, the 
study drug assignment code will not be available to the investigator , site staff , or Sponsor ( or designee) 
representative involved in day- to-day study management until study completion and database lock.  
 
In the event  an investigator considers unmasking of a subject’s study drug assignment to be necessary, 
he/she must first contact [CONTACT_40862]  (or designee ) to discuss the case.  Only after 
consultation with the study Medical Monitor will the  decision be made regarding  unmasking. Study drug 
assignment s will be revealed only for the subjects approved for unmasking, thus leaving mas king on 
remaining subjects intact.  
 
9.4. Study Drug  Packaging , Labeling  and Storage  
 
The investigational product and placebo, each delivered in microdose form using the Eyenovia MiDD, 
will be evaluated in this study .  Each product  must be aseptically transferred by a licensed pharmacist  
affiliated with the study site  from the container in which they are received to the sterile vial provided with 
the MiDD cartridge.  After aseptic transfer, the filled vial is re- inserted into the Mi DD cartridge.  
 
To maintain masking of the study drug assignments for staff administering investigational product  and/or 
performing clinical evaluations, study inventory storage and management will be performed by a 
pharmacy associated with the study site.  The Sponsor, or designee, will ship study drug kits to each site pharmacy.  Each kit will be labeled with the study protocol number, study drug code, product storage requirements, and the Caution – New Drug –  Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (US) Law to Investigational  Use label.  
 Instructions regarding study medication preparation are included in  
APPENDIX 2:  STUDY MEDICATION PREPARATION PROCEDURE .  Each designat ed site 
pharmacist will be trained and certified by [CONTACT_1034], or designee, prior to study medication preparation.  
 Prior to use, study medication must be stored in a secure area.  To maintain product stability, store at 20° to 25° C (68° to 77° F).  Protect product from light and excessive heat.   
 
New MiDDs  must be prepared by [CONTACT_401070].  To 
maintain masking of site personnel, the MiDD containing each study drug will be  labeled with the 
appropriate study randomization code , pharmacy preparation date and “use by”  date , then forwarded to 
site personnel for use.   The date on which the MiDD is used will be added by [CONTACT_8786] .  At the end 
of the treatment day,  each MiDD provided  will be returned to the pharmacy  for storage . Please note that 
each MiDD prepared must be used on the d ay of preparation; the MiDD may not be re -used on 
subsequent days.

ICH E6 – Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guidance.   Because of the differing sources for these 
definitions , some terminology; e.g., “adverse event”, “adverse reaction”, and “adverse experience”, 
differs.  For  this study, these terms should be considered  equivalent.  
 
10.1.1.  Adverse Event  (AE)  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered 
drug- related.
30    
 
10.1.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR)  
 
Any noxious and unintended response  to a medicinal product administered at any dose .  A reasonable 
possibility must exist that the adverse reaction is related to the medicinal product administered.31 
 
10.1.3.  Unexpected  Adverse Event  or U nexpected  Suspected  Adverse Reaction   
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the Investigator 
Brochure  (IB)  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or els ewhere in the current application, as amended.  "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological propertie s of the drug but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

10.1.5.  Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life- Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
An AE or suspe cted adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  Life- threatening 
AEs do not include AEs or suspected adverse reactions that, had they occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.34 
 
10.1.6.  Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 An AE or  suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening
35  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, meaning there is a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threat ening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject

10.2. Adverse Event Assessment  and Documentation  
 
All AEs that occur  from the time the subject receives the first dose of study drug37 until study 
participation has been completed (e.g., TEAEs)  must be documented.  Any medical condition present 
prior to the first study drug dose that remains unchanged or improves will  not be recorded as an AE; 
however, a worsening of the condition after dosing with the study drug, will be considered an AE.   
 
Adverse e vents  may be determined by [CONTACT_401072] : 
 
• Observed or volunteered problems  
• Compl aints  
• Physical signs and symptoms  
• The occurrence of a m edical condition during the study, which was absent at baseline 
• The worsening of a baseline m edical condition during the study  
 Treatment -emergent AEs , regardless of causal relationship, must be assessed by [CONTACT_401073].  Each AE must be described as ocular or 
non-ocular along with the following information: date of onset, date of resolution, severity, frequency of 
the event (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], intermittent, continuous), action taken (none, medical and/or surgical), relationship to study drug, and seriousness criteria .  Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE 
must be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF and any surgical intervention necessary for AE 
treatment must be recorded on the Concomitant P rocedure eCRF.  If more than one distinct AE occurs, 
each event should be recorded separately.  
 Adverse events will be documente d beginning at the time of onset, and documentation must continue 
until recovery is noted.  Events that are ongoing at the time of study exit must be followed until resolution 
or stabilization.

The relationship of the AE to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_130691]:  
 
Not Related  Evidence exists that the AE has a cause other than the study 
drug (e.g. pre -existing condition or underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication) and does not 
meet any other criteria listed.  
  
Possibly Related  A temporal relationship exists between event onset and 
administration of study drug.  Although the AE may appear 
unlikely to be related to the study drug, it cannot be ruled out 
with certainty; and /or the event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Probably Related  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of study drug; it  appears with some degree of 
certainty to be r elated based on known therapeutic and 
pharmacologic actions of the study drug.  It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Definitely Related  Strong evidence exists that the study drug caused the AE.  
There i s a temporal relationship between the event onset and

 11. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  Eyenovia’s  fixed combination 
of phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution administered with the MiDD for dilation of 
the pupil as compared to the individual components.  
 
11.1. Efficacy Endpoint s 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: An efficacy analysis will be conducted to compare fixed combination of 
phenylephrine  2.5%-tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 % microdose ophthalmic solution against placebo  with the following 
endpoint:  
 
The primary performance endpoint is m ean change per visit in pupil diameter at 3 5 minutes versus 
baseline, as measured by [CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051] .  The highly photopic 
condition will be established using a fully -charged transilluminator (mus cle light)  at the brightest setting.  
 
Additional Efficacy Analyses:  
• Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 6.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 7.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Mean change in pupil diameter at other timepoints ( 20, 50, 65, 80,  120, and 180 minutes)  
• Distribution of pupil diameter s at 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 120, and 180 minutes  
• Time from baseline to maximal pupil dilation  
 
These additional efficacy analyses  will also be measured using dig ital pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401029].  
 
11.2. Sample Size  
 
Up to [ADDRESS_697107] provided informed consent for study participation will be enrolled in the 
study and a minimum of 65 subjects will be randomized to study drug administration at Treatment Visit 1 
with the goal of having 54 subjects  evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint. A sample size of 27 
subjects per sequence, 54 total  (the study has two sequences, ABB and BAA where A is the Eyenovia 
fixed combination  drug , and B is the placebo control) , will have 95% power to detect a difference in 
means of 0.[ADDRESS_697108] with a 
0.05 two- sided significance level.  
 Power calculations are provided for additional exploratory outcomes below on an informational basis.  
 When the sample size is 54, a two -sided 95% exact confidence interval for a single proportion will have a 
half-width of 13.9% or less.  
• For evaluation of the proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 6.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes: 
if the observed propor tion in the fixed combination treatment is 70.4% (38/54), then the exact 
95% confidence interval for the proportion will be [56.4%, 82.0%], with a half -width of 12.8%.

 • For evaluation of the proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 7.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes: 
if the observed proportion in the fixed combination treatment is 40.7% (22/54), then the exact 
95% confidence interval for the proportion will be [27.6% 55.0%], with a half -width of 13.7%.  
 11.3. Safety Outcomes  
 
A safety analysis will be conducted to compare fixed combination of phenylephrine  2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1 % 
microdose  against placebo  for the following outcomes:  
• Slit-lamp examination findings  
• Occurrence of AEs  
• IOP measured at [ADDRESS_697109] -administration * 
• Visual a cuity c hanges*  
 
*IOP and VA line listings will be provided for pediatric subjects because of the variable testing methods 
appropriate for this sub -group  
 
11.4. Analysis Populations  
 
Subjects who are missing efficacy assessments at any of the time points or are otherwise unevaluable for efficacy considerations will not be replaced.  
 
11.4.1.  Intent to Treat Population  
 
The intent to treat ( ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects who received a dose of study 
drug.   Subjects will be analyzed according to t he planned sequence of drugs . 
 
11.4.2.  Per Protocol Population  
 
The per protocol (PP)  population will consist of all ITT subjects who completed all planned assessments 
without major protocol violations.  Subjects to be excluded from the PP population will be selected prior to unmasking drug  assignment.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the sequence of study drugs  
received . 
 
11.4.3.  Modified Per Protocol Population  
 
The modified per protocol (MPP) population is defined similarly to the PP population, except that 
classification will be made for each subject at the individual treatment visit level, rather than at the subject 
level. Unlike the PP population, subjects who only complete [ADDRESS_697110] of all ITT subjects who completed all planned assessments without major protocol 
violations for the given treatment visit. Subjects to be excluded from the MPP populat ion will be selected 
prior to unmasking treatment

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697111] of all ITT subjects.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
sequence of study drugs  received  
 
11.5. General Statistical Considerations  
 
Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP  population. Safety analyses will be performed 
using the safety analysis set. All primary analyses will be performed in both eyes.   The pupil diameter 
measurement at each corresponding time point after administration  will be compared between  study 
drugs . 
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical variabl es, i.e. race, sex, iris color (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point.  
 The ABB/BAA crossover design used in this study allows for within- subject (i.e. within -eye) estimates of 
both drug  effects (A and B) and carryover (AA, AB, BA, BB).  Thus , there is no need to include random 
effects for subject or eye in the analysis model, we will use fixed effects ANOVA to analyze these data 
(Jones and Kenward, 2015, section 5.2, 5.3.1) and tests will be based on within- eye variances.  A SAS 
REPEATED statement will be used to adjust for correlation between fellow eyes.  
 
This study has both a “pre -randomization” covariate (iris color) and a “period- dependent” covariate 
(baseline pupil measurement) as discussed in Jones and Kenward (2015,  section 5.4.4) .  We are assuming 
that the time between visits is sufficiently long that the baseline pupil measurement at each visit is unaffected by [CONTACT_401076].  
 
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all statistical tests and confidence intervals will be two -sided, alpha = 
0.05.  
 
11.5.1.  Analysis of Primary Efficacy  
 All time points for pupil diameter  will be analyzed  separately ; however, only the 35- minute time point 
will support statistical inference.  Success is defined as a statistically significant drug  effect, with the 
fixed combination  better (greater deltaPD) than placebo . 
 
The null and alternative hypotheses for comparison of Eyenovia ’s fixed  combination phenylephrine 
2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution with placebo, are defined as follows:  
 
• H
0: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051], is n ot different between Eyenovia ’s fixed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and placebo

 • HA: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_535658], is different between Eyenovia ’s fixed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and placebo 
 
Comparisons among drugs on mean pupil diameter will be based on a fixed- effects analysis of variance 
model.  The model will contain an effect due to subject, eye, subject x eye, period (1, 2, or 3), direct effect of drug, first order carryover, baseline pupil diameter, and iris color (dark vs light).  The SAS PROC 
MIXED procedure will be used to fit the ANOVA model.  Hypothesis tests w ill be based on confidence 
intervals produced by [CONTACT_535663]. Details are 
provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
The SAS PROC MIXED procedure uses all available data to produce maximum likelihood parameter estimates, in such a setting the missing observations are ignorable if data are missing at random (MAR).    
11.5.2.  Additional Efficacy Analyses  
 The proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 6.[ADDRESS_697112]-dose will be summarized by [CONTACT_401078].  
 For each of these proportions, pairwise comparisons of the fixed combination of phenylephrine 2.5% -
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% microdose ophthalmic s olution administered against placebo will be conducted with a 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) model for binomial outcome, allowing for correlation between eyes.   
 
The SAS PROC GENMOD procedure will be used to fit the model, usi ng the same fixed effects as the 
primary analysis.  Once again, comparisons between treatment groups will be based on SAS LSMEANS 
for the difference between drug and placebo.  Details are provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
In addition, a cumulativ e proportion of responders analysis (CPRA) will be created to graphically display 
the proportions of subjects with a pupil size at [ADDRESS_697113] -dose over the entire range of possible 
pupil size cut -offs (Farrar 2006), with separate lines for each treatm ent and eye combination.  
 
The distribution of time to maximum pupil diameter  will be described by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier plots.    
 
11.5.3.  Sensitivity Analyses  
 
The primary efficacy analysis described above will be rerun using the MPP population as a sensitivity 
analysis.  
 As a further sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation based on reference -based multiple imputation will be 
used to impute missing data at the 35- minute time point  based on a missing not at random (MNAR) 
assumption. Since the PP population contains only subjects with non- missing values, this analysis will be 
conducted using the ITT population, which may contain subjects who have only partially available information. Placebo treatment will serve as reference group for this approach. Each subject will be

 APPENDIX 3:  STUDY MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURE  
 This study will be double -masked so that there are no differences in presentation (Eyenovia’s fixed 
combination mydriasis agent is formulated as a multi -dose microdroplet spray and the placebo is also 
administrated as a microdroplet spray).  Site personnel designated to administer study medication will be 
trained by [CONTACT_401086].  In order to 
reduce the potential for operational bias, study personnel who administer study medication on a given 
day will not be allowed to perform post -study drug administration ophthalmic assessments on that day.  
Study drug must be administered in location unattended by [CONTACT_535667].  
 For each treatment day, one or more new MiDD  base units and cartridges containing the study drug to 
be administered  will be provided by [CONTACT_401088].  Each MiDD  will appear the same  except for 
a label indicating the study drug code.  Study site per sonnel will assemble the cartridge and base unit, 
then add the study drug administration day to the MiDD label  and prime the system for use by 
[CONTACT_535668] , then depressing and releasing the Dose Button.  This 
sequence must be p erformed 5 times  to complete the priming process.

At the time of study medication administration, the following steps should be followed sequentially:  
 
1. Load MiDD  dose  by [CONTACT_401090] . 
2. Hold MiDD such that that the thumb and 3rd finger are positioned on each side of the cartridge 
and index finger is positioned on DOSE B UTTON at the back of the MiDD.  Note:  H olding 
MiDD with fingers around the front of the device may affect dispenser alignment with the eye, 
resulting in spray administration outside of the targeted corneal area.   
3. Begin to position the MiDD over the patie nt’s eye such that the SPRAY NOZZLE is facing the 
cornea and the DOSE BUTTON is facing the medication administrator .  While positioning, it is

The MiDD may be rotated sl ightly to avoid interference that might affect stability during spray 
administration; however, it is important that the SPRAY NOZZLE be aligned directly toward 
the patient’s cornea.  
5. Ask patient to first look up, then look at the blue light around the SPRAY  NOZZLE 
6. When blue light is centered on the patient’s iris, depress, then quickly release DOSE BUTTON to administer medication.  Visually confirm medication delivery to the cornea.   
7. If medication delivery missed the cornea, withdraw MiDD from eye, then rel oad by [CONTACT_401091] 1- 6. 
8. Repeat steps 1 -7 for the contralateral eye.

 APPENDIX 4 :  EXAMINATION PROCEDURES  
 
All study personnel conducting ophthalmic assessments will be masked to the study drug administered.  
 
1. Visual Acuity  
 
The e valuation of VA should be performed before the subject’s pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401055].  Distance VA 
measurements should be obtained at a testing distance of [ADDRESS_697125] be between 80 cd/m
2 and 160 cd/m2, 
inclusive (85 cd/m2 is recommended).    
  
Adult subject s’ BCDVA will be determin ed using subjective manifest refraction.  
 The subject  should be seated so that the distance from the subject 's eyes to the ETDRS chart (Chart 1 
for right eye and Chart 2 for left eye) is 4 meters (157.5 inches).  The middle line of letters to approximately  one-third of the distance from the top line of letters should be at eye level for the subject .  
The subject  should be asked to start reading letters at the top line of the chart.   Document the number 
of letters correctly read the line.  Move to the next line down if 4 or more letters are read correctly and 
document the number of letters correctly read on this line.  Continue moving down the lines (documenting the number of letters read for each line) until the subject  reads 2 or more letters 
incorrectly, then stop.  Note:  If the total number of letters read (TLR) correctly is less than [ADDRESS_697126]  1 meter from the chart and add +0.[ADDRESS_697127]  should be tested to determine if vision is count fingers (CF), hand motion (HM), light 
perception (LP), or no light perception (NLP).  All visual acuitie s will be expressed in logMar units.  
 
For younger pediatric subjects, uncorrected distance  visual acuity (UCDVA) should be measured using 
age-appropriate methods per the Investigator’s usual practice.  
 
2. Pupil Diameter Measurement  
 
Pupil diameter should be measured prior to additional study -specified examinations using the 
Neuroptics VIP 300 pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187] ; the same pupi[INVESTIGATOR_535660] a given subject.  The subject should be asked to focus straight ahead at a target 
placed at [ADDRESS_697128].  
   
PHENYLEPHRINE 2.5%- TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_383219] 1% MICRODOSE OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION  
EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697129] should be asked to focus straight ahead at a target placed 
at 3 meters  to avoid accommodation.  A fully -charged transilluminator, or muscle light, will be 
shone into one eye while the pupil diameter in the fellow eye is measured . For optimal 
accuracy, take the measurement at the patient’s eye level and repeat each measurement 2- 3 
times to ensure the result is consistent .  The pupil diameter recorded should be either the mean 
(if 2 measurements are taken) or the median (if 3 measurements are taken) values.  
 3. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401057] a fully -charged transillumator, or muscle light .  The 
response will be recorded on a scale ranging from 0 (non- responsive) to 3 (brisk).  
 
4. Intraocular Pressure Measurement   
 
After completion of slit lamp biomicroscopy, local anesthetic will be applied to facilitate IOP 
measurements with the Goldmann Applanation Tonometer. Recent tonometer calibration must be 
documented.  
 
Two consecutive IOP measurements of each eye must be obtained. If the [ADDRESS_697130] be obtained. IOP will be analyzed as the mean of these 
2 measurements, or as the median of the 3 measurements.  
 
For pediatric subjects, IOP should be measured using age -appropriate methods per the Investigator’s 
usual practice.  
 
5. Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy  
 
The eyelids, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, lens , iris and anterior vitreous of the eye will 
be examined with the aid of a table -mounted binocular microscope, called a slit lamp.  The patient will 
be seated during t his examination and fluorescein dye should be instilled into the ocular cul -de-sac to 
facilitate the examination.  For pediatric subjects who cannot cooperate with a traditional SLE, a 
portable slit lamp model may be used according to the Investigator’s us ual practice.  Grading will be 
assigned as follows:

Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_697134], Republic of South Africa, October 1996

A.  INTRODUCTION  
 
1.  The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement 
of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including research on 
identifiable human material and data. The  Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of 
its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant 
paragraphs.  
 2.  Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other  
participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
 
3.  It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who 
are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfillment of this duty.  
 4.  The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, 
“A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”  
 5.  Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human 
subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
 
6.  In medical research involving human subjects, the well -being of the individual research subject 
must take precedence over all other interests.  
 
7.  The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current i nterventions must be

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697135], incentives for subjects and provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The 
protocol should describe arrangements for post -study access by [CONTACT_535672].  
 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a 
research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of the 
researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into consideration the laws and 
regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697136], institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the 
PHENYLEPHRINE 2.5%- TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_383219] 1% MICRODOSE OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION  
EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697137]’s freely -given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
 25. For medical research using identifi able human material or data, physicians must normally seek 
consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validi ty 
of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of 
a research ethics committee.  
 
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_535673].  
 
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from 
the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study 
that has no likelihood of benefit for them unle ss it is intended to promote the health of the 
population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
 28. When a potential research s ubject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to decisions 
about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respect ed. 
 29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for 
example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents 
giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such 
circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study 
may proceed without informed conse nt provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects 
with a condition that renders  them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research 
protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in t he 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized 
representative.  
 
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of the 
results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on 
human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN- MYD- TP-[ADDRESS_697138] current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven 
intervention exists; or  
• Where for  compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the 
outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to 
interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
 34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. 
The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study 
must never interfere with the patient -physician relationship.  
 35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the 
physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, this intervention 
should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new 
information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

Name [CONTACT_23361]:  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721581]:  A Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721582](s):  This study  will be conducted  at multiple  sites in the United  States . 
Stud y period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: November  2017 (First Subject First Visit)  
Estimated date last patient completed: August  2019 (Last Subject Last Visit ) Phase of development:  
Phase 3b  
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of AL-NCD initiation regimen (30 mg oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] + 662 mg 
AL-NCD intramuscular [ IM]) followed by [CONTACT_47812] [ADDRESS_985645] 4  weeks of 
treatment of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721583] a. 
Secondary:  
 To compare the efficacy of AL-NCD initiation regimen followed by [CONTACT_47812] 1064  mg IM with 
paliperidone palmitate initiation dosing (PP; Invega® Sustenna®; 234 mg + 156  mg IM) 
during th e first 4 weeks of treatmen t of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721584]  
 To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AL 1064  mg IM after 6  months of 
treatment with AL for schizophrenia  
 To compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AL 1064  mg IM with monthly PP 156 mg 
IM after 6  months of treatment with AL or PP for schizophrenia  
Exploratory:  
 To characterize subject and caregiver centered outcomes, such as quality of life, work 
readiness, satisfaction with medication, resource utilization, and caregiver burden after 
6 months of treatment with AL or PP for schizophrenia  
Methodology: This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
AL and PP in approximately 180 subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In total, 
subjects will participate for approximately 26  weeks, including up to  1 week of inpatient screening and 
25 weeks of treatment (which includes an  initial 2 -week in patient stay) . Potential subjects will be 
evaluated for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria at a Screening visit (up to a 7 day 
period)  and Baseline  visit prior to randomization . Prior antipsychotic medications should be discontin ued 
after screening  upon inpatient admission. Subjects will be randomized to either the AL Treatment Group 
or the PP Treatment Group and receive dosing with AL or PP.

dependent) . 
Investigational product, dosage, duration, and mode of administration:  
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4254] (AL) is a covalent non -ester modif ication of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721586] 
N-lauroyloxymethyl aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. The AL drug product is a white to off -white aqueous extended -release 
suspension for IM provided as single -use pre filled syringes (PFS) in a dose strength of 1064  mg every 
2 months . Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721587]  (AL-NCD) is an alternative formulation of AL 
designed to provide faster dissolution than the AL formulation and is provided in single -use PFS 
containing a dose strength of 662  mg. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721587] ( AL-NCD) is 
intended as a starting dose to initiate treatment with AL. 
For subjects with no history of tolerated exposure to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], oral test doses will be commercially 
available aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 5 mg tablets , provided in commercial packaging provided to the site by [CONTACT_43421].  
Oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721588] 30  mg tablets (overencapsulated to 
maintain study blind), which will be provided in bottles to the site by [CONTACT_43421].  
On D ay 1, subjects randomized to the AL Treatment Group will receive 662  mg AL-NCD (single IM 
gluteal injection) plus IM placebo ( PBO; single IM deltoid injection) plus a 30  mg oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721589]. 
On Day 8, subjects will receive AL 1064  mg (single IM gluteal injection) plus IM PBO (single IM deltoid 
injection). On Days 64 and 120, subjects will receive AL 1064  mg (single IM gluteal injection), and on 
Days 36, 92, and 148 will receive  IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection ).  
Reference therapy, dosage, duration, and mode of administration: Paliperidone palmitate is available 
as a white to off -white aqueous extended -release injectable suspension for IM injection provided as a 
single -use PFS in dose strengths of [ADDRESS_985647] doses will be commercially available risperidone 1.0  mg tablets, provided in commercial 
packaging provided to the site by [CONTACT_43421].  
Oral PBO for use in dose init iation will be empty gelatin capsules that visually match the 
overencapsulated aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 30  mg tablets (to maintain study blind) , which will be provided in bottles to 
the site by [CONTACT_43421].  
On Day 1, subjects randomized to the PP Treatment Group will rec eive PP 234 mg (single IM deltoid 
injection) plus IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection) plus an oral PBO tablet. On Day 8, subjects will 
receive PP 156 mg (single IM deltoid injection) plus IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection). Subjects 
randomized to the PP Treatment Group will receive PP 156 mg (single IM gluteal injection) on Days 36, 
64, 92, 120, and 148.  
Duration of study:  The o verall study duration is approximately 26  weeks and includes up to 1  week of 
inpatient screening  and 25 weeks of treatment (whi ch includes an initial [ADDRESS_985648] 
randomization/baseline ).

Statistical methods:  
Efficacy analysis will be based on the Full analysis set ( FAS), which will include all subjects in the Safety 
population who have at least o ne postbaseline assessment of PANS S. 
The Safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug ( AL injection, 
AL-NCD injection, 30 mg oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], oral PBO, PBO injection, or PP injection). Safety analysis 
will be based on the Safety population.

The change from baseline in PANS S total score at Week 4, Week 9 , or Week 25 will be compared 
between the two  treatment groups using an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) with last observation 
carried forward ( LOCF ) imputation for missing data. The ANCOVA  model will include treatment group, 
baseline PANS S total score, stratification factor, and the pooled study sites as covariates.  
Other efficacy endpoints:  
The continuous outcome s (change from baseline in PANS S subscales, CGI-S) will be analyzed using the 
same ANCOVA  with LOCF  model. The time from randomization to Readiness for Discharge will be 
summarized using a Kaplan -Meier  plot.

SAS), C -SSRS scores, ISR s, [LOCATION_006]U -SERS -PAT  Sexual Side Effects Subscale scores, and ESS total 
scores . Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(Med DRA) preferred terms and system organ classes. Concomitant medications will be categorized using 
the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( WHO-ATC) classification system.  
Analysis of o ther subject or caregiver centered e ndpoints:  
The change from baseline at each visit in Q -LES-Q-SF total score will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. The Burden Assessment Score will be summarized by [CONTACT_721644]. The 
number and percentage of response for the modified MSQ and Wo RQ will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. The number and percentage of subjects who had an ER visit, arrest, or have been incarcerated will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Handwriting Movement Kinematics and wrist actigraphy results will 
be summarized by t reatment group. Further analysis details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP).

Page 15  of 72 5. INTRODUCTION 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_721645]. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_297562] a second generation, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_721593] ( Abili fy USPI, 2017 ). Although 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721594], poor adherence to oral antipsychotic treatment regimens is widespread and presents a 
major limitation to successful treatment ( Keith and Kane 2003 ). Nonadherence has been 
associated with relapse and worsening long-term functional and mental outcomes ( Ascher-
Svanum et al, 2006 ; Ascher-Svanum et al, 2010 ). Long-acting injectable ( LAI) antipsychotic 
formulations, such as risperidone (Risperdal® Consta®), pa liperidone palmitate ( PP; Invega® 
Sustenna®), olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Zyprexa® Relprevv®), and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (Abilify® Maintena®; 
ARISTADA®), were developed to promote treatment adherence, and have been demonstrated to 
improve adherence relative to oral medication, and thus improve outcomes and reduce long term 
costs ( Kane et al, 2013 ). 
Ar
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_4254] ( AL; ARISTADA) is a covalently bonded, non-ester modification of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721586] N -lauroyloxymethyl aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. It is formulated as an extended-release 
suspension to be administered via intramuscular ( IM) injection into the gluteal or deltoid muscle. 
In clinical trials, treatment with AL demonstrated statistically significant reductions from 
ba
seline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores at Week 12, compared 
with placebo. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721595] [ADDRESS_985663] common adverse events (AEs) being 
insom
nia, akathisia, and headache.  
Due to the delayed appearance of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721596], treatment with AL currently requires a concurrent 21-day oral lead-in regimen 
(oral initiation regimen; ie, oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721597] 21 days after AL administration) to 
e
nsure adequate pharmacological activity to cover the initial lag of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721598]. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721587]® (AL-NCD) is an alternative 
IM formulation of AL under investigation that has been developed for the initiation of treatment 
with AL in order to eliminate the need for the current oral initiation regimen. This study is 
desig
ned to 1) evaluate the efficacy of the AL-NCD initiation regimen followed by [CONTACT_721646] 1064 mg/every 2 months dose regimen for acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and 2) compare 
the sa
fety and efficacy of AL to PP (ie, ARISTADA and Invega Sustenna).

tudy is a double-blind, 25-week evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AL or PP for the 
treatment of schizophrenia in subjects hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721599]. 
5.1. Disease Overview 
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_721647], physical and psychiatric comorbidities,  and increased mortality. Symptoms are 
characterized by a mix of “positive symptoms” such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought 
disorders, and by “negative symptoms” such as flat or blunted affect, poverty of speech, inability 
to ex
perience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and reduced motivation ( Ame rican 
Psychiatric Association 2013 ). Effective antipsychotic medications are available to treat this

Page 16  of 72 condition; for example, in patients with schizophrenia , aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721600] (Abilify USPI, 2017 ). Although 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721594], poor adherence to oral antipsychotic treatment regimens is widespread and presents a 
major barrier to achieving optimal pharmacologic outcomes ( Keith and Kane 2003 ). 
5.2. Study Rationale 
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721601]-release formulation of an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_721602]. Five dose regimens of AL are 
c
urrently approved by [CONTACT_24623] ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of schizophrenia as follows: 441 mg/monthly, 662 mg/monthly, 882 mg/monthly, 
882 mg/every 6 weeks, and 1064 mg/every 2 months. 
Ar
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_721587] ( AL-NCD)  is an alternative IM formulation of AL 
under investigation that has been developed for the initiation of treatment with AL in order to 
e
liminate the need for the current 21-day oral initiation regimen. The AL-NCD initiation regimen 
c
omprises a single 662 mg IM dose of AL-NCD coadministered with a single 30 mg oral dose of 
a
ripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. This regimen was developed based on pharmacokinetic modeling, and AL-NCD 
was found to be well tolerated when tested in a clinical study in subjects with schizophrenia. 
This stud
y is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the AL-NCD init iation regimen for 
acute symptoms followed by [CONTACT_721648] 1064 mg/every 2 months dose regimen. It will also 
c
ompare the safety and efficacy of AL to PP  (ie, ARISTADA and Invega Sustenna), two atypi[INVESTIGATOR_721603]. Paliperidone palmitate is approved by 
[CONTACT_721649]. In multiple clinical studies, PP has been found to 
be efficacious in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia ( Gop al et al, 2010 ; 
Nasrallah et al, 2010 ; Pandina et al, 2010 ). An active drug with a known efficacy profile is a 
useful comparator for evaluating new drugs while avoiding the ethical dilemmas associated with 
plac
ebo.  
Therefore, this study is being conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AL and 
PP
 in subjects hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721604].

8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a  multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AL 
a
nd PP in approximately 180 subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In 
tot
al, subjects will participate for approximately 26 weeks, including up to 1 week of inpatient 
sc
reening and 25 weeks of treatment (which includes an initial 2-week inpatient stay). Potential 
subj
ects will be evaluated at a Screening visit (up to 7 days) prior to randomization. If a subject 
doe
s not have historical exposure to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34829]/or risperidone and paliperidone, test doses 
will be administered during the first [ADDRESS_985684] dose of study drug on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from the 
inpatient unit upon assessment as clinically stable and appropriate for discharge as determined by 
[CONTACT_737]. Subjects will receive their final injection of study drug on Day 148 and will be 
considered to be on treatment until Day 176. A schematic of the study design is provided in

eligibility criteria (including medical and psychiatric history) will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_721657]. 
8.3.3. Id entification of Informant/Caregiver 
Each subject enrolled in this study will need a reliable informant/caregiver. The caregiver will be 
re
quired to sign a caregiver ICF and may withdraw consent at any time, in which case he/she can 
no longer fill the caregiver role for this study. If a caregiver can no longer fill the caregiver role, 
he/she should be replaced if possible. If the caregiver cannot be replaced, most subjects will be 
able to continue in the study. If the subject must also withdraw from the study (eg, the caregive r 
provided transportation to the site and no other travel arrangements can be made for the subject), 
the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for the caregiver’s 
withdra
wal, while fully respecting the caregiver’s and subject’s rights. The reason for the 
c
aregiver’s withdrawal and explanation of the subject’s discontinuation should be documented in 
the a
ppropriate e CRF.  
Information about a subject’s caregiver will be collected at screening and in the event of a

 Readiness for Discharge Questionnaire 
The RD Q is a  questionnaire used to assess a patient’s readiness for discharge, independent of 
socio-economic factors ( P otkin et al, 2005 ). The RD Q c onsists of 6 items assessing 
suicidality/homicidality, control of aggression/impulsivity, activities of daily living, medication-
taking, delusions/hallucinations interfering with functioning and global status. The 6 items 
ult
imately inform a “yes/no” indication of whether the subject is clinically appropriate for 
discha
rge. The Investigator or designee will complete the RDQ a t time points identified in 
Table 3. Subjects who are determined to be “ready for discharge” prior to Day 15 are still 
re

An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that meets one or more of the 
following criteria: 
 R esults in death 
 I s life-threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182032], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above. 
Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203823] a non-medical reason (ie, social stay admission)

(see Section 14.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
 M ild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities 
 M oderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities 
 S evere:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities

6.2. Audits and Inspections 
By [CONTACT_12142], the Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions and 
institutional and ethical considerations, authorized representatives of Alkermes, a regulatory 
a
uthority, and/or an institutional review board ( IRB)/independent ethics committee ( IEC) may 
visit the study site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, study drug 
stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and source documents, and other records 
relative to study conduct. The purpose of an Alkermes audit or inspection is to systematically 
a
nd independently examine all study-related activities and documents (eg, laboratory reports, 
x-rays, workbooks, and su bjec ts’ medical records) to determine whether these activities were 
conducted and data recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol,  
GCP
 guidelines of the International Council on Harmonisation ( ICH), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
The
 Investigator should contact [CONTACT_182118] a regulatory agency 
regarding an inspection.

Page 60  of 72 18. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
18.1. Ethics Review 
The study site’s IRB/IEC  must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol and 
ICF will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC prior to enrolling subjects into the study; written approval 
from the committee must be received by [CONTACT_721672]. The protocol must be reapproved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC upon receipt of amendments and 
annually, as local regulatory requirements require. 
The Investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the 
IRB/IEC according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational 
new drug safety report must be immediately reported. 
All relevant correspondence from the IRB/IEC will be forwarded by [CONTACT_12566] a timely fashion. 
18.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all 
applicable local regulatory requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and 
scientific quality standard used for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies 
involving the participation of human subjects. Alkermes is committed to complying with this 
standard to provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects will be 
protected, consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
18.3. Written Informed Consent 
The Investigator (or authorized designee) at each study site will ensure that the subject (or the 
subje
ct’s legal representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, and the potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective 
subject will receive an IRB-approved ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and 
will be given ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All information is to 
be provided in a language understandable to the subject and must not include any language that 
waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective subjects must also be informed of their right to 
withdraw consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject chooses to 
participate, he or she must sign the ICF before any study-specific procedures are conducted.  
All subjects will be informed of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to Alkermes, the IRB, the CRO, if applicable, and to regulatory authorities for 
review and evaluation for the duration of the study and until the project has been approved for 
marketing or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed that the Alkermes 
Me
dical Monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and completeness of 
the study records and results. 
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_721673].

19.1. Data Capture 
As stated in Section  17.1, this study will use e CRF s for capturing data. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_12556]. All data 
entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The electronic 
data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
A paper copy of all laboratory reports will remain with the source documents at the study site. 
All electronic source data collected outside of the e CRF, such as e-diaries, and central 
labor
atory, central ECG, or central MRI data, will be transferred directly to electronic data 
capture or directly to Alkermes for incorporation into the final datasets. All out-of-range 
labor
atory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and will be recorded as such on 
the e CRFs.  
Adverse events will be coded using Med DRA. Concomitant medications will be categorized 
using the WHO-ATC classification system. 
19.2. Inspection of Records 
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow 
the Alkermes Medical Monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to stud y 
conduct. 
19.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of all essential clinical study documents shall be governed by [CONTACT_721674]’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory 
requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_985732]. These documents should 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_721675] A. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/ 
institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
Subjects’ medical files should be retained in accordance with the applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution, or private 
practice.

To prevent functional unblinding due to the known differential influence on prolactin levels 
be
tween aripi[INVESTIGATOR_721642], postbaseline prolactin levels will be blinded to 
Investigators and study site staff, Alkermes, and  (with the exception of the 
designated unblinded Medical Monitor).  
The unblinded Medical Monitor will remain blinded to treatment assignment, but will receive 
and monitor prolactin levels for all subjects throughout the study. The unblinded Medical 
Monitor will contact [CONTACT_721678]-defined gender- specific threshold alerts are 
triggered (see below) to determine if the alert value is clinically significant in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].   
Alert Thresholds: 
 Males: >100 ng/mL 
 F emales: >150 ng/mL 
The alert threshold may be re-evaluated when 50% of subjects have been randomized. Any 
update to the alert thresholds will not require a protocol amendment, but will be addressed via an 
administrative change memo. 
Investigators may request postbaseline prolactin levels from the unblinded Medical Monitor at 
their clinical discretion (eg, if a subject has clinical symptoms that may be related to 
hyperprolactinemia). 
Treatment assignments and prolactin levels will be shared with the Investigator at study end 
when unblinded.

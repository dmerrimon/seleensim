COVID-19 has now infected over 33 million people in the [LOCATION_002] and 109 
approximately 185 million worldwide.1,2 Of those, an estimated 85% have reported either [ADDRESS_219455]-herpetic neuralg ia. Gabapentin works 124 
mainly on voltage-gated calcium c hannels (VGCC) with an ability  to cross the basement 125 
membrane, a trait important f or an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]. The α2δ2 subunit of  VGCCs, with 126

the efficacy of gabapentin for olfactory dysfunction (anosmia, hyposmia, parosmia) in [ADDRESS_219456]-COVID-19 patients.  132 
A2 Primary Hypothesis 133 
We hypothesize that oral gabapentin will be more effective than  placebo for COVID-19- 134

 5B1 Prior Literature and Studies 142 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, has infected an estimated 78 million in t he [LOCATION_002] with 143 
~85% of patients reporting some form of olfactory dysfunction.1,[ADDRESS_219457] em, has another role as 154

The  postsynaptic α2δ1 183 
subunit promotes spi[INVESTIGATOR_185848], t he development of neuronal dend ritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], while the 184 
α2δ2 works as a suppressor of axonal regeneration.13 Gabapentin functions as an inhibitor 185 
of the α 2δ2 subunit and therefore blocks  the suppression of axonal regen eration leading to 186 
increased neuronal regeneration and function. The medication is  effective in the treatment 187

nervous system (CNS) and i ad in neuron regeneration.[ADDRESS_219462]-COVID-19 in fection.  193 
 194 
B2 Rationale for this Study 195 
Olfactory dysfunction is a major symptom of SARS-CoV-2 affectin g up to 80% of [ADDRESS_219463] will evaluate the efficacy of oral 200 
gabapentin to improve chronic (> 3 months) olfactory dysfunction  secondary to COVID- [ADDRESS_219464] tw o weeks serving as a taper-dow n period. 211 
C2 Secondary Aim 212 
Describe the adverse effects of  gabapentin. All participants wi ll be monitored for adverse 213 
effects throughout the study.   214 
C3 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures 215 
 216 
Primary Outcome:  217 
Clinical Global Impressi on of Improvement Scale  (CGI-I ). The response rate is 218 
defined as the number of partici pants self-report ing minimal ch ange or larger on 219 
the Clinical Global Impressi on of Improvement Scale  (CGI-I ) scale, divided by 220 
the number of participants i n each group. The CGI-Improvement is a self- 221 
reported scale of improvement ranging from 1  to 7 (1 is Very Much Improved, 7 222 
is Very Much Worsened) and will  be measured after completing [ADDRESS_219465]-tolerable dose. Eac h rating is well defined to m aximize accuracy. 224 
Participants reporting 3 as Minimally Improved , 2 as Much Improved , or 1 as Very 225 
Much Improved  in the CGI-I will be deemed responders to treatment, and the 226 
number of responders to non-respon ders will be compared between  the two arms  - 227 
CGI-Severity (CGI-S) a nd CGI-Improvement (CGI-I).  228

Secondary Outcomes:  231 
1. CGI-Severity. The CGI-Severity  scale ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 is normal 232 
function and 7 is complete anosmia. This assessment will provid e subjective data 233 
on patients’ baseline olfactory f unction prior to beginning the  trial, after 8-week [ADDRESS_219466]  (UPSIT ).[ADDRESS_219467] below a four-alternative multiple-cho ice question. For a 240 
given item, the patient releas es an odor by [CONTACT_185858] 241 
with a pencil tip, smells the  pad, and indicates the odor quali ty from four 242 
alternatives. Even if no smell is  perceived, a response is requ ired (i.e., the test is 243 
forced-choice).  The subject's tot al correct score out of the 4 0 items is 244 
determined.16 245 
The total UPSIT score can ra nge from 0 to 40 and scores are int erpreted as the 246 
level of absolute smell func tion (i.e., normosmia, mild hyposmi a, moderate 247 
hyposmia, severe hyposmia, and anosmia), using the age- and sex -related 248 
normative classification system de scribed in the UPSIT manual ( Table 1) The 249 
minimal clinically important d ifference in UPSIT score is 4.  250 
 251 
4. Olfactory Dysfunction Outcomes Rating  (ODOR ). The ODOR  questionnaire is a [ADDRESS_219468]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_185849] 259 
colleagues in the Clinical Out comes Research Office. The NASAL-7 , contains 7 260 
household items with each item scored as 0 for ‘ Cannot Smell’ , 1 for ‘ Smells Less 261 
Strong/Different Than Normal ’, and 2 for ‘ Smells Normal’ , for a total possible 262 
score ranging from 0-14.  The fo llowing four categories of olfa ctory function 263 
were defined based on NASAL-7 score: anosmia  (score 0-4), severe dysfunction  264 
(score 5-7), mild dysfunction  (score 8-10), and normosmia  (score 11-14).  265 
6. Clinical Global Impression-Sever ity Scale for Parosmics (CGI-P ). The CGI-P  266 
Scale is a global rating of paro smia and the single global rati ng ranges from 1-5, 267 
where 1 is No Distortion , 2 is Mild Distortion , 3 is Moderate Distortion , 4 is 268 
Mostly Distorted , and 5 is Complete Distortion . The response on the CGI-P  will 269

associated with neuropathic pain.  293 
 294 
The medication has also proven eff ective in treated chronic pai n from Burning Mouth 295 
Syndrome (BMS) since gabapenti n is highly lipophilic and can en ter the central nervous 296 
system (CNS).[ADDRESS_219472]-COVID-19 olfactory dysfuncti on caused by [CONTACT_185860].  Gabapentin can 298 
penetrate the blood-br ain barrier and enter the CNS where it ca n aid in neuron 299

Subjective Tinnitus” (IRB #02-0717) 303 
Following randomization, participants in the gabapentin arm wil l take gradually titrated 304 
dosages in order to achieve a  dose of 3600mg/d or highest toler able dose. The titration 305 
schedule will span a maximum 4 weeks to reach 3600mg/d.  306 
 Week 1, 900 mg/d 307

 9Gabapentin (300 mg per capsule) and placebo will be supplied to  patients in 312 
identical opaque capsules in bli nded fashion. The medications w ill be distributed in 4 313 
separate vials representing eac h of the four weeks of the Titra tion Period.  All 314 
participants will be provided an e qual number of capsules and i nstructed to follow a TID 315 
(i.e., 3 times per day) dosing sch edule.  All participants’ dos ages will be titrated to a 316 
maximum dose of 3600 mg/d, regardle ss of any possible beneficia l effect achieved at 317 
lower dosages. If intolerable a dverse reactions occur, the dosa ge will be decreased to 318 
previous tolerable dose (e.g. i f 2700mg/d is intolerable, dosag e will be decreased to 1800 319 
mg/d). If, during the first w eek, 900 mg/d is intolerable, dosi ng will be decreased by 300 320 
mg/d per day until tolerable (i.e., 600 mg/d, 300mg/d) or until  they are no longer taking [ADDRESS_219474]-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. 330 
 331 
The potential risk to participan ts during the study is an adver se event associated with the 332 
medication use. Abrupt cessation of  gabapentin may alter the se izure threshold; for this [ADDRESS_219475] ained in full via Zoom call, pho ne call if necessary. 349

2.b Ethical Considerations  389 
This study relies on participati on of human subjects. Informed consent will be 390 
obtained from each participant to e nsure their safety, minimize  risk, and ensure full 391 
confidentiality. All assessment s will be conducted virtually vi a HIPAA-compliant online 392 
surveys at baseline and then t hroughout the study course. Selec tion of participants for the 393 
study will consider the variabil ity in response to COVID-19 as well as response to 394 
gabapentin by [CONTACT_185861] o groups are matched 1:[ADDRESS_219478]. Louis ENT Club, and otolaryngologists whose practices are within 403 
150 miles of Washington Universit y Medical Center (WUMC). Direc t recruitment of 404 
potential participants will als o be achieved through use of the  Washington University 405 
Volunteers for Health Research P articipant Registry, and the Ot olaryngology Research 406 
Participant Registry. This recr uitment strategy has been succes sful for two current trials 407 
of treatment for COVID-asso ciated anosmia VOLT (IRB ID# 2020110 46) and SCENT2 408 
(IRB ID# 202101190). We may also attemp t to recruit potential p articipants from past 409 
studies in our lab, such as t he CODS trial (IRB ID# 202004146).  Additionally, due to the [ADDRESS_219479]-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.  424 
 425 
The potential risk to participan ts during the study is an adver se event associated with the 426 
medication use. Abrupt cessation of  gabapentin may alter the se izure threshold; for this 427 
reason, participants will be provided with a taper schedule spe cific to the gabapentin dose 428 
at time of cessation. Gabapenti n has a slight risk of dependenc e in individuals with 429 
previous history of alcohol, coc aine, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_185850] 430 
from the study. 17 431 
 432 
The consent process informs a volunteer about the study, indica tes that participation is 433 
voluntary, and that he/she has the right to stop at any time. R isks are listed in the [ADDRESS_219480]-lin e therapy for diabetic 463

calcium channels ( VGCCs), which play an important  role in neuronal synaptic [ADDRESS_219481] been 466 
associated with neuropathic pain.  467 
3.b Treatment Regimen  468 
During the titration period of max imum 4 weeks, participants ra ndomized to 469 
the gabapentin arm will take gradually titrated dosages of gaba pentin as follows:  470 
 Week 1, 900 mg/d (300 mg TID) 471 
 Week 2, 1800 mg/d (600 mg TID) 472 
 Week 3, 2700 mg/d (900 mg TID) 473 
 Week 4, 3600 mg/d (1200 mg TID) 474 
 475 
If intolerable effects occur, dosage will be decreased by 1 dos e (300 mg) step (e.g. if 476 
2700 mg/d is intolerable, dosag e will be decreased to 2400 mg/d ).  Further de-escalation [ADDRESS_219482] tolerable 478 
dose established during the Titra tion Period will be maintained  throughout the 8-week 479 
Fixed-Dose period.   480 
3.c Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  481 
The participants will be divid ed using permuted block randomiza tion in a 1:1 allocation 482 
between two arms: the oral gaba pentin group and the oral lactos e placebo group with 20 483 
persons in each group. 484 
3.d Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  485 
Gabapentin (300 mg per capsule) and placebo will be supplied to  patients in identical [ADDRESS_219483] Compliance Monitoring  490 
There will be check-ins with the  study participants every two w eeks conducted virtually 491 
through the participant’s prefe rred communicatio n method (i.e. phone call or video call) 492 
to answer questions and ensure pa rticipants are adhering to med ication schedule. Subjects 493 
will be asked to keep a paper cal endar for daily notes of pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], side/adverse effects, [ADDRESS_219484] ribution to the participants via  FedEx.   508 
3.h Blinding of Study Drug  509 
Participants will be divided into two groups; one group will be  given oral gabapentin [ADDRESS_219485] contact[CONTACT_185862] f or which recruitment has 525 
ended will asked to complete an online screening questionnaire (survey titled: 526 
“ScreeningSurvey”) to ensure he  or she meets all the inclusion criteria and does not meet [ADDRESS_219486] (UPSIT).  Once received, the 529 
participant will complete the UPSIT and provide their response virtually through the 530 
REDCap survey.  Once eligibil ity is confirmed based on UPSIT sc ore, participants will 531 
be provided through REDCap an online consent form to review and  complete. The RA 532 
will offer each participant the  option to review the consent fo rm independently or with 533 
the RA via zoom or phone call (zoom as the preferred option). O nce the participant 534 
electronically signs the consent form, the RA will review it an d sign.  The REDCap 535 
software will automatically ema il the particip ant a copy of the ir completed form. 536 
F2 Schedule of Measurements 537 
Following the recruitment period and successful enrollment, bas eline survey completion 538

REDCap. Participants will be able to get in touch with a member  of the study team 24/[ADDRESS_219499] will be contact[CONTACT_185864] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a member of the study  team.  The participant 675 
will receive appropriate care and will be removed from the tria l. A description of the 676 
event will be included in the rep ort of adverse events for the clinical study. 677 
 678 
3.b Definitions of Adverse Events 679 
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associ ated with the use of a 680 
drug in humans, whether or not cons idered drug related (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 681 
 682 
An adverse event (also referred t o as an adverse experience) ca n be any unfavorable and 683 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom , or disease temporarily 684 
associated with the use of a  drug, without any judgment about c ausality or relationship to 685 
the drug. 686 
 687 
An adverse event can arise fro m any use of the drug (e.g., off- label use, use in 688 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administra tion, formulation, or 689 
dose, including an overdose. 690 
 691 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are  special cases of an adverse e vent where adverse 692 
outcomes are severe. SAEs include the following events: 693 
 694 
• Death of any of the participants a ssociated with a clinical tri al. 695 
• An event which can lead to life- threatening complications or pu t the life of 696 
participants at risk as a resu lt of participation in a clinical  trial. 697 
   
   
_______________________________________________________________ _______________________ 
 19• Events that result in such a c ondition where the participants m ay require 698 
immediate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185852]. 699 
• Any events that lead to a perma nent or temporary physical disab ility in the body 700 
of the participants. Any sort of i ncapacity is also regarded as  SAE. 701 
• Any events that lead to any type of congenital abnormalities. I t also includes any 702 
cases of birth defects resulting f rom the clinical trials. 703 
• Any events where an investigator  or team of investigators finds  feel that it can 704 
lead to significant hazards. 705 
 706 
Classification of Events 707 
 708 
i Relationship 709 
An AE or SAE may or may not be causally related to the study in tervention. A causal 710 
relationship means that the int ervention caused (or is reasonab ly likely to have caused) 711 
the AE. This usually implies a re lationship in time between the  intervention and the AE 712 
(e.g., the AE occurred shortly after the participant received t he intervention).  For all 713 
AEs, it is the responsibility of t he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_185853] 714 
patient to determine the relatedness of the event to the study intervention. 715 
 716 
ii Severity 717 
Severity refers to the intensit y of a specific event and is a m atter of individual clinical 718 
judgment.  719 
• Grade 1:  Asymptomatic or mild s ymptoms; clinical or diagnostic  observations 720 
only; no intervention indicated 721 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, lo cal or noninvasive intervention i ndicated; limiting 722 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of da ily living (ADL) 723 
• Grade 3: Severe; or medically s ignificant but not immediately l ife- threatening; 724 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185854]; d isabling; limiting 725 
self-care ADL 726 
• Grade 4: Life-threatening; ur gent intervention indicated. 727 
• Grade 5: Death related to an AE 728 
 729 
iii Expectedness 730 
 731 
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered "u nexpected" if it is not 732 
consistent with the risk infor mation described in this protocol  or on the informed consent 733 
or is not listed at the specific ity or severity that has been o bserved; or, if an investigator 734 
brochure is not required or ava ilable, is not consistent with t he risk information described 735 
in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current  application, as amended. 736 
3.c Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events 737 
All adverse events and suspected  adverse reactions are collecte d from ‘source 738 
documentation’ and the research coordinator will abstract the e vents.  Documentation can [ADDRESS_219500] or family send o utside source 741 
documentation. 742 
 743 
3.d Reporting Procedures 744 
The Principal Investigator (P I) will be responsib le for ensurin g participants’ safety on a [ADDRESS_219501] (IRB) as required. [ADDRESS_219502] pr otections.  The primary con sideration in making 762 
these judgments is the need to t ake timely action to prevent av oidable harms to other 763 
subjects.   764 
 765 
F4 Study Outcome Measurements and Ascertainment 766 
Participants will complete an assessment of blind after complet ion of 4 weeks of 767 
the 8-week Fixed-Dose period usin g REDCap (survey titled: “Blin d Assessment”) 768 
 769 
Participants will also complete the following forms using REDCa p (survey titled 770 
“FixedDoseSurvey”) after comple ting the 8-week Fixed-Dose Perio d: 771 
 772 
1.) Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale  (CGI-S ). 773 
2.) Clinical Global Impression of  Improvement Scale (CGI-I)  774

 21Participants will also complete the following forms using REDCa p (survey titled 782 
FinalSurvey) 4 weeks after co mpleting the Taper Period. 783

estimates of the sample size for this study will be determined based on feasibility. For 797 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we plan to enro ll 60 subjects. The sample siz e of 60 subjects is feasible 798 
given the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Missouri and consideri ng a conservative 799 
estimate of a 10% rate of perman ent olfactory dysfunction among  those (~50%) who 800 
experience olfactory dysfunction a s one of the presenting sympt oms. Using a 33% drop [ADDRESS_219504] 802 
between the two treatment groups  will provide us with 40 evalua ble cases. A previous 803 
study exploring a different treat ment for COVID-19 related anos mia in our lab showed 804 
that 30% of the participants r andomized to placebo reported imp rovement at the end of 805 
the trial as compared to baseli ne.  We aim to observe a 25% dif ference in the response 806 
rate between gabapentin and placebo groups. Assuming that this will be the response rate 807 
in the placebo group of our trial, the sample size of 20 subjec ts per group will provide us 808 
with a 95% Confidence Interval  -5% to 55% around the desired pr oportion difference of 809 
25% between gabapentin and placebo groups.   [ADDRESS_219505] siz e of the primary outcome 819

group, the frequency and relative frequency of the participants ’ response to the global 821 
rating of smell change will be rep orted for each Likert categor y. Fisher’s exact test will 822 
be used for comparing the responde rs’ rates between the [ADDRESS_219506] sizes with 95% CIs w ill be reported for each 831

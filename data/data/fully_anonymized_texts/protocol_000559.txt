2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a  malignancy of immature granul ocytes or monocytes. 
Malignancy is characterized by [CONTACT_583271], an emia, and neutropenia. 
In the U.S., approximately 11,[ADDRESS_766761] all newly 
diagnosed cases, as well as deaths, will be in adults.

includes systemic combination chemotherapy to control bone marr ow and systemic 
disease. Treatment is generall y divided into an induction phase , to attain remission, and a 
maintenance phase. Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected to 
attain complete remission status following appropriate inductio n therapy. Remission rates 
in adult AML are inversely relate d to age, with an expected remission rate of >65% for 
those younger than [ADDRESS_766762] approach to the trea tment of these patients. Some examples are already in 
clinical practice (eg, the use of all-trans retinoic acid-based  t h e r a p y  f o r  p a t i e n t  w i t h  
PML/RARα rearrangements) and others are in development with great possibilities of 
2012-0060

  being approved in the near future (eg, FLT3 inhibitors, alone o r in combination with 
chemotherapy). However, there is urgent need for identification  of new therapeutic 
targets and agents that may be  used for these patients.  
 
 
2.1 Erlotinib  
 
Erlotinib, a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of tyr osine kinase activity 
associated with the HER1/EGFR, has demonstrated tumor growth in hibition both 
in vitro and in vivo. Erlotinib w as designed to target the sign aling pathway that 
mediates the effects of EGFR ac tivation on cell proliferation. 
 
Erlotinib [ADDRESS_766763]-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. 
These indications are based on results from the SATURN study, a  multicenter, 
double-blind, randomized phase 3 study that  demonstrated stati stically significant 
and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Two additional phase [ADDRESS_766764] been c ompleted in NSCLC 
patients: 
•  First-line treatment of NSCLC, concurrently administered in combination 
with carboplatin/paclitaxel (Study OSI2298g); this trial showed  no benefit 
of the addition of erlotinib to f irst-line chemotherapy for NSCLC. 
 •  First-line treatment of NSCLC, concurrently administered in combination 
with cisplatin/gemcitabine (Study BO16411); this trial showed n o benefit 
of the addition of erlotinib to f irst-line chemotherapy for NSCLC.

3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
 This will be a phase II, single-arm, open-label study.  
 
 All patients will receive therapy with erlotinib administered o rally as a continuous 
daily dose in 28-day cycles. Patients will continue therapy until clinically significant 
progression of the disease  or unacceptable toxicity.  
 
 The historical experience in this patient population is that re sponse with standard 
therapy, when available, is less than 1%. In many instances (eg , patients with 
myelodysplastic syndrome failing hypomethylating agents), no standard therapy is even available. Thus, an overall response rate of 20% will be c onsidered significant.  
 4.[ADDRESS_766772] be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_583272]/her designee prio r to enrollment of that 
patient. In addition, the patient must be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written informed consent  must be obtained from 
the patient prior to initiating treatment. The following criter ia apply to all patients 
enrolled onto the study unle ss otherwise specified.

 General: All patients should be registered in CORe.  
 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 10 of 28  
  5.2 Treatment Plan: Patients will receive erlotinib therapy according to the 
suggested guidelines below. Individual minor variations in the initiation of 
therapy, are acceptable as indicated by [CONTACT_583273] p hysician judgment.  
These variations should be documen ted in the patient’s medical record.  
5.2.1 Therapy :  Patients will receive erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg orally, once 
daily in 28-day cycles. 
5.2.2 Dose Adjustments : Dose adjustments will be done as described below 
using the following dose-levels: 
 
Dose Level* Erlotinib daily dose 
0 150 mg 
-1 100 mg 
-2 50 mg 
* Dose escalations/reductions di fferent than those described in this tab le

6.[ADDRESS_766775] of the patient.  The reason for the variation sho uld be documented in 
the patient’s medical record. After this time, treatment interr uptions and dose 
adjustments may be considered on an individual basis. The follo wing guidelines 
can be used to consider treatment: 
 6.1.1 Patients with neutropenia or thr ombocytopenia as a consequence of the 
disease do not require treatment interruptions for myelosuppres sion. Dose-
reductions in these patients shou ld be considered in an individ ual case and 
discussed with the PI. The following guidelines can be used for  these 
patients:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients with a response and pre-cycle counts of neutrophils >1x10
9/L and platelets >50 x109/L who have sustained low 
counts of neutrophils <0.5 x109/L or a platelet count <20 x 
x109/L (eg, for more than 5 consecutive days) may have 
treatment interrupted. Upon recovery of counts to neutrophils >1x10
9/L and platelets to >50 x109/L treatment may be re-started 
with a 1 dose level reduction.  A  reduction of 2 dose levels ma y

  be considered if the myelosuppression was deemed severe and 
life threatening by [CONTACT_1963], and if it is in the  
patient's best interest. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] If there are persistent peripheral blood blasts, or the bone ma rrow 
shows >5% blasts, may continue treatment regardless of neutrophil and platelet count a nd give supportive care as neede d.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] If no marrow evidence of leukemia, may hold therapy until recovery of granulocytes to ≥1 x10

antidiarrheal.  See Section 6.3 for treatment details. 
Grade 3b or 4b a) Interrupt erlotinib until resolu tion to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_766777] art 1 
dose level lower. If the event does not resolve to grade 2 within 
14 days, erlotinib will be discontinued.  
Rash 
Grade 1 None 
Grade 2 None.  Initiate treatment as outlined in Section 6.3.   If rash persists 
and is intolerable or worsens over 10 – 14 days, then reduce by  1 
dose level.  
Grade 3b Reduce by 1 dose level.  If rash persists or worsens over 10 – 14 
days, then interrupt erlotinib u ntil resolution to ≤ grade 2 and then 
restart 1 dose level lower. If the event does not resolve to grade 2 
within 14 days, erlotinib  will be discontinued. 
Grade 4 Permanently discontinue erlotinib. 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Any Grade If ILD possibly related to study  drug is suspected, erlotinib s hould be 
interrupted immediately  pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is diagnosed, erlotinib should 
be discontinued permanently and appropriate treatment institute d as 
necessary.

toxicity may only be re-escalated to the previous dose level (ie, dose level at first reduction) 
and only if the toxicity abates or returns to baseline severity  and the investigator believes it is 
in the best interest of the patient.  Doses that have been redu ced 2 or more dose levels for 
toxicity may not be re-escalated to the starting dose level (or  dose-escalated dose for tobacco 
smokers).  Any patient who fails to tolerate treatment at 50 mg /day will be discontinued from 
the study. 
b) If not responding to optimal treatment within 48 hrs. 
c) Only if  2 grade level change from baseline 
 
6.3 Suggested Management of Toxicity: The following guidelines are offered as 
suggestions for the management of toxicity. Variations of these  are acceptable 
based on the patient’s individual circumstances and physician p reference.   
 If a patient experiences several toxicities, dose adjustments a re to be made based 
on the greatest degree of toxicity (ie, reducing the dose to th e lowest level).  If 
significant toxicity is still apparent, the dose may be reduced  a second time.  Any 
patient who fails to tolerate treatment of 50 mg/day will be withdrawn from the study.   
 
Antidiarrheal and antirash medications may be introduced at any  time if clinically 
indicated. Previous phase [ADDRESS_766780] es of suitable 
emollient creams include:  Neutrogena
® Norwegian formula, SARNA® Ultra, 
Vanicream™, Aveeno® (fragrance-free formulation), and Eucerin® cream.  Other 
over-the-counter aqueous creams or emulsifying ointments may al so provide 
symptomatic benefit.  Lotions are not recommended because they often contain 
alcohol, which may dry the skin.  Patients may also be encourag ed to use a 
titanium dioxide or zinc oxide-based sunscreen product applied to sun-exposed 
areas twice per day.  
2012-[ADDRESS_766781] the dose of erlotinib interrupted or re duced.  See Annex 
5 for more information on skin toxicity management. 
 
Minocycline may interfere with a nticoagulants and oral contrace ptives.  Patients 
treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants and/or o ral contraceptives 
should be monitored accordingly. 
 There have been infrequent repor ts of serious ILD, including fa tal events, in 
patients receiving erlotinib for t he treatment of NSCLC and oth er advanced solid 
tumors.  In the event of acute onset of new or progressive, unexplained pulmonary 
symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, where ILD is suspec ted, study drug 
should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is  diagnosed, study 
drug should be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as necessary.  Treatment with erlotinib should be used with extra caution in p atients with total 
bilirubin > [ADDRESS_766782]. Patients with hepatic impairment (total bi lirubin > ULN or 
Child-Pugh A, B and C) should be closely monitored during thera py with 
erlotinib.    
Gastrointestinal perforation (including fatalities) has been re ported in patients 
receiving erlotinib.  Patients receiving concomitant anti-angio genic agents, 
corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior 
history of peptic ulceration ordi verticular disease are at incr eased risk.  
Permanently discontinue erlotinib in patients who develop gastr ointestinal 
perforation.  
 
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_47423], which 
in some cases were fatal.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib t reatment if the patient 
develops severe bullous, bliste ring, or exfoliating conditions.    
 Ocular Disorders, including corn eal perforation or ulceration h ave been reported 
during use of erlotinib.  Other  ocular disorders including abno rmal eyelash 
growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis have been obser ved with erlotinib 
treatment and are known risk factors for corneal ulceration/perforation.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib therapy if patients present with acute /worsening ocular 
disorders such as unexplained eye pain.  
2012-[ADDRESS_766783] experienced no grade ≥3 erlotinib-related toxicity. D ose escalation may 
be done by [CONTACT_128657] a time and dose escalations should  not be done more 
often than every 28 days. Patients may not escalate to a dose l evel they received 
earlier where the patient experienced grade 4 toxicity.  
 
6.5 Supportive Care Guidelines 
  
Supportive measures including er ythropoietin, analgesics, blood  transfusions, 
antimicrobials, and hematopoie tic colony stimulating factors for treatment of 
cytopenias are permitted.   
 Prophylactic use of  hematopoietic colony stimulating factors is not permitted.  
 Other chemotherapy, investigational cytotoxic agents, radiation, or biologic therapy is prohibited while the patient is on study with the fo llowing exceptions 
during cycle 1: During the firs t [ADDRESS_766784] and/or platelet counts and hydroxyurea is 
allowed for a maximum of the f irst [ADDRESS_766785].

  Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fun damental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may  be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not bee n administered, 1) 
the event would not have happene d at all, 2) the event would ha ve occurred later 
than it actually did, or 3) the e vent would have been less severe. 
  The Investigator or physician de signee is responsible for verifying and providing 
source documentation for all a dverse events and assigning the a ttribution for each 
event for all subjects  enrolled on the trial. 
 10.2 Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the CTC AE version 4.[ADDRESS_766796].  Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol.  Adverse events and protocol specific d ata will be entered 
into PDMS/CORe.  Expected event s during leukemia therapy are:

10.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “s erious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in a ny of the following 
outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experi ence that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at imm ediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not i nclude an 
adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form,  might have 
caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005] 
 A persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse dru g experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopard ize the patient 
or subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical ev ents include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inp atient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 Important medical events as def ined above, may also be consider ed serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], 
IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeti ng the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for In vestigators 
on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices ”. Unless 
stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5  working days of 
knowledge of the event). 
 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 21 of 28  
   All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the 
study drug, must have a writt en report submitted within 24 hours  (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Ma nager in the 
IND Office.  
 
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill be 
utilized for safety reporting t o the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the fi rst protocol-
specific intervention,  until [ADDRESS_766797] returne d to baseline, 
progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acce ptable resolution 
of the event.  
 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_766798] be reported  t o  t h e  I N D  
Office. This may include the deve lopment of a secondary maligna ncy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_270506] (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_583264], 
Good Clinical Practices, the prot ocol guidelines, the sponsor’s  guidelines, 
and Institutional Review Board policy.  Investigator Communication with Supporting Company: 
 
Serious adverse event will be reported by [CONTACT_583277] 
(Fax number: [PHONE_3295]). Information not available at the time of the initial 
report (e.g., an end date for the  adverse event or laboratory v alues received after 
the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583265] (previously described) will not have an expedited report but it will be included in the annual report via the SAE  log. 
 
Pregnancies: Any pregnancy that occurs durin g study participation or within 4 
weeks of the patient’s last study drug administration should be reported using the 
MD Anderson SAE Form. To ensure patient safety each pregnancy m ust also be 
reported to OSI and the IND Of fice within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
 
2012-0060

Page 22 of 28  
  The Investigator will follow the pregnant female until completi on of the 
pregnancy.  The Investigator will provide this information as a  follow-up to the 
initial SAE. 
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detec ted in an aborted 
fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or cong enital anomaly), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for Expedited Reporti ng of SAEs. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_766799] therapy, 
when available, is less than 1%. In many instances (eg, patient s with myelodysplastic 
syndrome failing hypomethylating agents), no standard therapy i s even available. Thus, 
an overall response rate of 20% will be considered significant.   For the purpose of this 
analysis, a response will be cons idered if occurring after 3 mo nths of therapy (or earlier).  
 The Simon’s optimal two-stage design will be used to implement the study. A total of 29 
patients will be enrolled to thi s study. These sample sizes are  based on Simon’s optimal 
2-stage designs of alpha=0.05 with power of 95% (beta=0.05) to test the null hypothesis 
that the ORR will be ≤ 1%  versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR will be ≥ 20. At the first stage, [ADDRESS_766800] 2 responses 
achieved after the completion of the 2nd stage, the study will conclude that the treatment 
improves the response rate from 1% to 20%.  The probability of early termination under the null hypothesis is 87%. The probability of seeing at least 2 responses under the null 
(ORR = 1%) is 3% while the probability of seeing at least 2 wit h an event rate of 20% is 
94.8%.  Further enrollment will continue during the interim analysis un less no responders 
(CR+PR+HI) have been reported by  [CONTACT_583278] 14th subject being 
analyzed. In this event, enrollment will be suspended and these  [ADDRESS_766801] been fully assessed, the trial will be terminated  for futility. 
 
11.1  Safety Monitoring 
 
Toxicities will be monitored using the method of Thall, Simon, and Estey [1]. 
Toxicity is defined as clinically significant, non-hematologic grade [ADDRESS_766802] possibly 
2012-0060 
September 19, 2013 
Page 23 of 28  
  related to erlotinib to be lower than 30% during the 1st 28 day s. Using this 
information a non-informative flat prior distribution of Beta (0.6, 1.4) was chosen 
for the new combination treatment. 
 
The interim monitoring will be first conducted after the first [ADDRESS_766803] been 
evaluated and then be repeated  continuously. The monitoring rul e for toxicity is 
Pr(E, Tox > 0.3 | data) > 0.90,  where E, Tox is the proportion of any grade [ADDRESS_766804] pos sibly related to 
erlotinib. That is, the trial will be terminated if at any time  during the study there 
is a more than 90% chance that the average rate of grade 3 or 4  non-hematologic 
adverse events is more than 30%.   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239], based on these assumptions and monitoring conditions are shown in Table 1. For example, accrual will be stopped if [ADDRESS_766805] 13 patients. 
 
Table 1:  Stop accrual if the number of grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adve rse 
events is equal to or greater than indicated (i.e., # Grade 3 o r 4 toxicity) among 
the number of patients accr ued (i.e., # Patients) 
 
# Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

11.2 Statistical Analysis 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response (ORR) as assessed by 
[CONTACT_583279] s ection 9.3. The overall response rate (ORR) will be 
calculated for Using the intent-t o - t r e a t  ( I T T )  d a t a .  T h e  c o r r e s ponding 95% 
confidence interval will be derived.   Safety summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables  and listings. The 
frequency (number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs wil l be reported. 
2012-[ADDRESS_766806] demographics (including age, sex, and race/ethnicity) a nd other baseline 
characteristics (including ECOG performance status, disease bur den, and number 
of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be summ arized. Summary statistics will  include: means, 
standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables.  For secondary endpoints, descriptive statistics will be used to  s u m m a r i z e  t h e  
expression of biomarkers and the concentrations of plasma erlot inib.  The 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the expressions of biomarkers and concentrations of plasma erlotinib between patients with an d without 
response.

  Appendix  A:  Pharmacodynamic Investigations During Erlotinib O ral Therapy in Patients 
with AML Who Have Failed Prior Therapy.  
 
The major objectives of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  investigations during this 
clinical trial are as follows:  
1. To unveil which one or all three distinct biologic processes ar e blocked by [CONTACT_583281], irreve rsible cell cycle blockade or  terminal differentiation in 
AML
1. 
2. To determine the molecular mechanism involved in erlotinib indu ced off-target effect on 
numerous cell-cycle proteins and onco-proteins2. 
3. To determine the effect of erlotinib on Syk (a non-receptor tyr osine kinase) inhibition3, a 
recently identified novel target of AML.  
4. To relate plasma pharmacokinetic and cellular pharmacodynamic e ndpoints and to seek 
correlations between these measurements and response to therapy .  
 Only patients entering at MD Anderson Cancer Center will be stu died.  All patients with ≥5,000 
WBC/l of peripheral blood will be requested to participate in the c ellular pharmacodynamic 
studies. Patients will sign consen t forms to enter these invest igations.   
 Once a patient has consented to participate in the investigatio n, please contact [CONTACT_583282] 
(pager [PHONE_12076]) in The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology ([CONTACT_18134], phone, [PHONE_12077]) to coordinate scheduling of blood samples.   To facilitate preparedness for 
laboratory studies, please plan on initiating therapy in the subsequent morning if the clinical situation allows and please inform us as soon as there is a pos sibility of patient entering the 
clinical trial.      
Blood samples will be collected at the following times during C ycle 1.**   
 
1. 0 (Pre-dose) 
2. [ADDRESS_766808] . Gandhi’s laboratory in the Tan 
zone (T6.3932).   The blood will  be centrifuged and plasma will  be separated, transferred to 
storage tubes and immediately fr ozen, and stored until analysis.  After removal of plasma, the 
blood cells will be resuspended in  PBS and CLL lymphocytes will  be isolated by [CONTACT_138789]-Hypaque 
density-gradient centrifugation pr ocedures.  Cells will be used  for the following laboratory 
endpoints.    **Every effort will be made to collect all samples at all time points for all patients; however, 
missing collection in one or more of these time points in occasional patients will not be considered a protocol de viation/violation.

NOTE:  We may not be able to do all studies in every patient.  This will be decided based on 
diagnosis and number of leukemia cells recovered from the perip heral blood sample.   
 Plasma pharmacokinetics:  Plasma will be separated from the per ipheral blood samples and 
analyzed by a reference laborat ory for concentration of erlotin ib.   
 Cell death assay:  The leukemic blast cells before and during erlotinib therapy (1 x 10
6 cells) 
from real-time will be stained with Annexin V-FITC and propi[INVESTIGATOR_583268]/flow cytometry machin e

 Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization assay:  The leuke mic blast cells before and 
during erlotinib therapy (1 x 106 cells) obtained in real-time will be stained with DIOC6 and 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_583269]/flow cytometry machine
2.   
 Assessment of differentiation: Because preclinical studies illu strated either/or effect of apoptosis 
or differentiation caused by [CONTACT_583283], we wi ll determine if erlotinib can 
overcome the block of differen tiation during erlotinib therapy1,2. The leukemic blasts before and 
during erlotinib therapy (1 x 106 cells) obtained in real-time will be washed and stained with P E-
conjugated anti-CD11b antibody (myelomonocytic marker from Bect on Dickinson; clone 
ICRF44) and Isotypic mouse IgG1 (Becton Dickinson) to measure CD11b positive cells using flow cytometry.  Measurement of cell cy cle blockade: Phospho-proteome analysis r evealed that off target effect of 
erlotinib can influence the phosp horylation status of numerous proteins including the 
retinoblastoma (Rb) protein whic h is critical for G1/S transition of the cell cycle1. Therefore, we 
plan to measure the total and phospho-Rb (Ser-807/811) before a nd during therapy using 
immunoblotting technique.   Measurement of JAK/STAT proteins: Erlotinib is known to induce apoptosis via inhibiting the 
phosphorylation of oncogenic JAK2 kinase on Tyr 1007/1008 in AM L cell lines, which 
otherwise would phosphorylate STAT-5 (Tyr-694), a transcription  factor and a direct target of 
JAK21.   T h e r e f o r e  o u r  p l a n  i s  t o  m e a s u r e  t h e  J A K [ADDRESS_766809]-
translational modification duri ng erlotinib therapy using immun oblotting experiments.  
 Measurement of NPM-1 and p14
ARF:  In AML cell lines, the anti-ne oplastic action of erlotinib 
was associated with redistribution of NPM-1 (nucleophosmin-1, a  myelomonocytic master 
regulator) and p14ARF (a tumor suppressor protein) from nucleus to the cytoplasm1.  So we will 
be measuring these two proteins  by [CONTACT_133374]-fluorescence method a nd immunoblotting 
experiments by [CONTACT_583284]-1 and p14ARF before and during 
erlotinib therapy.  Measurement of Syk and the downstream molecules: Two recent imp ortant findings, one, 
erlotinib has off-target effect on Syk tyrosine kinase and two,  inhibition of Syk protein induced 
cytotoxicity in AML - identified Syk as an AML target4,5. Therefore our plan is to monitor Syk 
2012-0060

  phosphorylation during therapy and the consequent modulation in  Syk-regulated pathways such 
as NFKB, PI3-K/AKT6,7, STAT-38, mTOR9 and MAPK/ERK pathways10.  In addition, inhibition 
of BCR-induced Syk activa tion down-regulates Mcl-111, so we will be evaluating the expression 
and functional role of all the a bove said proteins during erlot inib therapy.

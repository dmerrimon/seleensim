Version Date: [ADDRESS_507740] level randomization will assign participants to one of two groups – choice or no choice. The 
participants in choice will be able to choose  in which  program t hey wish to  participate 
(telerehabilitation or facility -based). Individuals in  the no choice group, will be randomized to 
either  the telerehabilitation or facility -based program. The research protocol and associated tools 
will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_402725]. The study will comply with best practices in human subjects’ research 
including following HIPAA guidelines and using strict informed consent procedures . Clinical 
reported outcome measures and patient reported outcome measures  will be administered at 
baseline, immediately post -intervention  (at 16 -weeks) , and at [ADDRESS_507741]. Deborah Backus is the principal investigator (PI) and [CONTACT_402759] is the co-Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_402713]-Investigators at six other research sites  and the 
iConquerMS outcomes data collaborative . Shepherd Center is the primary and coordinating site 
for all study activities under Dr . Backus, who is supported by [CONTACT_402726], Project Manager. 
University of Alabama  at Birmingham (UAB)  under the leadership of [CONTACT_402760] will oversee 
delivery of the training  program s, and under the direction of Dr . Gary Cutter will provide 
research design, statistical analysis and randomization expertise.   
This study will yield important data regarding the comparative impact of exercise programs on 
MS outcomes and provide information to people with MS, health providers, payers, exercise 
partners, and policy makers about how people with MS  who have ambulatory difficulties  can 
safely and effectively exercise.  
  
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 5 of 33 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often progressive disease of the central nervous system 
affecting over 400,[ADDRESS_507742] in both the 
[LOCATION_002]19 and Europe.20   
 
Although evidence suggests that exercise  can improve mobility and perhaps decrease the 
rate and extent of disability (i.e. impaired function) in people with MS , most studies related 
to exercise have failed to screen for people with walking problems using objective 
assessment .21-38 Evidence does show, however, that t raditional, facility -based exercise training, 
particularly in a setting where other people with MS are exercising o r under the supervision of 
exercise personnel , may help people with MS consistently participate in exercise or to exerci se at 
a higher, more intense level. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_402714], lack of access to these programs  may make it 
difficult to engage in a GEMS -S program.39-43 Telerehabilitation (telerehab) has great potential to 
overcome challenges associated with facility -based  programs . Telerehab  can include 
videoconferencing, remote monitoring of signs and activity, and dissemination of specialized and 
individualized information via electronic mechanisms. Both facility -based  and telerehab exercise 
training  have yielded positive results in people with MS ,21-[ADDRESS_507743] not been compared head -
to-head. The current study will fill this gap in the evidence base and c ompar e the outcomes of 
delivering the same exercise interventions in a facility ( facility -based exercise training or GEMS -
S) or in the hom e/community using a telerehab approach  (telerehab delivered exercise training or 
GEMS -T). The interventions are designed to be identical in content, with the only difference 
being the mode of training delivery .  
 
This study will yield  important data to inform people with MS  who have objective walking 
impairment , as well as healthcare providers, exercise trainers, payers,  and policy makers , about 
exercise options for people with MS . Our main hypothesi s is that there will be no difference in 
outcomes when the evidence -based individualized exercise program is delivered i n a facility 
(GEMS -S) or via telerehab ( GEMS -T) (i.e., walking and other outcomes will improve similarly 
between conditions). Our null hypothesis is that GEMS -T is inferior to GEMS -S. A secondary 
hypothesis is that patients who perform  their preferred  choice  of program (GEMS -T(Choice)  or 
GEMS -S(Choice) ) will have  better outcomes in self -efficacy, adherence , and adoption of 
exercise  than no choice conditions . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 6 of 33 SPECIFIC AIMS  
Our specific aims (SAs) are as follows :  
SA1:  Compare the extent of change  pre-test to post -test in walking and mobility outcomes, 
social and vocational participation, and quality of life  between the identical evidence -
based individualized exercise program delivered via GEMS -S or GEMS -T in adults with 
MS who have slowed walking ( greater  than 6 seconds on the T25FWT );  
SA2:  Evaluate and compare the effectiveness between participants randomized to their 
preferred delivery mode ( GEMS -T(Choice) or GEMS -S(Choice) ) and those who are not 
randomized to their preferred delivery mode ( GEMS -T or GEMS -S);  
SA3:  Evaluate changes in self -efficacy , and adoption of exercise between these groups 
(GEMS -T, GEMS -S, GEMS -T(Choice), GEMS -S(Choice)).   
 
RESEARCH METHODS  
 
Design   
 
This is  a multi -site, 2-staged randomized , choice design study aimed at noninferiority, to 
compare the effectiveness of delivering an individual ized exercise program in a facility (facility -
based exercise training or GEMS -S) versus via telerehabilitation (telerehab -based exercise 
training or GEMS -T) in people with MS.  Noninferiority assumes both interventions ( GEMS -S 
and GEMS -T) produce no statistically different outcomes .  
 
Shepherd Center is the Clinical Coordinating site, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Deborah Backus, and UAB is the 
Training Site, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rob Motl. UAB  will also house the Statistical Center , led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gary 
Cutter . The Data Management Center led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert McBurney will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_402727].  
 
This protocol will first outline site specific procedures and tools, and then will provide details 
regarding the coordination of the multiple study sites by [CONTACT_402728].  
 
Participants   
 
We will enroll 400 participants across the following eight  centers : The Shepherd Center , Atlanta, 
GA; the University of Georgia, Athens ; the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for MS Treatment 
and Research, Ohio; the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill ; [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011] (MGH); the University of Colorado; the University of Alabama, Birmingham 
(UAB) in collaboration with The Tanner Center  and Foundation for Neurological Diseases 
(Tanner Center) ; and Marquette University, Wisconsin . The criteria for eligibility will be 
identical at all sites. Participants will qualify for the study if they meet the following criteria:  
 
Inclusion criteria : 
1. Physician -confirmed diagnosis of MS  
2. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of  4.0 through  6.5  
3. Age between  18 and 65 years  
4. Able to  travel to a GEMS -S site for testing and training   
5. Accessible, t echnological platform for GEMS -T (i.e. computer  or DVD player and TV, 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 7 of 33 and telephone )  
6. A score of between [ADDRESS_507744] (T25FWT ) time of between 6 seconds and 3 minutes  
8. Medically stable or approval from physician to participate in exercise studies  
9. A score of between 3 and 6 (inclusive)  on the Patient Determined Disability Steps  
 
Exclusion criteria : 
1. Documented  MS relapse  in the past [ADDRESS_507745] three months  that the study investigator determines makes 
participation unsafe  
3. Unable to walk 25 feet  
4. Already exercises at recommended  levels as determined by a score of 25 or higher on the 
Godin Leisure -Time Exercise questionnaire  
5. Has other neurological (e.g., stroke) or musculoskeletal conditions  or other co -
morbidities  
6. Has cognitive difficulties  as determined by a Mini Mental S tatus Exam score <19  
7. Is not proficient in English  
8. Is physically unable to complete the second T25FWT trial  
9. Any other concern that the investigators deem would jeopardize the safety of the 
potential participant.  
 
We will randomize 200 participants to the Choice group and 200 to the No C hoice  group.  Those 
in the  Choice group will choose which exercise program to undertake  – GEMS -T or GEMS -S. In 
the No Choice  group , we will randomize 100 participants to GEMS -S and 100 to GEMS -T (see 
Figure 1).  Four sites (Shepherd Center  with help from UGA , Marquette University, Cleveland 
Clinic, and University of Colorado) will each recruit [ADDRESS_507746] 40 participants with help from 
the Tanner  Center, a Birmingham -based multidisciplinary center providing neurology, nursing, 
infusion, clinical research, neurodiagnostic testing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, 
speech/language pathology, licensed professional counseling, group wellness classes, and 
individual p ersonal training in one central location.

Version Date: [ADDRESS_507747] on site  (by 
[CONTACT_402729]) , or by [CONTACT_72683] -of-mouth  using a fl yer describing the 
research study and participation requirements . We will supplement this recruitment strategy as 
needed by [CONTACT_402730], iConquerMS, and other 
partners . We will also develop recruitment advertisements to be shared via social media, such as 
Facebook and Twitter  (see sample post in the Appendix) . 
 
UAB will collaborate with the Tanner  Center for recruitment purposes only.  The Tanner Center 
has a history of assisting UAB with participant recruitment efforts, including for PCORI trials.  A 
research coordinator at the Tanner  Center will conduct a chart review of their patients to identify 
potentially eligible STEP for MS participants. The research coordinator will only review charts 
for those patients who have consented to be contact[CONTACT_402731], which is noted o n 
their intake forms. The Tann er Center  will also use the recruitment strategies outlined above.  
 
After identifying potential participants, the Tanner  Center research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_402732], such as: do you currently 
exercise? Can you travel to UAB at Lakeshore to exercise twice a week  (in case they are 
randomized or desire the facility training, GEMS -S)? These prescreening questions will be 
logged in a securely stored spreadsheet and only used for the purposes of determining potential 
eligibility  for the STEP trial . If a potential ly eligible participant expresses interest in being  
screened, the Tanner Center research coordinator will send the potential participant a URL link 
to an online consent form hosted on REDCap. The consent form will ask the potential participant 
to authorize the Tanner Center to release their contact [CONTACT_402733], such as a diagnosis of MS and EDSS score, if available, to UAB.  Upon receipt of 
consent, the Tanner Center research  coordinator will send this PHI  via REDCap to the rese arch 
coordinator at UAB. REDCap is a  HIPAA -compliant, secure document transfer tool. The 
research coordinator at UAB will then conduct follow up and screening with the potential 
participant.  
 
Study Procedures  
Screening  and Enrollment  
The procedures outlined here will be utilized at each site. We anticipate screening approximately 
800 individuals to rea ch our sample size goal of 400. Each site’s  research coordinator will be 
responsible for all recruitment and enrollment of participants.  
 
An overview of procedures for each participant is provided in Figure 2 . Screening will occur in 
three  phases to determine eligibility.  
 
Screen 1  assess es basic criteria such as age, ability to travel to the site, relapse status, other 
comorbidities (see Table 1  for full set of criteria ). Screen [ADDRESS_507748] three months will be collected but will not automatically 
exclude a participant . The research coordinator will gather as much information as possible about 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 9 of 33 any falls and determine with the site investigator if the  potential participant is eligible to 
partic ipate.  
If the individual meets the basic criteria, t he research coordinator will read a consent script  (see 
telephone consent script in the appendix) requesting permission to perform and record the 
responses to three additional surveys  (Screen 2 ). The telephone consent script will describe the 
purpose of the assessments and how the data wi ll be used and securely stored.  The research 
coordinator will document  whether verbal consent is provided, or not. If an individual  declines to 
provide verbal telephone consent, the screening ends. If the individual provides verbal  telephone  
consent, the research coordinator will proceed to Screen 2.   
 
Screen 2  implements  the MS Walking Scale -12 (MSWS -12), the Patient Determined Disability 
Steps (PDDS) , and the Godin Leisure -Time assessments .  
If the individual passes Screens 1 and 2 and still wishes to be considered for enrollment in the 
study, the research coordinator will complete the  Exercise Preparticipation Health Screening 
questionnaire  (EPHS) to determine if the participant requires medical consent to participate . 
Once the  individual  obtain s medical clearance, they will notify the research coordinator who will  
schedule  them  for Visit [ADDRESS_507749] funds and 
personnel  time to perform the assessments.  
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 10 of 33  
Figure 2 : Study procedures for each participant  
Visit  1 will be conducted at the study site. At the beginning of this visit, the research coordinator 
will review  the informed consent process with the individual , providing additional detail and 
answering questions as necessary. If the individual agrees to continue with the process and  
provides informed consent  (see Appendix for informed consent form) , the individual will 
complete additional clinician administered  screening assessments  and questionnaires . 
Specifically, a  blinded, NeuroStatus certified  evaluator will perform the Expanded Disability 
Status Scale (EDSS) assessment . A trained blinded evaluator will  conduct  the Timed [ADDRESS_507750] ( T25FWT ) and the Six -Minute Walk Test (6MWT)  per the respective data collection 
protocols . If the participant is physically unable to perform the second T25FWT trial, they will 
not complete the 6MWT, but will complete the EDSS. If the participant has an EDSS score 
between 4.0 and 6.5 and can complete the T25FWT in 6 to 180 seconds, they will undergo a 
Mini -Mental Status Exam  (MMSE)  to determine if they have the cognitive abilities to safely 
participate in the intervention for this study. If they score at least a 19 or greater, they will be 
considered eligible for the study. If not, they will not be enrolled in the study.  
Enrollment   
After a participant is determined eligible to participate,  the research coordinator will input the 
results from the 6MWT and implement a final instrument - Short Assessment on Health Literacy 
(SAHL -E). The research coordinator will subsequently  enroll  the participant  in the study by 
[CONTACT_40397] a participant account in the Portal. The participant will then complete a demographic s 
and medical history  survey and additional baseline patient reported outcome (PRO) measures, 
including the Modified Fatigue Impact sc ale-21 (MFIS -21), the MSWS -12, the Neuro Quality of 
Life (Neuro -QOL) scale, and a social cognitive theory  (SCT)  battery of measures (see Tables 1 
and 2). Individuals will have the option of completing measures remotely at home , if necessary .

determined appropriate by [CONTACT_55794].   
 
Prescreening activities, such as chart review and preliminary phone calls with interested 
participants will continue. Interested people will be informed the study is on hold and they will 
be contact[CONTACT_402738].  
 
Transfer of participant to coach  
Once a participant is randomized to their intervention group (GEMS -T or GEMS -S), the research 
coordinator will provide the respective coach the contact [CONTACT_402739]. They 
will also provide the following information:  
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 13 of 33 • If the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_402715]  a fall risk  
• The participant’s EDSS score  
• Whether the participant uses an assistive device  
 
To convey this information to the GEMS -T for the GEMS -T participants, the research 
coordinators will send an encrypted email to a secure, HIPAA -compliant email address at UAB 
with this information. This information is to inform the coach of functional status of the 
participant so that they can modify exercises to prevent falls.  
Follow -Up Assessment Procedures  
Timing  of subsequent outcome asses sments are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_507756] -intervention (at 16 -weeks), and at [ADDRESS_507757] battery at  home via the study portal . The research 
staff will not influence the survey responses but provide technical support to enhance 
completeness and quality of data. Participants will complete the 8 -week  and 6 -month  PROs via 
the secure online study portal (described below) . 
COVID -19 Follow -up Assessment Procedures  
All enrolled participants will continue with their assessments on schedule. However, the type of 
assessments administered will differ from Table 1 while there are restrictions on accessing trial 
site facilities due to the pandemic. Specifically, no clinica lly reported outcomes (T25FWT, 
EDSS, 6MWT) will be administered. Research coordinators will verbally consent participants in 
waves [ADDRESS_507758] 10 onwards will 
sign the amended ICF that includes the PDDS as a follow up assessment measure at enrollment.  
 
Data Collection Procedures  
All study data will be collected and maintained in a database accessible through a secure, HIPAA 
compliant study portal, developed by [CONTACT_402740]. To maintain confidentiality, all data collected 
and input to the portal will be linked to individuals via an individual identifying number, as 
described below under “ Study p ortal security” (p18-19) and in the informed consent form.  The 
research coordinator will help each individual create a portal account at Visit [ADDRESS_507759] -intervention assessments (summarized in 
Table  1) are completed on time : 1) the research coordinator  will contact [CONTACT_4317] 2 weeks 
prior to when outcomes are required  via the participant’s  preferred mode of communication  (eg., 
email, text to smartphone or phone call ; 2) t he research coordinator will also  place a reminder 
communication as above  24-[ADDRESS_507760] appointment ; 3) the portal will also 
send electronic reminders to research coordinators and participants when assessments need to be 
complete d and when PROs are not fully completed ; and 4) the coaches will also remind  
participants during their scheduled coaching sessions about upcoming data collection dates .  
 
 
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_507761] Manager at the Clinical Coordinating Center 
(Shepherd Center) will be provided wi th a report regarding data  completeness and fidelity.  Thus, 
there are daily indicators of completeness and quality of data, as well as daily oversight and 
weekly opportunities to rectify problems with data collection, entry and flow. The Project 
Manager, along with the PI (Backus) will work with the research coordinator  at each site not 
only to obtain missing data  when possible, but also to devise an individualized plan at any site 
that is routinely missing data.  
 
6-Month Assessments : The 6 -month assessments were implemented after waves 1 through 4 
were consented and enrolled. The procedures for contact[CONTACT_402741]:  
• Waves [ADDRESS_507762] intervention

To assist with the study intent to treat analyses, the study will attempt to collect data from 
withdrawals. Research Coordinators will offer participants who withdraw three options:  
1) Early Termination Visit: Participants will return to the facility to complete a full set of 
CRO and PRO assessments (including the feedback survey) and subsequently their 
withdrawal will be processed. Participants receive the $25 travel stipend for the vis it. 
2) Continue with assessments only: Participants will cease the exercise program but 
continue with assessments on schedule and per protocol.  
3) Complete an immediate withdrawal: Participants withdraw immediately and fully from 
both the exercise program and assessments.  
 
Should a participant choose 1) or 2), they will sign a new consent form with information about 
participating in these withdrawal assessments  (ICF Withdrawal – Early Termination Visit or ICF 
Withdrawal – Assessments Only) .  
 
INTERVENTION  
There are two modes of delivering the evidence -based , individualized exercise program: Facility -
based exercise training ( GEMS -S) and Telerehab -based exercise training ( GEMS -T). GEMS -S 
will be delivered at each of the eight  recruiting sites (n=200) and GEMS -T will be delivered via 
UAB within a participant’s home/community  (n=200). Both GEMS -S and GEMS -T consist of an 
identical, individualized exercise program based on evidence -based exercise guidelines. 
Participants will undertake both aerobic and resistance training of moderate intensity twice  per 
week for 16 weeks (4 months), based on these conditions:  
a. The prescription is individualized, based on each participant’s ability. All participants are 
provided a low -level prescription to try for one week. They are asked to monitor how 
they feel, and at the end of the first week, they are contact[CONTACT_426] a coach ( GEMS -S 
participants in person at the facility; GEMS -T participants via video -chat). The goal is for 
the participant to gradually progress toward meeting the exercise guidelines .  
b. The elements of the intervention were chosen to facilitate self -management of exercise, 
as well as to maintain the integrity of the intervention across delivery modes ( GEMS -S 
and GEMS -T). All participants will receive  a hip -worn pedometer  to monitor steps . This 
information is to monitor fidelity of the exercise implementation only , and the participant 
will also record this information on their adherence log for each session . For aerobic 
training, the walking speed in the natural environment ( GEMS -T) are adjusted to get the 
desired 100 steps/minute and target heart rate (HR) based on HR reserve and target zones 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 16 of 33 defined by [CONTACT_25986].44 The target steppi[INVESTIGATOR_402716] -intensity exercise in persons with MS.  
c. Resistance training consists of 1 -2 sets, 10 -15 repetitions of 10 exercises targeting lower 
body, upper body, and core muscle groups performed 2 days per week. Participants start 
with the amount of resistance at which they can perform 10 -15 repetitions. GEMS -T 
participants will receive bands to use at home, and GEMS -S participants will  be given 
bands to use and keep by [CONTACT_25733].  
d. There are three  separate levels of difficul ty of the exercise intervention  (orange, blue, 
white) that the participant chooses in discussion with their behavioral coach. This mutual 
decision is based on participants’ experience following the first two weeks of the 
program and coaches’ perception of how they did. The levels of dif ficulty vary in terms 
of progression toward meeting the exercise guidelines. This feature is critical for 
accommodating the various levels of ability we anticipate for our participants. Much like 
those who do not have a disability, each participant may sta rt at a different level; the goal 
is for each participant to exercise at moderate intensity by [CONTACT_5875] 10 of the intervention.  
e. Participants in both groups receive a detailed manual outlining safety information, 
description of equipment/materials, and all exercises. GEMS -S participants will have 
access to a coach in the facility who can provide guidance regarding exercise training . 
GEMS -T participants will receive a DVD  and a printed exercise manual  with actual 
demonstrations of all the resistance exercises, including modifications for differing levels 
of physical capability to maximize safety. Two people with MS and one member of t he 
research team serve as the models for the exercises.  
f. Procedures to prevent falls include providing all participants with a fall risk prevention 
information packet during enrollment and or during the first coaching session. Coaches 
will also implement the following coaching instructions:  
a. If the participant is at risk for falls , they will perform the resistance exercises in 
sitting ; 
b. If the participant use s an assistive device, they will be instructed to use one while 
doing the walking exercises ; 
c. If the participant needs someone with them to be steady, or if there is a wall 
where they can walk, they should use these resources to be safe ; 
d. The participant will be instructed to only walk as fast as they can do so safely, and 
to focus on increasing their number of steps first . 
g. Each participant will maintain an exercise logbook  that will provide training specific data 
that will be used to evaluate fidelity of the intervention across groups, as well as to 
measure adherence with the protocol. Participants will record missed sessions and the 
reason for the miss, and if the session was made up during the corresponding week.  
Participants will also log steps information from their pedometers on the exercise 
logbook  after each exercise session.  For GEMS -S, the site coach  will collect the exercise 
logbook  on a weekly basis  and enter the data into the Portal. F or GEMS -T, participants 
will input their adherence data directly into the Portal each week .   
h. The exercise coach  will check the exercise logbook  for each participant and will 
document in  the study portal:  
i. Missed sessions  
ii. Any reports of a dverse events  
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 17 of 33 GEMS -T coaches will review participant logs prior to their scheduled one -on-one 
sessions. If there is missing data, the coach will obtain the information during the 
coaching session, including any information about adverse events (AEs). The GEMS -
T Project Coordinator will review the exercise logs each Friday on non -coaching 
weeks for submission status and notification of AEs. For participants who have 
missing data, the GEMS -T Project Coordinator will attempt to contact [CONTACT_402742].  
If a GEMS -S participant misses an exercise session, the facility coach will 
attempt to contact [CONTACT_402743].  
For follow up calls regarding missed exercise logs or sessions, the GEMS -T and 
GEMS -S Coaches will log the call date, result (reached/message left), and any 
important details in their log. If the coach cannot reach the participant, they should 
leave a voic email reminding the participant to complete the log. If the participant has 
not updated their weekly log by [CONTACT_402744], the coach will attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_266401].  
i. At the end of the [ADDRESS_507765] manager will follow up with the coaches for all the above items and take any 
necessary appropriate action.  
 
COVID -19 Intervention Procedures  
While site training facilities are closed, we will implement the following procedures for GEMS -S 
participants in weeks 1 to 16 of exercise:  
• Wave 7: Wave [ADDRESS_507766]  them to complete follow up 
assessments at 16 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months  as per the protocol and 
schedule .  
• Wave 8: Wave 8 participants were in weeks 5 or 6  at the time trial facilities were closed 
and were informed their exercise on -site and their one -on-one coaching sessions would 
cease. Subsequently, the Steering Committee decided to offer the se participants the  
opportunity to continue their GEMS program with supervision at home  “GEMS -S 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 18 of 33 remote.” GEMS -S remote exercise continued per the procedures described below and in 
the figure.  
• GEMS -S remote intervention procedures: In the case of site restrictions for on -site 
research activities, Research Coordinators will call the  GEMS -S participants to describe 
the option to continue exercising at home (GEMS -S remote ) with supervision  by [CONTACT_402745]-approved video conferencing or telephone.  
o Interested participants will provide verbal consent, which will be logged in the 
study portal.  
o Research staff will mail each p articipant their exercise kits and the coach will 
schedule twice weekly exercise sessions  and the one -on-one coaching session if 
appropriate (dependent on the week of the exercise program).   
o The exercises will be performed per the GEMS -S protocol starting at a week 
agreed upon by [CONTACT_402746]. Only the resistance exercises (not 
walking) will take place by [CONTACT_209136]/phone call. The exercise sessions 
will not be recorded . 
o The schedule will continue as originally defined with the exercise ending at 16 
weeks.  
o Participants can opt to not participate in the GEMS -S remote  option. Those who 
decline consent will be asked to continue in the trial by [CONTACT_402747]. Those who decline will be withdrawn from the trial.  
 
GEMS -S remote  Exercise Procedures  

 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 19 of 33 • GEMS -T participants will continue with their virtual coaching and exercise sessions on 
schedule. GEMS -T coaches will add advice to their coaching sessions relating to how to 
exercise while maintain safe COVID -19 social distancing measures. They will also log 
any interruptions in training related to COVID -19. 
• Any participants enrolled in wave [ADDRESS_507767] them again when the study resumes exercising. Depending on 
when this is, participants may require further  screening.  
 
Behavioral Training  
The physical  exercise program is supplemented with a behavioral training intervention 
developed by [CONTACT_402748]., based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) in people with MS.56 The 
behavioral component entails regular  meetings with MS exercise specialists (i.e., behavioral 
coaches), informational newsletters, detailed training manuals, and log books for self -
monitoring. Personal interactions with coaches are conducted in person for GEMS -S participants 
and via one -on-one, semi -structured, online video -chat sessions for GEMS -T participants using 
web cameras and a HIPAA compliant teleconference system  based on participant resources and 
preferences. If participants do not have access to the internet, the video -chats are replaced with 
phone calls. The in -person and online video -chat sessions will coincide with delivery of 
newsletters and supplement the content of the newsletters. The newsletters provide instructional 
material, websites for mor e information, testimonials of individuals who have experienced 
benefits of exercise, and  tips for participants to try at home. GEMS -S participants will receive 
newsletters in person and GEMS -T participants will receive them electronically . 
 
The sessions with the coach are designed to provide participants with feedback and information 
on how to progress through the exercise program as well as social accountability. Coaches will 
be research staff at each site for GEMS -S and at UAB for GEMS -T. Participants will be assigned 
to one coach based on availability. Before beginning the study, coaches will receive training 
from [CONTACT_402761] in behavior change for physical activity, and this will be comprised of information 
regarding SCT and its applicatio n for motivating ongoing behavior change through supportive 
accountability and discussions of newsletter content. We will maximize consistency among 
coaches by [CONTACT_402749] -chat. The scripts will contain (a) 
questions to obtain feedback from participants on progress in the program, (b) confirmation of 
receipt and reading of the relevant newsletter (c) discussion points linked with the relevant 
newsletter, and (d) opportunities fo r participants to ask any questions. Coaches will meet weekly 
and discuss interactions with participants  to facilitate cohesion on how coaches respond to 
participants’ needs, questions and experiences.  
 
Coach auditing  
Coaching sessions will be audited to ensure th at coaches are delivering the intervention as 
intended. Once per week, on coaching weeks (when coaches discuss newsletters), a  coach will 
randomly choose a  coaching session to audio record. A different participant will be audited each 
time a coaching session occurs. Coaches may record sessions on whichever  recording  device 
they choose , as long as it is in compliance with site IRB regulations .  
 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 20 of 33 Prior to audio recording, the coach will obtain the participant’s permission by [CONTACT_402750] -recorded . 
 
UAB  will review the audio and conduct the audit using a coaching audit checklist . Subsequently, 
UAB will  then provide feedback to the coaches via email.  
 
See Data Safety and Adequacy section below for details on how the audio will be securely 
shared with UAB and audio recording security measures.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT  
We define adverse events as follows:  
• Adverse Event  - Any untoward medical event occurring in a patient or subject enrolled in 
a clinical trial, regardless of whether the event has a causal relationship with the 
treatment under investigation.  
• Serious Adverse Event  - Any adverse experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life -threatening event, requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Important medical events that 
may not resu lt in death, be life -threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a 
serious adverse event when: a) they may jeopardize the patient or subject, b) may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in this definition, or 
c) a reasonable possibility exists that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_123652].  
 
Ongoing reporting of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to the IRB and 
PCORI  will follow the  policies and procedures of the Shepherd Center , as outlined in policy 
AC.RES.01.06 “Unanticipated Problem, Death, and Adverse Event Reporting”  and participating 
IRBs . Specifically : 
• The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_402717]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_402718] (UPs) to the IRB within 10 days  of their occurrence.  
• Site Co -Investigators are responsible for reporting SAEs and UPs to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_402719] [ADDRESS_507768] Manager  to ensure all receive timely notification .  
• Either coaches or research coordinators can file the AE/SAE form on the portal and must 
communicate with each other to ensure the report is filed within the required timeline 
(see Table 3). If coaches start an AE form, they should simultaneously email the site 
research coordinator with a description of the event and the research coordinator will 
complete follow up and submit the form.  
• All study investigators are responsible for recording all new clinical experiences, 
exacerbations, and/or deterioration of any existing clinical condition occurring after a 
study subject has signed informed consent. Research staff will also provide follow -up 
information on all adverse events until resolution or an appropriate endpoint is reached.  
• Adverse Events will be documented and reported as follows : 
o Participant experiences an event, logs a description of the event in their 
participant diary/log and immediately contacts his/her coach or site research 
 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 21 of 33 coordinator, who follows the site -specific reporting steps (see Table 3  and Figure 
3).  
o The UAB Project Coordinator checks the exercise logs weekly for GEMS -T 
participants  and identifies an AE, and follows the reporting steps in Table 3 and 
Figure 3 . Or,  
o Participant experiences an event while with his/her coach, and the coach logs the 
event and follows the site -specific next steps (Table 3  and Figure 3 ).

DATA ANALYSIS  
Data analysis plan  
The primary hypothesis is a non-inferiority test of the changes in T25FWT  between GEMS -T 
and GEMS -S. This  will be tested  using a linear model with site as the stratification factor and an 
intention to treat approach. The primary analysis will adjust for covariates age, gender and 
baseline EDSS  or PDDS . Further addition of covariates may be examined in sensitivity analyses 
based on any differences seen on examination of baseline variables between groups. Secondary 
endpoints include change in 6MWT  and EDSS /PDDS . In all endpoints,  we are assessing  

 
 
Version Date: 17 June 2022   Page 23 of 33 improvement over baseline values. We will examine the frequency of worsening as a safety 
comparison. We will also examine the primary endpoint of a 20% improvement in the T25FWT  
(yes or no) using logistic regression. Further, to characterize the changes over time, we will use 
linear mixed models to assess the slopes of change for GEMS -S versus GEMS -T groups. We 
will also examine the relationship between the dose of exercise measured by [CONTACT_402752]. These are exploratory outcomes to see if the 
compliance measures predict the benefits on the outcomes . This information is important for 
translation and information  dissemination  to people with MS.  
 
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness between participants randomized to their preferred 
delivery mode (GEMS -T [Choice] or GEMS -S [Choice]) with  those who are not randomized to 
their preferred delivery mode , we will use the same analysis model but examin e an interaction 
term for choice and treatment. We will assess if the effect of Choice is the same for both 
treatments. Logistic regression will be used to assess the interaction between choice and 
adherence and attendance or dropouts. We also will exami ne time to dropout and/or time until 
dropout or poor compliance (which will be defined prior to final analyses). We also are 
interested in examining the intensity or compliance of the intervention to the choice as well as 
impact on the primary endpoint as noted above.  
 
We will also utilize mediation analyses to understand if the changes induced by [CONTACT_402753] -efficacy. Here we will use the approach by [CONTACT_402754].45-51 The MSWS -12, MFIS -21 and Neuro -QOL will all be analyzed using 
regression models similar to the timed walk models above and will utilize the same contrasts for 
examining choice as well as treatment effects.  
 
DATA MANAGEMENT  
The Data Management Center (DMC)  will be housed at the  Accelerated Cure Project/iConquerMS 
led by [CONTACT_402755] -investigator, Robert McBurney , PhD . The DMC will collaborate  and communicate 
with the Steering Committee and Advisory Board as outlined in Table 4.

committees (including the DSMB) and the PCORI office, as appropriate  
 
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_507772] access to their own  master file  linking participants with their 
randomized assignment , but this file will be stored on the Portal and kept separately from 
participants’ assessments .  
 
Research data will be entered online through the secure portal system and source documents , 
such as the CRO forms,  will be kept in a secure fashion. All hard copy documents, such as 
consent forms, will be kept in a locked cabinet, and all soft copy documents, such as screening 
and adherence logs, will be password protected.  
 
To ensure the EDSS is performed uniformly across all sites, research coordinators will upload 
scanned, completed EDSS source documents to Shepherd Center ’s Microsoft [ADDRESS_507773] Center has a Business Associates Agreement (BAA) 
with Microsoft as well as appropriate security controls in place to ensure the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of the source documents. . Each res earch site will have their own site -
specific folder to upload their EDSS forms to.  EDSS forms should not contain any personally 
identifiable information, only the participant ID number and evaluator name.  
 
For coaching audits, t he coach will upload the file to their site -specific folder  housed by [CONTACT_86736] ’s 
Microsoft [ADDRESS_507774] a BAA with Microsoft . Files will be labeled: [site 
name]_[wave #]_ session #_ date_participant ID. After uploading  the file , the coach will delete 
the audio file  from the recording device . Audio recordings will be stored on a password -
protected computer on a server central to UAB.  All audio data will be erased upon the 
completion of each wave  of recruitment . 
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_402721] a site -specific Microsoft 365 cloud  folder 
housed by [CONTACT_86736], saved with the participant’s study ID.  
 
Staff from iConquerMS will monitor and track errors, completeness with routine reports and 
feedback to the sites. Data will be shared with the Statistical Center at UAB, who will provide 
analyses using SAS, SPSS, R and other programs, as necessary.  
 
Study portal security  
The Portal components are  created in the web content management system 
Drupal  (https://drupal.org/ ). The Portal has design aspects that are sensitive to those with vision 
issues due to  symptoms  of the disease (e.g. color, size of type, etc.,) as well as compliance with 
Section [ADDRESS_507775]. The portal has been designed to be usable 
on tablets and higher resolution smart phones  to ma ke it possible for all users – those with access 
to PCs or without – to participate. The portal’s Survey Engine leverages the CURE 
framework,  an enterprise data collection tool (eDCT) originally developed for the NIH -
NCI (https://github.com/NCIP/edct -formbuilder ). 
Data collected through the Portal is stored in a commercial -grade, cloud -based, HIPAA 
compliant, secure data center. Data is backed up daily.  Offsite backups  may be held  by a third 
party to guard against data loss.   
 
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_507776] to minimize risks such as loss 
of confidentiality, identity  theft, electronic fraud/security breaches, electronic monitoring, 
stalking or bullying,  hacking, and phishing.  Access to the data center  is phy sically limited to 
authorized personnel. Password -protected access to the server will be  granted to study staff and 
vendors  with access permissions set based on their roles in the study. Data is encrypted at rest 
with keys available only to appropriate use rs. All data transmission (uploading and downloading) 
occurs over secure, encrypted channels.   
 
Individual accounts requiring unique usernames and  passwords will be created for participants. 
Identifiers will be stored separately from other data types to protect the  privacy of individual 
participants. Data will be de -identified when viewed by [CONTACT_154602] b ut the  participants themselves 
and authorized study staff. ACP will legally  require anyone accessing  participant -contributed 
data to agree not to attempt to learn the identity of any participant, or  present or  publish data in 
which an individual can be ide ntified.

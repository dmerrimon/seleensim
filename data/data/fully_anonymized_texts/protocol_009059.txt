Protocol: PP1
 
 
 
Purpose​: There is no available data on presence and concentration of ketamine in  
breastmilk. There are statements in the literature made as to the safety of the use of  
ketamine in lactating women ​, ​ though these are unsupported ​.
​ This information is pertinent 
for the treatment of women who are lactating who may have depression, PTSD,  
postpartum depression, and other emotional difficulties and would benefit from ketamine  
treatment. The objective of this study is tto …. o measure the presence and concentration 
of ketamine in breastmilk 
 
Background 
 
Ketamine was developed as an anesthetic agent, by [CONTACT_58068], in the search for  
analogs resulting from recognition of the anesthetic properties of phencyclidine, the first drug  
developed in the arylcyclohexylamine structure during the late 1950s ​,​ 1960s​.​ This drug was 
marketed as Sernyl and in addition to anesthesia ​,​ was also noted to cause significant increase 
in blood pressure and often prolonged postsurgical emergence delirium, even to the point of  
unmanageable ​,​ and at times​,​ violent ​,​ ‘manic behavior’​.​ Ketamine was developed clinically in 
the mid 1960s and was a successful anesthetic agent with fewer adverse effects than the  
parent compound. It was dubbed a ‘dissociative anesthetic’ by [CONTACT_58069], the  
primary research clinician, as a solution to the descriptive puzzle offered by [CONTACT_58070]. Ketalar, ketamine’s brand name, was approved by [CONTACT_34033] [ADDRESS_63370]  
onset and quick recovery period and its property of maintaining or elevating blood pressure in  
trauma situations. 
Ketamine’s potential to treat different psychological or psychiatric problems  
commenced in [ADDRESS_63371] for antidepressant psychotherapy (Fontana  
1974)​.​ In Mexico​,​ the psychiatrist Salvador Roquet introduced ketamine to patients in group 
settings as a component of his approach to psychedelic psychotherapy (Kolp et al. ​,​ 2007)​.​ And 
then he brought ketamine to the attention of investigators at the Maryland Psychiatric  
Research Center, Stan Grof and Bill Richards among them. Ketamine’s versatility extends to  
analgesia and, for example, was used to treat patients who were at the scene of the 2005 
London underground bombings ​.​ Following this awful act of terrorism, paramedics in the [LOCATION_006] 
were authorized to possess and administer ketamine for pain relief.  
Ketamine is currently listed as one of the two injectable medicines under general  
anesthetics in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. The Model List designates  
medications determined “satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population; they  
should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in the appropriate dosage  
forms, and at a price that individuals and the community can afford” (WHO Technical Report  
Series 2000). 
 
Pharmacology 
Ketamine is available in two enantiomers: the S (+) and the R ( −) configurations ​. 
Most pharmacological preparations include an equimolar racemic mixture of the two  
enantiomers. 
Although racemic ketamine has the broadest worldwide use, S(+)-ketamine is available  
in some European countries like Denmark, Finland, [LOCATION_013] and the Netherlands and will  
come to market as a patented nasal preparation for psychiatric use in latte 2018.  
Ketamine’s putative action is as an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate  
receptor antagonist​.​ Multiple routes of administration are utilized by [CONTACT_58071], each with its own unique pharmacokinetics, have  
been investigated in the treatment of depression, including intravenous, intramuscular,  
intranasal, sublingual, anal, and oral delivery. Ketamine’s antidepressant activity is believed to  
stem from its antagonism of NMDA receptors, which are widely expressed in the brain. When  
NMDA receptors on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons are antagonized,  
downstream glutamatergic neurons are disinhibited. This increased glutamatergic activity  
impacts neural signaling, synaptic plasticity, and connectivity.  It is posited based on animal  
models that ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation and proliferation may play a key role in  
eliciting antidepressant effects ​.​ Ketamine also impacts other neurotransmitter systems, 
affecting cholinergic, opi[INVESTIGATOR_58054], monoaminergic, and GABAergic function.  
The bioavailability of Intramuscular ketamine is similar (93 -95%) to IV ketamine  
(Clements et al​,​ 1982)​.​ Intranasal ketamine has been used in anesthesia and found to have a 
favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile relative to oral and rectal  
administration (Costantino et al ​,​ 2007)​.​ In a blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 20 MDD 
patients ​,​ 5​0​ mg of intranasal ketamine was found to elicit only mild side effects and produced 
significant antidepressant activity within 24 hours of administration (Lapi[INVESTIGATOR_58055] ​,​ 2014). 
Estimates of intranasal absorption are variable ranging from 30-50%, with the lower figure  
seeming more the case in clinical practice. In several studies, Sublingual and Oral ketamine  
have a calculated bioavailability of about 30 % and 20 %, respectively (Lara et al, 2013; Paslakis  
et al, 2010). Again, in clinical practice, these percentages appear to be lower—20-30% for  
sublingual preparations and perhaps 10% for the oral administration. Of 27 patients with MDD  
given variable​,​ escalating doses of sublingual ketamine ​,​ 20experienced antidepressant efficacy 
(Lara et al, 2013). A retrospective review of 20 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58056] a single 0.5mg/dose 
of ketamine, given orally for 22 found significant antidepressant efficacy (Iglewicz, 2015).  
Ketamine is water and lipid soluble ​.​ It is absorbable by [CONTACT_24636], intramuscular, intranasal, 
subcutaneous, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], oral, and rectal routes of administration. Differences in the effects of  
ketamine are entirely determined by [CONTACT_58072][INVESTIGATOR_58057]. Ketamine’s  
relatively low binding capacity to plasma proteins leads to rapid brain uptake and distribution  
(Weber et al ​.​ 2004)​.​ The differences in bioavailability are due to gastrointestinal absorption 
and first-pass metabolism ​.​ Th ​e α​ -elimination phase half-life is only 11 minutes, while ​the β​ - 
elimination phase is about 2 ​.​5 hours (Wieber et al.,1975). 
Ketamine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. It is N-demethylated by  
[CONTACT_9058] P45 ​0​ enzymes in liver microsomes into NK and other metabolites (Hijazi and 
Boulieu 2002) ​.​ The principal isoform responsible for demethylation is CYP3A4, with minor 
contributions by [CONTACT_097]2B6 and CYP2C9 (Hijazi and Boulieu 2002). NK plasma levels are about  
three times higher after oral administration than after IV administration ​.​ The metabolites of 
nor-ketamine primarily undergo renal excretion; about 91 % of ketamine is excreted in the  
urine as metabolites, and 1–3 % is found in the feces (Chang and Glazko 1974) ​.​ Parenteral 
ketamine (as hydrochloride) is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_58058], including the brain. It is likely 
excreted into breast milk and does cross the placenta ​.​ However ​,​ it was posited to have 
no clinically relevant or adverse effects on neonates (Little et al., 1972). As this was early work  
and related to anesthesia, this remains an open issue for often repeated psychiatric use by  
[CONTACT_58073]. 
Ketamine’s tolerability and safety have been demonstrated over almost 5 decades. It  
has been used as an anesthetic for adults and children since the 1960s and has been used in  
neuropsychiatric research for more than two decades. Anesthetic doses from 1 to 3 mg/kg are 
considered to be very safe (Wan et al​.​ 2015)​.​ Subanesthetic doses of ketamine (from 0.1 to 2 
mg/kg) have been associated with transient side effects including neurocognitive, sensory-  
motor, and hemodynamic changes ​.​ A pooled data study from three different clinical trials of 
subanesthetic IV ketamine administration in MDD patients found that adverse effects  
common within the first four hours of administration included dizziness ​,​ derealization ​,​ and 
drowsiness. Whether these are truly to be considered ‘adverse’ or are part and parcel of  
ketamine’s actual effects that result in the antidepressant and/or therapeutic benefits is the  
subject of much debate. One third of all patients experienced transient hemodynamic  
changes, particularly elevated blood pressure. There have been no cases of persistent  
neuropsychiatric sequelae, medical effects, or increased substance abuse in clinical practice.  
Route of administration and dose provided will also affect tolerability. While there have been  
multiple reports of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine with IV and IM  
preparations, a trial of sublingual ketamine in 27 MDD patients reported no such side effects  
(Lara et al. ​,​ 2013)​.​ A trial of intranasal ketamine also found only small increases in dissociative 
symptoms (Lapi[INVESTIGATOR_58055]., 2014) ​. 
A cautionary here in that increasing dosages of ketamine through any route of  
administration will result in an increase in dissociative effects.  
Ketamine has been approved by [CONTACT_58074]. Ketamine was classified  
in 1999 as a Schedule 3 substance. Off label use has been a constant in ketamine’s history.  
 
 
Summary of Research Design: ​This study will be conducted with 4 lactating women 
who agree to postpone breastfeeding and provide samples of their milk. Ketamine’s half-life  
is variously placed at [ADDRESS_63372] reliable data puts ketamine’s half-life  
at 2.1 hours and for the metabolite—norketamine at 1.2 hours—this from a ketamine study  
in children indicating the safety of this medicine (Herd et al 2002). Samples will be collected  
prior to injection for baseline measurement, and timed at 3, 6, and 9 hour  
intervals--choosing the maximum half-life  duration. Two dosages will be administered:  
0.5ml/kg and 1.0ml/kg. administered Intramuscularly (IM). Each administration will be  
separated by a minimum of 3 days and preferably one week. 
 
The study subjects participants to greater than minimal risk because the protocol design  
calls for administration of IM ketamine. While the safety of IM ketamine administration  
is well established over decades of use, participants will be provided with full  
information on risks. 
 
SEE PACKAGE INSERT FOR THIS MANUFACTURER—ATTACHED. 
 
The IM route confers rapid onset—2-[ADDRESS_63373] and a reliable  
approximate 95% absorption of ketamine ​.​ The dosage range for a 50 kg woman amounts 
to 25-50mg and for a 70kg woman 35mg-70mg ​,​ both quantities well within commonly 
used therapeutic administration of IM ketamine for depression and other psychiatric  
diagnoses (Dore et al, 2019)​. 
 
While psychiatric use of ketamine may well exceed 1. ​0​ mg/kg ​,​ blood concentrations of 
ketamine for anesthetic use have tended to follow a linear pattern of concentration, enabling  
estimates of concentration in breast milk, should there be a decision to exceed 1.0mg /kg IM in  
clinical practice.

Investigators. Lactating patients and staff in both situations will be approached for an initial  
screening conversation. 
 
No advertising is involved. 
 
 
Procedures 
Initial screening for participation will be conducted by [CONTACT_2413], via telephone.  
The IC and Intake form will be emailed/mailed  to a potential participant based on  
the suitability for admission to the study as per the screening determination. ​ The intake 
form assesses current and previous illnesses, psychiatric conditions, medications, 
supplements and emergency contacts, etc. 
Review of the Intake form will occur prior to the formal Intake Interview to be  
performed at the site.  This review will again determine potential eligibility.  
The intake Interview at the site will take place with two investigators present  
and will take as long as necessary to review the protocol, the IC, the information on  
the actual Intake form, and to determine admission to the study. ​ This will enable 
Investigators to screen potential subjects prior to enrollment—as is our general

Methods 
Quantitative analysis of ketamine will be performed by [CONTACT_58081] ​,​ Professor of 
Laboratory Medicine at UCSF School of Medicine and Kara Lynch at UCSF.  
 
1.1) Lab will prepare a standard for analysis of ketamine and its principle 
metabolite norketamine In breast milk. The half-life of ketamine is 2.1 hours ​,​ and 
that of norketamine 1.2 hours (Herd et al 2007). The study will view the half-life as  
being a conservative [ADDRESS_63380] VERSION 
1.1) A urine pregnancy test will be conducted prior to each administration of 
ketamine. 
2.1)  
3.2) A first subject in the study will have milk collected at ​0,​ 3, 6, 9, [ADDRESS_63381] ​.​ The lab will 
process the samples from the first subject as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_58061]. Breast milk will be collected until ketamine levels are undetectable. If  
significant amounts of ketamine are found in samples from the [ADDRESS_63382] feeding may resume ​.​ For that first subject ​,​ breast feeding may 
resume at 18 hours​,​ which corresponds to [ADDRESS_63383].  
 
1.3) Pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_58062] a full expression so as not to influence 
concentrations in subsequent sampling intervals. The volume of breast milk will be  
quantified for each expression. 
 
1.4) Milk will be refrigerated in sterile containers and aliquots of one ounce will be               
brought to the lab refrigerated as soon as possible. A second aliquot of each               
expression will be frozen in the event of loss or spoilage of the first aliquots ​,site to be                   
determined. 
 
1.5) Each aliquot will be labelled with coded subject designation, concentration of 
ketamine administered, date, and interval. The lab will be provided with the actual  
quantity of ketamine administered to each subject at the ​0.​5 and 1.0mg/kg levels and 
the weight of each patient in kgs. 
1)  
1.6) The Lab will provide the data to KRF in formats suitable for journal publication.

Potential Adverse Effects 
•• Nausea and vomiting—a less than 5% incidence of intolerability to  
ketamine. 
 
 
•• Transient hypertension—BP will be monitored. In clinical practice ​,​ and 
in this age group ​,​ this has not occurred with any frequency. 
 
 
•• Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic and subjects have a high likelihood of  
experiencing dissociative effects during the first two hours following ketamine’s  
administration. Generally, the major impact occurs in the first hour, with full  
recovery to baseline by [ADDRESS_63385] conducted thousands of  
sessions in which dissociative effects are part of the ketamine assisted  
psychotherapy (KAP) approach, including at much higher doses than those being  
administered in this study ​.​ Subjects may experience, an altered mental state in 
which there is an imaginative stream of associations, sensations and imagery.  
There can be anxiety accompanying a shift from ordinary reality. The  
Investigators have specialized in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a transformative psychotherapy  
with utilization of this state and are fully equipped and experienced in dealing  
effectively with this state. Subjects will be prepared for the possibility of this  
• experience. Administration will be conducted in the same 
comfortable setting in which KAP sessions are routinely provided. Investigators  
are continually present throughout the time frame of this experience, however  
long it may persist. Subjects will remain in the office until fully recovered and  
will have a ride home and will not drive themselves. 
 
 
•• Agitation—may occur transiently with dissociative effects. Subjects will remain  
in the clinical setting until ketamine’s influence has passed and they are safe to leave ​. 
We have never had to treat agitation, as it passes, and reassurance and support have  
been sufficient to enable attainment of calmness. In the event of unusual agitation  
that is a risk to the patient, sublingual lorazepam can be administered ​.​ With over 50​0 
patients and several thousand ketamine sessions, this has never occurred.  
 
 
•• Safety in operating machinery and driving—Subjects will have rides home when  
ready to leave. 
 
 
•• No long term negative effects involving administration of ketamine in these  
dosages and frequencies have been reported in vast numbers over many decades of  
use. 
A follow-up formal telephone session will occur at [ADDRESS_63386] feeding, psychological difficulties and insights not  
discussed in the prior 4 weeks of follow-up availability ​.​ Throughout the study, subjects 
will be reachable by [CONTACT_58082]--who will have developed an on-call schedule. 
 
Potential Benefits to Subjects 
Ketamine administered in this clinical environment may well contribute to a sense of  
well-being and an exploration of consciousness ​.​ If emotional issues arise these will be fully 
processed. The Study Staff are skilled psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], versed in the practice of ketamine  
assisted psychotherapy. 
Subjects may well feel they are contributing to the benefit of women who have  
postpartum symptoms and disorders.

Screening Script: ​The Ketamine Research Foundation is conducting a study of the 
presence and concentration of ketamine in breast milk following two administrations of  
ketamine by [CONTACT_58083]. This study is in preparation for use of ketamine as an  
assisted psychotherapy for women suffering with postpartum depression. If you agree to  
participate, ketamine will be 
administered to you on two separate occasions based on your body weight. You would spend at  
least [ADDRESS_63387] for 3-4 hours prior to administration of ketamine to reduce the  
possibility of nausea which may occur and does occur in a small percentage of patients who  
receive ketamine. ​ ​ The effects of ketamine may would last for up to [ADDRESS_63388] of transportation and an initial stipend on acceptance  
into the study of $100, and on completion a second $[ADDRESS_63389] normal blood pressure.

Ketamine Levels and Effects 
while Breastfeeding 
Summary of Use during Lactation 
 
Breastmilk levels of ketamine have not been measured after 
administration to humans. Minimal data indicated that ketamine use in nursing 
mothers may not affect the breastfed infant or lactation. Until more data are 
available, ketamine 
should only be used with careful monitoring during breastfeeding. 
Alternate agents are preferred. 
 
Drug Levels 
 
Maternal Levels. Relevant published information was not found as of the 
revision date. 
 
Infant Levels. Relevant published information was not found as of the 
revision date. 
 
Effects in Breastfed Infants 
 
Four mothers who received epi[INVESTIGATOR_58066] (dosages not specified). Their infants were either breastfed or 
received their mother's breastmilk by [CONTACT_58085]. No adverse effects were reported in 
the infants.[1] 
 
Effects on Lactation and Breastmilk 
 
A pregnant woman sustained 28% body surface area burns near term. 
She underwent an emergency cesarean section on her due date under ketamine 
anesthesia. Although the infant required vigorous resuscitation, the infant began 
breastfeeding immediately. The infant had transient jaundice that resolved in a 
few days.[2] 
 
A study compared women undergoing cesarean section who received 
either placebo or S-ketamine (esketamine) 0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly, followed 
by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/minute for 12 hours. This low dose was 
used to enhance analgesia and reduce residual pain rather than to provide 
anesthesia. All women received intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_58067] 8 to10 mg and sufentanil 
5 mcg for analgesia, as well as midazolam 0.02 mg/kg intravenously before the 
S-ketamine or placebo injection. Postoperatively, patients received 
patient-controlled intravenous morphine for 24 hours, followed by 
[CONTACT_58086], oral ketorolac and a single dose of ondansetron 8 mg 
intravenously as needed. Of the 56 patients enrolled in the study (28 in each 
group), 13 in each group were contact[CONTACT_6811] 3 years postpartum. Patients who 
received placebo reported breastfeeding for an average of 10.5 months and 
those who received S-ketamine 
reported breastfeeding for an average of 8 months; however, the 
difference was not statistically significant.[3] 
 
A randomized, double-blind study compared the effects of intravenous 
propofol 
0.25 mg/kg, ketamine 0.25 mg/kg, ketamine [ADDRESS_63392] breastfeeding was 58 minutes in those who received placebo, 31.9 minutes 
with 
ketamine and 25.8 minutes with propofol plus ketamine. The 
time was significantly shorter than the other groups with the 
combination.[4]

APPENDIX C 
FOLLOW-UP CALL AT 4 WEEKS 
Fundamentally, this is an open conversation with subjects to ascertain the  
aftermath effects of the two ketamine sessions. 
Questions  that are included will focus on: 
 ​Any adverse effects on subjects or infants​: Have you felt or noticed and problems 
with your physical state; or your emotional state since your ketamine sessions?  If so, do you 
attribute these to your ketamine experiences.  
Were there positive effects that you have noted? 
Have you noticed any changes in your infant since your ketamine experiences? Do 
you attribute these to ketamine? 
Difficulties in resuming breast feeding ​: Did you have any difficulties with your infant 
as a result of the suspension of breast feeding?   How long did this last if there were 
problems?  Do you have a view of how long suspension of breast feeding is tolerable to you? 
To your infant? 
   
              Have you experienced any psychological difficulties or insights you have not 
discussed in the prior 4 weeks of follow-up?

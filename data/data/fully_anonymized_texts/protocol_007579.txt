ZOLL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] 1. INTRODUCTION 
ZOLL has released (CE marked) its latest softwa re version of the LifeVest 4000, modified for 
the collection of data relevant to the heart failure patient population.  Like all wearable 
defibrillators, this version also monitors for VT /VF, notifies the patient if VT/VF occurs and 
instructs them to press response buttons.  If the patient is unresponsive to the alarms, the 
LifeVest delivers defibrillation therapy. Versions of the LifeVest have been used commercially in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe since 2002, with over 100,[ADDRESS_774164] (Appendix A). The LifeVest general use and performance data are published 
regularly on the commercial website www.zoll.com . 
This software version has modification s that include but are not limited to: 
 Body position data collection 
 Activity data collection 
 The ability to perform a health survey 
 The ability to guide patients through a walk test  
 
2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
A complete description of the operation and management of the LifeVest is given in the 
Operator Manual (20B0048). 
2.1 Description of Heart Trends modifica tion for heart failure monitoring 
2.1.1 Body Position : This metric uses the acceleromete r in the LifeVest belt node to 
measure body position trends.  It is reporte d as a percent time of day at lying flat, 
reclined (and at what degree), or standing.   This may be used to indicate body 
position during sleep.  Fluid buildup in the lungs often causes patients to add 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_587928] a reclining chair to alleviate their symptoms.  Changing body 
angle during sleep is an established indicator of worsening heart failure. 
2.1.2 Body Orientation:   This metric uses the accelerome ter in the LifeVest belt node 
to measure sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_587929].  It is repo rted as a percent time of day at lying 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], prone, left or right.   
2.1.3 Activity Trends : The patient activity metric uses  the accelerometer in the belt 
node to measure patient movement.  It is reported as hours active per day and 
total number of steps taken.  
Decreases in activity may represent an in crease in heart failure symptoms, while 
an increase in activity may represent posi tive effects of the patient’s medical 
treatment. 
2.1.4 Heart Rate Trends : The heart rate (HR) metric uses the existing HR software to 
provide a moving average of HR.  It is reported as minimum, maximum, and [ADDRESS_774165]:   A six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valuable tool used by [CONTACT_587946]’s functional capacity.  It is intended to be performed in an 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page [ADDRESS_774166], but 
is patient-initiated, and is conducted in the patient’s home.  The program reports 
HR and step count during the test, as we ll as the recovery period. The LifeVest 
can also calculate the distance covered by [CONTACT_587947]. 
2.1.6 Health Survey:   The health survey is a short questionnaire that is administered 
via the LifeVest Monitor.  It can be co nducted daily or weekly, and the physician 
can customize which questions should be asked.

ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page [ADDRESS_774189] pr ompted by [CONTACT_587949] (clinical) 
environment, and the Walk Test prompted by  [CONTACT_587950]. Distance will be 
used to compare the standard method with the WCD method performed within the same 
environment. Step count will be used to compare WCD methods. Odd and even numbered 
subjects will have outpatient WCD results anal yzed separately and combined. Paired or 
independent t-test methods w ill be used as appropriate. 
Patient Diaries will be qualitatively compared to the position, orientation, and activity 
metrics recorded by [CONTACT_587951], as well as to the results of the Health Survey. 
Health Survey results will be qualitativel y and quantitatively correlated (Pearson or 
Spearman as appropriate) to the position, orient ation, and activity metrics recorded by [CONTACT_587952]. Health Survey results will also be compar ed to the position, orientation, and activity 
metrics recorded by [CONTACT_587951]. 
Heart Rate metrics will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587953] (t-test) with a random and non-random 
sampling of ECG data recorded by [CONTACT_587951]. At a minimum, one random sample per week 
will be compared to the Heart Rate metrics. 
All data will be analyzed and reviewed for intervariable trends and correlations.  
 
7. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
Since subjects are selected from patients al ready wearing a WCD for medical reasons, the 
risks of the study relate entirely to the perfor mance of the Walk Test and the data collection 
involved. 
Some subjects may not be accustomed to walkin g for six minutes at a time. The extra exercise 
may result in sore muscles. A few subjects ma y experience cardiac ischemia while walking. 
Subjects are advised not to perform the Walk Test  or stop the test if they feel any cardiac 
symptoms.  If the patient does not adhere to th ese directives, it is possible that a myocardial 
infarction may occur, with pain, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587932] a result.  
Although subjects will not receiv e direct personal or health benefits from taking part in this 
study, the study may be helpful to future pa tients by [CONTACT_587954].  
 
8. SUBJECT CONSENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page [ADDRESS_774190]'s name [CONTACT_587959] (the “Sponsor”) but will be kept 
confidential.  Authorized personnel from the et hics committee and regulatory authorities may 
have access to original subject records. 
 
9. STUDY SIZE 
A minimum of [ADDRESS_774191] igator will be responsible for obtaining and 
maintaining Informed Consent Forms and Case  Report Forms (90D0120-CRF).  A copy of the 
signed Informed Consent Form will be given to  every subject.  A copy of each Case Report 
Form will be sent to the Sponsor, with th e originals maintained by [CONTACT_737]. 
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS 
If a subject or person associated with the s ubject reports or otherwise indicates an adverse 
event occurred due to the performance of the st udy, specifically while performing the Walk 
Test or Health Survey, an Adverse Event Form must be filled out.  
Serious adverse events should be reported to  ZOLL immediately.  The reviewing ethics 
committee must also be noti fied within [ADDRESS_774192] or completing the Heath Survey shou ld be referred to customer support. These are 
not to be reported as adverse events. 
 
12. DATA ANALYSIS PLANS 
Data from all patients enrolled in the study that wear the WCD will be considered and/or 
analyzed and may be correlated with arrhyt hmias and other events recorded by [CONTACT_230991]'s monitoring system and patient cha rts.  The data stored in the monitor includes: 
 Automatically stored ECG recordings (including true arrhythmias and false 
arrhythmia declarations). 
 Manually stored ECG recordings. 
 Duration of time that the WCD was worn. 
 Noise, arrhythmia, and other internal event flags. 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page [ADDRESS_774193] Trends Validation Protocol B 
 ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
     
ZOLL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]  Device actions during a treatment se quence; i.e., transthoracic impedance 
measurement, energy delivered and outcome. 
 Patient device interactions, including patient use of the response buttons. 
The stored data will be analyzed and correlated to data recorded through Case Report Forms. 
The data will also be analyzed to determine frequency of noise events, frequency of false 
arrhythmia events, and percentage of subject wear time.  The results obtained will be 
compared with the results of commercial LifeVest use.  
 
13. ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
ZOLL, the Sponsor, is responsible for study ad ministration and providing devices and related 
materials for the study.   
The Sponsor will designate one or more approp riately trained and qualified individuals to 
monitor the investigation.  These individuals will conduct at least one pre-investigation on-
site visit and one on-site visit during the invest igation to verify the adherence to procedures 
specified in the protocol, and verify mainte nance of required subject and data records.  
Monitoring activities will be conducted accordin g to ZOLL's Monitoring of Clinical Studies 
Standard Operating Procedure (ZOLL 90D0013) and will be documented. 
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining and maintaining ethics approval of the study 
protocol.  The Investigator is responsible for obtaining patient consent, and maintaining 
Informed Consent Forms and Case Report Forms for each subject.  The Investigator is 
responsible for maintaining records of study protocol deviations and amendments and all 
correspondence relating to the study.  The Sp onsor will provide an Inve stigator Notebook for 
this purpose.  At the conclusion of the stud y, the Investigator will provide a report to the 
Sponsor and the ethics committee. 
If the device malfunctions or fails to function  as expected, the Investigator must report the 
incident to ZOLL immediately. 
Patient identities will be kept confidential; ho wever, ZOLL may provide study results to the 
[LOCATION_003]’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies.

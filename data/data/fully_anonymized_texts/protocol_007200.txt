Summary  
The purpose of this study is to compare self -reported pain scale measurements using the Wong -Baker 
FACES pain rating scale from an experimental group (local anesthesia injection with DentalVibe system) 
and a control  group  (traditional  local  anesthesia  injection  with  DentalVibe  system  turned  off) in children. 
Eligibility: Children age [ADDRESS_357444] understand and speak English. Interventions and 
evalua tions: Each patient will have two separate restorative appointments where the DentalVibe will be 
used during local anesthetic injections. One appointment the DentalVibe will be turned on and one 
appointment the DentalVibe will be turned off. After each inj ection the child will be shown the Wong 
Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] a face associated with their level of hurt during the 
injection. Follow -up: All children will be followed up with any necessary recommended dental  
treatment.  
 
Purpose,  Background  and Rationale  
The purpose  of this study  is to compare  self-reported  pain  scale  measurements  using  the 
Wong -Baker FACES pain rating scale from an experimental group (local anesthesia injection with 
DentalVibe  system)  and a control  group  (traditio nal local  anesthesia  injection  with  DentalVibe  system 
turned off) in children.  
 
An important aspect of behavior guidance in pediatric dentistry is the control of pain during 
dental  procedures.  There  can be anxiety  and discomfort  associated  with  some  dental  procedures.  
Anxious  patients  feel more  pain  than  less anxious  patients.[ADDRESS_357445]  been  shown  to reduce  the pain  associated 
with the injection of local anesthesia.6 Another study showed cooling the injection site before local 
anesthetic injections reduced pain perceived by [CONTACT_293185].7 The Wand, a computer delivery 
system that provides precise injection flow rate, can provide less painful injections when compared to 
the conventional local anesthesia in pediatric patients.8 
 
According  to the Gate  theory,  proposed  by [CONTACT_293186]  & Melzack  in 1965,  pain  can be reduced  by 
[CONTACT_293187] -noxio us stimuli.9,[ADDRESS_357446] the dental mirror or operator’s finger to acts as a  
check and/or lip retractor. The DentalVibe allows for no changes in the traditional local 
anesthetic  injection  technique,  patient  position  and time  involved.  In the study  by [CONTACT_176522],  the 
use of the DentalVibe injection system significantly reduced pain associated with  infiltration 
injections of local anesthesia in adolescents.[ADDRESS_357447] had mixed 
results.16-17 The study by [CONTACT_293188] & Masri did not show significant reduction in pain with use 
of the DentalVibe. This study was conducted on subjects in a similar age group but only 
subjects with positive or absolute positive on the Fankl behavior rating scale were included. 
This rais es the question of  the influence of the DentalVibe on subjects with various levels of 
cooperation.18 
 
This study will be a systematic replication of the study by [CONTACT_176522]. The population will be 
younger  and subjects  will not be excluded  for poor  behavior.  The purpose  of this study  is to 
compare self -reported pain scale measurements from an experimental group (local 
anesthesia injection with DentalVibe) and a control group (traditional local anesthesia 
injection with DentalVibe system turned off) in children ag es 5-11. 
 
Subjects  
The justification for the inclusion of children in this research is that typi[INVESTIGATOR_293181]. [ADDRESS_357448] understand and speak 
English.  
 
Exclusion  Criteria  
The specific exclu sion criteria are that no children with the presence of medically or developmentally 
compromising conditions (autism, cerebral palsy, moderate/severe asthma); history of chronic disease 
(seizure disorder, cardiac disorder, hematological disease, endocrine disorder, liver disease, renal 
disease)  and currently  taking  medication  which  contraindicated  the use of local  anesthesia.  Non-english 
speakers will also be excluded. Subjects who require oral sedation or general anesthesia for treatment 
due to behavior or  medical history will be excluded.  
 
Methods  
This study  will be a systematic  replication  of the Ching  study.  The differences  will be: 
Age range of the subjects  
Subjects  will not exclude  subjects  with  negative  Frankl  behavior  ratings  
All subjects  will receive  nitrous  during  both  restorative  appointment  due to the age of the subjects.  
 
Administration  of nitrous  oxide  is commonly  practiced  in pediatric  dentistry  with  patients  of this  age 
group.  From  McDonald  & Avery  (2016)  eighty -five percent  pediatric  dentist  use inhalation  of nitrous  
oxide  and oxygen.  It is used  to reduce  anxiety,  produce  analgesia,  and enhance  effective  communication 
between a patient and health care provider.  
 
Up to [ADDRESS_357449]. Marshall  and the dental  assistant  will wear  the same  color  scrubs  and 
black lab jackets during all appointments. One appointment patient will receive local anesthetic dental 
injection with the DentalVibe turned on and at on e appointment the child will receive local anesthetic 
dental  injection  with  the DentalVibe  off. Used  strictly  as a check/lip  retractor.  The child  will be randomly 
assigned via a random number generator to either the DentalVibe on or off during the initial 
appointment. During the DentalVibe turned on appointment, the DentalVibe will be introduced to each 
child to make him/her familiar with the vibration sensation. All patients will receive 5 mins of O2, then 
N2O will be titrated up to 50%N2O/50%O2.  
 
When app ointment is complete the child will receive 5 mins of 100% O2. At both restorative 
appointment a cotton tip applicator with 20% Benzocaine topi[INVESTIGATOR_293182] (Patterson) will be 
administered for 1 min. 2% Lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000epi[INVESTIGATOR_293183] (Patte rson Dental) will then be 
deposited  using  a medium -length  (0.4mm)  with  27-guage  short  needles.  Local  anesthetic  injections  will 
be referred to as sleepy juice. Buccal and lingual infiltration will perform on the maxilla. Mandibular 
blocks will be performed on the mandible. One cartridge of local anesthetic will be used at each 
appointment. After administration, patient will be  shown the Wong Baker FACES pain rating scale and 
asked to rate the amount of discomfort experienced during the injection by [CONTACT_293189].  
The following  manuscript  will be used:  
Each  face  represents  a person  who  has no hurt,  or some  hurt,  or a lot of hurt. 
Face 0 doesn’t hurt at all.  
Face [ADDRESS_357450]. Marshall  will continue  with  restorative  treatment.  The same process  will 
be followed at the second appointment. Appointments will be scheduled  3-4 weeks apart.  
 
The statistical  methods  to analyze  the data  will likely  be a combination  of measures  of 
central tendency, descriptive stats, t -tests and correlations using SPSS version 2.2.  
 
Risk 
Potential risks are minimal. There is considered to be no more risk to a child beyond what is normally 
associated with local anesthetic injections. All potential participants will still require dental treatment 
requiring  bilateral  local  anesthetic  administration  in the dental  clinic.  The only  change  in procedure  for 
consenting individuals will using the DentalVibe injections system to aid in local anesthetic 
administration.  The DentalVibe  system  acts as a cheek  and/or  lip retrac tor which  is often  performed 
with the dental mirror or operator’s fingers. [CONTACT_293191] will monitor the subject's behavior by 
[CONTACT_4171]. This will help ensure the safety of the subjects.  
 
Monitoring/Auditing/Analysis  
[CONTACT_293192]  will conduct  procedural  checks  in which  the dentist  (PI) implementing  the procedures  will be 
monitored to ensure appropriate consent is obtained and treatment protocol is being followed. The 
procedural fidelity checks will occur weekly.  
 
[CONTACT_293193] will perform ongoing data and safety analysis. She will administer the local 
anesthetic  with  the DentalVibe  injections  system  and present  the Wong -Baker  FACES  pain  rating  scale  to 
the children after local administration.  
 
Data  analysi s will occur  every  time  a child  is administered  anesthetic.  Data  analysis  will 
occur when the child is asked to evaluate his/her own pain rating.  
 
Benefits  
The potential  benefits  to the subject  that may  reasonably  be expected  from  participation  in the research 
is that less pain may be felt during local anesthesia injection. Potential benefits to society include the 
possibility of identification of an effective device to reduce pain during local anesthetic injections in 
children. This could lead to bette r behavior and more positive experiences in the dental clinic.  
 
Recruitment  
All subjects will be new or existing patients of the UNMC pediatric dental clinic. Research staff will have 
ethical access to potential subjects because [CONTACT_293191] has a clinical  relationship with the potential 
subjects.  Participants  will be recruited  from  a continuous  sample  of patients  who are  scheduled  for new 
patient or recall appointments at the UNMC Pediatric Dental Clinic. The children's parent or guardian 
will be informed  of the research.  If parent/guardian  chooses  to have  their child  participate,  the research 
will be further explained. A treatment appointment will then be made with [CONTACT_293191]. If the 
parent/guardian chooses not to have their child participate, a treatmen t appointment will still be 
scheduled with [CONTACT_293191] or one of the other providers.  
 
Informed  Consent  
The location where informed consent will be obtained in the consultation room located in the UNMC 
pediatric dental clinic. The environment will be conducive to discussion. The consultation room is a 
private and quiet room located behind closed doors. Dr. M arshall will be the  only person involved in the 
process of consenting the parent or guardian about their child's participation in this study. Her 
responsibility  will be to properly inform  the parent  or guardian  about  the research.  Approximately  10-[ADDRESS_357451]'s family or friends, counselors or other 
confidants, reading the consent to the parents or guardians, and use of teaching aids. [CONTACT_293191] will 
question the parents or guardian concerning his.her understanding of all the elem ents of informed 
consent. At the second treatment appointment [CONTACT_293191] will get verbal consent for the child to 
continue to participate in the study before starting the appointment. During the  appointment when the 
DentalVibe injection system is turned on, the DentalVibe will be introduced to each child to make  
him/her  familiar  with  the vibration  sensation  prior  to use  during  local  anesthetic  injections.  Tell-show -do 
will be used as a behavior guidance technique during all dental appointments.

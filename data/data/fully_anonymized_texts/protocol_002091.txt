 Page 6 of 26   cancer (BC) which was already diagnosed at an outside facility (OSF), or 
who have OSF imaging findings that are assigned category 5 (highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_89066] >95%) or 4C (suspi[INVESTIGATOR_89066] 50-95%) according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI -RADS) on OSF imaging [1]. Precise delineation of the extent 
of disease in the affected breast and evaluation of the contralateral breast are crucial for surgical treatment planning in BC patients [2]. Even in patients with no known BC, a second opi[INVESTIGATOR_89067] a specialized cancer center can make a significant impact on clinical management, changing the original interpretation in 36- 47% of lesions [3, 4]. In patients who present with known BC at MDACC, the rate of upstaging upon second opi[INVESTIGATOR_89068]-imaging is 25%, which changes surgical management in 12% of patients [5]. At the same time, the re-operation rate after breast conservation surgery in BC patients is 19% [5]. This is suboptimal and may be due to underestimation of tumor size, but this rate is lower than the national rate, which reaches 30% [2]. 
The current protocol for staging of OSF BC cases consists of a second 
read of interpretable OSF mammograms or repeating technically suboptimal mammograms, followed by [CONTACT_2207], ultrasound-guided and/or stereotactic-guided biopsies, when indicated. Some patients also require breast MRI with second look ultrasound and ultrasound- or MRI-guided biopsies, which prolongs work-up and delays treatment. 
At our institution, using ultrasound and MRI almost doubles the number of 
additional suspi[INVESTIGATOR_89069]. 45% of these additional lesions are malignant. The sensitivities of mammography (MG), US, and MRI are 36, 71, and 85%, respectively, and their specificities are respectively 76, 68, and 39%, making MRI the most sensitive, and the MG the most specific modality. 18% of additional malignant lesions at MDA are found on MRI only [6]. Unfortunately, the need for breast MRI often delays treatment due to the limited availability of magnet time. MRI is also 
an expensive imaging test, further limiting access.   
3.[ADDRESS_97947] 
imaging (NBI) require IV contrast injections and provide information on abnormal vascular architecture and increased vessel wall permeability that is common in BC [7]. Breast MRI is the most extensively researched among the functional modalities and serves as the gold standard for evaluation of new imaging modalities. MRI shows the highest sensitivity in detecting additional malignant lesions in the affected breast and the contralateral breast [2, 8-10]. MRI is also the most accurate modality for the evaluation of the index cancer size, while the conventional imaging modalities used for the first line of cancer staging- mammography and ultrasound- only modestly correlate with the tumor size on pathology [2, 11]. These attributes of MRI contribute to improved outcomes of surgical

staging referred for a second option to a tertiary cancer center 
 Page 7 of 26   treatment of BC, in particular, to the decreased need for re-excision for 
positive margins [2, 12, 13]. At the same time, MRI has a high rate of false positive results that require additional biopsies and may delay cancer treatment [14, 15]. 
Additional limitations of MRI include high cost, long scanning time, and 
limited availability of equipment. There is also a significant patient acceptance factor [16]. In one large study, only 51.6% of patients who were offered MRI at no cost agreed and successfully completed the MRI study. The main reasons for patient refusal were claustrophobia and time constraints [17]. 
Dedicated nuclear breast imaging (NBI) is a group of functional imaging 
modalities that depi[INVESTIGATOR_89070]. This group includes breast specific gamma imaging (BSGI), molecular breast imaging (MBI), and positron emission mammography (PEM) [18]. The role of NBI is evolving. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of MBI and BSGI in cancer detection are reported at 35-60% and are not affected by [CONTACT_89080], but are affected by [CONTACT_89081], detecting 71% of lesions less than 5 mm in size, as opposed to 84-99% of larger tumors.  
The disadvantages of NBI are long scanning time, relatively low 
resolution, whole-body radiation, and limited visualization of the prepectoral tissues. Yet NBI may be a viable diagnostic option for eligible women who cannot tolerate MRI [18]. 
3.[ADDRESS_97948] Enhanced Mammography 
CEM is a relatively new imaging technique that is based on 
mammography (MG) but utilizes intravenous contrast that adds functional information to morphologic information. Each CEM study has two components. The first component is a set of low- energy (LE) im ages, 
which are equivalent to non-contrast MG and are interpreted as FFDM, providing all the benefits of conventional mammography. A set of high-energy images are also obtained, above the k-edge of iodine (i.e. > 33 kVp). Then processing is performed to subtract the low- energy from the 
high-energy images and thereby [CONTACT_89082], subtracted contrast images (SCI), which reflect only areas of enhancement. Enhancement shows the functional state of the tissues, i.e. tissue vascularity and blood v essel permeability that is similar to MRI.  
CEM improves the diagnostic accuracy of MG alone, and even performs better than MG combined with DBT or MG with US [19-22]. CEM has been shown to be similar in sensitivity, but higher in specificity, than MRI for detection of index BC [19, 23]. It also efficiently finds multicentric and multifocal BC, as well as cancer in the contralateral breast with similar sensitivity but higher specificity than MRI [19, 24]. The higher specificity may make CEM more desirable than MRI in pre-operative cancer staging, since the high false positive rate currently limits the use of MRI [25] . 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Added value of contrast enhanced mammography for breast cancer 
staging referred for a second option to a tertiary cancer center 
 Page 8 of 26   CEM is also significantly faster and significantly less costly than MRI 
[16]. It can be easily incorporated into the workflow without any added work-up time. In addition, CEM is preferred over MRI by [CONTACT_1962] [22].  
The main concerns raised about CEM are the need for intravenous 
iodinated contrast administration and the associated risk of contrast-related complications, as well as increased radiation exposure. However, in a recent (2019) systematic literature review o f CEM technique 
involving 14,012 patients, only 30 adverse reactions were reported, of which 26/30 were mild (pruritus, hives, etc, that resolved promptly without treatment); 3/30 cases were moderate (nausea, vomiting, urticaria etc, resolved after antihistamines or corticosteroids); and 1/30 cases was severe, non -fatal, requiring short- term intensive care [26].  
As routinely performed, the radiation dose from CEM is approximately 2.3 mGy for a combination of 2 exposures. This is 1.5 times higher than a single exposure of FFDM, but is 25% lower than a combination mode mammography, which is the current standard of care at MDACC and consists of FFDM and DBT exposures. It is also significantly below the FDA allowed maximum glandular dose of 3 mGy per one exposure [27-29], [personal communication with GE Healthcare engineering team].   
Until recently, no direct method of tissue sampling under direct CEM 
guidance existed, which made it impossible to biopsy CEM- only detected 
lesions, and often required performing breast MRI to search for a correlating lesion and for biopsy guidance [30]. This has changed with the introduction of the first commercially available CEM-guided biopsy device (GE Healthcare Pristina Serena Bright), which has obtained 510(k) clearance by [CONTACT_89083] 2020. This enables direct biopsy of C EM- only detected lesions without the need for 
MRI and MRI - guided biopsies that increase cost and delay patient care 
(Appendix A ). 
3.4 Multiparametric cohort 
We are proposing to add comprehensive multiparametric data collection on the study cohort that could aid in patient stratification [ongoing MERIT study (PA17 -0584)]. This would involve administering a 
questionnaire, collecting blood samples, and archiving raw mammographic images, for blood and imaging biomarkers discovery and validation. The analysis of the multiparametric data may provide additional predictive and prognostic information on BC patients, which could be helpful in the choice of therapy and follow -up.

 Ultrasound Due to a subjective nature of ultrasound, the ultrasound images will not 
be included in the reader study. However ultrasound images and reports will be obtained from the patients’ medical records and analyzed to provide correlation per lesion with the FFDM, DBT, and CEM studies. 
MRI 
When available, MRI reports and MRI images will be obtained from the 
patients’ medical records and analyzed to correlate with the FFDM, DBT, CEM, and ultrasound findings. 
Image-guided biopsies 

PROTOCOL TITLE: Added value of contrast enhanced mammography for breast cancer 
staging referred for a second option to a tertiary cancer center 
 Page 13 of 26   Ultrasound-guided FNA or core biopsies, as well as stereotactic, or MRI-
guided core biopsies will be performed as a part of routine clinical care, when indicated. The biopsies may also be performed using a CEM-guided biopsy instrument (GE Healthcare Pristina Serena Bright).   
The following data will be collected from the biopsy reports: 
• Number of core samples 
• Needle gauge 
• Adequacy of sampling, which for stereotactic biopsies will include 
the percent of microcalcifications removed, and the number of cores with microcalcifications  
• Concordance with the pathology results. 
 5.4 CEM -guided biopsies: 
CEM - guided biopsy device uses a stereotactic technique to target areas 
of abnormal enhancement in the breast. The first commercially available CEM -guided biopsy device (GE Healthcare Serena Bright™ CEM biopsy 
system) has been U.S. Food & Drug Administration 510(k) cleared in May 2020. This system is capable of both conventional stereotactic and CEM-guided biopsies. For both methods the system uses angular mammographic acquisitions in the breast to calculate the target, but for stereotactic biopsies it uses  the morphologic abnormality in the breast as 
the target, whereas for CEM-guided biopsies it uses the area of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_89071]. With the exception of targeting, the biopsy procedure and the biopsy needles used for the procedure are identical for both methods (Appendix A ). 
For those study patients who demonstrate abnormal CEM enhancement with no correlate on FFDM or US, GE Healthcare Serena Bright™ CEM biopsy system will be used to perform CEM- guided biopsies. CEM- guided biopsies may also be utilized for choosing the areas of most prominent CEM enhancement as biopsy targets for extensive mammographic abnormalities, where precise targeting is diffi cult. The 
presence of distinct abnormal enhancement within a target is expected to correlate with the most metabolically active a reas of the lesion [31]. This 
may improve the accuracy of biopsy and decrease the rate of upgrade to malignancy at surgery. 
5.[ADDRESS_97955] of care [32]. As a part of the standard of care we will perform a post-procedure mammogram after tissue sampling and clip placement [32].  
For those patients who undergo CEM-guided biopsies for pathologic 
enhancement, post-procedure CEM images of the biopsied breast will be obtained. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Added value of contrast enhanced mammography for breast cancer

 Page [ADDRESS_97956] tissue lesions will be categorized as positive if diagnosed as invasive BC or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and otherwise will be categorized as negative, including the lesions of uncertain malignant potential without subsequent surgical upgrade to invasive cancer or DCIS.  
 5.[ADDRESS_97957] the additional information listed below. 
The following parameters will be recorded: 
• Pathologic diagnosis 
• The maximal diameter of the dominant abnormality 
• The maximal diameter of the abnormality with the highest level of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] (Invasive cancer, in-situ cancer, atypia) 
 
For invasive cancers/DCIS: 
• Histologic/nuclear grade 
• Presence of tumor necrosis for invasive carcinoma and/or 
comedonecrosis for DCIS 
• Architectural growth pattern for DCIS  
• The Presence of lymphovascular invasion 
• Biomarker status (ER, PR, Her-2/neu, Ki-67) 
• Presence of calcifications  
• Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte analysis 
 
 
5.8 Multiple reader study design  
Low-energy images produced as a part of CEM are of sufficient quality 
for clinical interpretation (equivalent to directly acquired 2D mammographic images), and will be interpreted accordingly by [CONTACT_87219]. 
The reader study will have 2 components: 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Added value of contrast enhanced mammography for breast cancer

 Page [ADDRESS_97958] the patient’s management. 
2. Multiple reader study. The results of this study will not be used 
for clinical care, and will not be reported to the patients or referring clinicians.  
Each patient’s study will contain LE images (FFDM equivalent), DBT images, and CEM subtraction images. All these components will be separated and presented to radiologists in different combinations for within -subject comparison. As a part of the multi- reader component, the 
study images for every patient will be reviewed in [ADDRESS_97959] 2 month to prevent case memorization. 
1. LE (FFDM equivalent) images only 2. LE (FFDM equivalent) with DBT  
3. LE followed by [CONTACT_89086] 4. LE followed by [CONTACT_89087] (complete CEM study)  
The study radiologists will be aware of the patients’ inclusion criteria, but 
will be blinded to the clinical diagnostic reports, any and all comparison images of any modality outside of the assigned protocol, and the pathology report.  
5.9 The sequence of the imaging studies and the parameters to be 
collected are presented below. The reporting will be done using ACR BI-
RADS Fifth edition recommendations.  
 1. LE images: 
• Laterality  
• Clock position

• BI-RADS assessment per lesion using the 7-point BI-RADS® scale 
(1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5) (Fig.3). BI-RADS categories 1- 3 will be 
considered negative, and BI-RADS categories 4- 5 will be 
considered positive. 
2. DBT images:

 A PACS -based MDACC-created and approved software will be utilized 
for data collection by [CONTACT_89088].  
 
Lexicon  
There is currently no standard reporting language for contrast enhanced mammography. The most commonly used conventional approach to reporting will be utilized for the study: for the mammographic findings, the BI -RADS mammography lexicon will be utilized; for the enhancement 
patterns, the BI-RADS MRI lexicon will be applied (fig.4) [1, 33].

 Follow-up We will follow up the study patients for at least 12  months. We will review 
the patients’ medical records, including clinical notes, pathology, and radiology reports. This will be done to monitor for possible development of new BC or cancer recurrence. Results from biopsy and/or follow-up will serve as the ground truth and will be used to determine the true positive and true negative.

 Page [ADDRESS_97960] be registered through the MDACC CORe system.  6.2 Questionnaire  
 If not already enrolled in the MERIT study (PA17-0584), participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire that collects data on personal and family history of cancer, health status, breast cancer risk factors, diet, weight gain, and physical activity (Appendix C1, C2). The questionnaire or a link to the questionnaire may also be sent to the participants at a different time from their mammography appointment (before or after) via text or email, or through our electronic health record system.  The questionnaire data may also be collected via telephone by [CONTACT_3647].  Essential data elements will be collected from the patients’ medical records.  
 6.[ADDRESS_97961] blood specimens, a PI[INVESTIGATOR_89072] (Velano Vascular) may be used by [CONTACT_89089] (Appendix D ). 
 The blood will be delivered to a facility within MD Anderson where it will be processed by [CONTACT_21724].  Additional details regarding blood processing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are described in Appendix E.  The McCombs Institute will manage the biospecimens and will utilize portions of samples to evaluate candidate biomarkers.    Samples from each patient will be assigned a unique specimen identification number.  This number will become a part of the repository and will be used to identify the subjects' data in the system. In this way, no personal identification information such as name [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a social security number is necessary.  
 If the participant is also enrolled in any other McCombs Institute early detection study ( for example, 2013-0609, PA17-0791), biospecimen 
collection is not required if the last collection was within 30 days.

12.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  
12.1 The patients may refuse participation at any time for any reason. 
12.2 The subjects will be withdrawn from the research without their 
consent in the following situations: 
• The patient has consented to the study but is determined to be ineligible before CEM is completed  
• The patient does not complete CEM imaging 
• The patient refuses a biopsy or chooses to have a biopsy at an outside institution  
• In these cases , the patients’ research files will be removed and any 
collected data will not be used for analysis. 
 
13.0 Risks to Subjects * 
13.[ADDRESS_97964] injection protocols. 
13.2 The extra imaging study carries small extra dose of ionizing 
radiation, approximately 30% more than a standard 2D mammogram, but 
less than a combination mode 3D mammogram.

15.0 Data Management * and Confidentiality  
15.1 Statistical considerations 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of CEM 
and LE images (FFDM equivalent) for the detection of additional cancer sites in the affected breast and in the contralateral breast among patients with known BC diagnosed or highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_89074].  The images of CEM/LE and DBT for each patient will be read/reviewed by [ADDRESS_97967] tissue lesions will be categorized as positive if determined as invasive cancer or DCIS, and otherwise will be categorized as negative that includes the lesions of uncertain malignant potential without subsequent surgical upgrade to invasive cancer or DCIS.  
The primary outcome of this study is accuracy determined by [CONTACT_89090]/LE results to that of the pathologic evaluations. Specifically, it is defined as the number of concordant cases between CEM/LE and pathologic evaluation divided by [CONTACT_89091]. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV).  Sensitivity (specificity) is defined as the number of correctly diagnosed positive (negative) cases divided by [CONTACT_89092] (negative) cases, NPV is defined as the number of true negative lesions obtained from CEM/LE divided by [CONTACT_89093]. The PPV is similarly defined for positive breast lesions.  Cance r detection rate is 
defined as number of invasive malignancy or DCIS divided by [CONTACT_89091].  
A successful CEM guided biopsy is defined as a biopsy which successfully sampled the abnormality in question. This procedure will be considered feasible if 95% patients or more have successful CEM guided biopsy among those who will undergo this procedure, which is similar to the success rate of the prone stereotactic vacuum assisted biopsies [41].

 Page 22 of 26   15.2  Sample size 
In two recent studies, the authors reported the accuracies of 78.0% 
(versus 69.0% for MG) [35] and 79.8% (versus 65.3% for MG) [36], respectively.  We utilize these clinical evidences for our sample size justifications. Using a two-sided extended McNemar test with a 
significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 83 patients provides 80% power to detect an accuracy difference of 12% between the two modalities of CEM and FFDM assuming the discordant of 20%. The method proposed by [CONTACT_89094] (2018) was used to calculate the sample size, where the multiple lesions were adjusted via the average number of lesions and the variance that were assumed to be 1.4 and 1, respectively [37]. We further assumed the intracluster correlation of 0.4, and 0.[ADDRESS_97968] deviations, medians, and ranges. Outcome variables of cancer detection rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals; and compared between the modalities using the McNemar test or the weighted generalized score st atistic proposed by [CONTACT_89095] [38], if deemed 
appropriate . To account for multiple lesions, outcome variables will be analyzed using generalized liner mix models or extended McNemar’s test [39-41], and additional analyses may be further performed if deemed 
appropriate. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_97969] the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Identifiers (name, medical record number) will be collected but will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_89096].  Scan/report dates will also be collected as part of this study, in order to identify different scans from the same patient. The key linking these numbers will be retained in a restricted database by [CONTACT_093].  All study personnel have completed training in methods for maintaining the confidentiality of health information.  Electronic records will be stored on password protected institution computers behind the institution firewall.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_89075].  Complete confidentiality will be maintained during this retrospective evaluation, manuscript preparation, and submission.

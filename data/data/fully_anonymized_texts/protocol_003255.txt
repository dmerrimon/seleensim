1.[ADDRESS_949309] prevalent cancer among men in the U.S with an estimated incidence 
of 241,740 and deaths of 28,170 in 2012 (SEER).  While there are many effective treatment 
options for localized prostate cancer, the outlook fo r metastatic disease remains grim with limited 
effective treatment option.  The five-year relative survival for localized disease is 100% whereas 
that for metastatic disease is 27.8% (SEER). Therefore, there remains a great need for 
improvement in the ther apeutic management of metastatic prostate cancer.    
1.2 Stereotactic Ablative B ody Radiation (SABR)  
 
Stereotactic a blative body radiation (SABR) is an emerging treatment paradigm defined in the 
American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology guidelines  as a “treatment method to 
deliver a high dose of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single dose or a small number of 
fractions with a high degree of precision within the body” [1] . Potential indications for SABR 
include a broad spectrum of tumor types and locations.  
 
Previous studies have demonstrated multiple immunogenic properties of radiation therapy, 
especially when given at high doses such as with SAB R [2, 3].  Since SABR is a highly focused 
therapy, it does not inherently immunocompromise the host. By [CONTACT_699272], the body retains the antigen depot (dying tumor cells) within the host. Furthermore, since 
SABR causes local inflammation, dendritic cells (DCs) are attracted into the tumor. These DCs 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_699232]; during this process they are 
activated. Once in the cortex of the lymph node, tumor antigens on DCs are efficiently presented 
by [CONTACT_699273] I MHC molecules to T cells.  Interestingly, radiation causes a dose -
dependent increas e in MHC I tumor neo -antigen presentation to tumor cells [4]. The T cells 
initiate an adaptive immune response resulting in antibody production and the expansion of 
cytotoxic T cells. These are delivered to both the primary and metastatic tumor sites. There is 
also evidence from both pre -clinical and clinical studies that radiation therapy, specifically at 
ablative doses typi[INVESTIGATOR_699233], initiates and augments an immune  response by [CONTACT_699274]. In a pre -clinical rodent syngeneic model, this was demonstrated for prostate 
cancer using a Listeria -PSA vaccine by [CONTACT_699275]. al [5].  In the clinic, this was shown recently 
by [CONTACT_699276] . al. who demonstrated that the abscopal effect (whereby [CONTACT_699277] a 
primary site of cancer resulted in a complete response at metastatic sites) was due to an increase 
in tumor -specifi c T-lymphocytes and a decrease in MDSC and other immune regulatory cells 
following the combination treatment of SABR and CTLA -4 immunotherapy [6]. A phase I trial was 
recently published for metastatic melanoma and re nal cell cancer where HD IL -2 was  combined 
with SABR with encouragin g results [7]. 
1.3 Sipuleucel -T 
Sipuleucel -T (Provenge) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine consisting of autologous infusion of 
dendritic cells that are activated by [CONTACT_699278] (PAP) and a 
GM-CSF fusion prot ein, PA2024 . Sipuleucel -T has  demonstrated approximately 4 months of  
overall survival ( OS) benefit in mCRPC patients in three phase III randomized trials and is 
currently FDA approved for this stage of prostate cancer patients [8-10]. The D9901 trial enrolled 
127 patients with asymptomatic mCRPC. The median survival time for patients treated with 
sipuleucel -T was 25.9 months comparing to 21.4 months for placebo -treated p atients (P=0.01) 
[9]. A similarly designed trial, t he IMPACT trial enrolled 512 mCRPC patients and the median 
survival time for sipuleucel -T patients was 25.8 months comparing to 21.7 months for placebo -
treated patients (P=0.032) [10]. Both of the trials allowed crossover of patients and therefore

 taking crossover into account, the predicted survival benefit is reported to be approximately seven 
months.  
 
Administration  of sipuluecel -T consists of leukapheresis  of the patient’s own blood to col lect WBC 
consisting of DC. This  is followed by [CONTACT_699279]2024. Three to  four days later this 
product is infused back to the patient. This process is repeated a total of three times two weeks 
apart. The side effects of sipuleucel -T are mostly limited to chills, fever, fatigue, nausea and 
headache which usuall y occur  within the  first few days of infusion. In addition, more serious 
cardiovascular events were observed at a rate of 2.4% vs 1.8%, cerebrovascular events of 3.5% 
vs 2.6% and cord compression of 1.7% vs 0.3% in patients treated with sipuleucel -T and placebo 
respectively . 
1.4 Rationale  
 
As applied in concert with sipuleucel -T in the present study, S ABR is intended not only as a 
systemic cytoreductive agent  but also an immuno stimulant . In the Norton -Simon hypothesis of 
malignant tumor progression, tumor growth can be plotted o n a c urve that very closely resembles  
the Gompertz model of human population growth  [11].  One notable difference, however, is that 
instead of reaching a steady -state level, as would be the case for a society’s population, 
relentless tumor growth will tend to continue steadily to the point of lethality for the host once the 
systemic disease burden reaches an overwhelming level.  By [CONTACT_699280] -T treatment, in addition to maintaining the burden of death 
below the lethal threshold, the growth dynamics may be altered to render the remaining cells 
more susceptible to the immu notherapy.  Therefore, the purpose of SABR would be two fold. It 
would irradiate sites of disease that are bulky and resistant to systemic agents, and can 
eventually serve as origins of further tumor spread and metastasis. Simultaneously, SABR would 
act as an in-situ tumor vaccination by [CONTACT_699281], 
there by [CONTACT_699282] s ipuleucel -T in facilitating an effective immune response  and 
eventually affecting disease progression, quality of life and ove rall survival .  
 
Metastatic prostate cancer can be seen as composed of bulky sites o f disease and innumerable 
micro metastatic disease sites that are below the resolution limit of radiog raphic imaging. 
Systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_699234] y alone, which are effective towards 
micrometastatic disease but less so to the bulky sites of metastasis, can result in response, but 
ultimately the tumors progress resulting in declining quality of life and death from cancer.   
Historically, the use of l ocal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_699235] 
a purpose other than palliation was ineffective since the tumor distribution was systemic.   
However, there is growing evidence that this  new, potent, highly focused, and convenient  form of 
radiation called S ABR can dramatically debulk and even eradicate bulky tumor deposits [12-15].  
Importantly, since S ABR is shown to be  immunostimulatory, and immunotherapy has 
radiosensitizing properties, the combination of the two is expected to be synergistic  [2]. In 
addition to the initiation of antigen presentation by [CONTACT_699283], tumor irradiation will actively recruit 
DCs into the tumor and to the draining lymph nodes by [CONTACT_225350] -associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are activated by [CONTACT_102664] -T, as shown by [CONTACT_094] -clinical studies 
[16, 17]. Therefore a combination treat ment that offers eradication of the bulky progressive sites 
and simultaneously synergizes with the concurrent systemic treatment of immunotherapy to 
eliminate the micrometastatic disease is expected to improve outcome dramatically and even 
offer cure to th is group of patients that currently only receives palliative treatment.  
 
Therefore, we propose a single -arm, open -label, phase II trial of sipuleucel -T and SABR 
administered concurrently. The safety profiles of both SABR and sipuleucel -T are excellent and 
therefore there are limited concerns for toxicity when they are administered concurrently. Given 
the three randomized phase III clinical trials of sipuleucel -T available for comparison  as historic 
control, a two -arm trial is not necessary.

 The primary en d point of this  study  is to measure improvement in time to progression (TTP) of 
metastatic prostate cancer co mpared to the reported TTP of 14 .6 weeks with treatment with 
sipuleucel -T alone  [10].  A significant improvement on the historically reported values of TTP 
would justify seeking a phase three trial to show the efficacy of this regimen  in improving overall 
survival.  One of the secondary endpoints will be augm entation of the immune response. An 
immune response in this case would constitute results of two immunologic assays and also a 
radiographic response to non -target sites.  Additional  secondary endpoints of this trial will be 
those that are recommended by [CONTACT_699284][INVESTIGATOR_699236] a 
phase III trial of prostate cancer and include progression free survival (PFS), biochemical 
progression free survival (bPFS) , prostate cancer -specific survival (PCaSS),  overall survival (OS) , 
impro vements in quality of life  (QOL)  and cost effectiveness analysis .  
1.[ADDRESS_949310] not only PAP and PA2024, but 
also an array of known prostate cancer antigens  [18]. An overall increase in tumor  antigen -
specific antibody will be measured using immunoblotting with patient sera as a source of prima ry 
antibody  [19].  
 
Enhancements of increased cytotoxicity to prostate cancer cells can be measured by [CONTACT_699285].  Antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity (ADCC) measures the cell -killing ability of 
certain lymphocytes that require the target cell to be marked by [CONTACT_699286]  [20]. On the other hand, lymphocyte -mediated cytotoxicity assay will 
measure the formation of tumor -specific CTLs among the lymphocytes collected from patients 
with the controls being lymp hocytes collected from the same patients before SABR and before 
sipuleucel -T. Since it is not practical or feasible to obtain sufficient quantities of tumor cells from 
each patients to assess a quantitative cytotoxicity by [CONTACT_699287], e stablished  allogen ic human 
prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 will be used  for this purpose. It is a generally accepted 
principle of tumor immunology that there will be many common tumor antigens between different 
patient tumors of same site origin , and therefore tumo r cell lines as well  [20]. In fact , the tumor 
antigens (PSA, CEA, CA 19 -9 etc.) that are in clinical pr actice are reported to be present in a 
significant portions  of patients  of the respective tumor site .  This concept of commonality of tumor 
antigens  between allogenic tumor cell lines and patients  is put into clinical practice by [CONTACT_699288]-tumor vacc ine which is currently in early phase  clinical trials for pancreatic , melanoma and 
prostate  cancer  [21, 22]. GVAX co nsists of multiple human tumor cel l lines of the respective site, 
that is modified to express GM -CSF, and killed with radiation prior to injection in patients. The 
presence of common tumor antigens in the cell lines and patient’s tumors, leads to induction  of an 
immune response. The LNCaP and PC -3 cell lines has been shown to express many of the 
common prostate cancer antigens, and therefore, is an appropriate surrogate to be used instead 
of patient’s own cells  and has been used in similar in vitro  cytotoxi city assays [23-27].   
 
Cytokine s are hormonal messengers responsible for most of the effects in the immune system 
such as activation of innate versus adaptive immu ne response, cellular versus humeral immune 
response  [28, 29]. For example , an increased level of IL-2 and IFN -γ suggests activation of Th1 
cells leading to  activation of macrophages and suggests a cell-mediated adaptive immun e 
response  whereas IL-4 and IL -5 may indicate Th2 activation and induction of humoral immunity 
[20, 29].  An increase in IL -[ADDRESS_949311] activation of autoimmune responses [30]. Therefore, 
measurements of serum cytokine levels have  generally been used previously in clinical trials as 
surrogates to assess specific activation of immune pathways  [31, 32].  Serum cytokines from this 
clinical trial before and after SABR will be measured using an extensive array of cytokines to 
explore the specific immune pathways that are initiated by  [CONTACT_699283]. The planned array of cytokines

Many surrogate markers for activated and proliferating lymphocytes hav e been described. Some 
of these markers include CD25, CD71, CD45RO, CD107a, CD54, CD69, Ki67 and ICOS/CD278 
[33-36]. These markers are easily measured with antibodie s specific for the markers that are 
tagged with a fluorophore utilizing FACS analysis. These measurements from PBMCs collected 
from patients before and after treatment will give us further information regarding the intensity of 
the immune response.  
 
The r elative levels of different monocyte subpopulations in the tumor biopsy sample after 
treatment as well as in the peripheral circulation often dictate the overall outcome of an immune 
response , and has been reported in previous immunotherapy trials [7]. Exploration of possible 
mechanisms of treatment failure can be explored from this analysis as well. Therefore the 
following subpopulation of cells will be quantified in patient PBMCs  (and in tumor biopsy samples 
where applicable)  collected b efore and after treatment utilizing some of the listed markers specific

1.6 Health -related Quality of Life  (HRQOL)  and Economic Analysis  
In the [LOCATION_002], total national health expenditures (NHE) increased from $7.14 billion in 1990 
to $2.23 tril lion in 2007, which represents an average annual growth rate of 7.0%.  In contrast, over 
the same period, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased from $5.8 trillion in 1990 to $13.8 
trillion, or average 5.2% annual growth rate.  Given that national hea lth expenditures have grown 
faster than GDP, the share of GDP devoted to health expenditures has increased from 12.3% in 
1990 to 16.2% in 2007 [37].  Moreover, national health expenditure growth is expected to continue 
to outpace income growth, with total NHE reaching $4.35 trillion by 2018, accounting for 20.3% of 
GDP (CMS 2009).  There is growing concern that t hese trends in health expenditures are not 
sustainable.  For the Medicare program, current estimates of the present value of total unfunded

 liabilities through the year 2083 (the present value of the difference between projected future 
Medicare expenditure s and Medicare revenues over the next 75 years under current Medicare 
policy) total $89 trillion, with Medicare’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699237] (“Part A”) trust fund projected to be 
depleted by 2017 [38]. 
 
Prior studies have estimated that about half of the recent growth in health expenditures is 
attributable to advances in  various forms of health technology, including new pharmaceutical 
products, surgical procedures, imaging modalities, and new biomarkers [38].  While almost all of 
these new technologies offer some potential to improve clinical outcomes, they also more often 
than not add to health expenditures.  Within the context  of unsustainable trends in health 
expenditures, a key policy question relates to whether the extent of improvement in outcomes 
associated with the use of a new technology is attained at a “reasonable” additional cost, compared 
to existing technology.  Ind eed, the value offered by [CONTACT_699289].  For example, 
in the [LOCATION_008], the National Health Service bases payment policy decisions for new 
technologies on recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
(NICE), which in turn are substantially influenced by [CONTACT_225437] -effectiveness analysis yielding an 
estimated additional “cost per quality -adjusted life -year (QALY) gained ” via use of the new 
technology.  Currently, NICE usually considers technologies offering improved outcomes at a cost 
less than £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained (about $33,000 - $50,000) acceptable, though 
exceptions are common [39]. 
 
The American Cancer Society estimates 241,740 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with 
28,174 prostate cancer related deaths in 2012 [40].  The NIH estimates that the overall direct cost 
of cancer in the [LOCATION_002] in 2010 was $102.8 billion with prostate cancer being the fifth mos t 
costly cancer accounting for over $[ADDRESS_949312] in 2010 and $19 billion projected in 2020 
[40, 41]. The rapi[INVESTIGATOR_699238], driven by a combination of 
advanced surgical, radiation, and pharmaceutical treatment technologies, have catalyzed increased 
scrutiny regarding current treatment approaches for p rostate cancer [42-44].  In fact, prostate 
cancer has been described as the litmus test for healthcare spending reform efforts [45]. With 
several recent novel therapeutics recently approved in the management of castration -resistant 
prostate cancer, the economic implication of the rapeutic modalities for men with mCRPC is 
certainly applicable to this protocol and thus will be studied in a correlative approach [46-48].   
 
Therefore, we propose  to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the combined treatment and assess 
patients’ health related quality of life, in order to evaluate the economical consequence of using the 
two new technologies proposed in this study and its impact on quality of life.  Based on the primary 
hypothesis of this study that time to progression will be improved with the co mbination of SABR and 
sipuleucel -T, we further hypothesize that the addition of SBRT will increase the durability of 
response or lengthen the time to progres sion thus increasing the cost effectiveness of the 
combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Thus, we hypothesize that the added treatment of SBRT while adding 
modestly to the total cost of the combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_699239]’s entir e 
treatment course co mpared to s ipuleucel T alone, making the combination a very attractive 
treatment for mCRPC patients.  Additionally, we hypothesiz e that combination of SBRT and 
sipuleucel T will increase the quality -adjusted life -years for CRPC cancer patients (compared to  the 
prior reported chemotherapeutic options for mCRPC) at a reasonable incremental cost, as defined 
by [CONTACT_572777] -effectiveness thresholds.  The sample size would be prohibitively large 
should these secondary endpoints be analyzed beyond simp le descriptive statistical purposes.

 2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
2.3.1 Immunologic Correlates : The  objective of the correlative immunologic stu dies is 
to characterize the nature of immune response by [CONTACT_699292] . 
In addition , any correlation between the primary and secondary outcomes to 
cytokine levels or changes in the level of immunocytes will be explored.

this study will compare the cost effect iveness and improvement of quality of life 
of this combination treatment to the other current standard s of care for mCRPC 
patients ( i.e. Docetaxel , sipuleucel -T alone, etc. ).  
2.4 Endpoints  
TTP: The primary endpoint of TTP will be measured as described in the 
recommendations of Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 [49] and in 
accordance with the Phase III clinical trial by [CONTACT_699293]. al. [10] : 
o Progressive disease (PD) on serial radiographic imaging tests  
 Visceral/soft -tissue mets:  
 PD defined using RECIST 1.1 criterion ( www.RECIST.com ) 
 >50% increase ( in the sum of the products of diameters for 
index lesions) measurable disease  
 Clear worsening of non -measurable disease  
 Bone Lesions: (PCWG2 recommendations; JCO 2008)  
 Appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions in Bone scan , 
confirmed by a r epeat bone scan in ≥6 weeks.  
 The Appearance of [ADDRESS_949315] follow -up scan 
(6 week scan ) will require ≥2 additional new lesions in a 
repeat bone scan  ≥[ADDRESS_949316] scan (PET  scan alone or 
equivocal are acceptable alternatives)  will be repeated every 8-12 (+/- 1 week)  weeks  
(since the reported TTP with Sipuleucel -T alone is 14.6 wks) for the first two years 
after completion of all study treatment and every 6 months thereafter for two years. 
Bone scans will be repeated every 8-12 (+/- 1 week)  weeks for the first [ADDRESS_949317] 9 months after completion of 
study treatment only if soft tissue lesion is present  (see section 5 for detail s). 
2.4.1 Immunologic Endpoint: Reaching an immunologic endpoint by [CONTACT_31617] p atient will 
constitute either an amplification of immune response (as compared to 
historically reported values for sipuleucel -T administration alone) or abscopal 
radiographic response.  Immune response will be measured using ELISpot 
assay, T -cell prolifera tion assay or ELISA.  The assays will first be calibrated by  
[CONTACT_699294] -
treatment and an increase of >95th percentile will be considered a positive 
response.  To reach the immunologic end point for this trial,  there has to be a 
>100% increase in immune response as measured by [CONTACT_699295] -T is administered alone as reported by [CONTACT_699296] a l [32] for patients 
treated in the IMPACT trial :

 showing  0 spots for PA2024 ;  A 100% increase  in the median 
number of spots from these numbers after normalizing to control (pre -
treatment values) at their respective time points will constitute 
reaching the endpoint.  
 T-Cell proliferation (3H -Thymidine) assay showed a median T -Cell 
Stimulation Index (SI) of 20 at Wk 6 and 18 at Wk 1 4 and 12 at Wk 
26; therefore a 100% increase o f SI from these values at their 
respective time points after normalizati on to control (pre -treatment 
values) will  constitute reaching the endpoint.  
 ELISA showing an increase in >1:400 increase in the titer of antibody 
to PA2024 is reported by [CONTACT_699297] [32], therefore an increase of 
1:[ADDRESS_949318] will be counted as evidence of an 
immunologic response and will be defined as radiographic response at non -
treated sites  
 CT measurement of >50% decrease in diameter of a non -target soft -
tissue or visceral lesions (RECIST 1.1)  as defi ned above  
 PR or CR as defined in (Section 6.1.4)  and per RECIST 1.1.  
 Resolution of bone lesions in bone scan or a significant improvement 
in Bone scan as assessed by a radiologist.  
 Since, it may be very difficult to assess a radiographic response in 
prost ate cancer blastic lesions, if there are no progression of disease 
(as defined above) > [ADDRESS_949319] deviation from the Median TTP (14.6 
wks), it will also constitute as evidence of a durable immune 
response.

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN : STUDY MEDICATION  
4.1 Sipuleucel -T: Treatment Dosage and Administration  – The administration of 
Sipuleucel -T follows  standard -of-care treatment.  The following treatment plan is 
recommended.  
4.1.1 Preparation of sipuleucel -T:  
Sipuleucel -T will be  administered for three cycles, two weeks each  as per manufacturer's  
recommendation . SABR will be administered on the third -fourth week.  SABR planning 
takes place during the first two weeks and sipuleucel -T administration and treatment 
administration take s place on the third or fourth week, prior to the last leukapheresis.  All 
treatments can be carried out as out -patient. Further information regarding the 
manufacture and characterization of sipuleucel -T is provided in the sipuleucel -T 
Prescriber Informati on (Appendix G).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_949327]  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; primarily 
lymphocytes and monocytes), which takes place in the regional Carter Bloodcare center 
over approximately [ADDRESS_949328] consisting of APCs loaded with prostate 
antigen PA2024. PA2024 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of  human PAP and 
GM-CSF. GM -CSF acts as a targeting molecule that directs the PAP antigen to APCs 
and promotes antigen uptake and processing. PAP is a tissue -specific target antigen 
rather than a tumor -specific target antigen. Studies with specific monoclona l antibodies 
and RNA probes indicate that the antigen is strictly prostate -specific.  
Immunohistochemical studies reveal that the antigen is expressed by [CONTACT_699298], and > 90% of all prostatic adenocarcinomas, but is not expressed by [CONTACT_699299] 
[50]. PAP is secreted by [CONTACT_699300], and an elevated serum level is 
found in most subjects  with advanced prostate cancer [51]. The cDNA for PAP has been 
isolated. Analysis of sequence homology with other known proteins reveals a low risk of 
cross -reactivity of immune responses. GM -CSF is a multil ineage factor that may also 
activate mature granulocytes and macrophages, and may activate quiescent APCs.  
 
Preparation of sipuleucel -T entails isolating quiescent APCs from a subject’s peripheral 
blood leukapheresis product by [CONTACT_699301] 2 days in the presence of PA2024. The culture medium does not contain 
serum or exogenous cytokines. During the culture process, APCs specifically and 
selectively pi[INVESTIGATOR_511303] (PA2024) and differentiate into anti gen loaded APCs capable 
of presenting antigen to T cells. These APCs thus represent the cells responsible for the 
biological activity of sipuleucel -T. Other cell populations in sipuleucel -T co-purify with 
APCs during buoyant density centrifugation, but do not incorporate or present antigen, 
and are therefore referred to as “non -APCs.” After the culture period, the cells are 
washed and suspended in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. The final preparation of 
PA2024 -loaded APCs is designated sipuleucel -T. Sipul eucel -T is placed in a refrigerated 
package and transported to the clinical site for infusion.

Quality control (QC) testing is performed at several time points during the manufacturing  
process and on samples of the final product. If the fin al product passes all required 
release tests, an approval to infuse the product (Cell Product Disposition Form) is faxed 
to the infusion center. If a cell product does not meet Dendreon quality specifications, 
Dendreon will contact [CONTACT_699302] t elephone and by [CONTACT_6791]. Dendreon will  provide 
instructions for product return or destruction of cell products that are not approved or not

4.1.6 Administration  (Recommended)  
Subjects are premedicated with acetaminophen and an antihistamine such as 
diphenhydramine prior to the infusion. After the site receives the Cell Product  Disposition 
Form indicating the cell product is approved, the infusion is administered over 
approximately 60 minutes through an intravenous (IV) line suitable for blood transfusion 
(without a cell filter).  The infusion of sipuleucel -t contains at least 5 0 million CD54+ 
activated DC.  Subjects are observed for at least 30 minutes following the infusion.

oligometastatic patients tr eated at 1 -5 sites of disease has also showed an increase in 
progression free survival with the increasing radiation dose per fraction [57]. A dose of less than 
7.[ADDRESS_949333] permitted dose [56].  
 
The SABR  prescription dose will be delivered to the periphery of the planning target volume 
(PTV, see below for definitions).  Investigators will have discreti on in choosing from either of the  
biologically equivalent dose levels usin g one or  three  fractions, although a single fraction is 
preferred  over three fraction treatments.   Treating physician will have f urther discretion in 
selecting up to six sites to treat  if >[ADDRESS_949334] feasible di sease site, bulky progressive sites, symptomatic sites , and sites where 
palliative and preventative (i.e. to prevent a pathologic fracture in weight bearing bone) 
indications are applicable.  Treating physicians should choose their dose based on establishe d 
planning guidelines at their center including their ability to respect normal tissue tolerance listed 
below.  It is not required that all targets be treated with the same dose fractionation.  A dose from 
the following table should be used:  
 
Prescription Dose

Target Volume (Gy)  
Number of 
Fractions  Protocol Compliant  Minor Deviation *  Major Deviation  
1 21-27 Gy  ≥16 Gy, <21 Gy  >27 Gy, <16 Gy

*This column  is protocol compliant for tumors abutting the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (major deviation remain as

Dose tolerance limits should be adhered to for all treatments.  Protocol compliant dose should be 
used in all cases, if possible.  When treating tumors abutting the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], tolerance limits 
should not be exceeded.  To facilitate this requirement, minor deviation dose ranges listed above 
in the table will be considered fully compliant for tumors abutting the spi[INVESTIGATOR_699241]/tumor volume (GTV) shou ld be at least 2cm3 in size, corresponding to roughly a 1.5 cm 
diameter tumor. This is to ensure that adequate tumor volume and therefore adequate tumor cells 
(roughly 108 -109 cells/cm3 [58]) are killed for antigen presentation.  In addition, it is recognized 
that for parrallal tissues (i.e. Lung, Liver and Kidney), if tumor lesions are larger than a certain 
percentage of its total volume, then it be comes exceeding ly difficult to reach the tissue constraints 
and its critical volume dose limit.  Therefore, the following GTV volume guidelines should be 
followed, which is defined for a single lesion :

 4.2.[ADDRESS_949335] for a painful bone metastasis, a single dose of 8 Gy is 
usually as effective as 30 Gy  [59]. However, in this protocol the  goal is not just to relieve pain 
within an osseous metastasis but also to dramatically debulk the cancer cells present  and induce 
an immune response , and the higher dose is more likely to accomplish this goal give n a higher 
biological potency [60]. Long term survival after bone metasta sectomy has been reported  [61].  
Irradi ation of non -spi[INVESTIGATOR_699242]. Metastases in major lower extremity and weight -bearing bones should undergo 
surgical stabilization if there is radiographic evidence of cortical erosion.  Similarly, whenever 
treating organs of the GI tract (Esophagus, stomach, small/large bowel, rectum), if there are 
concerns for bowel obstruction, a GI or surgical referral must be placed.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_949336] in the Carter BloodCare: [ADDRESS_949337], Dallas, TX [ZIP_CODE]; (214) [ADDRESS_949338] cycle of Sipuleucel -T and the SABR treatment is 
administered over the two weeks of cycle 2.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Simulation, beam arrangements, tumor prescription dose  
Treatment to skeletal lesions other than spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], may be accomplished with any 3D conformal 
radiotherapy or intensity -modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique suitable for this application 
with performance specifications adequate to provide proper tumor dose di stribution and normal 
tissue sparing.  The bone lesions can be treated with a conformal 3D or IMRT technique, which is 
different than SBRT/SABR technique. The difference lies in immobilization technique and  
dosimetric planning , but otherwise all the descrip tions of SBRT in terms of contouring and tissue 
constraints that needs to be met remains the same.  Immobilization for 3D or IMRT does not 
require a body frame but rather a Vac -lock bag is used with appropriate additional devices (i.e. 
head rest, knee spo nge, etc.).   
At the time of simulation for patients who will receive SBRT to the lung and/or liver, the movement 
of the dome of the diaphragm (superior portion of the liver) is to be observed under fluoroscopy or 
other acceptable means to estimate respi[INVESTIGATOR_699243].  Patients will be assessed for suitability for tolerance of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_699244] a breath -hold technique, respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344], or abdominal compression to 
limit diaphragmatic  excursion during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Patients with severe lung disease and patients 
who cannot tolerate diaphragmatic or breathing control devices for other reasons will be treated 
without them. A larger margin to account for breathing related intra -fractional o rgan movement is 
required.  
With the patient immobilized in a vacuum -type or equivalent body mold  preferably in a body 
frame , a planning CT scan with [ADDRESS_949339] to highlight the stomach and duodenum is recommended for patients with medial liver 
lesions or lesions of the  caudate lobe.  
For treatment to the liver, the following structures are contoured: entire liver, each individual liver 
gross tumor volume (GTV), each kidney, and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The planning target volume (PTV)

 is constructed to account for the positiona l uncertainty of the GTV during treatment. The PTV for 
each contoured GTV should be at least 5mm larger than the GTV in the axial plane and 1.[ADDRESS_949340] maneuvers to 
diminish motion.  For lung SBRT the same principles apply; the entire lung volumes are 
contoured, as are each individual GTV within the lung.  
The prescription dose for each lesion is l isted in the table in section 4.1, prescribed to the 
periphery of the PTV. In case of IMRT or 3D conformal technique, a PTV coverage of >95% of 
the prescription dose is required with no restrictions on dose heterogeneity other than minimal 
PTV dose >90%. There is no restriction on the dose “hotspot” except that it must be located 
within the PTV. A Linear Accelerator with effective photon en ergies of ≥ 6 MV is required. The 
use of a Multi -leaf collimator (MLC) or custom blocks are acceptable.  A stereotactic relocalization 
system that relies upon stereoscopic radiographs, implanted fiducials, or near real -time CT based 
verification will be us ed.  
The PTV may be treated with any combination of coplanar or non -coplanar three -dimensional 
conformal fields, shaped to deliver the specified dose while restricting the dose to the normal 
tissues.  Field arrangements will be determined by [CONTACT_699304] s ystem to produce the optimal 
conformal plan in accordance with volume definitions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Normal Tissue Dose Constraints  
 
In accordance with the prior Phase I studies  [62], certain normal tissue dose constraints must be 
respected.  
 
The possibility that SBRT -induced fibrosis might cause occlusion of large central airways, thus 
impeding ventilation distal to the occlusion has been well considered  [63]. An adjustment to the 
fractionation scheme may be made if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_681516], the 
following conditi ons apply: (1) the location of a lung lesion is close enough to a large proximal 
bronchial airway such that occlusion might occur, and (2) compromised ventilation to the 
segment(s) of lung potentially affected would cause clinically significant adverse con sequences. 
In such a case, the treating radiation oncologist should discuss any proposed dose modifications 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_699245] a regimen of similar biological potency can be safely given.  
 
The same special situations apply whenever a lesion is c lose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], small bowel, 
great vessels, porta hepatis and renal pelvis. In these situations, in addition to meeting dose 
constraints, additional tests must be performed to ensure adequate reserve of normal tissue 
function. For example,  in the situation of a renal pelvis lesions, a functional renal scan must be 
performed to ensure ample renal reserve for the patient.   In case of a patient with COPD 
receiving radiation to lung lesions, PFT must be performed to demonstrate FEV1>1.2L and DLCO 
>60%.  In case of a patient with peripherial lung lesion close to the ribs, to decrease the chance of 
a rib fracture, the lesion must be >3mm from the rib.  In case of treating liver lesions, LFTs must 
be within normal range.    
 
Special condition applies in the s etting of a patient whose primary prostate disease has been 
irradiated previously and is present as a site of disease . Since re -irradiation toxicity is a concern, 
these patients will not receive SABR to the sites of previous irradiation . These patients wil l only 
be included in the trial if they have metastatic disease that are eligible for SABR outside the 
previously irradiated field.  Re-irradiation to a site that has received previous SBRT is also not 
allowed.   
 
Deviations from the intended dose regimen will be documented, with calculations of the BED of 
the applied regimen included in the patient’s research chart along with documentation of the 
discussions pertaining to the idiosyncrasies of the case.

4.3 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any subject who receives tr eatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each patient will 
be assessed for the development of toxicity  for 6 month s following the completion of radiation 
therapy( see Time and Events table (5.4) ). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be 
made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  
 
Both treatments of sipuleucel -T and SABR have excellent safety profile. The most common ly 
reported toxicity for s ipuleucel -T (incidence ≥ 15%) are chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, 
joint ache, and headache (see Section 7.0 and 8.0 for detail). Acute infusion reactions (reported 
within 1 day of infusion) included, but were not limited to, fever, chills, respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] 
(dyspnea,  hypoxia, and bronchospasm), nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, and 
tachycardia. In controlled clinical trials, 71.2% of patients in the sipuleucel -T group developed an 
acute infusion reaction. The most common events (≥ 20%) were chills, fever, and f atigue. In 
95.1% of patients reporting acute infusion reactions, the events were mild or moderate. Fevers 
and chills generally resolved within 2 days (71.9% and 89.0%, respectively).  In controlled clinical 
trials, severe (Grade 3) acute infusion reactions  were reported in 3.5% of patients in the 
sipuleucel -T group. Reactions included chills, fever, fatigue, asthenia, dyspnea, hypoxia, 
bronchospasm, dizziness, headache, hypertension, muscle ache, nausea, and vomiting. The 
incidence of severe events was grea ter following the second infusion (2.1% vs. 0.8% following

 the first infusion), and decreased to 1.3% following the third infusion. Some (1.2%) patients in the 
sipuleucel -T group were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22318] 1 day of infusion for management of acute infusion 
reactions. No Grade 4 or 5 acute infusion reactions were reported in patients in the sipuleucel -T 
group.  
 
In the event of an acute infusion reaction, the infusion rate may be decreased, or the infusion 
stopped, depending on the severity of the reaction. Ap propriate medical therapy should be 
administered as needed.  
 
Hematologic toxicity is not reported or expected for either sipuleucel -T or SABR.  
Non-hematological Toxicities should be managed as follows:

4.4 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Drugs that are prohibited during or within the f ollow up time of the protocol therapy include 
chemotherapy, glucocorticoids and any other treatments directed to mCRPC patients. 
Bisphosphonates or treatment for bony metastatic disease and androgen deprivation therapy 
should not be initiated, but if patie nt is already on the treatment, then it should be continued 
throughout the duration of the study.

In case of delay, the recommended ti me for completion of both Sipuleucel -T and SABR is within 8 
weeks. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until:  
 Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 Subject  decides to withdraw from the study, OR 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the subject  unacceptable for

This material is the property of the UTSW Department of Radiation  Oncology . Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_91332].  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Measurable Disease: Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be 
recorded) with a minimum size of:   
1. [ADDRESS_949364] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
3. [ADDRESS_949365] x -ray. 
Malignant lymph  nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_949366] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). Lymph nodes merit special 
mention since they are normal a natomical structures which may be visible by [CONTACT_118581]. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable 
and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_949367] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost 
always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or 
coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal 
node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm ha s a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short 
axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions. Node s that have 
a short axis < 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or 
followed.  
Note: Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in cases of 
documented progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therap y. 
Non-measurable disease.  
All other lesions are considered non -measurable, including small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short 
axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -
measurable include: leptome ningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_143985].  
Target lesions.  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two 
lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified 
as target lesions  
6.1.3 Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease)  including any 
measurable lesions over and above the five target lesions should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted  throughout follow -up. Methods for 
Evaluation

6.1.4 Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.   
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological l ymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (the sum may not be “0” if there are target nodes).  Determined by 
[CONTACT_43897] 4 weeks apart. There 
can be no appearance of new lesi ons. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : > 20% increase in the SLD taking as 
reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) 
and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir.   
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the s mallest sum 
LD since the treatment started. There can be no unequivocal new 
lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must 
be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
  
 Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (Non -CR/Non -PD): 
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
  
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one o r more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as ref erence

 for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The subject’s best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

CR = complete response, NE = not evaluable, PD  = progressive disease  
A ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  
 
6.1.5 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criter ia are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The du ration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until t he criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

 6.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progre ssion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Bone Lesions:   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Progression of bone lesions will be defined according to the 
PCWG2 criterion:  
 Appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions in Bone scan, confirmed 
by a repeat bone scan in ≥ 8 weeks.  
 The Appearance of 2 new lesion s on the 6  week scan will require ≥2 
additional new lesions in a repeat bone scan ≥ 8 weeks apart.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Response of bone lesions will be defined by [CONTACT_5640] a complete 
resolution (CR) at the metastatic sites or partial resolution (PR) of 
radiotracer uptake by a radiologist.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Pathologic Fracture:  
Any clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_699247], CT or MRI as appropriate and if confirmed by a 
radiologist, will constitute progression.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_699248] :  
Any clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_699249] (CT myelography if patient is not eligible 
for MRI) as appropriate and if confirmed by a radiologist, will constitut e 
progression.  
6.1.7 Time to Progression (TTP)  
TTP is measured from the time treatment is started (week 0) until the first date 
that progressive di sease is objectively documented as defined by [CONTACT_699308] 6.1.4.  
6.1.8 Measurement of Immunologic R esponse:   
Reaching an immunologic endpoint by [CONTACT_699309] (as compared to historically reported values for 
sipuleucel -T administration alone) or abscopal radiographic response.  Immune 
response wil l be measured using ELISpot assay, T -cell proliferation assay or 
ELISA.  The assays will first be calibrated by [CONTACT_699310] -treatment and an increase of >95th 
percentile will be considered a positi ve response.  To reach the immunologic end 
point for this trial, there has to be a >100% increase in immune response as 
measured by [CONTACT_699311] -T is administered alone as 
reported by  [CONTACT_699296]. a. [32] for patients treated in the IMPACT trial:  
 ELISpot Assay (wit h PA2024 and PAP) showed that the median # of 
spots were 12, 5 and 8 a t Wks 6, 14 and 26 respectively with wk 0 
showing  0 spots for PA2024;  A 100% increase in the median 
number of spots from these numbers after normalizing to control (pre -
treatment value s) at their respective time points will constitute 
reaching the endpoint.  
 T-Cell proliferation (3H -Thymidine) assay showed a median T -Cell 
Stimulation Index (SI) of 20 at Wk 6 and 18 at Wk 14 and 12 at Wk

 26; therefore a 100% increase of SI from these val ues at their 
respective time points after normalization to control (pre -treatment 
values) will constitute reaching the endpoint.  
 ELISA showing an increase in >1:400 increase in the titer of antibody 
to PA2024 is reported by [CONTACT_699296].al [32], therefore an increase of 
1:[ADDRESS_949369] will be counted as evidence of an 
immunologic response and will be defined as radiographic response at non -
treated sites  
 CT measurement of >50% decrease in diameter of a non -target soft -
tissue or visceral lesions (RECIST 1.1) as defined above  
 PR or CR as defined in (Section 6.1.4) and per RECIST 1.1.  
 Resolution of bone lesions in bone scan or a significant improvement 
in Bone scan as assessed by a radiologist.  
 Since, it may be  very difficult to assess a radiographic response in 
prostate cancer blastic lesions, if there are no progression of disease 
(as defined above) > [ADDRESS_949370] deviation from the Median TTP (14.6 
wks), it will also constitute as evidence of a durable immune 
response.   
6.1.9 PFS:   
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the length of time from start of 
treatment (week 0) to the time of disease progression (as defined in Section 6) or 
death from any cause.   
6.1.10  bPFS:  
Biochemical progression -free survival (bPFS)  is defined as the time from start of 
treatment (week 0) to the time of PSA disease progression with PSA progression 
defined as the first documented date of an increase in PSA by > 2ng/ml from 
baseline AND an increase >25% from baseline value that is confirmed  by a 
second measurement >3 weeks apart according to the recommendations of 
PCWG2 [49], or death from any cause.  
6.1.11  OS:  
OS is defined as the duration of time from star t of treatment (week 0) to the time 
of death.  
6.1.12  Prostate cancer specific survival (PCaSS):  
PCaSS  is defined as the percentage of patients who have not died from prostate 
cancer at the time of analysis and will be calculated according to the following 
equati on:

 6.2 Quality of Life :  
6.2.1 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -P (FACT -P) 
Patient -reported functional status will be assessed with prostate cancer subscales of 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT -P) (See appendix for 
form) . The FACT -P is a 39 -item questionnaire that uses 5 -point Likert -type response 
choices (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 =somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). It will 
take less than 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire. The Trial Outcome Indices 
(TOI) also will be utilized to measure the summed functional well -being, physical well -
being, and the additional concerns (prostate) subscales of the FACT -P [64, 65]. A 5-
point deterioration in the FACT -P TOI between pre -treatment and at year 1 will be 
considered clinically significant [66].  
 
The first analysis of change in QOL from baseline to 6 weeks will only be performed on 
patients who are still alive at  6 weeks. Changes in QOL will be also analyzed using all 
available data at pre study, 6 months and one year with semiparametric  generalized 
estimating equations (GEE).  
 
Additionally, similarly we will also compare the percentage of patients with an effect 
size for the change in FAPSI (FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index) scores 
between pre -treatment and 1 months whic h will allow  us to compare the percentage of 
patients whose functional status remains more similar to baseline levels.  
6.2.2 EQ-5D  
The EQ -5D is a patient self -administrated questionnaire that takes approximately 5 
minutes to complete  (See appendix for form) . The first part  consists of 5 items covering 
5 dimensions including:  mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. Each dimension can be graded on 3 levels: 1 -no problems, 2 -
moderate problems, and 3 -extreme problems. Health states are de fined by [CONTACT_699312] 5 dimensions, generating 243 health states 
to which unconsciousness and death are added.  
 
The 5 -item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0, “Worst health 
state,” and 1, “Best heal th state.” The index score or the cost -utility equation can be 
used in the quality adjusted survival analysis depending on the health state(s) of 
interest.  
6.[ADDRESS_949371] effectiveness  data collection : 
Health care utilization data needed to assess costs will be obt ained from treatment 
records.  Additionally, in order to assess the treatment related indirect costs and patient 
out of pocket costs, at the first follow up visit  6 weeks after the completion of cycle 3 
Sipuleucel -T(see Appendix VII).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] :.  For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699250], impatient physician 
costs will be estimated by [CONTACT_699313] -based 
Medicare Fee Schedule to billed procedures in the physician billing records.   
Treatment Cost : Direct costs of radiation treatment including consultation, simulation, 
treatment planning, and treatment delivery.  Patient bills related to treatment will be 
obtained and estimated by [CONTACT_572790] -specific cost -to-charge 
ration from  Medicare cost reports as described above.  
Emergency Room visits : The date of ER visit and name [CONTACT_444246], and whether the 
ER visit resulted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  ER costs will be estimated using Medicare 
average payment rates for facility and ph ysician charges, using the merged MEDPAR 
and MBS data as described above.

 Physician  and Clinic Visits : The date of the visit, the name [CONTACT_699334], and the service provided (physician exam, lab test, physical therapy, etc.).  Cost s 
for physician and clinic visits will be calculated based on billing records obtained for such 
visits, using Medicare payment rates for procedures indicated in the clinic billing records.   
Medications : Prescription drugs used, including dosage strength a nd frequency of 
administration.  Information about name, dose, and frequency of all prescription 
medications will be recorded.  The medications used by [CONTACT_699314].  Unit costs for these drugs will be estimated as t he “AWP” 
price published in the Red Book less 15%.  Outpatient drug costs will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_572792][INVESTIGATOR_699251].  Note that costs of drugs administered t hrough a clinic 
(e.g., reimbursed under Medicare Part B) are included under “clinic visit costs” and 
impatient drug costs are included under “inpatient facility costs.”  For example: Cost 
estimated for the Sipuleucel -T infusions will be based on Medicare a llowable utilizing J 
code J3490 and associated facility charges for administration of Sipuleucel -T.  
 
6.4 Safety/tolerability  
  Analyses will be performed for all subjects  having received at least one dose of study 
therapy . The study will use the CTCAE version  4.0 for reporting of non -hematologic 
adverse events ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ) and modified criteria  for 
hematologic adverse events.

expected or unexpected.  
Acute Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring in the time pe riod from the signing of the informed consent,

All non -hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The 
CTCAE v4 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
 
Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the 
Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_699316] d below.   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
 
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the patient unabl e to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
7.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A “serious” advers e event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is immediately  life-threatening.  
(The subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is an important medical event  
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the subject , may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse ev ent. The event may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home; convulsions t hat may not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.  
 
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_283095]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A 
serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the 
research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under study and 
events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious 
adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car 
accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263996] a serious 
adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end -stage 
cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263997] -specified 
period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse 
event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of the study.  
1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579]. Note: If 
events occur during a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], that prolong the existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], those events should be evaluated and/or reported as SAEs.   
2 NCI define s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263999] 24 hours. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615487]. 
For example: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114582] a patient is admitted for observation or minor 
treatment (e.g. hydration) and released in less than 24 hours. Furthermore, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699252] a routine AE or in an expedited report.  
7.2.4 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):  
The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risk s to subjects or others” is found, but not 
defined in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 
56.108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_949378], which is defined in 21  CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from 
the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets ALL three (3) of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given (a) the res earch procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research

7.4 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4) .  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE may NOT be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

7.5.1 Expedited Reporting  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] [ADDRESS_949384] administration of the study drug .  
 Suspected ad verse reactions will also be reported to Dendreon Cor poration 
at [PHONE_14538] and FDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  
 The IRB must be notified within 10 business days of “any unanticipated 
problems involving ri sk to subjects or others” (UPR/UP IRSO) . 
The following events meet the definition of UPR:  
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), 
which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_89644], 
involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly relate d to the 
research procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk.  
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research sub ject. 
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated 
sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an 
unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research.  
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may i nvolve risk to the subject or 
others.  
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_079].  
7.5.2 Routine Reporting  
 All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are unrelated 
to the study participation - are to be reported annually as part of regular data

8.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
8.1 Sipuleucel -T 
 Other names for the drug(s):  Provenge  
 
 Classification - type of agent:  autologous cellular immunotherapy  
 
 Mode of action:  Sipuleuc el-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy. While the 
precise mechanism of action is unknown, Sipuleucel -T is designed to induce an 
immune response targeted against PAP, an antigen expressed in most prostate 
cancers. During ex vivo culture with PAP -GM-CSF, APCs take up and process the 
recombinant target antigen into small peptides that are then displayed on the APC 
surface.  
 
 Storage and stability:  Sipuleucel -T arrive s in a cardboard shippi[INVESTIGATOR_249829] a special 
insulated polyurethane container inside. The insulated container and gel packs within 
the container are designed to maintain the appropriate transportation and storage 
temperature of Sipuleucel -T until infusion. Once the Sipuleucel -T infusion bag is 
removed from the insulated container, it should rem ain at room temperature for no 
more than 3 hours.  
 
 Protocol dose:  Each dose of sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million 
autologous CD54+ cells activated with PAP -GM-CSF 
 
 Preparation:  Upon receipt, the outer cardboard shippi[INVESTIGATOR_699259] -specific labels located on the top of the insulated 
container. Infusion must begin prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_699260]. Once the patient is prepared for 
infusi on and the cell product disposition form has been received, remove the 
sipuleucel -T infusion bag from the insulated container and inspect the bag for signs 
of leakage. Contents of the bag will be slightly cloudy, with a cream -to-pi[INVESTIGATOR_100209]. 
Gently mix and re-suspend the contents of the bag, inspecting for clumps and clots. 
Small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Do not 
administer if the bag leaks or if clumps remain in the bag. Prior to Sipuleucel -T 
infusion, match the p atient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the cell product 
disposition form and the Sipuleucel -T infusion bag.  
 
 Route of administration for this study:  IV infusion  
 
 Incompatibilities: There are no known incompatibilities  of sipuleucel -T. 
 
 Availabil ity: Commercially available from Dendreon Corporation.  
 
 Side effects: The most commonly reported toxicity for s ipuleucel -T (incidence ≥ 15%) 
are chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, joint ache, and headache. Acute infusion 
reactions (reported within 1 day of infusion) included, but were not limited to, fever, 
chills, respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (dyspnea, hypoxia, and bronchospasm), nausea, vomiting, 
fatigue, hypertension, and tachycardia. Please refer the package insert for a detailed 
list of adverse reactions.

9.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
The goal of the planned labor atory correlative studies is to  measure the indu ced immune 
response to not only PAP but to other prostate cancer antigens as well (see section 1.5 for 
detail).  In addition, the correlative studies will evaluate the immune response generated by 
[CONTACT_511313] -T and the augmentation of t he anti -tumor immune response . The submission of 
collected whole blood before, during and post treatment at 8wk intervals is mandatory. Patient 
specimen may be shipped to companies or outside institutions to perform specialized assays, a 
non-extensive list of which is provided  below.  Specimens will be shipped de -identified.

partic ipation in this clinical trial in which case they will then be destroyed . 
9.1.1 Whole blood sample: Patient’s whole blood  will be collected in EDTA ( Lavender  
top) tubes f or ~ 100 ml at baseline  (pre-study) , after SABR , at [ADDRESS_949386] 
treatment (post treatment defined as being after administration of cycle 3 
Sipuleucel -T), at [ADDRESS_949387] treatment . In addition, 10 ml will 
be collected in anti -coagulant -free tubes for the collection of sera.  The blood will 
be processed  by [CONTACT_7891] (1000g, 15min , 4oC), collecting the supernatant 
and freezing at -80oC in [ADDRESS_949388] protocol. Briefly, 
the cell suspension will be carefully placed on 10ml polystyrene tube containing 
1ml ficoll and centrifuged ( 400g,  30min , RT).  Collect the PBMC region from the 
ficoll and washed 3x with PBS. Count and freeze cells in 5 aliquots  with 
10%DMSO  90%FBS in -80oC.  
9.2 Assay Methodology  
9.2.1 Elispot: IFN- ELISpot assays will be  performed according to manufacturer’s 
protocol using a commercial ELISpot kit  (MabTECH) . Brieﬂy, 96 well plates are 
coated overnight with 0.015 mg/ml of an anti -human IFN -g monoclonal antibody.   
PBMC from patients will be incubated in triplicates wells and stimulated in the 
presence of either PA2024 (10µg/ml) , protein lysate from patient biopsy (50µg/ml)  
or 5 ng/ml PMA and 0.5 ng/ml ionomycin  as positive control an d albumin as 
negative control .  For ELISPOT assays, plates are incubated for 48 hours, 
washed, probed with biotinylated anti -IFNg, further washed, and then incubated 
with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase. Spot development is achieved with 5 -
bromo -4-chloro -3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT; Invitrogen) 
and spots are enumerated by [CONTACT_699317].  
9.2.2 ELISA : In this procedure, purified antigen (PAP imunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], PA2024, 
PSA or etc.) is first adsorbed to an EIA 96 well micro plate (Fischer).  P atient 
plasma is then added to each well as a source of primary antibody and serially 
diluted.  After extensive washes, detection enzyme (HRP) -linked anti -human mAb 
is then added to each well and allowed to bind.  Appropriate substrate i s then 
added to each well and c olor development occurs within 5 -60 min.  UV Microplate 
Reader will be used to read the plates  
9.2.3 3H-thymidine Proliferation Assay: PBMC from patients will be incubated in a 
similar manner as above for five days at 37 oC then ov ernight with 0.5 mCi tritiated

 3H-thymidine, harvested onto a glass -fiber filter using a [ADDRESS_949389] betaplate 
counter. The degree of antigen -specific clonal T cell expans ion will be expressed 
as a stimulation index (SI) of the ratio of 3H-thymidine  incorporation by [CONTACT_699318]2024 compared with media controls.  An alternate method 
utilizing FACS analysis with carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester 
(CFS E) is also available [69]. 
9.2.4 Chromium Release Cytotoxicity Assays : For cell -mediated cytotoxicity 
analysis, A 50 µl sample of 51Cr-labeled target cells (LNCaP or PC 3 human 
prostate cancer cell) is mixed with 100µl of effector cells (patient PBMC) at 
various target to effector ratio (E:T ratios). After centrifugation at 100 X G, the 
cells are incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. The radioactivity of culture supernatant is 
meas ured using a gamma counter and percentage of cytotoxicity is calculated . 
For antibody -dependent cytotoxicity analysis this procedure will be performed with 
patient’s plasma instead of PBMC and the percentage of cytotoxicity is calculated  
in similar manner . An alternate and non -radioactive labeling method utilizes 
GAPDH enzyme release from lysed cells  called Bioluminescence Non Radioactive 
Cytotoxicity Assay (aCella -TOX, T Cell Technology, INC ) [70, 71]. 
9.2.5 Flow cytometric analysis ( FACS):  For FACS  analysis of  cell-surface molecules, 
the cell samples are stained with fluorescent dye – conjugated m onoclonal 
antibodies  against the selected markers on ice followed by [CONTACT_699319] 4% 
paraformaldahyde . Data are acquired on a LSRII  (BD Biosciences) and analyzed 
using FACSDiva  software (BD Biosciences).  The PBMC of each patient before 
and after treatment  will be analyzed to iden tify the relative sub -population of CTLs, 
regulatory T -Cells, effector memory T cells, MDSCs, neutrophils and NK cells 
utilizing appropriate cell surface markers (see section 1.5).   
9.2.6 Immunohistochemical staining  (IHC): Standard immunohistochemistry stainin g 
procedure will be performed using the Benchmark XT automated stainer 
(Ventana) for both antibodies. Briefly, formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue 
sections will be cut at 3 -4 micron and air -dried overnight. The sections will be 
deparaffinized, rehydra ted, and subjected to heat -induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_241154]. 
Sections will then be incubated with appropriate primary antibody. For signal 
detection, ultraView universal detection system (Ventana) will be used. The slides 
will be developed using 3 -3’-diaminobenzi dine chromogen and counterstained 
with hematoxylin. Appropriate positive and negative controls will be utilized for 
each run of immunostains.  The evaluation of the immunostaining will be carried 
out by a genitourinary pathologist without knowledge of any clinicopathologic data. 
Only nuclear reactivity will be considered positive. An H score will be assigned as 
the product of average intensity of staining (0 for negative, 1 for weakly positive, 2 
for moderately positive, and 3 for strongly positive) and ext ent of 
immunoexpression (0 -100% percentage of cells staining). In addition,   Dual-
antibody ISH will be performed to identify and analyze TILs, CTL (CD3+,CD8+), 
Tregs (CD4+FoxP3), DC (CD11c) , NK/T (CD3+, CD1d), neutrophils (CD11b, 
Ly6G} and MDSC (CD14+,CD1 1b) in the tumor tissue before and after treatment , 
when available  (see section 1.5) . 
9.2.7 Serum Cytokine Analysis:  Multiplex cytokine analysis in patient’s plasma will be 
performed in precoated 96 well plates (Human TH1/TH2  10 plex ultrasensitive 
assay, Meso S cale Discovery – MSD, Maryland, [LOCATION_003]) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. 25 µ L of diluent 2 i s dispersed into each well. The 
plate is sealed and incubated by [CONTACT_699320] 30 minutes at RT.

 10.[ADDRESS_949392] -EFFECTIVENESS  
10.1 Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Analysis  
The study design is to prospectively analyze the HRQOL among patients wi th mCRPC 
treated with SABR and sipuleucel T. While hypofractionation is hypothesized to yield greater 
tumor cell kill, it may also increase the normal tissue toxicity, in which case there may be a 
decrease in HRQOL. The primary normal tissue toxicities in patients receiving radiation 
depend  on the location of the treatment. Prior studies have demonstrated that the most 
sensitive and clinically meaningful method for accurately capturing the normal tissue 
toxicities is via patients reported outcomes (PROs), s uch as HRQOL.  
 
In this non -randomized trial, we plan to  assess the FACT -P at 3 specific time points to 
minimize patient burden: baseline (pretreatment), first follow up visit , and at one year  (See 
Appendix ).  In order to analyze the QOL, we plan to use a b rief, validated instrument that is 
user friendly and has clinical relevance [72].  FACT -G is a measure that sums t he functional 
well-being  (FWB), physical well-being  (PWB),  the social/family well -being (S/FWB), and 
emotional well-being (EMB).  FACT -P adds to the FACT –G (27 items) by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] [ADDRESS_949393] has been 
translated into 26 languages and is available free of charge to ins titutions with the 
completion of an agreement to share data, accessible at 
http://www.facit.org/translation/licensure.aspx .  
 
In a HRQOL study focused on patient with advan ced prostate cancer, the components of the 
FACT -P which showed a frequency greater t han 17% were retained in a measure renamed 
the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index -8 (FAPSI -8) [66].  Since pain was a major 
component of this simplified scale, we  propose obtaining a Brief Pain Inventory to 
supplement the pain assessment of the FACT -P especially given the nature of this protocol 
likely accruing patient s with minimally painful osseous metastases [73].   
 
In addition, the EQ -5D and modified BPI [INVESTIGATOR_699262].  EQ -5D 
is a standardized instrument for use as a measure  of health outcome. Applicable to a wide 
range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a 
single index value for health status.   The US version of the EQ -5D will be used, to enable 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_526629] -QoL scores f rom EQ -5D scores into health state utility scores 
(ranging from 0 to 1) for the US population.  These utility scores are needed for cost -utility 
analysis (estimates of costs per “quality adjusted” life -year gained) [74, 75]. 
 
HRQoL of patients with mCR PC is unfortunately not well described in the literature for either 
treatment modalities in this study or other standard  of care treatments as well. [76].   
 
A Canadian phase II study of docetaxel administered every 3 weeks with prednisone in men 
with metastatic hormone -refractory pr ostate cancer progressing after 
mitoxantrone/prednisone assessed quality of life as a secondary endpoint.  A significant 
improvement (p=0.018) from 66 % pretreatment to 75% post 7 cycles of docetaxel was 
reported in the 30 patients treated on the trial [67]. The overall quality of life was maintained 
in these patients as well despi[INVESTIGATOR_699263].  
 
In another phase II study  looking at mitoxantrone, estramustine, and vinorelbine (MEV) 
versus 13 -cis retinoic acid (CRA), interferon -alpha2b (IFN), and paclitaxel (Tax) 
CRA/IFN/TAX,  the patients treated in the CRA/IFN/TAX arm experienced a significant 
decrease in HRQOL as measure d by [CONTACT_92349] -P [78].  This is one of the few studies that 
reports QoL in patients treated with mCRPC.

 However, clearly, the lack of radiation given in the above  mentioned studies and the various 
systemic treatments do not allow for the abovementioned studies to be appropriate 
comparisons for our study.   
 
There is little reported on the effect on HRQOL for patients treated with Sipuleucel T, 
abiraterone, MDV3100,  docetaxel, carbazitaxel, or other emerging treatment options for 
patients with mCRPC.  Regarding the pain response to various treatment options for 
osseous metastases in the metastatic prostate cancer, there are innumerous reports [48].  
Thus, we p ropose utilizing the FACT -P and a modified BPI [INVESTIGATOR_699264]2 [49]. .     
 
Additionally, in order to calculate the indirect costs associated with hypofractionated 
radiation treatment, a single administration of a short economic questionnaire will take place 
at the first available follow up.  This questionnaire which has been adopted for administration 
in the [LOCATION_002]  has been used in economic assessment in rural Canadian cancer 
health service research [79].   
10.[ADDRESS_949394] -Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)  
For the primary CEA analysis, we will estimate cost accumulated within [ADDRESS_949395] a reasonable number of people surviving at  that time.  
 
Since patients are enrolled into the study over time and some patients are still alive at the 
end of the study, their survival time and costs are censored.  Due to the presence censoring, 
we cannot use a simple average of the patients’ total c osts, a simple average of the patients’ 
costs for those with complete cost information, or a Kaplan -Meier estimator on censored 
costs, since these all produce biased estimators of the mean costs [74].  Instead, we will use 
the inverse -probability weighting method to calculate average costs. [75, 80]  The 
assumption used in this method is that censoring is independent of the surviv al time, or cost 
collection process, which is often satisfied in well -conducted clinical trials. If the new 
treatment can both extend patients’ survival time (or quality -adjusted survival time), and 
save costs at the same time, the new treatment will be pr eferred to the current standard 
treatment under any willingness to pay threshold.  
 
However, if the new treatment extends survival time but costs more, cost -effectiveness 
analysis provides an estimate of the incremental cost of greater incremental effective ness.  
For traditional cost -effectiveness analysis, treatment effectiveness is measured simply as 
survival time.  The incremental cost -effectiveness ratio indicates the additional cost required 
to attain one additional year of survival.  For cost -utility a nalysis, treatment effectiveness is 
measured as quality -adjusted survival time (which accounts for the impact of treatment on 
both mortality and morbidity, including any differences in adverse affects of treatment 
affecting HR -QoL).  For cost -utility analy sis, the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio 
indicates the additional cost required to attain one additional year of quality adjusted 
survival.

 10.3 Quality adjusted survival time:  
The quality -adjusted survival time estimates need to account for the presence of 
censoring.  Due to the induced informat ive censoring problem, the ordinary survival 
method (e.g., Kaplan -Meier estimator) cannot be applied in this case [75,80,81].  
Accordingly, we will use the inverse -probability weighted method of Zhao and Tsiatis to 
carry out the survival time analysis [75, 80].  To estimate quality adjusted survival time, 
data from EQ -5D will first be translated into utility measures. These measures are 
obtained at discrete time points, so they will  be interpolated into the time intervals 
between the visits. The quality -adjusted survival time is just an integration of the utility 
measures over a patient’s survival time, or until the time limit similar as the cost 
calculation, whichever occurs earlier . 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION S 
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is an open label phase II non -randomized single arm prospective clinical trial. The 
primary end point is TTP, while the secondary end points include improvement in 
immunologic response, PFS, bP FS, PCaSS, OS, quality  of life and cost -effectiveness 
(Please see endpoint details in section 2 and 6)   
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that Sipuleucel -T + SABR will 
improve the reported TTP with Sipuleucel -T alone  by 80%. The TTP for Sipuleucel -T as 
reported by [CONTACT_699323]. al. is 14 .6 weeks  [10]. Assuming an 80% improvement wo uld lead 
to a TTP of 26.2 8 weeks. According to t he CRAB website 
(https://stattools.crab.org/Calculators/oneArmSurvivalColored.html ), the estimated 
sample size  with [ADDRESS_949397] significance level of 10% and 80% power, assuming that 
the accrual time is 3 years, with a follow-up time of 4 years after the end of accrual , is 20. 
The secondary endpoints (i.e. OS, PFS etc.) will be followed for a total of four years.   The 
estimate d response rate using [ADDRESS_949398] 
error of 11.2%. 
11.3 Data Analyses Plans  
This is a single -arm P hase II trial of SABR  for mCRPC p atients. TTP, OS, bPFS,  PCaSS  
and duration of response will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach along with 
the 95% confidence interval using Greenwood variance formula. Exact binomial method 
will be used to calcula te the response rate and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval.   One-sample log -rank test  [82] will be used to test if the survival endpoints such 
as TTP is significantly different from those in the historical con trol reported in Kantoff et . 
al [10].   
Wilcoxon signed -rank test  will be used to test if the median number of spots in Elispot of 
the PBMC collected from patients  at 6, 14 and 26  weeks are at 100% increase in the 
median number of spots by [CONTACT_699324]  [32]. T-Cell 
proliferation SI and ELISA antibody titer will also be evaluated in the same manner. 
Statistical analysis plans for cost -effectiveness and health -related  quality adjusted life are 
described in Section 10.

The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring 
Commi ttee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all 
UTSW SCCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local 
serious adverse events and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_699266] e events on a quarterly basis.  The quality assurance activity for the Clinical 
Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure 
data integrity and regulatory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon 
request.  
 
The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part 
of the DSMC to conduct regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are  
reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting.  In this way, frequency of DSMC 
monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level is determined by [CONTACT_375299] a number of factors such as the phase of the study; the type of 
investigational  agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required to 
ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol -
specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these principles.  
 
Clinical trials are assessed f or safety on a continual basis throughout the life of the trial. 
All SAE’s and any AEs that are unexpected and possibly/likely related to study 
participation are reported to UTSW IRB through an electronic research system per UTSW 
IRB guidelines. SAEs are r eported to the sponsor per specific sponsor requirements. 
These SAEs are reported to the SCC C DSMC on a real time basis. All local SAEs will be 
reported to the SCCC DSMC. SAE reports can be either scanned/emailed to the

Page 5 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 1. PURPOSE, BACKGROUND, AND OBJECTIVES 1.1. PURPOSE This is a safety study of a commercially available silver-nylon burn dressing (Silverlonâ Dressing, Argentum Medical, Geneva, IL) in a cohort of patients likely to develop radiation dermatitis from undergoing radiation therapy as a treatment for breast cancer.  The goal is to establish the safety of the use of Silverlonâ as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_670516]. While the results are expected to be applicable to any cancer site requiring radiation therapy, we will select patients with breast cancer as a group most easily studied for radiation dermatitis.    1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Of the 1.6 million patients newly diagnosed with cancer annually in the [LOCATION_002], approximately 50% will receive radiation therapy at some point in their treatment. Up to 95% of these patients will experience adverse skin reactions, collectively termed radiation dermatitis. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Up to 60% of patients with breast radiation will develop Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring grade 2 or 3 toxicity and 30-40% of unselected patients will develop moist desquamation (8).  Because of the almost universal occurrence of radiation dermatitis in patients undergoing radiation therapy, there is great interest in finding skin care products that can prevent or ameliorate this injury while providing an optimal environment to assure safe and effective tissue repair. Currently, there are no effective products that prevent radiation dermatitis; therefore, emphasis has shifted to treatment of visible signs of sustained radiation-induced skin reaction.  Unfortunately, no standard treatment recommendations exist for the prevention of radiation skin toxicity (9). There is ‘significant heterogeneity in clinical practice’ (10), a ‘relative lack of high-quality evidence to support specific management strategies’ (10), and no product is universally successful or recognized as best. There are hundreds of products used to treat radiation dermatitis, nearly all being employed ‘off-label’.  There are approximately 20 products with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pre-marketing clearance for the indication of radiation dermatitis.  Most are passive protective hydrogel emulsions or dressings.   All have been approved through the ‘substantial equivalence’ 510(k) pathway, without clinical trials in radiation dermatitis prior to approval. Silver-nylon dressings (Silverlon® Wound/Burn Contact [CONTACT_670543], Argentum Medical, Geneva IL) are comprised of a single layer of knitted nylon fiber substrate coated with metallic silver. Commercially marketed since 2003, Silverlonâ dressings have 16 FDA 510(k) premarketing clearances, with both over-the-counter and prescription indications. Silverlon® dressings have also been the standard US military dressings for burns and traumatic injuries for over 15 years (11) and are the standard of care for transatlantic aeromedical evacuation of burn patients (12,13). Silverlon® Dressings are indicated for use up to 7 days for partial and full thickness wounds including traumatic wounds, surgical wounds (donor and graft sites, incisions), first and second degree thermal burns, as well as dermal ulcers (stage I-IV pressure sores, venous stasis ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers), vascular access or peripheral IV sites, orthopedic external pin sites and wound drain sites.  Additionally, Silverlon® Dressings are indicated for the management of infected wounds, as the silver in the dressing provides an antimicrobial barrier that may be helpful in managing these wounds. Silverlon® Dressings are a non-adherent wound contact [CONTACT_670544]. (14)   
    
Page 6 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Several clinical studies performed in Canada have demonstrated the utility of silver-nylon dressings in the management of radiation dermatitis. Vuong et al (15) performed a Phase II study of 15 patients with anal or gynecologic cancers who received radiation therapy of 45-54 Gy in 25-30 fractions with concurrent chemotherapy.  In this population, the expected incidence of radiation dermatitis is 100% with 43-78% of patients progressing to severe (RTOG grade 3-4) radiation dermatitis (15).   Silver-nylon dressings were placed starting on day 1 of radiation therapy and maintained continuously until 2 weeks after conclusion of the radiation therapy.  Dressings were removed during radiation application and for bathing.  A control group received silver sulfadiazine starting at the occurrence of symptomatic dermatitis.  The mean RTOG radiation dermatitis severity score was 1.15 (SD= 0.4) for silver nylon group compared to 2.62 (SD 0.48) in the control group (p < 0.0001).   A follow-up Phase III study by [CONTACT_670545] (16) had similar results.  Forty-two anal or rectal cancer patients undergoing high-dose radiation therapy of [ADDRESS_905858]-therapy.  Silver sulfadiazine was started at the occurrence of grade 1 radiation dermatitis.  The Silver-nylon group RTOG scores at the end of radiation treatment were significantly lower than the silver sulfadiazine group (1.67 vs. 2.53, p= 0.01). The silver-nylon group also had fewer and shorter breaks in treatment than the control group (16).    Studies in head/neck cancer and breast cancer have yielded less clear results because of methodologic flaws. Vavassis et al (17) evaluated silver-nylon dressings in 12 patients with squamous carcinoma of the head and neck undergoing radiation therapy.  Silver-nylon dressings were placed on one side of the neck and silver sulfadiazine on the contralateral side of the neck. Silver-nylon dressings and silver sulfadiazine were initiated at the point where radiation dermatitis was assessed as RTOG grade 2 or greater. Nine of the 12 patients developed radiation dermatitis of RTOG grades 3 or 4. There was no difference in improvement in RTOG grade between control (silver sulfadiazine) and silver-nylon sides.  Pain control was subjectively better in the silver-nylon side for 8 of 12 patients.  Furthermore, half (6/12) of the patients stopped using silver sulfadiazine and applied silver-nylon to both sides of the neck because of better pain control.  Aquino-Parsons et al (8) studied silver-nylon dressings in [ADDRESS_905859] dose to the tumor bed.  The experimental arm used silver-nylon dressings on the inframammary fold continuously placed except during radiation therapy and bathing, starting at day 6 of radiation therapy and continuing until 14 days after completion of therapy.  The control group used twice-daily application of moisturizing cream (with brand chosen by [CONTACT_102]), along with topi[INVESTIGATOR_670517], and saline compresses, hydrogel or silver sulfadiazine for moist desquamation. Moist desquamation occurred in 38% of patients with no difference in incidence, size or RTOG score of moist desquamation between treatment and control arms.  Patients reported less itching in the silver-nylon arm at completion of the course of radiation therapy and at one week afterwards. The methodologic flaws of this study included withholding treatment until day 6 of radiation therapy and using the silver-nylon dressing only on the inframammary fold rather than on the entire radiated field.     
    
Page 7 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Based on US Military experience and utility for multiple injury conditions, the Department of Health and Human Services / Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has placed Silverlonâ in the National Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829], and, since 2013, has funded multiple preclinical studies to broaden FDA-cleared indications for mass-casualty use.  In July, 2019, Silverlonâ obtained the first-ever FDA clearance for the treatment of sulfur-mustard chemical weapons burns.  BARDA and Argentum maintain an active research program seeking FDA clearance for radiation injuries including porcine preclinical studies of cutaneous radiation syndrome.  The present study, part of the BARDA radiation effort, seeks to perform clinical studies leading to FDA clearance for the indication of radiation dermatitis.  Our previous research in multiple animal models (rat, hairless guinea pig, Gottingen minipig), multiple wound types (thermal burns, chemical burns and open wounds), and several different wound depths (superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness and full thickness) demonstrate that there is no adverse or systemic effect of topi[INVESTIGATOR_670518].  In all animal studies, following extended application of Silverlon® dressings, silver ion was not detectable in blood, spleen, liver or kidney samples obtained at autopsy. (18,19)   The present study, a small human safety study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_670519]-nylon dressings to patients undergoing radiation therapy, is intended to complete our extensive safety experience with silver nylon dressings in support of an FDA 510(k) application for the additional indication for human radiation dermatitis.  1.3. OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective: To investigate the safety of Silverlon® dressing in patients throughout their prescribed course of radiation therapy and after radiation therapy.  • Hypothesis: We do not expect any adverse effects from extended use of Silverlon® dressing during and after radiation therapy.  • Primary Outcome Measures: Adverse reactions/events documented by [CONTACT_670546] “probable” or “definite” related to Silverlon® Dressing (Weekly AE/Chart Review Source Doc).  Secondary Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of managing radiation dermatitis with Silverlon® dressing. • Hypothesis: We expect that Silverlon® will be a feasible therapeutic modality for managing radiation dermatitis. We expect high compliance rate during RT and slightly lower when skin symptoms are not presented (i.e., before RT and post-RT). We do not expect any withdrawals due to adverse reactions to the dressing.   • Secondary Outcome Measures: Compliance; Withdrawal rate due to dressing.   Exploratory Objective: To monitor the severity of radiation dermatitis and patient quality of life during use of Silverlon® dressing throughout radiation therapy and after radiation therapy. • Exploratory Outcome Measures: radiation dermatitis severity (RTOG Score & Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS)); DLQI

OVERVIEW This is a single-site, non-blinded, non-randomized safety study of patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer. This safety study will be conducted by [CONTACT_670547] & Radiation Oncology.  Radiation therapy treatment will be delivered at The University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center. The study will not address radiation dose, scheduling or application method, which will remain the province of the attending radiation oncologist.  The single intervention will be the application of Silverlon® dressing over the radiation site (i.e., whole irradiated breast area) which will start on the first day of radiation therapy and continue for 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.  The patients will wear the Silverlon® dressing all of the time, except while bathing/showering and during radiation therapy sessions. All study visits and evaluations will take place at times already scheduled for radiation therapy and will not involve additional travel solely for research purposes.   Subject participation will start just prior to the start of their prescribed course of radiation therapy and will be completed 2 weeks following completion of radiation therapy.  There are no control or placebo groups.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS This is a single site study at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center, with an accrual goal of 30 fully evaluable subjects. “Fully evaluable” as defined as completing informed consent, meeting eligibility criteria, initiating Silverlon® dressing during radiation therapy and continuing to two weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Therefore, the [ADDRESS_905860] complete full protocol procedures. Assuming a 20% withdrawal rate, we will recruit [ADDRESS_905861] year, the Wilmot Cancer Institute had 75 patients that would be eligible for this study which demonstrates our ability to reach our accrual goal. To reach this goal of 30 fully evaluable subjects, the total number of subjects approached and/or consented may reach 75 subjects.   PARTICIPANT POPULATION(S) Accrual Number: Category/Group: (Adults/Children Special/Vulnerable Populations) Consented: Maximum Number to be Consented or Reviewed/Collected/Screened Intent to Treat: Number to enroll and initiate treatment. Fully Evaluable: Number to enroll and fully complete study. Local 75/0/0 75 36 30 Study-wide 75/0/0 75 36 30 Total: 75/0/[ADDRESS_905862] be female. Approximately 99% of breast cancer diagnoses occur in adult women.  Since too few men are diagnosed with the disease to allow meaningful sub-group analyses, subject accrual will only be women (≥ 22 years of age) with breast cancer. Additionally, men are unlikely to wear a bra and the dressing would have to be held in place using another method, which is not the purpose of this study.   3.3. AGE OF SUBJECTS This study will enroll adult patients (22 years of age or older). There is no upper age limit for participation in this study. There will be no children enrolled in this study.  3.4. RACIAL AND ETHNIC ORIGINS There are no restrictions based on race or ethnicity in this study. Based upon an ethnic minority population of 16% in the six-county area of [COMPANY_002]ster, we expect [COMPANY_002]ster accruals to be at least 12% minority.

A minimum of two weeks is required between the end of chemotherapy and start of radiation therapy. • No history of previous breast or chest radiation therapy. • Subject may or may not have had surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) prior to RT. (Note: Surgery is not required for eligibility). • Subjects may be currently prescribed and receiving hormonal therapy or agents used to treat Her2-nue positive cancer (e.g., Herceptin, Kadcyla, etc). • Subjects must be able to read, speak, and understand English language (all study forms are in English). • Subjects must be able to give informed consent. • Subjects must be willing to have photographs taken of radiation-induced skin changes in the radiation treatment area.  • Subjects must be willing to wear Silverlonâ dressing and undergarment (i.e., bra) at all times, except when bathing/showering and during their radiation therapy session.  • Subjects must be willing to complete a Silverlonâ Compliance Log to document the date and time that Silverlonâ was removed and applied each day during the study.     
    
Page 12 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 3.6. EXCLUSION CRITERIA • Diagnosis of medullary or inflammatory breast cancer. • Diagnosis of tumors of the breast other than primary breast cancer (skin cancers, lymphomas, or metastatic cancers from other primary sites). • Partial breast irradiation (PBI) treatment technique is not eligible. • Concurrent chemotherapy or systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], except for hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_670520]2-neu-positive cancers (as described in inclusion criteria). • Pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Pregnant females are ineligible because pregnancy is a contraindication for RT.  All subjects of childbearing potential will be asked if they are pregnant or could be pregnant. The subject must respond “no” to continue with radiation and to participate in this clinical study. • Previous radiation to the chest or breast.  • Radiation being given for palliative purposes.  • Presence of unhealed surgical wounds, biopsy sites, open wounds in the breast or chest area. • Presence of breast infection.  • Subjects currently on anti-EGFR (human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]) therapy, such as Iressaâ (gefitinib) or Erbituxä (cetuximab, C225). • Previous diagnosis of autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, or radiosensitivity disorder.  • Presence of any active dermatological issues in radiation treatment area (i.e., fungal skin infection, dermatitis, psoriasis plaques, etc.).   • Chronic skin disease of the breast, previous breast trauma or scarring of the breast • Subjects with known sensitivity to silver or nylon. • Subjects unable or unwilling to wear Silverlonâ dressings and undergarment (i.e., bra) at all times, except while bathing/showering and during their radiation therapy session. • Subjects unable to speak, read, or understand English language (all study forms are in English).  3.7. WOMEN & CHILDREN This study will enroll women (adult and elderly). Approximately 99% of breast cancer diagnoses occur in adult women.  Since too few men are diagnosed with the disease to allow meaningful sub-group analyses, subject accrual will only be women (≥ 22 years of age) with breast cancer.  This study will not enroll children because breast cancer is primarily a disease diagnosed in adult women above the age of 21.    3.8. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS There will be no members of special or vulnerable populations enrolled in this study.     
    
Page 13 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 3.9. TARGETED ENROLLMENT This study will accrue 30 fully evaluable subjects. Assuming a 20% withdrawal rate, we will recruit 36 eligible subjects. To reach this goal of 30 evaluable subjects, the total number of subjects approached and/or consented may reach [ADDRESS_905863] year, the Wilmot Cancer Institute had 75 patients that would be eligible for this study which demonstrates our ability to reach our accrual goal. Demographics of the enrollment population has been estimated from prior University of [COMPANY_002]ster studies drawing from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_670521]. This information is provided in the following table to illustrate an anticipated patient population profile for 75 enrolled subjects at the study site.     Racial Categories Ethnic Categories    Not Hispanic or Latino Hispanic or Latino Unknown Ethnicity  Total Female Female Female Female American Indian/Alaska Native [ADDRESS_905864] (EMR) at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center by [CONTACT_3462]. Study personnel will notify the treating radiation oncologist of the eligible patients. Alternatively, study personnel will be notified of eligible patients at radiation oncology team meetings. At the patient’s CT-SIM appointment or another clinic visit in Radiation Oncology prior to the start of radiation therapy, the radiation oncologist will ask the patient if they are interested in hearing about participation in a clinical research study. Subjects must be consented at prior to the start of radiation therapy. The Silverlonâ dressing used in this study must be applied to the whole breast area that will receive radiation two days prior to the start of radiation therapy.  If the patient agrees, study personnel will meet with the patient in a meeting room or clinic room for discussion of the study with minimal disturbances. All study materials are in English, therefore all subjects must be able to read, speak, and understand English.  Current FDA, ICH, NCI, state, federal, and institutional regulations concerning informed consent will be followed.   The patient will be informed that we are conducting a study and would like to invite them to participate. The study personnel will go over the study procedures and the informed consent form. The patient will have time to ask questions, take the consent form home, and discuss with family members. The patient will be informed that participation in the study will in no way influences their prescribed course of treatment and care at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center. If the patient needs time to consider participation, the study personnel will follow-up with them by [CONTACT_305168]. Alternatively, if the patient has limited time to meet with study personnel, the patient will be given an informed consent form to take home with them and the study personnel will then then contact [CONTACT_670548] 14 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] in study participation. By [CONTACT_648], the patients will be informed that we are conducting a study and would like to invite them to participate. The patient will be offered an in-person meeting, where she is allowed to bring a companion. The study personnel can discuss the study by [CONTACT_670549]; however, the in-person meeting is required for obtaining informed consent. The informed consent form will include consent for photographs of the skin in the radiation treatment area. The photographs will be de-identified if used in publications related to this study. There will be a provision on the informed consent form for the patient to opt-out of publication of photographs.  However, patients declining consent for photographs for research purposes will be deemed ineligible for this study. If the patient agrees to participate, the patient will sign and date the informed consent, along with the study personnel obtaining consent. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the patient to take home and the original signed consent form will be placed in the subject’s study folder. An Eligibility Checklist containing inclusion and exclusion criteria will be completed and signed by [CONTACT_670550]’s study folder. A unique numerical Study ID will be given to each study subject, which will be included on all forms along with the subject’s initials. This will help de-identify the forms used for data collection and the electronic database. Additionally, during the consent process, subjects will be asked to complete a W9 form for reimbursement purposes. The subject will provide their name, mailing address, and signature [CONTACT_670579]. The consent process will be free of coercion and undue influence. Study personnel will then explain the project to the potential subjects and answer all questions.  The subject will be provided sufficient information and time make a thoughtful and rational decision on participation.  The subject will be given the opportunity to take the consent form home for review and discussion with family members before finalizing her decision.  After informed consent form is signed, subjects will be given a copy of the document, along with the phone numbers of the study personnel to call if they have further questions. The completed informed consent forms will be kept in the subject’s study folder and stored in a locked office in a locked cabinet.  4.1 REMOTE CONSENT PROCEDURES Remote informed consent will be allowed using the following steps: During an initial in-person or telemedicine meeting with the patient, the study will be discussed with the patient by [CONTACT_5944]. If the patient expresses interest in the study, a full RSRB-approved consent form will be provided to the patient. This discussion will be documented in eRecord. If the study was initially discussed at a telemedicine visit, a copy of the RSRB-approved consent form will be provided to the patient via standard mail or e-mail, per patient preference. An RSRB-approved patient letter containing the instructions for remote consenting will be included.  If the patient was seen in-person, a paper copy of the RSRB-approved consent form will be provided at the time of the in-person visit, along with a copy of the RSRB-approved patient letter containing instructions for the remote consent process. Since the next clinic visit for many patients who are consulted via telemedicine may be the start of treatment, this option is provided to reduce the need for patients to return to the clinic solely for the purpose of signing the consent form.   
    
Page 15 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] A discussion between the patient and the provider will occur after the patient has reviewed the consent form. The provider will review the scope of the subject’s participation in the study, and address any questions or concerns that the subject may have. This discussion can occur in-person, over the phone, or as a telemedicine visit. The discussion of the study and any questions patient had must be documented in an eRecord note, in addition to the patient’s decision about study participation. Documentation of patients decision regarding participation also must be documented in eRecord The patient must return a copy of the signed consent via e-mail, standard mail, or other electronic method prior to enrollment. Patient should return original signed to clinic at the next onsite visit, or via standard mail using pre-addressed and stamped envelopes that will be provided by [CONTACT_464]. In the event the patient does not provide the original consent, a new one will be signed at the next visit. The consenting MD will sign both the copy returned by [CONTACT_670551], once the patient has returned the original copy to the clinic. The date written by [CONTACT_670552], even if these dates do not match. A copy of the consents signed by [CONTACT_670553].   5. METHODS AND PROCEDURES 5.1. STUDY PROCEDURES The majority of study procedures will relate to their course of radiation therapy.  The dose, scheduling and duration of radiation therapy will be determined by [CONTACT_670554].  All study visits will take place at the time of scheduled radiation therapy sessions and will not involve additional travel.  To ensure appropriate safety precautions when conducting in-person study procedures, the process for conducting in-person visits outlined in the Guidance for Human Subject Research will be followed.  • Study personnel will keep track of all patients that are eligible for the study, all patients approached about the study, and the outcome of that discussion (Declined participation or Consented). For patients that declined participation, study personnel will indicate the reason for decline. All of this information will be entered into the electronic REDCap Screening Log for the study.    • Baseline Visit (after consent):  o Study personnel will obtain demographic and lifestyle information from the subject to complete the OnStudy Data Form. This information will include: age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, alcohol use, prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and breast size (i.e., bra size), and if they had breast reconstructive surgery before radiation therapy.

This will provide baseline quality of life and symptoms for the subject prior to the start of RT and Silverlon® Dressing. Study personnel will electronically enter the data from the form into REDCap for secure storage in the study database.  o Study personnel will review the Silverlon® Dressing Patient Instructions with the subject thoroughly to ensure the subject understands the application, use and, storage of the Silverlonâ dressing. It is important for the subject to follow the Silverlon® Dressing Patient Instructions instead of the package insert for the use of Silverlon dressing during radiation therapy and this study. The patient instruction sheet will be given to the subject with the dressings. Study personnel will show the subject how to wear the Silverlon® dressing in their bra to cover the whole breast that will be irradiated. The subject will be given two Silverlon® dressings of the appropriate size necessary to cover the whole irradiated breast. The subject will be instructed to wear the Silverlon® Dressing in their bra to cover the whole irradiated breast at all times except bathing/showering and during radiation therapy sessions. The subject will be instructed to start wearing the Silverlon® Dressing on the first day of radiation therapy. The subject will be instructed that they will receive two new Silverlon Dressings every 7 days from study personnel. Subjects will be instructed to use the same dressing for 7 days. Subjects will be instructed that if the dressing becomes soiled (i.e., dirty, odor, stain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], etc.) for any reason, they can change it to the second dressing and they should record this change in their Compliance Log. (NOTE: The first Silverlon dressings can be given to the subject prior to the first day of radiation therapy or on the first day of radiation therapy.) o Study personnel will instruct subjects that moisturizing lotions or other topi[INVESTIGATOR_670522]. However, subjects may apply moisturizing lotions or other topi[INVESTIGATOR_670523]. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_670524] 5.[ADDRESS_905865] will also be given a Silverlon® Compliance Log to document each time they remove the Silverlon® dressing and put the Silverlon® dressing on. Study personnel will write the Subject ID, Subject Initials (First, Middle, Last (FML)) on the top of each page of the Compliance Log. Study personnel will write the date the Log was given to the subject in “Log Start Date” and write the date the Log was returned in “Log End Date”. The “Log End Date” should correspond with the date that new Silverlon® dressings and new Log are dispensed to the subject (i.e., every 7 days).   o It is anticipated that Baseline Visits will involve [ADDRESS_905866]’s time. This is a paper form that the subject will take home with them and complete as necessary daily whenever the Silverlon® dressing is removed and put back on.  o Additional Silverlon® Dressing will be provided to the subject every [ADDRESS_905867] with two new Silverlon® Dressing every 7 days. For compliance reasons, subjects will return the used Silverlon® dressings and the completed Compliance Log to study personnel every 7 days when new dressings and log are dispensed.

SILVERLON® DRESSING 
    
Page 21 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] The device being evaluated is Silverlon® Burn/Wound Contact [CONTACT_670543].  The device has been commercially marketed since 2003 and has 16 FDA 510(k) clearances.  Silverlonâ has been used on hundreds of thousands of patients over the last 17 years.  For this reason, the intervention is considered a non-significant risk device. This study is being conducted to provide safety data to the FDA to support an application to specify a radiation dermatitis indication for Silverlon® Dressings. For this study, Silverlon® Dressing will be supplied by [CONTACT_670559]. Where possible, all product will come from a single lot.  Product will be sent directly to the study coordinator or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_670526].  On conclusion of the study, any unused product will be returned to Argentum Medical.  Study personnel will be responsible for storage and distribution of the Silverlonâ.  Storage will follow manufacturer’s instructions which are: “Store Silverlonâ Burn/Wound Contact [CONTACT_670560]. Keep dry. Avoid excessive heat or humidity (20). Each patient will receive the appropriate size of SilverlonÒ to cover the whole irradiated breast area. Subjects will receive two SilverlonÒ dressings at the start of the study. Since, Silverlon® dressings are indicated for use up to 7 days, two Silverlon® dressings will be dispensed to the subject every 7 days until completion of the study (i.e., 2 weeks (14 days) post-radiation therapy). The total number Silverlon® dressings dispensed to subjects will vary and be based on the length of their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Furthermore, additional Silverlon® dressing will be dispensed to the subject by [CONTACT_32236] (i.e., due to loss, damage, ran through washing machine, etc.) as necessary for them to complete the study.   For this study, each subject will be instructed to wear the Silverlon® dressings for 7 days in the following manner:    • Silverlon® dressing should cover the whole irradiated breast area and kept in place by a bra.  • Start wearing Silverlonâ dressing on the first day of radiation therapy  • Continue wearing until 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.  • Wear Silverlonâ dressing all of the time except when bathing/showering, swimming, and during radiation treatment sessions. The dressing should be stored in a clean, dry resealable bag or container (e.g., ziplock bag) when not worn to protect it from becoming soiled of damaged. • The radiation site can be washed daily with mild unscented soap (per instructions by [CONTACT_280545]). • Use of any topi[INVESTIGATOR_159610], lotions, creams or gels with Silverlonâ dressing during the course of the study is permitted under the guidance of the treating physician for subjects with worsening skin reactions to help prevent moist desquamation and subject withdrawal.  o Silverlonâ dressing is to be removed during the application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_670527], and re-applied after total absorption of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_670528] (approximately one hour after application).

The goal of the study is to determine if Silverlon® dressing is safe to use during radiation therapy and can be used in place of other current topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450]. Oral antihistamines are permitted to help with itching or other symptoms. Standard of care for radiation dermatitis is only permitted if the subject is withdrawn from the study due to the progression of the skin reaction to RTOG score ³3 (i.e., moist desquamation in areas that are not skin folds). If the subject is withdrawn for this reason, then standard of care (i.e., silver sulfadiazine, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_242365], etc.) are permitted.   6.[ADDRESS_905879] of care topi[INVESTIGATOR_670535]:  • Subject should have documented worsening skin reaction that requires additional treatment per the treating physician, and be ordered/prescribed the topi[INVESTIGATOR_670536] 28 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] treating provider on study. • The type, dose and frequency of the medication prescribed will be documented in the subject’s study and medical record. • The subject will be instructed to remove the Silverlon® dressing before applying the topi[INVESTIGATOR_168842], and reapply the dressing approximately one (1) hour after application of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_670537]. The subject will be asked to document the removal and re-application of the dressing in their Subject Compliance Log.  7. SUBJECT WITHDRAWALS Subjects will be advised during the consent process that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice or reason. Subjects that withdraw from the study will be replaced with another subject. Subjects will continue to receive radiation therapy as prescribed with standard of care with their treating radiation oncologist. The reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the subject’s medical records. The date of occurrence and reasons for any subject withdrawal will be recorded and documented on the Withdrawal Form.   Subjects can be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_670565]: non-compliance to study procedures; termination of funding; allergic reaction to Silverlon® dressing; worsening of the disease under study; intercurrent illness; pregnancy; or progression of skin reaction to RTOG score ³3 in the radiation area where the Silverlon® dressing has been applied (i.e., whole breast).  RTOG score ³3 requires patients to have areas moist desquamation outside of skin fold regions (i.e., which would exclude inframammary fold and axillas because these are skin fold regions). Additionally, an area of moist desquamation that is >50% of the radiation treatment area (i.e., RISRAS-HPA score ³3). Therefore, a large area of moist desquamation outside of skin folds would suggest withdrawal. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_670538]. Patients withdrawn from the study will stop using SilverlonÒ dressing, but continue to receive radiation therapy on their normal schedule as prescribed by [CONTACT_174634]. For patients withdrawn from the study, standard of care for radiation dermatitis will be provided by [CONTACT_174634], who will continue to follow the patient as per their normal clinical routine. The date of occurrence and reasons for any subject withdrawal will be recorded and documented on the Withdrawal Form. An adverse event will be reported if the skin reaction is RTOG ³4. This grade of radiation dermatitis is severe and should be reported on the AE Source Doc and following reporting procedures stated in §10. Allergic reaction to Silverlon® dressing will be reported as an unexpected side effect on the AE Source Doc.  8. EARLY STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_670539] a significantly increased rate of confluent moist desquamation (i.e., RTOG ³3; large areas (>50% of radiation treatment area) of moist desquamation outside of skin folds) in subjects using the Silverlon® dressing. The study will be stopped if 6/15 or fewer subjects who initiated treatment with Silverlon® dressing are withdrawn due to RTOG score ³3.  This result would suggest a two-fold increase in the rate of confluent moist desquamation with patients using Silverlon® dressing. If the first 6 subjects are withdrawn due to RTOG score ³3 while using the dressing (i.e., 6/6), the study will be stopped due to the significantly increased rate of confluent moist desquamation. If the study is stopped early, participant reimbursement will be issued to any subjects remaining on study.

The only patient intervention in this study is the application of Silverlonâ dressings to the radiation site.  No adverse reactions or events have been reported for Silverlonâ  dressings. Subjects may find the dressing uncomfortable to wear inside the bra. However, discomfort while wearing has not been reported. Unexpected side effects, such as allergic reactions, may occur and are unpredictable.  This reaction may be mild, such as a skin rash, or you may have more severe symptoms like swelling of the throat, low blood pressure, and shortness of breath.  If any of these unexpected side effects occur, subjects will be advised to stop use of their intervention immediately. Subjects will be informed about any additional potential risks if they are discovered.  Furthermore, while we make every effort to keep all data and study information private, this cannot be guaranteed.  All data will be de-identified and stored in a locked file in a locked office.  All appropriate procedures will be taken to maintain subject privacy and data collected during this study.  9.2. PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS The study protocol, amendments to the protocol, consent forms, study forms and patient-report forms are reviewed by [CONTACT_22846], University Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB), prior to implementation.  The RSRB also provides continuing review of study conduct and consent. The research staff (PI, Co-investigators, study coordinator) will conduct continuous review of data and subject safety.  The review will include the number of subjects, adverse reactions, and responses observed.  The Investigator will submit summaries of this data to the Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB) for review as required in the study’s protocol review committee approval letter. Study forms and patient-report forms are either electronic forms through REDCap, excel spreadsheets, or paper forms. All data from paper forms will be entered electronically into REDCap database as it is received from the subjects. All electronically captured data will be securely stored in the secure REDCap database at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center. To protect the confidentiality of subjects, questionnaires and data collected on each subject will be coded, the form collected will contain a numerical Subject ID and Subject Initials. The forms contain the minimum personal identifiers needed for research. The key list with all Subject IDs will be kept in a locked file.  All forms will also be kept in a locked file that is separate from the key list that links the subject name [CONTACT_670580]. When data analyses are completed, the key list and paper forms will be destroyed. The required informed consent will be the only record kept of those subjects who have participated in the research.  The Silverlonâ  dressing that will be studied in this project is not associated with any risks.  Any safety information for an individual patient that is volunteered by a study participant during the course of this research will be documented. All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_737], radiation oncologist, or nurse, elicited from or volunteered by [CONTACT_423], will be documented and reported as described in §10. Each adverse event will include a brief description of the experience, the date of onset, the date of resolution, the duration and type of experience, the severity, contributing factors, and any actions taken. This description will be in the summary not during a subject’s regularly scheduled clinic appointment.      
    
Page 30 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 9.3. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE SUBJECTS It is not possible to predict whether subjects will feel any personal benefit from participation in this research study. Subjects may have relief of radiation dermatitis and associated pain and itching, as well as improved quality of life. The study will provide insight into the safety and use of Silverlonâ dressing for radiation dermatitis. Subjects will receive reimbursement for their participation in this study (See §5.6).    9.4. ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION Subjects who do not participate in this study will receive the current standard of care for radiation dermatitis at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center. Study participation is voluntary.  Subjects can choose to not to take part or withdraw from the study at any time, for whatever reason.    10. SAFETY AND REPORTABLE EVENTS 10.1. ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING This study does not involve interventional or clinical endpoints for individual patients. This is a safety study to determine if Silverlonâ  dressing can be indicated for radiation dermatitis. The primary outcome is not clinical response to treatment; it is safety (i.e., adverse reactions/events/complications).  Any adverse event will be documented on the AE Source Doc throughout the course of the study. Any safety information for an individual patient that is volunteered by a study subject during the course of this research must be reported as described below: All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_670566], or nurse, elicited from, or volunteered by [CONTACT_423], will be documented. Each adverse event will be recorded on the electronic AE Source Doc. This form will record the will include a brief description of the experience, the date of onset, the date of resolution, the duration and type of experience, the severity, contributing factors, and any actions taken. This description will be in the summary not during a subject’s regularly scheduled clinic appointment.     Adverse event (AE): is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject using study device, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study device, whether or not considered related to the study device.  The relationship of each adverse event to the study device must be recorded as one of the choices on the scale described below.    Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the protocol treatment, using the following categories.   ATTRIBUTION DESCRIPTION Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related to treatment. Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related to treatment. Possible The AE may be related to treatment.  Probable The AE is likely related to treatment.  Definite The AE is clearly related to treatment     
    
Page 31 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]): For AE reporting purposes, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240542] 24 hours.  Life Threatening Adverse Event: Any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.   Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:   • Death  • A life-threatening adverse event  • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (for ≥ 24 hours).  • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  • A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  • Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   10.2. RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS Study personnel will assess adverse events by [CONTACT_670567]. Any side effects and adverse reactions will be noted on the AE Source Doc. Study personnel will check with the nurse and/or treating radiation oncologist regarding any reported adverse reactions. All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_737], the treating radiation oncologist, or volunteered by [CONTACT_423], will be documented.  Adverse events will be reported per the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB) reporting requirements. Each adverse event will include a brief description of the experience, the date of onset, the severity of the event, the relationship to investigational intervention, and any action taken with respect to the study and intervention. Adverse event monitoring will occur at the start of informed consent until completion of the study.   The relationship to the study device and the severity of each adverse event (i.e., attribution) as judged by [CONTACT_670568].  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered study device, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The relationship of each adverse event to the study device must be recorded as one of the choices on the scale below:  DEFINITE:  Causal relationship is certain (e.g., the temporal relationship between device use and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable; there is a clinically compatible response to de-challenge; other causes have been eliminated; and the event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically using a satisfactory re-challenge procedure, if necessary).  PROBABLE:  High degree of certainty for causal relationship (e.g., the temporal relationship between device use and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable; there is a clinically compatible response to de-challenge [re-challenge is not required]; and other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely). 
    
Page 32 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  POSSIBLE:  Causal relationship is uncertain (e.g., the temporal relationship between device use and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable or unknown; de-challenge/re-challenge information is either unknown or equivocal; and while other potential causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study device does not appear probable).  UNLIKELY:  Not reasonably related, although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out (e.g., while the temporal relationship between device use and the adverse event onset/course does not preclude causality, there is a clear alternate cause that is more likely to have caused the adverse event than the study device).  UNRELATED:  No possible relationship (e.g., the temporal relationship between device use and the adverse event onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal relationship to the device is not plausible).  10.3. REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Serious adverse events (SAEs), while a subject is enrolled in the study until the subject completes the study, will be reported in writing to the University RSRB as per their requirements.  A serious event refers to any event in which the outcome results in any of the following:  death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449994] a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in the study, will not be considered serious adverse events. The onset date, resolution date, treatment, and outcome of each adverse event will be reported to the Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB) and to the Safety Coordinator using the MedWatch Form FDA 3500A-Mandatory Reporting. Unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) will be reported to the University RSRB and Sponsor.  IRB:  As described above, on-study adverse reactions are reported to the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB).  Modifications to the protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_670569].  The RSRB also provides initial and continuing review of study conduct and consent.  Research staff (i.e., PI, Co-investigators, or study coordinator):  Will also conduct continuous review of data and subject safety.  The review will include for each treatment arm/dose level:  the number of subjects, adverse reactions, and responses observed.  The Investigator will submit summaries of this data to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee for review as required in the study’s protocol review committee approval letter.  11. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN [CONTACT_670581] (co-investigator) in Radiation Oncology at University of [COMPANY_002]ster will serve as the Clinical Monitor for this study. Approval of protocol, informed consent 
    
Page 33 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] procedures, and recruitment will be obtained from the University RSRB. Any safety concerns about the clinical protocol will be brought to the immediate attention of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigator. Study personnel will follow aforementioned reporting procedures for adverse event reporting, including any serious adverse events. Protocol deviations and quality issues will be recorded and reported to the IRB per local policies. Remedial and/or corrective action to prevent reoccurrence of protocol deviations or quality issues will be instituted as necessary. Because this study’s procedures pose relatively low risk to subjects, monthly data and procedural reviews by [CONTACT_670570]. As such, an additional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan document will be not be created for this study. Patients will have their radiated sites examined once a week by [CONTACT_5640] a radiation oncologist as part of their regular course of radiation therapy.  At this examination, any adverse events related to their skin will be recorded. For the purpose of this study, an adverse event will be defined as severe radiation dermatitis meeting the definition of RTOG score grade 4 or above (ulceration, hemorrhage or necrosis) or other adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the area of radiation area where Silverlonâ dressing is applied.  Patients meeting the definition of ‘adverse event’ will be withdrawn from the study and the radiation dermatitis then treated according to local protocol as ordered by [CONTACT_670571].  Changes in dose or scheduling of radiation therapy in response to an adverse event will remain the responsibility of the attending radiation oncologist.  If a patient feels that they are having an adverse event outside of the weekly monitoring schedule, they may contact [CONTACT_316924] [INVESTIGATOR_670540]-up appointment with the radiation oncologist will be arranged.   12. STUDY MONITORING PLAN – Sponsor The Sponsor and/or designee will monitor the study over its duration. The Sponsor study monitor, Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will visit the site at appropriate intervals to review investigational data for accuracy and completeness and ensure compliance with the protocol.  Medical records/source documents (office, clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be reviewed for subjects looking for primary end-point events.  In cases of all-cause mortality and SAE, the study monitor will perform inspection for pertinent documents and records for these events. The CRA will be assisting the site to resolve any data queries and ensuring that relevant source documents related to study events are being retrieved from the site. The Investigator/site will permit access to such records. Source documentation must be available to substantiate proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow-up of adverse events, accuracy of data collected on case report forms, and study device information. A monitoring visit sign-in log will be maintained at the site. The Investigator, Clinical Monitor, and/or research coordinator will be available for monitoring visits. It is expected that the Investigator will provide the study monitor with a suitable working environment for review of study-related documents.  13. DATA ANALYSIS AND MONITORING 13.1. Sample Size Justification The study will recruit 36 total subjects to accrue 30 fully evaluable subjects with an estimated 20% withdrawal rate. The target enrollment table in §3.[ADDRESS_905880] access to enough eligible patients to complete this study in 12 months. The following table shows the 
    
Page 34 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] precision estimates and 95% confidence intervals for our primary objective (i.e., adverse events related to SilverlonÒ) and secondary objective (i.e., compliance and withdrawal rate). Our estimates for adverse events (primary and intent to treat analyses) are based on published trials showing no reported adverse events or allergic reactions to silver nylon dressing in patients receiving radiation (8, 15-17). Our estimates for the primary objective were conducted with sample size of 30 for the fully evaluable subjects and 36 for all subjects that initiated treatment. Our estimates for compliance (secondary analyses) are based on the Aquinos-Parsons et al study in breast cancer patients that showed a 97% compliance rate for silver nylon dressing (8). Our estimates for compliance were conducted using sample size of 30 for fully evaluable subjects. In subjects that withdraw from the study, we will be able to partially evaluate compliance because of their early termination of treatment and study procedures. Our estimates for withdrawal are based on the Vavassis et al study in head & neck cancer patients using silver nylon dressing that reported 1 of 12 subjects (i.e., 8%) withdrew from the study (17).  Our estimates for withdrawal were conducted using a sample size of 36 to capture all subjects that initiated treatment. 95% Exact Clopper Pearson confidence intervals on the expected proportion have been generated using SAS 9.4.  95% Confidence Intervals  Objective Measure Sample Size Proportion Estimate Expected Observed Count 95% LCL 95% UCL Primary # Adverse Events per number of patients 30 0  0 0 0.116  Intent to Treat # Adverse Events per number of patients [ADDRESS_905881] population. The primary analyses will evaluate the number of adverse events or reactions reported (if any) at the breast irradiation site where the SilverlonÒ dressing was applied. The primary analyses will be conducted on 30 fully evaluable subjects (i.e., 30 subjects that fully complete the study) and on all subjects that initiated treatment with SilverlonÒ dressing in an intent to treat analysis (see section 13.1). For a safety study, it is important to obtain the overall adverse event rate for all subjects that initiated treatment and all subjects who fully completed the study.  The secondary analyses will evaluate the compliance rates for the SilverlonÒ Dressing during RT and post RT. Compliance will be on the number of days during RT and post-RT that the dressing was worn. We expect compliance rate to be 97% (8). Additionally, we will evaluate the percentage of subjects that removed the dressing for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Subjects are asked to wear the dressing during sleep and only remove the dressing for RT sessions, showering/bathing, or swimming.  Furthermore, we will calculate the number of hours during a day that the dressing was not worn summing the time between removal and application of the dressing each day. 
    
Page 35 of 41  RSRB STUDY00004587 Version Date: 09/14/2021  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Compliance will be evaluated in the [ADDRESS_905882] less than 6 subjects to withdraw due to the SilverlonÒ dressing. The exploratory analyses will assess trends in radiation dermatitis severity (i.e., RTOG and RISRAS) and quality of life (DLQI) during the course of the study. These analyses will also be able to evaluate changes in skin symptoms experience by [CONTACT_670572]-Patient Symptom Scale during RT.     14.

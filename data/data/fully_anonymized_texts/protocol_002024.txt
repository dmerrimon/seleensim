Pi[INVESTIGATOR_371445]. In a meta- analysis of these 
trials, which included 25 studies enrolling a total of 1054 patients, supervised treadmill exercise, as compa red with observational control, increased maximum walking distance by 180 meters and 
pain-free walking distance by 125 meters.

minute walk distance and subjective measures of quality of  life and functional capacity. Based 
on these trials, supervised treadmill exercise is a class IA recommendation in the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines.

 1.4  Behavioral Economic Approaches to Encouraging Physical Activity In a recent clinical trial, a gamification intervention, leveraging insights from behavioral economics, successfully increased ph ysical activity among overweight and obese adults 
compared with goal-setting alone.
19 In STEP UP, obese and overweight adults were provided 
with wearable fitness trackers and randomized to one of four interventions to increase physical 
activity: Goal-setting alone or goal- setting plus one of 3 different gamification strategies. In all 
arms, participants’ baseline daily step count was determined using the wearable fitness tracker  
during the study’s first two weeks, and then participants set a goal of increasing step count by 33, 40, or 50% over the next [ADDRESS_464700] that showed their relative progress versus the other 2 participants. In the cooperation arm, participants worked together in teams of 3, and a team member was randomly selected  to represent the team for each day, making each team member accountable to the others.

2. Study Objectives  
The objectives of this study are the following:  
1. To test the effectiveness of a gamification -enhanced home-based walking program, as 
compared with a home-based walking program using goal-setting and automated coaching alone, to improve walking endurance in patients with peripheral artery disease 
2. To identify psychometric features associated with response to gamification in patients with peripheral artery disease  
 
3. Study Design  
3.1.  General Overview  
The GAME PAD study is a two -arm randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating whether a 
home- based walking program  with automated coaching augmented with gamification and 
behavioral economic principles improves functional capacity in patients with PAD. The study 
will randomize 100 patients with PAD to a 16- week  home-based walking program using goal-
setting alone (attention control) or to the  same home-based walking program with automated 
coaching augmented with gamification and behavioral economic principles. There will be a 2-week run-in period to obtain baseline measures of physical activity, followed by a 16- week  
intervention period, and a n 8-week  follow-up period (see study protocol figure below). 
 
  
 The study will be conducted using Way to Health, a research information technology platform at the University of Pennsylvania used previously for physical activity behavioral interventions.  After institutional review board (IRB) approval of the study, patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be contact[CONTACT_19904], phone call or letter to invite them to  participate. Those who 

Version [ADDRESS_464703] will provide online informed co nsent to the study procedures. All 
patients will receive a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312]) that will enrolled in the Way to 
Health platform. The Fitbit and Way to Health platform will continuously track patients’ steps and survey patients regard ing pain with walking monthly. Within the Way to Health platform, 
patients will be randomized to one home- based exercise program or the other. All other 
management decisions are completely at the discretion of the care providers. Data capture will include: 
• Baseline case report form (for each patient) collecting clinical information abstracted from the medical record  
• Patient -reported quality of life and functional limitation related to PAD  collected via 
telephone survey and/or the Way to Health platform at the time of enrollment and at 16 - 
and 24- week  follow -up 
• Psychometric features collected via in -person survey at the time of enrollment 
• Daily step count and calculated exercise minutes col lected via FitBit charge  
• Patient -reported pain with ambulation collected via the Way to Health platform at 
monthly intervals  
 
3.2.  Site 
GAME PAD will enroll patients from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which consists of five large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371447], Penn Presby[CONTACT_51616], Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Chester County Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and from Cardiovascular Solutions of Central Mississippi, a private cardiovascular practice primarily serving a socioeconomically depressed region. Regardless of site, all patients will be consented and trial participation will be managed virtually through the Way to Health platform by [CONTACT_371456], and no clinical personnel from any site will participate in research procedures or have access to any participant data.

8. Any other reason why it is not feasible to complete the entire 6-month study 
9. Step count > 7500/day during the baseline data collection period 
 
4.  Study Procedures  
4.1. Screening and Informed Consent  
Patients with peripheral vascular disease will be identified within the electronic health record and 
Penn Data Store, the health system’s clinical data warehouse,  by [CONTACT_48334]-10 codes consistent with 
peripheral artery disease (I70.2x, I70.3x-I70.7x, I73.9) or peripheral artery disease on their problem list. They will be invited to participate by [CONTACT_6968], and will be randomized to opt- in or 
opt-out approaches. Patients randomized to the opt- in approach will be instructed to call a study 
coordinator or visit the Way  to Health platform to enroll in the study; patients randomized to the 
opt-out study will be notified that they will be called by a study coordinator unless they decline to participate. This sub-study will be detailed in a separate protocol. Potentially el igible patients 
may also be identified by [CONTACT_371457], and directed to contact [CONTACT_371458]. These patients will not be included in the opt- in versus opt -out substudy. 
 Interested patients will visit the study website on the Way to Health platform to learn more about the study, create an account, provide informed consent, and complete initial baseline eligibility surveys. Study coordinators will be availab le to assist patients with this process, as necessary.  
 We will follow an IRB -approved approach taken by [CONTACT_371459]. Upon reaching the portal, potential participants will be asked to create an account and will then be informed of the details of the study, including its objectives, duration, requirements, and financial payments.  The Way to Health portal will then take interested participants through an online informed consent. The consent document will be divided into sections and potential participants will have to click a button to advance through each section. This is to help ensure that participants read the consent form thoroughly by [CONTACT_292451]. Each section will have a button allowing the user to contact a researcher via email or by [CONTACT_371460]. Successive screens will explain the voluntary nature of the study, the risks and benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and that participants can withdraw from the study at any time. On the final consent screen, potential participants who click a clearly 
delineated button stating that they agree to participate in the study will be considered to have 
consented to enroll. Participants will be provided with details regarding how to contact [CONTACT_371461]. This contact [CONTACT_292453]’ individual Way to Health web portal dashboards throughout the study.   
Support partners will provide verbal informed consent via telephone for their name, email 
address, and phone number to be stored in the study database. 
4.2. Baseline Questionnaire 
After providing informed consent, participants will complete an online questionnaire to confirm 
eligibility and complete the study surveys.  
Version [ADDRESS_464704] of the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire and the Walking 
Impairment Questionnaire to characterize limb symptoms and functional limitations,23,24 the 
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of mobility, 
pain interference, and satisfaction with social roles and activities,25 and the SF -36 physical 
functioning scale.26 Patients will also complete several questionnaires to obtain a psychometric 
profile: the Big Five Inventory survey to evaluate personality characteristics, the Grit Sc ale to 
assess perseverance, the Self Efficacy for Exercise Behaviors survey, the PHQ -[ADDRESS_464705] be available during that second week to estimate 
baseline measures; otherwise the period will be extended, and patients will be called to inquire if there are any issues with u sing the device. In prior work, we typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] 6 to 7 days of data 
from more than 90% of participants.
29 Participants who do not complete this run -in phase will 
not be randomized into the trial, nor will patients with step counts > 7500 steps/day during the run-in phase.  Once baseline measures have been established, eligible participants will b e contact[CONTACT_371462]. They will be given their baseline step count and asked to select a step goal increase of 33%, 40%, 50% or choose a custom goal as long as it is at least [ADDRESS_464706] because it gives participants the options of setting their own goal but also steers people to choose one of the options provided, any of which would be terrific from the standpoint of increasing physical activity. Leaving it completely open -ended risks having participants either 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371448] ‘too easy’ or not likely to be attainable. In prior work, we find that on average participants chose ambitious goals and more than half selected a 50% step increase.  
To achieve their goal, patients will be recommended  to begin walking for [ADDRESS_464707] established baseline measures and finished goal selection will be randomly 
assigned to attention control or the automated coaching + gamification intervention usin g a 1:1 
allocation and stratifying on baseline step count (< 2500 steps, 2500 – 5000 steps, > 5000 steps)  
Version [ADDRESS_464708] to Health platform, all patients will receive daily text messages that  inform them  
their previous day’s step count.   4.5.2.  Automated Coaching Plus G amification Intervention  
Similar to patients randomized to the attention control arm, patients in the intervention arm will receive daily text messages that inform them whether they did or did not meet their step goal. In addition, they will receive biweekly text messages including encouragement to walk for exercise, reminders about their goal step increase, reminders about optimal practices for home -based 
walking in patients with PAD, and information about th e benefit of exercise in improving PAD 
symptoms and functional capacity.  Patients randomized to the intervention arm will have a 4 -week ramp -up towards their step goal. 
The net difference between baseline and  their goal will be divided by 4 and the participant w ill 
be asked to achieve the 25 % increase each week for the 4- week ramp -up and then maintain the 
step goal for the remaining study period. For example, a participant with a baseline of [ADDRESS_464709] found that the rate of goal attainment is high using this gradual approach rather than encouraging the par ticipant to go from 5,000 to 7,400 
steps immediately. Following the ramp -up period, the participant will be asked to maintain their 
goal during the remainder of the study.   Other components of the gamification intervention are as follows:  1) Pre -commitment: First, each participant signs a pre- commitment contract agreeing to try their 
best to achieve their daily step goal. Pre-commitment has been demonstrated to help motivate behavior change.
 
2) Points: At the start of each week, the participant will receive 70 points (10 for each day that week). Points ar e endowed rather than given after goal achievement to leverage loss aversion – a 
concept from prospect theory that reveals that individuals are more motivated by [CONTACT_371463]. Each day the participant is informed of their step count. If the step goal was achieved, he 
or she retains their points.  However, each day the goal is not met, they are informed that they lost 10 points. Points are replenished at the start of the week to leverage the “fresh start effect” – the concept that individuals are more m otivated for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_371449].
 
3) Levels: At the end of the week, if the participant has 40 points or more, he or she will advance one level. The levels include: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, platinum (highest). If he or she has less than 40 points, he or she will drop down one level at the end of the week. This creates a sense of achievable goals (goal gradients) and uses loss aversion to help motivate ongoing efforts to not lose status. E ach participant begins the intervention in the silver level. By [CONTACT_371464], the higher levels seem within reach and they will feel a sense of loss from droppi[INVESTIGATOR_343924] [ADDRESS_464710] week if they don’t achieve 40 points; this may motivate them to initiate 
greater activity. After 8 weeks, we will reach out to individuals that are stuck in lower levels of blue or bronze and restart them back at silver.  This allows for another “fresh start” and creates a new endowment effect as someone wh o is already at the bottom would otherwise not be able to 
drop down further and experience loss aversion. At the same time, we will also inquire if he or she would like to adjust their step goal as long as they are within the range of a 33% to 50% increase. In previous studies, we’ve found that some individuals set overly ambitious goals at the start of the intervention and that for participants who have trouble achieving their initial goals, we can re- engage them if goals are reset to a more reasonable level.  
4) Supportive sponsor: Each participant will select a family member or friend of their choice who will serve as a supportive sponsor. This person will receive a weekly email with the participant’s progress including accumulated points, level in the game, and average step count. This supportive sponsor will help to enhance social incentives to motivate the individual towards his or her goal. We will encourage participants to select someone with whom he or she comes into frequent contact [CONTACT_371465] a partner, family member, or friend that they see often.  Prior to starting in the study, we will conduct a three -way phone call with the participant 
and their supportive sponsor. We will provide an overview of study procedures for their arm assignm ent, and then prompt the participant and supportive sponsor to discuss ways in which 
they can help the participant meet their step goals. At least [ADDRESS_464711] to Health platform to 
return to the website to complete an end -of-study questionnaire consisting of the San Diego 
Claudication Questionnaire, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, the Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of mobility, pain interference, and satisfaction with social roles and activities, and the SF -[ADDRESS_464712] compensation  
Patients will be paid $25 for enrolling in the study and completing baseline surveys, $25 for completing the 16-week  intervention with step count data available for ≥ 60% of days  and 
completing the 16- week survey, and $25 for completing the study with step count data available 
for ≥ 60% of days and completing the 24-week survey. 
5. Statistical Methods  
5.1 Primary and secondary outcome measures  
Version 1 .3  11 
April 27, 2022 The study’s primary outcome measure will be change in daily step count from baseline to the 
intervention period for patients in the intervention  arm versus patients in the attention control 
arm.  
 Secondary outcome measures will include:  
1) Change in daily step count from baseline to the follow -up period 
2) Change in daily number of minutes engaged in light, moderate, or vigorous physical activity from baseline to the intervention period, and from baseline to the follow -up 
period 
3) Change in daily number of minutes engaged in moderate, or vigorous physical activity from baseline to the intervention period, and from baseline to the follow-up period 
4) Change in W alking Impairment Questionnaire  score from baseline to the end of the 
intervention period, and from baseline to the end of the follow -up period 
5) Change in PROMIS mobility, pain interference, and satisfaction with social roles and activities  scores from baseline to the end of the intervention period,  and from baseline to 
the end of the follow-up period 
6) Change in SF-36 physical functioning scale from baseline to the end of the intervention period, and from baseline to the end of the follow -up period 
 5.2.  Sample Size  
Patients with PAD walk approximately 3900 steps/day (SD 2689 steps).
16 With a home-
based exercise program, the mean change in steps/day over 4.5 months for patients with PAD was a decrease by 200 steps (SD ~2000 steps).
[ADDRESS_464713], a gamification 
intervention similar to the one prop osed increased step count by > 900 steps/day (SD 
~2400 steps).19 With 100 patients (50 in each arm), the study will have 80% power to 
detect an 1100 step difference in change in daily step count between the two arms with alpha set at 0.05  5.3.  Data Analyses Data for all consented patients, whether or not they completed all protocol requirements, will be included for analysis. Patient demographic s, risk profiles, clinical characteristics, and baseline 
questionnaire results will be reported. In addition to change in number of steps from baseline, secondary outcomes will include change in daily exercise minutes, and change the Walking Impairment Que stionnaire, the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS) measures of mobility, pain interference, and satisfaction with social roles and activities, and the SF -36 physical functioning scale . In exploratory analyses, we will identify 
baseline psychometric properties associated with greater change from baseline in daily steps, and greater response to the gamification intervention.  
 All analyses will be performed using intention -to-treat. Data can be missing for any day if the 
participant did not use the activity tracking device or did not upload data. For the main analysis, we will use multiple imputation for step values that are either missing or for values less than 1000 steps because evidence suggests these are not accurate measures of actual activity. We will perform five sets of imputations and results will be combined using Rubin’s standard rules. We will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings using only collected data with and without step v alues less than 1000 steps. The primary analysis will fit mixed effects 
Version 1 .3  12 
April 27, 2022 regression models to evaluate changes in physical activity outcomes measures adjusting for each 
participant’s baseline step, time at the observation level using calendar month fixed effects, participant random effects, and adjusting for repeated observations of participant step counts. We will compare changes in daily step count and physical activity from baseline to the intervention period, excluding weeks 1- 4 (the ramp -up period). We will repeat these analyses, comparing 
changes in daily step count and physical activity from baseline to the follow-up period. Secondary analyses will fit mixed effects regression models adjusted for other variables of interest such as participant characte ristics. Exploratory analyses will fit mixed effects regression 
models to evaluate associations of participant characteristics or behaviors with strong or poor performance in the outcome measures.  In a subgroup analysis, we will separately analyze 
subgroups reporting and not reporting exertional lower extremity symptoms.   For changes in survey measure scores from baseline to the end of the intervention, and from baseline to the end of follow- up, we will compare the intervention and control arms using paire d 
t-tests, without adjustment for baseline characteristics.

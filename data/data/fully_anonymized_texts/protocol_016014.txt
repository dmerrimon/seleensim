CONFIDENTIALAMENDMENT HISTORY
Amendment 5
The purpose of this amendment is to change the time point for evaluation of the secondary 
endpoints from week 100 to week 52.
The secondary outcome measures include as sessment of parameters associated with the 
prevention of vision threatening complications s econdary to diabetic retinopathy, and central-
involved diabetic macular edema (DME).  Th ese secondary outcome measures were to be 
analyzed in an exploratory manner at week 52 and formally tested at week 100.  At week 24, 
these measures were assessed from a safety pers pective, and there was a remarkable separation 
between the Intravitreal Afliberc ept Injection (IAI) and sham groups.  This separation was highly 
suggestive that IAI has a profound impact on these out comes in diabetic retinopathy patients.  In 
light of these results, Regeneron feels that it is important to make these data available to the 
diabetic retinopathy community through approved labeling as soon as possible.

CONFIDENTIALCLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Title A Phase 3, Double -Masked, Randomized Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Patien ts with Moderately Severe to Severe
Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
Site Locations Approximately 70 sites.
Objectives The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of intravitreal (IVT) 
aflibercept compared to sham treatment in the improvement of moderately severe 
tosevere nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).
The secondary objectives of the study are:
xTo characterize the safety of IVT aflib ercept in patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR 
xTo determine if IVT aflibercept w ill prevent the worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy and reduce the incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME)
xTo determine the anatomic effects of  IVT aflibercept in patients with 
moderately severe to severe NPDR.
Study Design This is a phase 3, double -masked, randomized study of the ef ficacy and safety of 
IVT aflibercept for the improvement of  moderately severe to severe NPDR.
Eligible patients will be enrolled into  1 of 3 treatment groups in a 
1:1:1 randomization scheme, and will be stratified based on their Diabetic 
Retinopathy Severi ty Scale (DRSS) score (level 47 vs. level 53).  Only [ADDRESS_1220287] the following dosing 
regimens from day 1 to week 48:  1) ev ery 8 weeks (2Q8) aflibercept IVT after 5 
initial monthly doses; 2) e very 16 weeks (2Q16) aflibercept IVT after 3 initial 
monthly doses and 1 Q8 interval; and 3) sham treatment.  In year 2 (beginning at week 56), the 2Q8 group will be treated with a flexible treatment regime
n.
The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by ≥2 steps from baseline on the DRSS in the 
combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 
group s at week 24, and in each group separately at week 52.
Patients will be evaluated for efficacy (bes t corrected visual acuity [BCVA] using 
the 4-meter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] protocol, 
spectral domain o ptical coherence tomography [SD- OCT], and fluorescein 
angiography [FA]/fundus photography [FP]) and for ocular and systemic safety 
(including ophthalmic exams, visual field testing, and laboratory assessments) through week 100.
Patients who develop PDR, anterior segment neovascularization
(ASNV) , or DME 
in the study eye will qualify for rescue treatm ent.  If treatment is given, patient data 
will be censored for the primary analysis.

CONFIDENTIALIntravitreal aflibercept (2 mg) will be ma de available for patients who have central-
involved DME (CI-DME), PDR or ASNV in the fellow eye at screening (beginning 
on day 1), or are diagnosed during the trial.  
Standard of care treatment (eg, PRP ) will also be allowed for patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_873760].
Study Duration The study duration is 103 weeks, including the screening period.
Population
Sample Size:  Approximately 360 patients will be enro lled, and with a target enrollment of 
approximately 1 20 patients in each treatment group (1:1:1 ratio).
Target Population: The patient population will include men or women with type [ADDRESS_1220288] (without DME threatening 
the center of the macula), in whom PRP can be safely deferred for at least [ADDRESS_1220289] equivalen t scores, 
factors such as ocular dominance and patient preference should be considered in 
making the selection.
Treatments
Study Drug
Dose/Route/Schedu
le:The investigational product is intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI), and will be 
administere d to the patients by [CONTACT_576499].
Study Eye
Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 o f 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio:
x2Q8:  aflibercept 2 mg Q8 to week 48 (after 5 initial monthly doses),
followed by a flexible treatment regimen with aflibercept 2 mg to week 96
x2Q16:  aflibercept 2 mg Q16 to week 96 (after 3 initial monthly doses and 1 
Q8 interval)
xSham:  sham injections every 4 weeks (Q4) to week 16, followed by [CONTACT_873767] Q8 to week 96
To preserve the masking, sham injections will be performe d for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 
group sat treatment visits in which patients  do not receive an active injection 
through week 96, and at all treatment visits for the sham group from baseline to 
week 96.  Masking will be maintained to the end of the study (week 100).
Endpoints
Primary: The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by ≥2 steps from bas
eline in the DRSS score at week 24 in the combined 
2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and at week 52 for each group separately.

CONFIDENTIALSecondary: The secondary outcome measures will be tested at week 52 and are as follows:
xProportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a vision-threatening complication due to 
diabetic retinopathy
Vision-threatening complications are defined as composite outcome of 
PDR (inclusive of patients who have vitreous hemorrhage or tractional 
retinal detachment believed to be due to PDR) and ASNV
oNote:  ASNV is defined as neovascularization of the iris (at least 2 
cumulative clock hours), and/or definitive neovascularization of 
the iridocorneal angle
xProportion of patients who develop CI-DME
xTime to development of a vision-threatening complication
xTime to development of CI-DME
xProportion of patients who receive PRP, inclusive of patients undergoing 
vitrectomy with endolaser 
xArea under the curve (AUC) for change in BCVA from baseline
These outcome measures will also be tested at week 100in an exploratory manner 
for all 3 treatment groups.
Procedures and 
AssessmentsEfficacy and safety ocular procedures will include BCVA (ETDRS) and refraction, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp examination ,gonioscopy, indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, SD -OCT, FA/FP, and visual field testing (study eye).
Overall safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_812000] -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), physical examinations, electroc ardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and 
clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], and urinalysis) at pr especified time points.  
Statistical Plan The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of patients with a ≥2 -step 
improvement from baseline in DRSS score in the study eye at week 24 in the 
combined 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups, and at week 52 for the 2Q8 and 2Q16 groups
separately .  Statistical testing of week 24 and week 52 will be conducted to 
demonstrate the superiority of the aflibercept  groups (combined, 2Q8, and 2Q16) to 
the sham group, respectively.
The primary efficacy variable analysis w ill be conducted on the full analysis set 
(FAS) population.  The primary analysis is a statistical evaluation of superiority of 
3comparisons (combined aflibercept vs. sham at week 24, aflibercept 2Q8 vs.
sham at week 52, and aflibercept 2Q16 v s. sham at week 52) in respect to the 
primary eff icacy variable. The statistical analysis will be performed using the 
Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel method, stratified by [CONTACT_873768] (level 47 vs. 
level 53).  Missing or n ongradable post- baseline values will be imputed using the 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure. For any patient who receives 
rescue treatment, the measurements after re scue is given will be imputed using the

Clinical Study Protocol VGFTe-OD-[ADDRESS_1220290] -baseline observations are missing or nongradable.
Aflibercept treatment will be considered to  be superior to sham if the estimated 
aflibercept group (combined, aflibercept 2Q 8, or aflibercept 2Q16) is greater than 
the sham group, and the p -value is less than or equal to or statistically significant at 
a 1.67% level.
A hierarchical testing procedure will be performed for each dose group to compare 
the secondary efficacy variables between the respective aflibercept group and the 
sham group at week 52.
For a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed 
using all observed measurements (regardless of whether rescue treatment was 
given), and only true missing values will be imputed using the LOCF procedure.  
Baseline values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing
or nongradeable .
Safety Variabl es
Safety variables will be summarized on the safety analysis set (SAF) through week 
[ADDRESS_1220291] results will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_50475]. 
Sample Size
Anticipating approximately 4 1% of patients with a ≥2 -step improvement from 
baseline in DRSS score in either the 2Q8 or  2Q16 groups versus 17% in the sham 
group, [ADDRESS_1220292] a difference with a power of 90% for rejec
ting the null hypothesis at a 2-sided 1.67% (5%/3 ) significance level.  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_1220293] 90% power to detect a 
difference between the combined aflibercept group and sham group at week 24, if a38%
response rate is assumed in the combined aflibercept group.  To account for 
about a 15% dropout rate, 120 patients  per group will be enrolled.

CONFIDENTIAL1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1. Introduction
Diabetes mellitus and its complications are a worl dwide health epi[INVESTIGATOR_873761].  In 2013, the World Health Organizati on estimated that 347 million people had diabetes 
and this number has been projected to increase to 366 million by 2030 and potentially more if 
rates of obesity continue to increase ( Wild 2004 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_873762], morbidity and mort ality as a consequence of diabetes, including 
diabetic retinopathy, are expected to rise.  Di abetic retinopathy is microvascular damage to the 
blood vessels in the retina, and it can progress to  vision-threatening stages including proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR), where new vessels that  are susceptible to hemorrhage grow initially 
from the retina and/or optic disc and extend be yond the internal limiting membrane, and diabetic 
macular edema (DME), where fluid accumulates disrupting the macular architecture and 
function.  Although there are treatments for DME (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
[VEGF] agents), there is a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy. More advanced retinopathy (prolif erative) is often treated with panretinal 
photocoagulation (PRP).  Although PRP may stop the progression of a proliferative disease, it is 
inherently destructive to the reti na and, therefore, likely to cause  visual symptoms such as visual 
field defects, reduced contrast sensitivity, and impaired night and color vision, and can also lead 
to exacerbation of macular edema ( Bressler 2011 ). There is currently no treatment for 
nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and patients are observed until disease progresses 
sufficiently to warrant PRP.
Intravitreal (IVT) anti-VEGF therapy is currentl y the standard of care tr eatment for DME, and it 
has proven to be generally safe and effective in patients with DME.  In the phase 3 VISTA and 
VIVID studies of EYLEA®(aflibercept, known in the scientific literature and in clinical studies 
as VEGF Trap-Eye or intravitreal aflibercept injection [IAI]), patients treated with either 
aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (2Q4) or aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks (2Q8) (following 
5 initial monthly doses) regimens gained 11.[ADDRESS_1220301] corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) at week 52 (data on file).  Similar visual acuity (VA) gains were seen in 
the RISE and RIDE studies of 0.3 and 0.5 mg Lucentis given monthly ( Brown 2013 ).
In addition to the effect on vision, improvements in diabetic retinopathy as measured by [CONTACT_873769] (E TDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale 
(DRSS) were demonstrated in studies of EY LEA and Lucentis.  In the VISTA and VIVID 
studies, the proportion of patients showing a ≥2 -step improvement in DRSS at week 52 for the 
2Q4 and 2Q8 groups was 33.8% and 29.1% (VISTA) and 33.3% and 27.7% (VIVID), 
respectively ( Korobelnik 2014 ).  In order to confirm that these results would be consistent for a 
population with moderately severe to severe NPDR at baseline, a subgroup analysis was 
performed in patients with a ba seline DRSS score of level 47 or 53.  In this subgroup, as with the 
entire population, consistently more patients in the aflibercep t groups had a ≥2 -step improvement 
in DRSS (2Q4 = 49.6%, 2Q8 = 43.9%), as compared to  the laser group (16.7%) (data on file).  It 
is also worth noting that the proportion of patients with ≥2 -step improvement in DRSS both in 
the subgroup and the overall population at week 52 was similar at the earlier time point of 
week 24.

Clinical Study Protocol VGFTe-OD-[ADDRESS_1220302] in 
patients without DME, leaving patients at risk  for the development of DME and/or PDR.  Based 
on the evidence from the VISTA and VIVID studies in patients with DME showing that EYLEA (in addition to treating macular edema) also improves the underlying diabetic retinopathy, we 
propose to investigate EYLEA in patients with  moderately severe to severe NPDR who do not 
have DME by [CONTACT_873770] [ADDRESS_1220303].
Additional background information on the study drug can be foun d in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.
1.2. Rationale
1.2.1. Rationale for Study Design 
Patients with severe NPDR may have 20/20 vi sion and therefore experience no symptoms of 
their advancing disease.  Howe ver, profound vision loss can occur acu tely if the fragile, leaky 
vessels develop and either bleed into the vitr eous cavity or cause retinal traction and/or 
detachment ( Bressler 2011 ).  Therefore, slowing or haltin g the worsening of disease will 
minimize or completely avert these severe, often  irreversible, effects on vision in a patient
population for which there are no approved, or generally accepted, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The most comprehensive grading scale that has been developed for diabetic retinopathy was 
derived from the ETDRS.  This was a landm ark study that established the value of laser 
photocoagulation in managing diabetic retinopathy.  From this study, a systematic grading scale, 
the DRSS, was derived to predict progression from NPDR to PDR.
Based on the evidence from the VISTA and VIVID studies showing that aflibercept, in addition 
to treating macular edema, also improves the underl ying diabetic retinopathy in patients with 
severe NPDR, this study is designed to assess th e superiority of aflibercept when compared to 
sham in treating patients with moderately seve re to severe NPDR, by [CONTACT_873771] [ADDRESS_1220304] 
concurrent DME are unlikely to be experiencing vi sion loss, a longer interval between physician 
visits and injections would be preferable.  Theref ore, a dosing regimen with a longer interval will 
be tested (aflibercept 2 mg every 16 weeks [2Q16]) in the current study, along with the 2Q8 
regimen.
1.2.2. Rationale for Dose Selection
The 2 mg dose of aflibercept is the same as the currently marketed dose of EYLEA and was used 
in the phase 3 DME studies, where improvemen t in underlying diabetic retinopathy was 
demonstrated.

2.2. Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of the study are:
xTo characterize the safety of IVT aflibercept in patients with moderately severe to 
severe NPDR 
xTo determine if IVT aflibercept will pre vent the worsening of diabetic retinopathy 
and reduce the incidence of DME
xTo determine the anatomic effects of IVT af libercept in patients with moderately 
severe to severe NPDR
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Description and Duration
This is a phase 3, double-masked, randomized study of the efficacy and safety of IVT aflibercept 
for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR.
After providing informed consent, pa tients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening 
visit, up to 3 weeks before day 1/baseline.  At the day 1/baseline visit, patients will undergo 
safety assessments prior to receiving the first dose of study drug.
Eligible patients will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1: 1:1 randomization scheme, 
and will be stratified based on their DRSS scor e (level 47 vs. level 53). Only [ADDRESS_1220306] the following dosing regimens from 
day 1 to week 48: 1) 2Q8 aflibercept IVT after 5 initial monthly doses; 2) 2Q16 aflibercept IVT 
after 3 initial monthly doses and 1 8-week in terval; and 3) sham treatment (see section 5.1). In 
year 2 (beginning at week 56), the 2Q8 group will be treated with a flexible treatment regimen
(see section 5.3).
The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of patients who have improved by 
≥2 steps from baseline on the DRSS in the combined  2Q8 and 2Q16 groups at week 24, and in 
each group separately at week 52.  Patients will be evaluated for efficacy (BCVA using the 
4-meter ETDRS protocol, spectr al domain optical coherence tomography [SD-OCT], and 
fluorescein angiography [FA]/fundus photography [FP]) and for ocular and systemic safety 
(including ophthalmic exams, visual field testin g, and laboratory assessments) through week 100 
(Figure 1 ).
Patients who develop PDR, anterior segment ne ovascularization (ASNV), or DME will qualify 
for rescue treatment (see section 5.2).  If treatment is given, patien t data will be censored for the 
primary analysis.

No formal interim analysis is planned.
3.3. Study Committees 
3.3.1. Safety Monitoring Team
A safety monitoring team (SMT) at Regeneron will  meet at scheduled times during the study to 
review masked safety data.  These data may include, but are not limited to:
xTreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) th at result in an early study withdrawal
xSerious adverse events (SAEs)
xFatal events
xIdentified and potential risks for IVT aflibercept
Appropriate action, if needed, will be taken ba sed upon these reviews and in consultation with 
the medical monitor.
3.3.2. Other Safety Committee
Potential arterial thrombotic events will be ev aluated by a masked adjudication committee 
according to criteria formerly appl ied and published by [CONTACT_496145]- Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration 
prior to database unmasking ( Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration 1994; 
Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration 2002 ).  An arterial thrombotic event is defined as a 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, or death resulting from vascular or unknown causes.  Additi onal details regarding data to be collected can 
be found in the study procedure manual.

Weeks 52 and 100 are nontreatment visits.
A masked physician will be assigned to do the fo llowing:  1) assess AEs, and 2) perform the 
masked assessment of efficacy.  A separate, unmaske d physician will administer treatment in the 
study eye (ie, perform study drug injection or sham injection) ( Table 1 ).
The unmasked physician or designee will not have  any role in the study beyond the receipt, 
tracking, preparation, destruction, administration of study drug, and assessing safety during the 
observation period following study drug administ ration. The masked physician will determine if 
a patient has developed DME, ASNV, or PDR in th e study eye, and will be responsible for 
recommending treatment, which will be admini stered by [CONTACT_496161]. Once it has 
been determined that a patient has progressed to DME, ASNV, or PDR, treatment may be given by [CONTACT_873775].  Beginning at week 56, the masked physician will 
assess whether a patient has a DRSS Level [ADDRESS_1220318] be 
maintained as new personnel are added to the study team.

A physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at the screening visit.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram
A standard 12-lead ECG measurement will be measured at visits specified in Table 2 and 
Table 3 .  Heart rate will be recorded from the ventricular rate and the PR, QRS, RR and QT 
intervals will be recorded.  The ECG strips or report will be retained with the source 
documentation.  Electrocardiograms will be forwarded to a central reader.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Testing 
Hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, HbA1c, and pregnancy testing samples will be 
analyzed by a central laboratory.  All samples collected for laboratory assessments will be 
obtained prior to administration of study drug.  At  visits at which FA is performed, urinalysis 
samples must be collected before FA to avoid fa lse elevations in urine protein values.  Detailed 
instructions for blood sample collection are in  the laboratory manual provided to study sites.
Samples for laboratory testing will be collected at time points according to Table 2 and Table 3 .  
Tests will include:

7. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING
7.1. Definitions
7.1.1. Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is a ny unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any cli nically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.

xResults in death –includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).
xIs life-threatening –in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_873765] .
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73422] 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a

xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect
xIs an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient ormay require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).
An ocular important medical event may include the following:
xAn AE that requires either surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss 
of vision
xSubstantial, unexplained vision loss or an AE that causes substantial vision loss
7.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
7.2.1. Adverse Events
The investigator (or designee) will record all AE s that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study.  Refer to the study procedure manual for the procedures to be

the use of the study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the IRB, regardless of 
assessed causality.
In the event the investigator is informed of an  SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:
xSAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study/early termination visit - the
SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow-up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.
xSAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by [CONTACT_50460]-related SAEs will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow-up information on the outcome of a drug-related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.
7.2.3. Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug: Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 
2 times the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE,
Pregnancy: Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), by [CONTACT_16470]

AE.
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalitie s will be assessed according to the scale 
outlined in section 7.3.1 .
7.2.6. Follow-up
Adverse event information will be collected until the patient ’s last study visit.
Serious adverse event information will be collected  until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.
7.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality
7.3.1. Evaluation of Severity
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:
xMild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal 
functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient.
xModerate: Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.   Treatment for symptom may be needed.
xSevere: Produces significant impairment of fu nctioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or

CONFIDENTIALAflibercept treatment will be cons idered to be superior to sham if the estimated aflibercept group
(combined, aflibercept 2Q8, or aflibercept 2Q16) is greater than the sham group, and the p-value 
is less than or equal to or statistically significant at a 1.67% level.
As stated above, for the primary efficacy analysis, any patient who receives rescue treatment in 
the study eye will have all efficacy measurements  collected after rescue treatment is imputed 
using the last observation prior to such treatment. For a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed using all obs erved measurements (regardless of whether rescue 
treatment was given), and only true missing valu es will be imputed using the LOCF procedure. 
Baseline values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing or 
nongradable.
Secondary Efficacy Variables
If at least one of the aflibercept groups is shown to  be superior to sham in the primary variable, 
additional comparisons will be made for this af libercept group with resp ect to the secondary 
variables at week 52, using the significance level specified in section 9.1.
A hierarchical testing procedure will be performed for each dose group to compare the secondary 
variables between the respective aflibercept group and sham in the following order:

CONFIDENTIALThe p-values at week 52 for the secondary endpoints will be reported for all comparisons 
between the aflibercept groups and the sham group; however, a superiority claim can be made 
for a given endpoint only if all preceding endpoint comparisons in the hierarchy are shown to be 
statistically significant at a significance level specified in section 9.1. The hierarchical method 
ensures the overall type I error rate of 5% for this study, with multiplicity adjustment for primary 
and secondary endpoint analyses.
All endpoints will also be analyzed descriptively at week 100 in an exploratory manner. 
The analysis of proportion variables will be done using the same methodology as for the analyses 
of the primary efficacy variable described in this section.
For continuous variables (ie, BCVA), an analysis  of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline 
measurements of the continuous variable as covari ates and treatment and baseline DRSS score 
(level 47 vs. level 53) stratification as fixed fact ors will be used for the endpoint. The pair-wise 
comparisons of each aflibercept group versus sh am will be done in the ANCOVA model. In 
addition, 2-sided 95% confidence in tervals for the difference of each aflibercept group minus 
sham will be calculated.
Time to first vision-threatening co mplication (composite of PDR [inclu sive of patients who have 
vitreous hemorrhage or tractiona l retinal detachment believed to  be due to PDR] and ASNV) will 
be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. A log-rank test will be performed, comparing 
sham with the aflibercept groups, as well as 2-si ded 95% confidence intervals for the time to first 
vision-threatening complication for the di fference of each comparison group. Time to 
development of CI-DME will be analyzed similarly.
Similar to the analysis of the primary endpoint, any patient who receives rescue treatment in the 
study eye will have all efficacy measurements co llected after rescue treatment imputed using the 
last observation prior to such treatment.  For a se nsitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis 
will also be performed using all observed measur ements (regardless of whether rescue treatment 
was given) and only true missing values will be imputed using the LOCF procedure.  Baseline
values will be carried forward if all post-baseline observations are missing.
Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints may also be performed on subsets of the FAS, 
such as patients who have developed CI-DME, PDR, or patients who have had a vitrectomy.  
Such subsets will be defined in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses of Additional Efficacy Variables
All additional efficacy variables (see section 8.3) will be analyzed descriptively.  In addition, the 
primary and secondary variables will be also analyzed descriptively at week 100.  These 
descriptive analyses may include statistical tests on the proportion for the efficacy variables, in 
the same way as described for the primary and secondary efficacy variable analyses (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
The analysis of categorical variables will be  done using the same methodology used for the 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable described in section [IP_ADDRESS] . Analyses of continuous 
variables (eg, central retina l thickness, median deviation on visual field) will use a 2-way 
ANCOVA main effects models with treatment gr oup and baseline DRSS (level 47 vs. level 53)

 [ADDRESS_438950] Clearance Therap ies in Cystic Fibrosis ( REACT -CF) 
 
1. Specific Aims  
Mucus  clearance is one of the  primary innate defense mechanism s of the lungs, and impaired 
mucus clearance is believed to drive  the development and progression of c ystic fibrosis lung 
disease through a cycle of bacterial colonization, infection, inflammation, and mucostasis.  Airway 
Clearance Therap ies (ACTs ) are a cor nerstone of treatment in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_352647] a number of mechanical devices that are designed to facilitate 
mobilization of mucus from the airways . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_352648] t he time patient spend performing them , little research is available to validate the efficacy of 
any specific device or technique ; even less research exists on the comparative effectiveness of 
competing devices .  
The biology underlying the transduction of physical forces applied with ACTs into effective 
mucus clearance has also been inadequately studied. Mechanical forces are known to stimulate 
release of signaling molecules (i.e. adenosine nucleotides and nitric oxide  [NO] ) from airway 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603].  These molecules are involved in the regulation of physiologic processes (i.e. ion transport, cilia beat frequency, and mucus secretion) that determine rates of mucociliary clearance  (MCC) .  Until now, no studies have directly expl ored the linkage between these signaling 
molecules and in vivo  rates of MCC. If in fact a significant relationship is discovered, the 
measurement of these molecules could provide simple, non -invasive biomarkers that reflect MCC 
rates and allow assessment o f treatment effects from ACT and potentially other therapeutics.  
In this study, we propose to objectively characterize the effect of ACTs that utilize different 
approaches by: 1) measuring MCC using gamma scintigraphy; and 2) exploring biologically plausib le biomarkers that could help our understanding of the physiologic responses to ACT that 
facilitate mucus clearance. We also explore the effects and  utility of a novel vibrating plate device 
as an ACT. Finally , the results of this study will used to inform  the design of future trials of 
effectiveness of ACTs.  
 Within this study, we will test several hypotheses:  
Hypothesis 1:  Device -assisted airway clearance therapy using OPEP, HFCWO -vest, and whole -body 
vibration  causes a demonstrable increase in MCC  and expectorated sputum volume when  compared 
to cough alone.  
Hypothesis 2: Airway  signaling molecules , including  NO and purine nucleotides (e.g. ATP, 
adenosine) , are associated with  the regulation of MCC and  mediate the increase in mucus clearance 
that occurs following the application of mechanical stimuli  from OPEP, HFCWO -vest, and whole -body 
vibration.  
 We will test these hypotheses through these specific aims:  
Specific Aim 1 : Measure the effects of [ADDRESS_438951] modalities on MCC , using gamma 
scinti graphy . 
Specific Aim 2 : Measure the effects of different ACT modalities on proposed regulators of MCC , 
including nucleotide levels (via exhaled breath condensate collection) and exhaled NO.  
Specific Aim 3 : Examine  associations between biomarkers of airway mechanical stimulation and 
measured MCC . 
Specific Aim 4 : Determine what study characteristics would be needed to more fully assess the 
effectiveness of ACTs, including sample size,  study design features , and outcome measures.

surface liquid (ASL) , and  reduced  mucus clearance1-3. Recent work has led to the development of a  
2-gel model of the ASL layer where dehydration and i ncreased  osmotic pressure  in the overlying 
secreted gel can result in volume  depletion  of the periciliary gel layer . This in turn may lead to 
adhesion of mucus plaques to airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_352649] -stimulated mucus clearance4. In CF subjects, we have shown that cilia and cough driven 
mucus clearance is abnormal5,6, and that additiona l reduction in  MCC contribute s to the onset of a 
pulmonary exacerbation. Not surprisingly , effective airway clearance of mucus is a cornerstone of 
therapy and  of great importance in preventing disease exacerbations and  progression of  airways  
disease . 
 
Airway Clearance Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352650] , and continues to be,  a central part of CF care. Techniques of 
manual chest percussion and postural drainage  have largely been supplanted in adolescents and 
adults by [CONTACT_352672], w hich afford patients independence. These  devices , together 
with voluntary breathing techniques  (active cycle of breathing, autogenic drainage, huff coughing)  
and exercise , enable individuals with CF to  better  expectorate tenacious airway secretions. 
Curren tly available ACT devices include pneumatic high frequency chest wall oscillatory devices, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_352651] a vest  (The Vest®, AffloVest®, inCourage®, SmartVest®), a variety of oscillatory 
and non- oscillatory positive  expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111]  (PEP)  devices ( Flutter ®, Acapella ®, Aerobika ®, 
RC-Cornet ®, TheraPEP ®, Hydrapep®) , and acoustical percussors (Vibralung ).  FDA clearance of 
these devices do not require proof of efficacy and, according to an expert review of available literature, there is insufficient evidence to assess the long -term effects of ACTs as well as  
inadequate evidence to support the superiority  of one ACT over another
7. Therefore, prescription 
of such devices is often determined by [CONTACT_352673], based on what 
“feels” most effective to them, and/or provider habits and/or biases with little objective data guiding decisions .  
 Whole Body Vibration In Exercise And Therapy  
The use of whole body vibration (WBV) via a v ibrating plate was developed for use in personal 
fitness and recreation and not as a medical therapy or intervention. These devices consist of a large plate that vibrates at frequencies generally between [ADDRESS_438953] of these devices is to constantly accelerate and decelerate the whole body in an 
oscillating m anner.  This acceleration is described by [CONTACT_352674]. These variables are the settings on the device. Studies of WBV in bone density and musculoskeletal outcomes in older adults did not show benefit for acceleration <1 g, but other 
studies did show some benefit for WBV ex erting higher ma gnitudes (1 to 8  g)
8-10. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_352652]11. These  device s have not been studied as a means of airway clearance therapy, but 
there is anecdotal support for their  use for airway clearance by [CONTACT_352675]. Furthermore, 
studying their  effect as an ACT allows  us to test the hypothesis that high energy devices, even 
those not specifically engineered for airway clearance  such as WBV platforms , may be as effective  
in ACT as those devices that were specifically engineered to affect the respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133].

 [ADDRESS_438954] operating procedure was  developed at UNC to report re sting MCC as 
well as cough clearance and has been used in several single and multisite studies12. Pharmacologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352653]13 and iv acaftor (in patients with the G551D -mutation )[ADDRESS_438955] also failed to yield meaningful clinical improvements in CF (e.g. amiloride, UTP, denufosol).   Together, these observations suggest that the MCC technique may have the ability to predict the clinical effectiveness of a subgroup of CF t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Given the importance of MCC as an innate lung defense, it is not surprising that there are 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_352654], including ion transport and ciliary beat frequency ( CBF).  Extracellular adenosine 5’ -
triphosphate ( ATP ) is the endogenous ligand for P 2Y
2 receptors, which in turn stimulates calcium 
activated chloride channels, inhibits the epi[INVESTIGATOR_85062]  (ENaC) , and increases CBF15,16.  
ATP release in airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_352655]17, and could provide a 
mechanistic link betwee n ACT or exercise and mucus clearance. Adenine nucleotide levels have 
been successfully measured in exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) specimens from CF patients, and 
likely reflect airway inflammation  as well18,19.  
Another airway mediator that is linked to MCC is NO.  NO , via cGMP,  is known to increase  
CBF20,21 and may inhibit ENaC activity via the same signaling pathway22,23.  Exhaled NO levels are 
significantly reduced in diseases characterized by [CONTACT_352676] (PCD and CF), and increase in 
response to ivacaftor in G551D -CF patients24. NO production may also be increased by [CONTACT_352677], at least in endothelial cells25.  Once again, like ATP, NO levels in the airway may be 
modulated by [CONTACT_352678] M CC.   
 Slow Inhalation, Large Particle MCC Method  Development  
A multicenter MCC SOP was developed and tested by [CONTACT_352679]
12 and has been employed 
in several CFF and industry funded studies (GOAL, VX661 -111, AlgiPharma, PROSPECT)14. This 
method, which utilizes a relatively fast and shallow breathing pattern during isotope inhalation, emphasizes clearance from the large airways, but  is less able to characterize small airway 
clearance.  We, therefore, used funding from  the MCC Consortium (CFF) to develop and test 
alternat ive methods for assessing particle clearance from the small airways .  In this work, we used 
concepts introduced by [CONTACT_352680]., where the very slow inhalation of large aerosol particles 
(SILP) can be used to better target small  airways.  Slow inhalation (80 ml/sec) of [ADDRESS_438956] SOP  (5 µm MMAD with inhalation rate of 500 
ml/sec) in healthy , CF and COPD  subjects.  First, while large airway clearance appeared unchanged 
(definition: wh ole lung clearance in first 90 minutes), the fraction of isotope that cleared between 
[ADDRESS_438957] deposition via 
avoidance of alveolar deposition (Figure 1A). Second, w e observed an improved abi lity to 
distinguish pathological clearance patterns in diseased subjects (Figure  1B), in contrast to our 
prior observation that only peripheral clearance and cough clearance appears to be impaired in CF subjects with our standard measurement protocol.  Finally, we tested the relative responsiveness 
of the SILP method  using hypertonic saline  (HS) , given [ADDRESS_438958] of HS was observed  (Figure 2A) , particularly with the [ADDRESS_438959] updated June 15, 2017   Co-PIs: Trimble, Aaron & Donaldson, Scott  
 [ADDRESS_438960] was observed to be a “responder”, as opposed to prior observations that only 
~60% of subjects acutely respond to HS when using the traditional MCC SOP  (Figure 2 B).  In 
summary, this new methodology appears to have significant advantages to the traditional MCC measurement protocol typi[INVESTIGATOR_352656].

 [ADDRESS_438962] their performance. Comparison between ACTs is also hampered by [CONTACT_352681]. In this study, we will employ a highly relevant outcome measure (MCC) to 
characterize the effect of differing AC T modalities.  Further, by [CONTACT_352682] ( FENO  and EBC nucleotide levels) that have biological relevance to the 
mucus clearance system and are believed to transduce physical stimuli into biological  signals, and 
correlating  them to quantitative MCC measurements, we may discover broadly useful biomarkers 
for research into ACT effects while also broadening our understanding of the mechanisms that control mucus clearance.  These biomarkers could be used to identify ACT modalitie s worthy of 
more extensive clinical testing or to “personalize” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352657] (e.g. mild vs. severe lung disease).   We will also investigate 
the effects of a novel device that employs high frequency, whole body vibration, but was not developed as an ACT device, to broaden our understanding the types of mechanical stimuli that successfully increase mucus clearance.   T he results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_352658], including sample size, study design features, and outcome 
measures.   
 4. Rationale for p roposed study  
We intend to carry out this pi[INVESTIGATOR_352659] (and variability) of cough 
alone and various ACT device s on MCC, signaling molecules, and sputum volume.  We will also 
explore the correlation between MCC and signaling molecules, and compare  a novel exercise 
device using whole body vibration to  traditional ACT methods.   
 5. Experimental Design and Methods :  
Key inclusion criteria:  Adults with confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis aged 18 years and older.  
 Key exclusion criteria : Pregnant or lactating women, i ndividuals with severe lung disease (FEV
1 
<30%), or with exacerbations of lung disease requiring antibiotics or medication change within 
four weeks prior to enrolment. Individuals unable to use vest- based HFCWO , oscillatory PEP 
device, or who requir e oxygen supplementation at rest. We will also exclude individuals with 
significant balance or gait impairment preventing the individual from tolerating being positioned on a vibrating platform.  
 Study design:  Ten (10) adult CF s ubjects will be recruited from the CF clinic  at UNC, and will have 
a screening visit and four  subsequent study visits. At Study Visit 1 huff -cough alone (control) will 
be performed while the order of the [ADDRESS_438963] clearance therapy ( ACT) treatments 
received at Study Visits 3-5 will be randomized: oscillatory PEP  (positive expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111]) , 
high frequency chest wa ll oscillatory vest,  and the vibrating plate device.  Only one ACT device will 
be used at any given visit as adjunct s to huff -cough ing, with the same cough regimen used at all 
study visits (Figure s 3 & 4) . Study visits will be at least three and no more tha n 21 days apart.  
Subjects who are prescribed hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, long -acting bronchodilators, and/or 
airway clearance will be asked to withold use of these agents/activities  after midnight before each 
study visit after  screening.  No bronchodil ators will be used as part of this study.  
 Methods:

 6 Screening Visit  
Following recruitment  and informed consent , subjects will undergo a screening visit that 
includes a physical exam, medical  history, medication review, and measurement of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
Subjects will be allowed to continue all of their home medications  during the study, but will be 
asked to withhold  hypertonic saline, dornase al fa, and long -acting bronchodilator s for 12 hours 
before mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) scans. No bronchodilators will be given.  
 
Randomization  
 Baseline (huff -cough only) measurements will be 
obtained at Visit 2. For visits 3- 5, a single ACT method will 
be employed at each visit, with a randomized order in 
which the methods are used. We will employ a Latin -square 
design  as shown. First, the 3 periods will be randomized, 
followed by [CONTACT_352683] (A -C). This will generate a 
random [ADDRESS_438964] appears once in each row and column. The rows of this table will serve as a block randomization schedule, which will optimize balance for a number of subjects not divisible by [CONTACT_352684]. Subjects will be assigned to the next row in the table after the baseline  visit (repeating the sequences every [ADDRESS_438965]) to ensure eligibility prior to 
rand omization.  
 Study Visits  
The order of procedures at each stu dy visit is outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_438966] (if applicable)  will be performed  to ensure subject safety. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_352660] ( nitric oxide , nucleotides), and therefore may interfere with results.  Exhaled 
breath condensate (E BC) and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO ) samples will be obtained 
prior to the inhalation of isotope and immediately after the first ACT intervention . Procedures  for 
biomarker collection and analysis are discussed below.

 [ADDRESS_438969] segment will be separated by [CONTACT_352685], which will allow qu antification of particle 
clearance using previously described methods
6,12,26. To perform huff -coughs, subjects will be 
instructed to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_352661] 75% of total lung capacity (TLC), hold inspi[INVESTIGATOR_38855] 2 seconds, and 
then expi[INVESTIGATOR_352662] (RV). This breathing pattern will be repeated two additional times and followed by a single, forceful cough to complete a single huff -cough 
maneuver. During each of the six s egments of the intervention period, there will be five minutes 
for transitioning from image capture to ACT, completion of the ACT, performing huff- cough, and 
repositioning in front of gamma camera.  Four minutes are allotted for ACT and [ADDRESS_438970] intervention on the same study day (16 min and 196 
minutes after isotope inhalation) we hope to  identify the optimal timing of sputum volume and 
MCC measurements to differentiate the effects of the different ACT modalities . After the initial ACT 
intervention and MCC assessment, subjects will remain within the Marsico Clinical Research Center and will refrain from any inhaled medications, vigorous exercise, or additional ACT during this time. [ADDRESS_438971] (HFCWO -Vest)

 [ADDRESS_438972]® System, Model 105 (Hill -Rom, Batesville, IN). Subjects will 
have the adjustable vest fitted during their screening visit. The following adaption of a previously -
studied protocol will be used for device settings27. Each treatment segment  will be 4 minutes.  
 
Segment:  1 2 3 4 5 6 
Frequency, Hz:  8 9 10 18 19 20 
Device Pressure  10* 10* 10* 6 6 6 
*or highest tolerated pressure setting  
 
Oscillating  Positive Expi[INVESTIGATOR_352663] (OPEP Device)  
Subjects will be given an Aerobika® (Monaghan Medical Corporation, Plattsburgh, NY) 
oscillating positive expi[INVESTIGATOR_352664] a resistance setting of 5, the maximum resistance setting on the device. Subjects will perform 10 exhalations from near T LC to near RV 
through the OPEP device at a respi[INVESTIGATOR_352665] 10 breaths / minute to avoid acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_245034]. The resistance setting will be decreased as necessary so subjects can comfortably perform this breathing maneuver. Subjects  will perform [ADDRESS_438973] segments minutes followed by [CONTACT_352686] -cough maneuver. A 
member of the research team will coach subjects on proper breathing and device technique.  
 Vibration platform  for Whole Body Vibration (WBV)  
WBV will be performed for [ADDRESS_438974] segment using the PowerPlate® 
(Performance Health Systems, Northbrook, IL) vibration platform. Subjects will be positioned seated on the powerplate, which will rest on a custom -made wooden box 12” high, so that height 
of the platform is approximately that of a standard chair. Holes in the top of box engage the rubber “feet” of the PowerPlate to keep it in place. Subjects are seated with their feet on the floor and hands in  their laps, sitting up as straight as possible.  The “high ” amplitude  will be used on the 
device . After each segment, subjects will perform a huff -cough maneuver and return to be seated 
in front of the gamma camera.  
 Outcome Measures  
Mucociliary Clearance  
Background and transmission scans will be performed per the MCC Standard Operating 
Procedure (see attachment) to subtract background radiation levels and allow identification of lung boundaries and regions of interest
12. The Tc- [ADDRESS_438975] period, there will be an 
additional 38 minutes of image capture . After an 86 -minute break (i.e. 180 minutes after tracer 
inhalation), an identical MCC image capture period with ACT intervention will occur (Figure 3).  
 Airway Signalling  Molecule Assays  
Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC)  
EBC collections will be performed using the R -tube system.  The subject will perform n ormal, 
tidal volume breathing through the chilled tube for [ADDRESS_438976] intervention  at minute 56 (see Figure 3) .  EBC samples 
will be processing by [CONTACT_352687][INVESTIGATOR_352666], purines, and 
REACT -CF Protocol, Last updated June 15, 2017   Co-PIs: Trimble, Aaron & Donaldson, Scott  
 10 amino acids as previously described18. Following this step, the EBC sample (plus internal 
standard) will be lyophilized and reconstituted to achieve a 20 -fold increase in concentration 
before analysis by [CONTACT_264489] s spectrometry.  
EBC concentrations of purine metabolites (AMP, adenosine, hypoxanthine) will be measured 
using MS methods as previously described19,28,29. In addition, we will utilize a recently installed AB 
Sciex 6500 triple quadrupole mass spec trometer available in our core center that has ~100 -fold 
increased sensitivity relative to the Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer utilized in previous studies 
and should be ideal for assessing the low biomarker concentrations expected in EBC.  
 
Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) 
FeNO  will be measured using NIOX MINO® device by [CONTACT_352688].  FeNO  measurement will be performed immediately before each EBC collection  (i.e., 
before inhaling isotope and at minute 56) . 
 
Sputum Collection  and coughs  
All expectorated sputum from the start of the first ACT period through [ADDRESS_438977] 
isotope inhalation  will be collected and weighed to assess total volume.  Subjects will not be 
encouraged to cough outside of huff -cough maneuvers – rather, to cough only when naturally 
compelled to do so. Subjects will be encouraged to expectorate rather than swallow their s putum. 
This sputum will be analysed by [CONTACT_352689]. While MCC images are being obtained, subjects will be asked to minimize additional coughing besides the huff -coughs 
performed during ACT intervention period. Any additional coughs will  not be controlled for, but 
will be recorded and evaluated as a covariate in data analyses.  
 
Subject Evaluation of ACT  
Following each treatment session, subjects will be asked to subjectively evaluate the efficacy of 
the device. Subjects will be to agree o r disagree with the following statement using a standard 
Likert scale: “This ACT technique was effective for lung clearance.” At the conclusion of the study, each study subject will be asked: “Which of the studied airway clearance method s would you 
choose  to perform on a daily basis ?” Responses will be limited to each of the four studied 
modalities.  
 
Breath Sounds Audio Collection  
Audio recordings of non -phonated breath sounds will be collected from the subjects using a 
stethoscope equipped with recording capability before and after airway clearance. 25 second recordings of sounds will be recorded from up to seven locations (trachea and right and left: posterior, lateral, and anterior chest) using a flow meter to ensure standard breathing pattern. Audio files will be analyz ed using a computer program designed to analy ze recordings, and 
quantify characteristics of breath sounds (frequency, duration, and number of adventitious sounds).  
 Data management:  
 The data will be entered in R EDCap, an electronic data capture program. The data entry forms will 
include edit  check s to insure data quality. The discrepancies  will be managed by [CONTACT_20234].  After reviewing the database for quality checks, the database will be frozen and 
exporte d at the end of the study for analysis.

Data analysis:  
 Agathe Ceppe , biostatistician for the UNC CF Center, has been closely involved in the study design 
and will be responsible for overseeing the database creation and management , as well as 
performing final statistical computations during  data analysis.  
 
Primary comparison : MCC will be visualized  using a whole right lung clearance  vs. time  plot 
from immediately after isotope inhalation through [ADDRESS_438978]- inhalation.  The  area under 
this curve  (AUC -Clr
274), will be used to reflect “total clearance”, and will serve as the primary 
outcome of this study. We will compare AUC -Clr [ADDRESS_438979] modalities ( HFCWO -vest, OPEP device, and WBV device) . 
Secondary comparisons : AUC-Clr over other intervals  (i.e. 94 min and 180 min), and from other 
lung regions of interest (i.e. peripheral and central lung zones)  will be calculated and compared in 
similar fashion as above. Furthermore, the change in the rate of clearance (represented by [CONTACT_352690], d Clr/ dt) before (0 -16 minutes of MCC curve ; dClr/ dt0-16) versus 
during/ after the initial ACT intervention (16 – 56 minute s; dClr/ dt16-56) will be used to compare 
the immediate effects of each ACT versus . huff coughs alone.  The mean changes in EBC purines 
concentrations  and FeNO,  (before vs. after ACT ) will be calculated .  If these are found to be 
different from zero,  a com parison between huff -cough alone and each of the ACT modalities will 
be made. Total sputum weights and % solid s at baseline and  after each ACT [ADDRESS_438980] deviations  and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for MCC 
parameter s and all secondary outcome measures . A repeated measures m odel will be used to 
compare the primary and secondary outcome measures , with the subjects considered as random 
factors. For hypothesis one  and three , MCC values from huff -cough alone will be compared to 
traditional ACT methods (HFCWO -vest and OPEP)  and Whole Body Vibration  to test the null 
hypothesis that there is no difference in MCC between huff -cough and a) HFCWO -vest ; b) OPEP ; 
and c) WBV . For hypothesis  two , biomarker values pre and post each ACT intervention will be 
compared using paired t- tests to  test the null hypothesis  [i.e. there is no difference between 
candidate biomarker concentration before and after use of a)  HFCWO -vest, b) OPEP , and c) WBV] . 
We will also compare the change in biomarker values across different methods using a repeated 
measure model . Finally , we will explore the strength of the  relationship between MCC responses 
and the corresponding change in candidate biomarker values by [CONTACT_352691]’s 
Correlation Coefficient.  
 
Breath sounds data will be collected as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], and will not be subject to statistical 
measures.  
 Missing Data/Subject Drop Out : 
Subjects that drop out before the end of visit 3 (i.e. provide only baseline data) will not be included for analysis, and will be replaced. Data from all s ubjects who complete at least visit 
[ADDRESS_438981] 
method to baseline . We anticipate no more than 10% drop out  beyond visit 3. Per sample 
REACT -CF Protocol, Last updated June 15, 2017   Co-PIs: Trimble, Aaron & Donaldson, Scott  
 12 size estimates below, 7 subjects are estimated to provide  80% power to detect a change 
from baseline , so enrolling 10 subjects should provide adequate sample size for the 
analyses.  
 
Sample size e stimate : No comparable preliminary data exists on MCC in response to  ACTs . 
However, our lab  has collected pertinent  data, i.e. the effect  of 2 HS doses (given 100 minutes and 
4.5 hours min after isotope was inhaled) on  MCC  in CF patients  (N=11)  using the same SILP  
method  we propose here. The mean (SD) values at baseline and after HS are shown in Table 1.  We 
used linear interpolation to estimate the AUC -Clr2 70 value for these data, as this is close to the 
selected final imaging time point in the proposed study.  
     Table 1 
 Baseline, mean (SD)  Post -HS, mean (SD)  Mean Change (SD)  
AUC -Clr 180 17.4 (11.5)  30.5 (11.6)  13.1 (9.4)  
AUC -Clr 360 47.4 (26.6)  89.9 (27.2)  42.4 (21.2)  
Interpolated AUC -Clr 270 32.4 (19.0)  60.2 (19.1)  27.7 (15.1)  
 We predict that the observed mean change in AUC -Clr
[ADDRESS_438982] will be somewhat smaller 
because this study  uses a baseline that likely will be accelerated by a partially active intervention 
(huff cough) . Therefore, w e estimate a more conservative predicted effect size of  20.0 (72% of that 
observed after HS) with the same estimate of variability (SD 15.1) in our sample size calculations.

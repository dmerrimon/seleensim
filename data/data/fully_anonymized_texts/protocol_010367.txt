flush  and aqueous cells and flare . Surgical  trauma and phacoemulsification energy activate an 
inflammatory cascade that ultimately leads to formation of prostaglandins, which results in local 
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.  
Inflammation may resolve with no treatment in 15 -28% of patients. However, i nadequately 
treated  inflammation after cataract surgery frequently causes  pain, photophobia, increased risk 
for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) , corneal edema , corneal scarring  and cystoid macular 
edema  [Aptel et al., 2017 ]. Thus, managing and treating postoperative inflammation is an 
important goal following cataract surgery.   
Other ocular inflammatory diseases include , for example , non-infectious uveitis, a potentially 
blinding condition that is the fifth leading cause of visual loss in the developed world ( third 
leading cause of preventable blindness), has been estimated to account for 10% of all visual 
impairment in the western wo rld and 10–15% of cases of total blindness [Nussenblatt, 1990; 
Merida et al., 2015 ]. Anterior uveitis accounts for approximately 80% of non -infectious uveitis 
cases in the [LOCATION_002] [Thorne et al., 2016 ].  
Uveitis is characterized by [CONTACT_222792], recurrent, chronic or 
acute -on-chronic. Untreated, recurrent bouts of uveitis eventually lead to tissue destruction from 
direct infla mmation or from complications such as cataract, glaucoma and macular edema.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_222783]-infectious uveitis and 
postoperative inflammation.  In the US, topi[INVESTIGATOR_599227] (QID) dosing for at least [ADDRESS_792715] surgery  [Kim et al., 2019 ]. 
The side effects associated with steroid use , significantly limit prolonged treatment. The most 
common adverse effects of ocular steroids are cataract  and elevated IOP which can lead to 
steroid related glaucoma.  
Given the limitations of treatment , there is a need for a n effective anti -inflammatory drug that 
does not have an IOP -elevating effect.  Tarsius Pharma has developed  a novel therapeutic 
approach for local prevention and treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory diseases.

Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive TRS01 - , TRS01 , 
TRS01 % or vehicle  dose on Day 1.  
Randomization will occur after subjects m eet all eligibility requirements at Screening and Day 
1/Visit 3  (1-day post -surgery). Each subject will be assigned a unique subject number.  
Each kit package (contain ing two IP bottles) will contain  a kit number that can be later corelated 
to the subject number at the site.  
Randomization for the US sites will be sepa rate from the French site.  
The randomization codes and all data sets will be stored in a secure area accessible only to 
delegated study personnel and only released on completion of the study and after the study 
database has been locked.  
In this study all p arties are to be masked to the allocated treatment; investigators, study staff  and 
subjects . At the site, there will be designated unmasked study staff that will train the subject  on 
all study procedures  related to IP administration . 
In emergency situations for reasons of subject  safety (e.g.  serious unexpected /unlisted drug 
related event;  medical emergency;  potentially life-threatening  drug interaction)  the masking  code 
may need to be broken. In those cases, whenever  possible,  a request for unmasking  should be 
discussed with the sponsor (or designee) prior to unmasking . Detailed instruction on the method 
for breaking the mask  will be provided during site training and noted in the Investigator  study 
file. 
Following the first IP administration, if the subject  perceives any AE that may be attributed to 
the IP, these should be reported to the unmasked  site personnel.   
4.4 INFORMED  CONSENT   
Prior to undergoing any study -related activity, the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will 
discuss  the purpose and pertinent details of the study with each potentially eligible subject . The 
explanation w ill be  sufficiently detailed to allow the subject  to make an informed decision to 
participate in the study. If the subject  is willing to participate in the study, he/she w ill be 
requested to give written informed consent. A copy of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) will be  
signed by [CONTACT_599237] e Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee . 
The signed and dated ICF w ill be  retained with the study records, and a copy of the signed and

Other safety measures are discussed in section  7.2 above.  
 
7.3 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonab le possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected: An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
Investiga tor’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
  
Life-threatening: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might ha ve caused death.  
 
A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at 
any dose that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above).  
 
A NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs 
as described above.  
 
Tarsius -2020 -Trial   001 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 06March2020                Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_792742] (unrelated,  probably, definitely). The AE will be assessed using the 
following definitions :  
 
Unrelated:  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event  easily explained by [CONTACT_599242]  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational product 
use.  
 
Probable:  
• Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_599243].  
• Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.

7.4 PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_222801], date and time of resolution, sever ity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of 
investigational product), treatment required, and the outcome.  
 
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial. For example:  
• How have you felt since your last assessment?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?  
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.  
 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_599232] a nd categorized as unrelated, probable, 
or definite.  
 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate. If a 
non-SAE is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to follow 
Tarsius -2020 -Trial   001 Clinical Study Protocol

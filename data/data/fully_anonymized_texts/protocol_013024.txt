IRB number: [ADDRESS_1233743] vs Ultrasound-assisted Catheter Thrombolysis for Submassive Pulmonary 
Embolism
Principal Investigators: Wissam Jaber, MD and Michael McDaniel, MD
IRB number: [ZIP_CODE]
Draft date:  February 10, 2017
SUMMARY
Background: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) accounts for 5-10% of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241900]. 
Systemic anticoagulation (AC) is the standard of care and thrombolysis is recommended for those 
at a higher mortality risk. Catheter-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882184] 
(CDT) and ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis ([LOCATION_003]T) have been introduced as new more 
effective and safer treatment modalities. [LOCATION_003]T is a modification of standard catheter lysis utilizing 
a system of local ultrasound to dissociate the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, allowing deeper 
penetration of lytics. However, there is limited comparative effectiveness data against standard 
multi-sidehole catheter infusion. More rapid clearance of pulmonary thrombus by [CONTACT_882193].  Alternatively, if thrombus clearance 
is similar, the cost of [LOCATION_003]T may exceed the cost of CDT (equipment and disposables), without 
offering any potential advantage.
Hypothesis: Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis is superior to Standard Catheter 
Thrombolysis for patients with submassive PE
Objectives/Aims: 1. Determine differences in the percentage of thrombus load reduction (CTA 
Obstruction Index) from baseline to the termination of lysis; 2. Determine differences in 
cardiopulmonary and clinical outcomes; 3. Determine differences in the impact of catheter 
directed intervention on functional capacity (NYHA score and 6-min walk test) and health-related 
quality of life outcomes (SF36, PE QOL, and San Diego Shortness of Breath questionnaires at 3 
and 12 months; 4. Detail the cost differences in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113493] (i.e., procedure costs, 
adverse event costs, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]) and discharge costs (nursing care, subsequent outpatient 
care) to inform a Markov state-transition cost-effectiveness model.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Statistical Power: The study is powered on the primary endpoint. 40 patients will be needed at 
each group for a power of 0.80.
RESEARCH PLAN 
a. SPECIFIC AIMS
Hypothesis: Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis is superior to Standard Catheter 
Thrombolysis for patients with submassive PE
Aim 1: Determine differences in the percentage of thrombus load reduction from baseline to the 
termination of lysis between the two techniques

b. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) carries a high morbidity and is the third-leading cause of 
cardiovascular mortality in the western world. It accounts for 5-10% of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882185] 200,[ADDRESS_1233744] that approximately 10% of all patients with acute PE die during the first [ADDRESS_1233745] observed survivors for >[ADDRESS_1233746] reported an incidence 
of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 1-5% within 2-[ADDRESS_1233747] 
on the patient's quality of life and prognosis.
The management acute PE is mainly guided by [CONTACT_882194]. 
Initial systemic anticoagulation (AC) is the standard of care and treatment is escalated based on 
the clinical presentation and patient characteristics that may stratify them at a higher mortality 
risk. The goals of therapy are to primarily prevent mortality, and secondarily potentially prevent 
late onset chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and improve quality of life.2, 
3, 5, 11-14
Massive PE is defined as PE associated with sustained hemodynamic instability, whereas 
submassive PE (sPE) is defined as PE without hemodynamic instability but with abnormal right 
ventricular (RV) function and/or evidence of myocardial necrosis.[ADDRESS_1233748] to accurately risk stratify sPE to identify the patients who are at increased risk of 
decompensating and/or dying. Clinical scores, imaging tests and biomarkers are under 
investigation, yet an ideal prognostic tool is still pending. A novel cardiac biomarker, heart-type 
fatty acid-binding protein (h-FABP), is emerging as a significant predictor of mortality in patients 
with submassive PE.15, [ADDRESS_1233749] 
recent metaanalysis, the subgroup analysis of 8 submassive PE trials (1993-2014, n=1775) 
showed that thrombolytic therapy was associated with a mortality reduction (1.39% vs 2.92%) but 
with an increase in major bleeding (7.74% vs 2.25%).[ADDRESS_1233750] randomized trial (PEITHO, 1006 patients) which compared a single, weight-adapted i.v. 
bolus of tenecteplase with standard anticoagulation.18
The recent development of catheter-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882186]-directed thrombolysis 
(CDT), ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis ([LOCATION_003]T), and pharmacomechanical or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_882187].[ADDRESS_1233751] acknowledged CDT as a viable treatment alternative for high risk acute sPE 
(echocardiographic RV dysfunction and elevated cardiac biomarkers), if appropriate expertise is 
available and particularly when the bleeding risk is high.3, [ADDRESS_1233752] 
randomized controlled trial to include CDIs for sPE comparing standardized fixed-dose of [LOCATION_003]T 
(10mg rtPA per lung over 15 hours) and AC to AC alone.21 In the [LOCATION_003]T group, but not in the 
heparin group, the mean RV/LV ratio was significantly reduced at 24 hours, but became 
comparable between the two groups at 90 days. The RV systolic function was significantly 
improved in the [LOCATION_003]T group vs. the heparin group at both 24 hours and 90 days. In both study 
groups minor bleeding complications were rare and there were no major bleeding complications. 
The SEATTLE II trial, a single-arm study evaluating the effectiveness of [LOCATION_003]T, showed also an 
RV/LV ratio improvement at 48 hours.29
Limited data exists for comparing different catheter-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882188]. The 
majority of recent series for catheter-directed interventions utilize [LOCATION_003]T exclusively; however 
there is limited comparative effectiveness data comparing this modality to standard multi-sidehole 
catheter infusion.15, 16, 19, 30 Preliminary, non-controlled data are conflicting. One series by [CONTACT_882195] 33 high-risk PE patients suggested benefit for [LOCATION_003]T for angiographic clearance of 
thrombus burden with more bleeding events in the CDT group.31 Kuo and colleagues noted no 
difference in outcomes and treatment specifics between [LOCATION_003]T and CDT in the recently published 
early results of a multicenter prospective registry.28 Our retrospective analysis of 63 patients 
suggests that there may be no difference between the two treatment modalities, demonstrating 
similar rates of outcomes such as survival, hemodynamic stabilization, and echocardiographic 
parameters in both groups with similar procedure length and lytic dose in the time-adjusted 
cohorts.32 Selection bias cannot be underestimated in all these studies.
The expected benefit of [LOCATION_003]T has been dependent on the device’s ability to increase 
penetration of lytic into thrombus using high frequency, low power ultrasound, due to its reversible 
effects on fibrin dissociation.19, [ADDRESS_1233753] 
effective (e.g. via reduced length of ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]).  Alternatively, if thrombus clearance 
is similar, the cost of [LOCATION_003]T may exceed the cost of CDT (proprietary equipment and 
disposables), without offering any potential advantage.
Preliminary, non-controlled data are conflicting. One series by [CONTACT_882196] [ADDRESS_1233754] catheter directed 
thrombolysis to ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis for the treatment of acute submassive PE. 
The study will include patients eligible for catheter directed thrombolysis per the study protocol 
for submassive PE (CT or echocardiographic RV strain (defined as RV/LV ratio >1) without 
persisting hypotension <90mmHg or drop of systolic blood pressure by [CONTACT_2669] 40mm Hg for at 
least 15 minutes with signs of end-organ hypoperfusion (cold extremities or low urinary output 
<30 mL/h or mental confusion) and without the need of catecholamine support or cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation).
The treatment with CDT or [LOCATION_003]T are standard of care for submassive PE. All the procedures, 
tests and follow up visits are according to current standard of care.
Exclusion criteria: age <18; pregnancy; index PE symptom duration >14 days; high bleeding 
risk (any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular disease or 
neoplasm, ischemic stroke within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or 
bleeding diathesis, recent spi[INVESTIGATOR_882189]/brain surgery, recent closed-head or facial trauma with 
bony fracture or brain injury); participation in any other investigational drug or device study; life 
expectancy <90 days; and inability to comply with study assessments.
At baseline all patients need to have
1. Chest CT angiogram with contrast diagnostic of PE
2. Baseline transthoracic echocardiogram
3. Baseline cardiac biomarkers 
a. Cardiac troponin (cTn) 
b. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and/or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP)
All patients will be treated initially with unfractionated heparin by [CONTACT_2329] a standardized dosing 
protocol. Immediately after consent, vital signs will be recorded, a pulse oximetry reading will be 
obtained with the patient breathing room air for [ADDRESS_1233755] 
commercially available multi-sidehole catheter or a [LOCATION_003]T catheter. 
Technical considerations (access, intraoperative tPA bolus, tPA drippi[INVESTIGATOR_882190]) will be left to 
the discretion and preference of the operator. Invasive pressure tracings will be obtained from the 
drug delivery catheters when positioned in the pulmonary arteries (main, right or left). The 
maximum tPA dosing should not exceed 24mg.
Termination of lysis will be left to the discretion of the operator. As a general recommendation 
lysis should be terminated once clinical (e.g. O2 requirements), hemodynamic (e.g. pulse rate or 
blood pressure) and/or echocardiographic parameters (e.g. RV dilatation) improve or if a 
complication occurs. Lysis catheters and sheaths can be removed at the bedside. Before removal, 
invasive pressure tracings will be recorded from the drug delivery catheter.
A transthoracic echocardiogram should be obtained just before or within [ADDRESS_1233756] CTA examination.
Patients will be followed up at 3 months and 12 months.
Primary Endpoint: PE thrombus load reduction (CT obstruction index) from baseline to the 
termination of lysis.
The pre and post lysis CTA will be compared by [ADDRESS_1233757]  10  segmental  arteries  (three to  the  upper  lobes,  two  to  both  the  middle  lobe  and  
the  lingula, and  five  to  the  lower  lobes). The vascular obstruction scores will be determined 
as previously described by [CONTACT_882197]. and Mastora et al.35,36
Secondary Endpoints:
1. Clinical outcomes comparison
a. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 90-day mortality
b. Decompensation to massive PE (hypotension <90mmHg and use of 
catecholamines)
c. Major and minor bleeding. Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding associated 
with a fall in the hemoglobin level of at least 2.0 g/dL or with transfusion of ≥2 U of 
red blood cells or involvement of a critical site (intracranial, intraspi-nal, intraocular, 
retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intra-muscular with compartment 
syndrome). Clinically overt bleeding not fulfilling the criteria of major bleeding is 
classified as a minor bleeding complication.
d. Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 90-day follow-up. There will be 
no routine surveillance for asymptomatic recurrent VTE. Recurrent VTE will be 
diagnosed if suspected symptoms or signs of deep vein thrombosis or acute PE 
are objectively confirmed by [CONTACT_882198] (new filling defect by [CONTACT_882199]-enhanced chest CT, new high-probability perfusion defect 
revealed by [CONTACT_882200], or positive compression ultrasound study for deep vein 
thrombosis). 
e. Major adverse events up to 90 days after randomization.
f. Clinical success: PE related decompensation prevention without a 90-day major 
adverse event or death.
g. ICU length of stay
2. Echocardiographic parameters comparison
a. RV/LV, TAPSE (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and RVSP (Right 
Ventricular Systolic Pressure) improvement from baseline to the termination of 
lysis
b. RV/LV, TAPSE and RVSP at 90 days
c. RV/LV, TAPSE and RVSP at [ADDRESS_1233758] effectiveness model will be created to simulate patient 
oriented outcomes assuming a societal perspective with a 12-month time horizon. All point 
estimates for model parameters will be determined from the prospectively collected data, 
as described above. Quality adjusted life years will be determined for each therapy based 
on survival, freedom from major adverse events, discharge status, functional status, and 
quality of life measures. Costs will be calculated for each therapy based on in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_851367] (i.e., length of stay in the ICU, operating room and procedure costs, 
and associated adverse event costs) and out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680] (outpatient nursing care, 
loss of work, outpatient testing and follow-up).

Statistical Analysis: 
The study is powered on the primary endpoint that is thrombus load reduction (obstruction index). 
We propose to compare standard CDT and [LOCATION_003]T at post-treatment with analysis of covariance, 
controlling for differences remaining after randomization. Population parameters for the 
obstruction score have not been published, so we consulted several relevant studies reporting on 
thrombus reduction scores in order to predict sample size.19,31,34,39 We assumed that CDT with 
ultrasound enhancement ([LOCATION_003]T group) should be ≥50% more effective than without ultrasound 
enhancement (control group) and calculated an expected relative mean thrombus reduction of 
43% in the CDT control group.40.[ADDRESS_1233760] the 
differences with a power of 0.80.

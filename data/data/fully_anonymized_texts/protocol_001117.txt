Study Title   
Randomized Trial Evaluating Effectiveness of neoClose® Abdominal Closure 
Device versus CarterThomason® Needle Passer  
 
Trial Design   
A randomized trial intended to compare neoClose® abdominal closure versus 
standard Carter - Thomason® closure in a bariatric surgery gastric by[CONTACT_292402]. The primary objective of the study is to compare 
the technical effectiveness of the devices.  A secondary outcome will be a nalysis 
of pain scores associated with the distinct closures.  
The study will be by a group of 6 Bariatric / General Surgeons at a high volume 
academic  institution.  Patients will be randomized upon induction  of anesthesia 
and blinded to the closure techniqu e performed. Video analysis of technical 
effectiveness will be performed as well as clinic follow up at [ADDRESS_356852] .

Study Population   
Adults aged 18 -70 years with BMI > [ADDRESS_356853] completed a multimodality 
bariatric work up (EGD, nutrition evaluation and psychological evaluation) and 
selected to have an elective gastric by[CONTACT_292403].  
 
Subjects who fail to complete extensive pre -operative work up including 
endoscopic surveillance, nutrition visit, psycholog ical clearance will be excluded 
from the study. A pregnancy test will be done on female subjects as part of 
Standard of care.  
 
There will be 35 patients per group. A power analysis was completed using the 
data derived from our preclinical porcine study usi ng primary endpoint of time 
(32 seconds for Carter - Thomason ® and 18.5 seconds for neoClose ®). The alpha 
utilized was 0.05.  A total of 70 patients will be screened for the study.  
 
Assessments   
The study will allow for the evaluation of technical effectiveness and analysis of 
pain scoring:  
 
Technical Effectiveness  
 Number of sutures required to complete  closure.  
 Time required to complete  closure.  
 Depth of needle penetration to complete  closure.  
 Evaluate for surgical site occurrences immediately post op as well as at  1 
,6 weeks and 1 year after closure procdure.  
 Evaluation for port site hernia at 6 weeks with abdominal  ultrasound. 
Pain  Evaluation  
 Visual analog pain scale will be used to assess pai n at both port  sites.  
 Amount of intravenous narcotics required during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292398].  
 
The study will allow for assessment of pain scores during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292399] [ADDRESS_356854] 
the time and depth of needle exposure. Patients will fill out pain analog scores

popular closure device is the Carter -Thomason® needle.  This device has inherent limitations:  
 
(1) Insertion of the needle is associated with injury to the viscera and blood  vessels.  
(2) The width of the suture placed using the Carter -Thomason® needle can lead to compression 
of peritoneum and entrapment of underlying nerves, causing post -operative port site  pain.  
(3) Placement of the suture is challenging in the obese patient.  (1) 
 
Very few studies have been completed to compare novel devices to the Carter - Thomason® with 
equivocal data.  (2)(3) 
Current practice requires fascial closure with a suture passing needle whic h passes the suture 
material through some amount of subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and fascia.  This technique is 
often associated with elevated levels of discomfort which can remain weeks after the operation is 
complete. In addition, the technique of port s ite closure can be difficult to learn leading to 
prolonged times potential needle exposure to underlying viscera as well as times for port site 
closure.  
The development of a novel closure device which relies upon the guided deployment of 
suture / fasteners  could help improve the learning curve associated with port site closure. In 
addition, such a technique that would not require passage of suture material through adjacent 
muscle and isolated the posterior fascia could lead to an improvement in patient sati sfaction 
secondary to a decrease in pain.  
The neoClose ® device is an abdominal closure device that has been approved by [CONTACT_34033] 
2013 (510K) to use as such.  The study aims to add to the existing knowledge about these kinds 
of devices and also to evaluate the effectiveness of the neoClose® device compared to the Carter - 
Thomason® device. Moreover, surveys will also be administered to patients using the Visual 
Analog Scale of pain to establish pain scores associated with individual closures.  
 
B. STUDY DESIGN AND  PROCEDURE  
 
Patient Allocation  
 
This is a randomized study consisting of 35 patients. This site will be the only site across the US 
doing the study.  On the morning of the procedure,  qualified subjects who were consented for 
the study will be randomized to fascial closure with either the neoClose® device or  a Carter -

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-15-0668  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/02/2017   Thomason® suture passer. The floor team and the subjects will be blinded to the closure 
technique.  
 
 
Small Pouch Gastric By[CONTACT_292404]. Briefly, the procedure 
involves  the placement of 6 total trocars.  Two large trocars (12 mm port placed 3 cm cephalad 
to the umbilicus and a 12 mm port in the right mid clavicular line) undergo fascial closure at the 
completion of the case.  The dissection is started by [CONTACT_7328] a small p roximal gastric pouch with 
a linear stapler.  A hand sewn gastrojejunostomy is then created approximately 50 cm distal to 
the ligament of Treitz.  The small intestine is divided and then a 150 cm roux limb is created and 
a small bowel anastomosis is comple ted. No local anesthetic will be utilized in the study  patients 
in order to avoid compounding variable to the assessment of pain  scores.  
 
Sleeve Gastrectomy  
Patients having robotic assited sleeve gasterectomy will also be in the study. For this 
procedure, the same number of trocers and same locations will utilized. The stomach is 
visualized and fully mobilized. Sleeve gastrectomy is achieved with a linear stapler. The 
stomach is removed from the 15 - mm port site in the right upper quadrant. Similar to the 
gastric by[CONTACT_292405], local anesthesia will not be used to avoid compounding 
variable in pain assessment.  
 
 
Port Site Closure  
Either the neoClose® device with provided suture/fasteners or a Carter - Thomason® suture passer 
with [ADDRESS_356859] protected UT supplied computer in Excel files by [CONTACT_292406]. Upon analysis of the data, the MRN will be deleted thereby [CONTACT_292407].

F. CLINICAL  EVENTS  
 
Risks  
 
Risks to the patient are the same as the baseline procedure with Carter - Thomason® - visceral 
injury, hematoma, hernia, pain. There is no foreseeable additional risk when using the 
neoClose® device over the baseline treatment.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs)  
AEs clinically relevant to the patient will be recorded from the perioperative period thro ugh the 
sick week follow up period.  
The following is a non -comprehensive list of possible adverse events:  
 Hematoma or bleeding at port  site. 
 Iatrogenic visceral injury during port  closure.  
 Seroma at port  site. 
 SSI at port  site. 
 
G. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
Confidentiality  
Data that will be gathered for the study will be de -identified to protect patient information. 
Research charts and video recordings would be stored in a room under lock  and key. No 
identifying markers w ould be included in the video recording of subjects in the study. Only the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_292401]. The video 
recordings will be kept for a maximum of [ADDRESS_356863] is otherwise entitled, and that withdrawal from the registry will not 
jeopardize their future medical care.

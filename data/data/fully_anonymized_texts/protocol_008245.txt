Protocol 
Number:  DSJ_2019_08  
Treatment 
Devices:  The treatment device is the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  which is used  for assessing the 
anatomy of a patient’s knee, assisting in the planning of the position of the femur and tibia 
implant components intra operatively and assisting the surgeon with the bone preparation 
during total knee arthroplasty. The system will be uti lized to implant ATTUNE  total knee 
replacement s. Any of the commercially available configurations of the ATTUNE  primary knee 
system are permitted  for use according to the standard of care at the site. Those subjects 
treated using  VELYS Robotic- Assisted Sol ution  will be referred to as the Robotics cohort.  
Control Device:  The control devices are the  ATTUNE  Intuition instruments which are manual instruments. 
This instrument system will be utilized to implant ATTUNE  total knee replacements. Any of 
the commercially available configurations of the ATTUNE  primary knee system are permitted 
for use according to th e standard of care at the site.  Those subjects treated using the 
Intuition Instruments will be referred to as the Manual cohort.  
Intended Use for 
the Device:  The intended use of the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  is to assist the surgeon to perform 
prima ry total knee arthroplasty utilizing the ATTUNE  knee system.  
Primary Objective:  To determine whether the accuracy to plan of the  long leg  alignment achieved with the 
VELYS Robotic- Assisted Solution  is non -inferior to the accuracy to plan of the long leg 
alignment achieved with the manual ATTUNE  Intuition  instrumentation.  This will be assessed 
on long -leg X -rays taken at 12 weeks.  
• Note: If non -inferiority is successfully demonstrated, then the study will be deemed 
to be successful, and a test for superiority of accuracy to plan of the long leg  
alignment achieved with VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  will be conducted.  
Secondary Objectives:  Evaluate the nature, severity, and frequency of local adverse events associated wit h the use 
of the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  in total knee arthroplasty during the procedure and 
within th e subsequent [ADDRESS_339370] i ntra -operative clinical assessment of soft tissue damage in both Manual  and 
Robotics cohorts.  
Summarize the alignment outliers (>3 degrees outside of plan) in both Manual and Robotics 
cohorts.  
Summarize surgical time for the Robotics and Manual cohorts.  
Summarize individual component alignment achieved with manual instruments and Robotics 
in the frontal and sagittal planes, specifically: distal femoral varus -valgus (FM), proximal tibial 
varus -valgus (TM), femoral component flexion and tibial slope.

 2 INTRODUCTION            
Primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common, elective surgical procedure performed frequently to 
alleviate pain most commonly  due to osteoarthritis, with factors such as age (older being more frequently 
replaced) and gender (females being more frequent sufferers of knee OA) influencing the patient 
demographics. The clinical demand for TKA use is increasing, with demand for primary total knee replacement in the [LOCATION_002] alone being forecast to rise by [CONTACT_46431] 600% to 3.48M from 2005 to 2030 [1].   
The surgical process  is a key contributor to the success of TKA  with orthopaedic surgeons striving to 
execute bone resections  and make soft tissue adjustments  to achieve optimal implant p ositio n; ensuring 
longevity and improve d patient function and satisfaction . Therefore , over time there has been a continual 
evolution in the techniques and technologies employed to achieve this goal. Manual instrumentation 
including jigs, fixtures and cutting guides are used to guide the surgeons ’ resections  relative to anatomical 
landmarks such as the tibial axis, femoral canal and posterior condylar axis . This method was first 
developed in the 1980s and when combined with surgeon skill and experience generally results in  good 
outcomes and remains the most commonly used methodology for implanting a total knee. However, up 
to 6% of  patients who undergo a primary TKA may require a revision  within 5 years of the  procedure [2] 
and whilst the majority of revisions are attributed to infection it is widely accepted that implan t 
positioning influences the rate of other leading causes of revision such as  instability  and  loosening [3].  
 
One of the key parameters in the outcome of the surgical procedure is the alignment of the knee implant components relative to the mechanical axis of the leg . The mechanical alignment philosophy was 
proposed by [CONTACT_277992] [4] . Mechanical axis alignment is 
defined as the line drawn from the center of the femoral head through the ce nter of the knee and ankle. 
The knee is generally considered to be in proper alignment when these three points are collinear in the frontal plane  [4-6]. Many authors have observed that the correct alignment of the lower limb is correlated 
with clinical success in total knee arthroplasty  [6-8]. 
 In a b id to increase consistency in the achievement  of parameters such as  alignment , Computer Assisted 
Surgery (CAS) was developed in the early 2000’s . Optical localization technology is used to collect intra-
operative data and track relative position of the bones and instruments during surgery.  Intra -operative 
data is used to register the patient anatomy and enables the surgeon to define an d adjus t planning for 
the placement of the implant.  Based on the plan, the system guides the surgeon to position cutting blocks 
which in turn controls  alignment of the cutting plan e for the required steps . More recently r obotic systems 
have been introduced which build on the same technology developed for CAS whilst  providing more 
control or assistance to the surgeon during e xecution of the resections  to increase the probability of 
achieving the desired outputs . The VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  is currently being developed by [CONTACT_277993].  
 
2.1 Summary of Preclinical/Clinical Experience  
Bench testing was performed on the subject device, VELY S Robotic -Assisted Solution , in accordance with 
the product risk analysis and product requirements. This include d testing that addressed  accuracy and 
repeatability, service life, mechanical integrity and usability of the system. All acceptance criteria were 
met, and no issues of Safety or Effectiveness were identified.

 A cadaveric study compared the accuracy of the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution to manual 
instrumentation. Five  surgeon s each performed eight bilateral total knee replacement surgeries – with 
the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution one side and conventional instruments ( ATTUNE  Intuition) on the 
contralateral side  (total sample size of 40) . Bone resection depth levels were measured intra -operatively 
using digital calipers.  Resected bones were CT and laser scanned, then bone  preparation was completed, 
followed by [CONTACT_277994]. Final implant  position  was measured using additional laser scanning.   
During each case, surgeons  evaluated the integrity of defined knee soft tissue structures (medial collateral 
ligament [MCL], lateral collateral ligament [LCL], posterior cruciate ligament [PCL], Posterior Medial 
capsule, Posterior Lateral capsule, and the patellar ligament) after completing all bone resections. 
Additionally, surgeons were asked to evaluate  resected bone quality,  overall  final long leg alignment, 
and soft-tissue balance during trialing.   
 The robotic -assisted surgical cohort had statistically smaller mean absolute errors for femoral varus -
valgus  angle (p<0.000), tibial varus -valgus angle  (p=0.001), and tibial proximal resection thickness 
(p<0.000) and were statistically equivalent to manual  instrumentation for femoral flexion -extension angle, 
femoral internal external angle, femoral distal resection depth and tibial flexion -extension (posterior 
slope) angle. The robotic -assisted cohort was also found to have statistically smaller errors in f inal implant 
alignment for femoral varus -valgus angle, femoral flexion- extension and tibial varus -valgus angles.  
All inspected soft tissue was uncompromised following robotic -assisted bone resection. After each 
procedure, all surgeon participants responded ‘Yes’ when asked if the final long leg alignment was 
clinically acceptable. In addition, all surgeon participants responded ‘Yes’ when asked if the knee soft tissue was stable and balanced.   
 2.[ADDRESS_339373] 10 years .  
Literature suggests that the currently available systems can increase the accuracy vs. manual 
instrumentation  in both unicondylar knee arthroplasty ([LOCATION_006]A) [9 -11] and TKA  [12-15].  
A learning curve has been identified with the introduction of r obotic  systems for [LOCATION_006]A and TKA which is 
associated with an increase in the operating time but importantly, based on the current literature this period is not associated with an increase in adverse events  or a reduction in accuracy  [16-21]. There is no 
consensus on  the length of the learning curve with large variation in the  number of cases found in these 
studies. It will clearly vary depending on the  system , the  amount of previous experience with 
CAS/Robotically assisted surgery , the training and support provided to the new user  and how steady state 
is defined .   
Translation  of the improvement in accuracy to improvements in other outcomes such as patient 
satisfaction , pain  and function are less clear with some studies finding no difference  [22, 23]  and other 
studies finding subtle improvements  [24-26]. This may be du e to these clinical outcomes  being highly 
dependent of factors beyond the accuracy of the placement of the implant.

 3.2 Study Design Rationale  
The study is designed  as a multi -center prospective sequential controlled cohort study. Each site will enroll 
Subjects into the manual  cohort until their enrollment target has been reached, and then will enroll 
Subjects into the robotic cohort. The manual cohort will be used as benchmark data that the robotic 
cohort can be compared to . A sequential design was chosen to mitigate the risk of  learnings from the 
study  arm influencing the control arm. As the primary objective is accuracy which can be measured 
objectively randomizing was deemed  to not add any benefit. Likewise blinding the Subjects  would add 
significant complexity to the study without influencing the objective measures that are the focus of the 
study. A single knee system (ATTUNE ) will be used to minimize variation.  
 3.[ADDRESS_339375] pro cedure 
employed  [4]. The theory being that the knee replacement should be loaded evenly on the medial and 
lateral condyles to avoid subsidence or loosening at the side under greater load. This was subsequently 
supported by [CONTACT_277995] i mplanted in mechanical alignment Vs. 
those implanted with a varus or valgus alignment  [6, 8] . More recently some authors have challenge d the 
criticality of implant ing the knee in perfect neutral alignment with some variation accepted with the goal 
of better replication of the patients’ specific  knee alignment and improved management of the soft tissues 
of the knee  [27-29]. Either way, achieving the planned long leg alignment is deemed important in the 
survivorship and function of the knee replacement and  can be used as a surrogate  measure of the 
procedure success and the refore the  VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution’s  success in guiding the surgeon to 
this goal.    
The long leg alignment can be measured via X -ray at the first follow up (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6- 12 weeks) when the 
Subjects  are full weight bearing and the swelling has subsided suffici ently to allow the patient to reach

  3.4 Rationale of Study Population  
Patients aged 22 -85 years who meet the indications of the ATTUNE  Knee system in a primary case 
including patients with severely painful and/or severely disabled joint resulting from osteoarthritis, post -
traumatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis  are targeted for this study. The study is limited to primary TK A 
and excludes failed previous TKA as the VELYS Robotic- Assisted Solution  is only  cleared for use in primary 
TKA. In addition to contraindications specified by [CONTACT_277996], 
contraindications for using the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  are as follows:  
• Patients for whom a hip center of rotation cannot be established using the VELYS ™ Robo tic-
Assisted registration protocols . 
• Patients in whom the necessary bony landmarks needed for registration are not present or 
accessible.  
These contraindications for the VELYS system are not included in the exclusion criteria for the study as 
they may be c hallenging to identify pre -operatively and may only become evident when  the surgeon has 
made  an intra- operative assessment. Information on the management of subjects in whom these 
contra -indications are detected intra -operatively  is given in Table [ADDRESS_339377] DEFINITION                                                                                            
       
Patients aged 22 -85 years who meet the indications of the ATTUNE  Knee system in a primary case 
including patients with severely painful and/or severely disabled joint resulting from osteoarthritis, post -
traumatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis  may be considered for enrollment in this study.  
Subjects who do not meet  all inclusion criteria or who meet any of the exclusion criteria are withdrawn  
from the study

5 OBJECTIVES             
 5.1 Primary Objective   
The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate  whether the accuracy to plan of the long 
leg alignment achieved with VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  is non -inferior to the accuracy to plan of 
the long leg alignment achieved with the manual ATTUNE  Intuition instrumentation.  This will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_277997] -Knee- Ankle angle (HKA) on long-leg X -rays taken at 12 weeks and 
comparing to the planned HKA .

  This will be followed by a subsequent superiority analysis to determine if the VELYS Robo tic-Assisted 
Solution  is more accurate in achieving this goal than the manual ATTUNE  Intuition Instrumentation.    
5.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate the nature, severity, and frequency of local adverse events associated with the use of 
the Robotic system in total knee arthroplasty during the procedure and within the follow up period, assessed at  12 weeks, 90 days  (specific cut of the data only, no visit)  and 1 year .  
• Intra -operative clinical assessment of soft tissue damage in both Manual  and Robotics cohorts.  
The condition and function of the key knee structures (medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral 
collateral ligament (LCL) , posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), patella tendon (PT), posterior lateral 
capsule (PLC) and posterior medial capsule (PMC) will be assessed intra- operatively.  
• Summarize the alignment outliers (long leg alignment >3 degrees outsid e of  plan  ) in both 
Manual  and Robotics cohorts.  
• Summarize surgical time for the Robotics and Manual  cohorts ; including skin -to-skin time , 
operating room utilization (wheels in -to-wheels out) and total operating room time (including 
set up and clean down) .  
• Summarize individual component alignment achieved with manual instruments and Robotics in the frontal and sagittal planes, specifically: distal femoral varus -valgus (FM), proximal tibial 
varus -valgus (TM), femoral component flexion and tibial slope . 
 
5.3 Tertiary Objectives  
Additional tertiary objectives are:  
• To evaluate impact of surgeon learning curve on the Robotic system on accuracy of surgical procedure (assessed via accuracy to plan of long leg alignment ), patient reported outcomes, 
safety, and surgical time.  
• Summarize the  patient reported outcomes (EQ5 -D, KOOS, FJS,  Patient Knee Pain and Satisfaction) 
for the Robotics cohort vs. the Manual  cohort.  
• Summarize the  length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/stay for the Robotics cohort vs. the Manual  cohort.   
 
For the Robotics cohort there will be the following additional exploratory objectives:  
• Assessment of the correlation between the planned long leg alignment and the post-resection  
long leg alignment recorded on the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  case report.  
• Assessment of the correlation between the post- resection  long leg alignment recorded on the 
VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  case report and the long leg alignment measured via weight 
bearing X -ray at 12 weeks.   
• Assessment of the correlation between the planned medial and lateral gaps in extension and the post -resection  medial and lateral gaps in extension recorded on the VELYS Robotic -Assisted 
Solution  case report.  
• Assessment of the correlation between the planned medial and lateral gaps in flexion and the post -resection  medial and lateral gaps in flexion reco rded on the VELYS Robotic- Assisted Solution  
case report.  
• Assessment of the correlation between the post -resection  medial and lateral gaps in flexion and 
extension and the thickness of the tibial insert implanted as recorded in the device log.

6 STUDY DESIGN            
This study is designed as a p rospective sequential controlled cohort study. Each site will enroll Subjects 
into the Manual cohort until their enrollment target has been reached, and then will enroll Subjects into 
the Robotic c ohort. Level of Evidence is II.  
There will be a maximum of 8 sites that will recruit a total of 200 Subjects ( 100 manual control arm  and 
100 in the Robotic study arm ). Each  site will use the  implant  configuration(s) that fit with their standard

 of care. Both resurfaced patella and non -resurfaced patella are permitted in this investigation, consistent 
with the site’s standard of care.  
Each site is expected to implant approximately 10- [ADDRESS_339381] (see Section 4.3. Definition of Subject Enrollment)  except 
for information that was gathered previously as part of the standard of care at the site .   
 7.1.[ADDRESS_339382] selection was 
unbiased. The consenting log will document the date the patient was approached for the study and 
whether they consented.   
  After signing the Informed Consent, study Subjects are defined as “enrolled” and site will  then  complete 
the non -standard of care pre -operative data collection.  
It is expected that complete data collection will be obtained for all enrolled Subjects, with the only exception being a Subject who is subsequently withdrawn. See section 7.[ADDRESS_339383]  withdrawals  the following are the minimum eCRFs to 
be completed: inclusion/ exclusion criteria, Demographics, Medical History (targeted)  and surgical 
history.  
 7.1.[ADDRESS_339384] is included in the study without 
adequate informed consent being provided.  Failure to obtain and properly document this process is in 
violation of 21 CFR Part 50, the Declaration of H elsinki, and this study protocol.

 All Informed Consent Documents (ICD) must have favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_277965]/EC (Section 
12.1). Consent of a Subject needs to be from the subject themselves and documented on an ICD  and the 
process documented within source documentation .   
Screening, consenting and enrollment are illustrated in Figure [ADDRESS_339385]’s 
questions.  If the Subject then agrees to par ticipate, they must add their  signature [CONTACT_278025]/EC’s approved ICD and this document must then be countersigned and dated by [CONTACT_277999].  
No names or dates should be prepopulated  or completed by [CONTACT_278000].   
Upon successful completion of the consent process, the Patient is enrolled and is identified as a Study 
Subject.   
Acquiring Consent on Day of Surgery:  If the ICD signatures are acquired on the day of surgery, the time 
of the signature [CONTACT_278026]- related and/or mood -altering medications being 
administered. The  documentation of time is not required where consent is obtained on a day prior to 
surgery.

  7.2.3 Pre -operative Management   
Prior to surgery, the data in Table 1 -1 (the Time & Events Table) must be collected for each enrolled 
Subject. The interval for obtaining the Informed Consent and pre -op assessments is from - 90 days through 
day 0 (day of surgery) as designated on th e Time & Events Table (Table 1- 1). The - 90 day time frame is 
important to support PROs being collected closer to the time of surgery since it is anticipated that there 
may be deterioration in function as the patient awaits surgery. The interval for obtaining preoperative radiographs is extended to - 180 days to day 0 (day of surgery) so that study subjects would not need to 
have repeat radiographs if any radiographs that had been taken as standard of care prior to the Subject 
being enrolled were the required  views. This will be allowed to minimize the study subject’s unnecessary 
exposure to radiation. Note, it would be preferred if the radiographs were taken from - 90 days through 
day 0, however if radiographs are available that exceed the 180 day maximum timepoint, they can still be 
used if they are thought to be acceptable for preoperative surgical planning (as per their standard of care) 
at the discretion of the PI.  
Once written informed consent is given, the below will be followed:  
• Pre-operative Radiograph  assessment (unless acquired prior to enrollment), Subject History  and 
all Patient Reported Outcome questionnaires will be completed.    
• The TKA surgical details and any procedure or device related intra- operative complications are 
captured on eCRFs for subsequent analysis.  
• Follow -up intervals include [ADDRESS_339393] of care for total knee arthroplasty. The approved surgical 
technique (specific to the configuration implanted and the instrumentation used) must be followed. Any 
deviation from the approved surgical technique  must be reported as a protocol deviation. See Table 7 -2 
for further detail.

 Table 7 -2: Protocol Requirements During Surgery  
Surgical Process detail  Protocol instructions  
Instrumentation  • The manual arm of the study will use the ATTUNE  Intuition 
Instrumentation  (Reusable or SOLO). Computer assisted 
surgery, TruMatch technology or any other type of Custom 
Patient Instruments is not permitted.  The surgeon will target 
placing the implant perpendicular to the mechanical axis of 
the leg  but may vary by +/ - 3 degrees if deemed 
advantageous to the soft tissue management of the knee. 
• The Robotic arm will use the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  
supported by [CONTACT_278006]. The surgeon will 
target placing the implant perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the leg  but may vary by +/ - [ADDRESS_339394] to the choice of configuration of the 
ATTUNE  system used including cemented CR FB, CR RP, PS FB, PS RP , 
or Cementless CR RP or PS RP (see section 10. 2).  
Patellar Treatment  This investigation allows the Investigator to follow their current 
standard of care with respect to patellar resurfacing.  Specifically, the Investigator can choose to:  
• resurface the patella  
• leave the patella unresurfaced.  
 
Data collected during the operative management of the Subject is listed in Table [ADDRESS_339395]- operative management including physical therapy protocol is at the discretion of the 
surgeon and support  staff and should follow each Site’s standard of care. Rehabilitation programs are 
often individualized, however, efforts should be made by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_277966] .  
The follow -up windows have been selected to achieve the primary objective of investigating the accuracy 
of the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution , as well as providing further data to characterize the patient 
recovery over the first post- operative  year . Every effort should be made to schedule the post- operative

is changing with time, particularly in the early recovery phase.  
All follow -up visits will be conducted according to the Time and Events Table (Table 1 -1), and applicable 
eCRFs must be submitted to the Sponsor .   
Data collected during the post- operative management of the Subject is listed in Table 7 -1.  
 7.2.6 Radiographic Procedures  
Radiographic guidelines regarding image  collection and transmission to the independent radiographic 
reviewer will be provided to the Principal Investigator.  Weight bearing Long leg AP X-rays and lateral 
views are to be obtained pre- operatively and at the 12 week visit (baseline evaluation).  Long leg AP X -rays 
are critical to be able to achieve the primary objective of assessing the alignment achieved. Skyline views will not be collected in this study.

7.5 Revisions/Re -operations  
A “revision” is defined as a surgical procedure of the affected knee where one or more of the TKA 
components (femoral component and/or metal tibial base, polyethylene insert, or patella polyethylene 
resurfacing component) are remove d.  Should it be necessary for the Subject to undergo a revision of 
either the femoral or metal tibial base between the time of enrollment and completion of the study data acquisition, the Subject is to be withdrawn from study participation.  Thus, both an  Adverse Event (AE) 
eCRF and a  Subject Completion/Discontinuation  eCRF must be completed.  Note that if a tibial 
polyethylene insert is exchanged and/or a resurfaced patella is revised but both femoral and tibial components remain intact, then an AE eCRF m ust be completed but the subject is not to be withdrawn.  
Examples of how to handle revisions are shown in table 7 -5.

component  Complete Adverse Event eCRF

eCRF  Continue  
Revision of a previously resurfaced patella  Complete Adverse Event 
eCRF  Continue  
Resurfacing of a previously unresurfaced patella  Complete Adverse Event 
eCRF  Continue  
 
A re-operation is defined as any surgical procedure of the affected knee in which no TKA components are 
removed. Examples include irrigation & debridement without tibial insert exchange or the resurfacing of  
a previously unresurfaced patella without tibial insert exchange.  These subjects are not to be withdrawn.  
An Adverse Event (AE) eCRF must be completed.

8   STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY          
This section describes the statistical methods for the study design and planned analysis of study data.  
8.1 Study Design  
This study is designed as a prospective sequential controlled c ohort study  utilizing the ATTUNE  knee. All 
procedures will be done either with traditional surgical instruments and cutting blocks (Manual Cohort) 
or with the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  (Robotic Cohort). Each site will enroll Subjects into the Manual 
Cohort until their enrollment target ha s been reached, and then will enroll Subjects into the Robotic 
Cohort.  
8.2 Treatment Assignment  
Each site is expected to implant approximately 1 0-20 ATTUNE  knees in ea ch of  the control (Manual 
Cohort) arm and the study (Robotic Cohort) arm. There will be a maximum of 8 sites that will recruit a 
total of 200 Subjects (100 manual co hort  and 100 in the Robotic cohort ). Each site will use the implant 
configuration(s) that fit with their standard of care. Both resurfaced patella and non -resurfaced patella 
are permitted in this investigation, consistent with the site’s standard of care.  
Only one knee per subject will be included in the study. For bilateral subjects (staged) only the first knee implanted during study enrollment may be enrolled.  
8.[ADDRESS_339403] of care with traditional, non -robotic instrumentation and 
would thus confound study comparisons.  
Subjects  may be unblinded to the typ e of instruments used in their case . 
8.4 Interval Windows  
The pre -operative assessment is to be done 90 days prior to the procedure up to day 0 (defined as the 
day of the index procedure for this study); radiographs for this study may be from 180 days prior to day 0 (or longer if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_277967]). The required window intervals  
for analysis purposes are defined as follows:  
 
 
  
 
DSJ_2019_08 Rev F  DePuy Orthopaedics Inc.  
06-June -2022                                                                                                                                  Page 30 of 76 
  
Table 8 -1: Interval Windows  
Required* Follow -up Intervals (days)  
Pre-op**  Day 0  12 Weeks  1 Year  
-90 to 0d  0 (Defined as 
the Day of TKA)  7-182 183-547 
* Although these are the windows for analysis purposes, 
narrower “preferred” interval windows have also been included 
in this protocol.  
** Pre-operative radiographs may be in the window - 180 to 0 
days (or longer if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_277968])  
 
Multiple visits within these defined windows for a single subject may occasionally occur. If this occurs then 
for bot h the pre -op and [ADDRESS_339404] to the date of surgery will be considered the 
study visit. Individual pre -op data (i.e. radiographs, PROMs, etc.) may be collected at different pre -op visits 
and each type of data will be considered sepa rately when considering multiple visits.  
8.5 Levels of Significance  
Where estimated, all confidence intervals will be 95% confidence intervals. For the primary endpoint 
hypothesis test an alpha = 0.05 will be used to determine statistical significance. No adjustments will be 
made for multiplicity as this is the only formal  hypothesis in the study.  Although there are no other formal 
hypotheses in this study, final results may be provided along with p -values to facilitate clinical judgement.  
8.6 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined for the purpose of analysis: an Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis set, a 
Safety analysis set, and a Per Protocol (PP) analysis set.  The analyses of adverse events and the Kaplan -
Meier analysis of revisions will be carried out on the Safety analysis set. The primary endpoint analysis will be carried out on the ITT  analysis set and all secondary endpoint analyses will be carried out on the Per 
Protocol analysis set.  The analysis of the tertiary endpoints will be carried out on the PP analysis set unless otherwise stated in the final clinical summary report.   
Enrolled subjects set who do not undergo surgery to implant the ATTUNE  system with either manual 
instrumentation or with the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  will be withdrawn from the study without 
any further data collection, replaced per section 
7.3.[ADDRESS_339405] s who are consented , enrolled into the study , and under go a TKA 
procedure  with any cuts attempted with the intended device(s) . The purpose of this analysis set is to 
perform the primary endpoint non -inferiority analysis. Analys is of the ITT set will be performed based on 
the intended instrumentation for the procedure.  
DSJ_2019_08 Rev F  DePuy Orthopaedics Inc.  
06-June -2022                                                                                                                                  Page 31 of 76 
 8.6.2 Safety Analysis Set   
The Safety analysis set consists of all ITT subjects who complete surgery to implant the ATTUNE  primary 
TKA system  with the intended  instrumentation .  Analys is of the Safety set  will be performed based on the 
actual instrumentation used for the procedure.  
 
All intraoperative events that occur before an intra- operative screen failure will be reported.  
8.6.3 PP Analysis Set  
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the Safety analysis set that includes all subjects who meet 
the following criteria:  
• There are no clinically meaningful deviations from the protocol eligibility criteria, and  
• The subject receives a n ATTUNE  primary TKA system,  
• The subject is implanted with the intended surgical instrumentation,  
• The subject has at least one post-operative evaluation in the 6 week or later time window.  
Analysis of the PP set will be performed based on the instrumentation used to complete the procedure.  
8.7 Sample Size Justification  
The primary endpoint analysis is a non -inferiority comparison of the mean of the absolute values of 
deviation from planned Hip -Knee- Ankle  angle (HKA)    with a non -inferiority margin of 1.5 degrees (as 
described in the Prim ary Endpoint  section below). The s tudy will be deemed to be successful if non -
inferiority is successfully demonstrated using a t -test with a 1 -sided alpha of 5%. Based upon an 
anticipated standard deviation of approximately 2.4 degrees in deviation from plan measurements, it is 
estimated that there is greater than 99% power to demonstrate non -inferiority in this primary endpoint 
analysis.    
The sample size of N=[ADDRESS_339406] 5% of patients in the general 
population (as determined from review of previous ATTUNE  total knee replacement studies using 
conventional instruments), then with a sample size of N=100 there is greater than a 99% chance of the 
observa tion of at least 1 such event in this study. There is greater than 80% change of observing at least 
one event for adverse events that occur with a rate of 1.6% or greater.  
8.8 Analyses to be Conducted  
8.8.1 General Conventions  
All analysis will be performed using SAS v9.4 or higher. Statistical summaries (tallies and percentages for 
categorical variables, and sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum (and others as needed) for continuous variables) at each respective time point, or cumulatively for safety endpoints.  
8.8.2 Disposition of Study Subjects  
A detailed account of all enrolled subjects will be presented in a dataset flow diagram to display the 
analysis datasets, beginning with the set of ITT subjects and explicitly listing t he subjects with

 8.8.4 Primary and Secondary Endpoints and Associated H ypotheses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint and associated hypotheses  
The primary endpoint to evaluate accuracy to plan is a non -inferiority comparison of mean absolute 
value for deviation from planned HKA.  
𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉−𝜇𝜇𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑉𝑉≥1.5° 
 
𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴:𝜇𝜇𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉−𝜇𝜇𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑉𝑉< 1. 5° 
 
wh
ere 𝜇𝜇𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉  is the mean absolute value of deviation from planned HKA  for VELYS Robotic -Assisted 
Solution  procedures, 𝜇𝜇𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑉𝑉 is the mean absolute value of deviation from planned HKA  for procedures 
using manual instrumentation , and 1.5° represents the non -inferiority margin. Absolute value of the 
deviation from planned HKA angles will be calculated with the below calculation for both V ELYS  and 
Manual procedures:  
abs
olute value deviation from plan = |radiographic HKA – planned HKA| 
HKA measurements may be either positive or negative depending on varus/valgus alignment. The 
radiographic HKA is measured via the long leg, weight bearing X -ray at [ADDRESS_339407] with a 1 -sided alpha of 5%.   If non -inferiority is 
successfully demonstrated, then the study will be deemed to be successful, and a test for superiority of 
accuracy to plan  achieved with VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  (i.e. test margin of difference of 0°)  will 
be conducted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints and associated hypotheses  
• Summarize  the nature, severity, and frequency of local adverse events associated with the use 
of the Robotic system in total knee arthroplasty during the procedure and within the 
subsequent 12 weeks, 90 days3 and 1 year .  
• Summarize Intra -operative clinical assessm ent of soft tissue damage in both Manual and 
Robotics cohorts. The condition and function of the key knee structures (medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) , patella 
tendon (PT) , posterior lateral capsule (PLC)  and posterior medial capsule (PMC)  will be assessed 
intra- operatively. The proportion of subjects that are uncompromised and  fully function al for 
each structure will be presented along with a Fisher’s extract test p -value to  facilitate clinical 
judgement on any differences . 
• If Per Protocol population differs from ITT population then perform the non -inferio rity and 
superiority tests as specified above on the Per Protocol population.  
 
3 This is a specific analysis  of data to determine number of AEs  that occurred within  90 days  of the procedure  
determined at 1year follow up  – there is no 90 day visit.

 • Summarize the alignment outliers (long leg alignment >3 degrees outside of plan) in both 
Manual and Robotics cohorts.  Manual and Robotics cohorts will be presented along with a 
Fisher’s extract test p -value to facilitate clinical judgement on any differences.

resection  execution. Mean surgical time will be presented along with a two -sided sample t -test 
p-value  to facilitate clinical judgement on any differences.   
• Summar ize individual component alignment achieved with manual instruments and Robotics in 
the frontal and sagittal planes, specifically: distal femoral varus -valgus (FM), proximal tibial 
varus -valgus (TM), femoral component flexion and tibial slope.  Mean alignment measures will

9.1 Anticipated Adverse Events / Non -Reportable Adverse Events  
There are particular immediate  post -operative events that are changes from the baseline condition of the 
Subject  but are expected events resulting from surgery. For the purposes of this protocol these are 
referred to as Expected/Anticipated Adverse Events and are listed in Exhibit A. If these events occur, they 
should be recorded in the Subject’s medical record, but these should NOT be reported as AEs in the eCRF 
or to the Sponsor  unless in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_277969] . 
9.2 Study Related Risks/Reportable Adverse Events  
Any surgical procedure poses a potential risk and the procedures undertaken as part of this clinical investigation are no exception. There are known risks associated with the method of anesthesia (general, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], local). In addition, there are risks associated with implantation of a device. The risks associated 
with the use of the robotic system in the study arm and the manual instruments in the control arm are

06-June -[ADDRESS_339411] frequently 
reported AEs and complications in total knee arthroplasty. The AEs identified below  (Table 9 -1) are to be 
reported as AEs. 
Table 9 -1: Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events and Complications  
General   
• Early or late loosening, tibial subsidence, bending, cracking, fracture, deformation, 
or wear of one or more of the prosthetic components, often related to factors listed 
under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS in the  implant  IFU. Loosening may also occu r 
due to improper fixation or positioning.  
• Early or late infection which may require removal of the implant.  
• Pain, dislocation, subluxation, flexion contracture, decreased range of motion, or 
lengthening or shortening of the leg, caused by [CONTACT_278009], looseness or wear of components.  
• Excessive wear of the polyethylene components due to intraoperative damage to 
the femoral component, loose cement and/or bone fragments, and/or high patient activity levels or weight.  
• Fractures of the tibi a or femur. lntraoperative fractures are usually associated with 
revision surgery, deformity and/or severe osteoporosis. Postoperative fractures are usually stress fractures. Fractures can be the result of defects in the cortex due to multiple pin holes, p rior screw holes, misdirected reaming, and/or inadequate or 
maldistribution of bone cement.  
• Cardiovascular disorders and thromboembolic disease, including venous 
thrombosis, and pulmonary embolus, and heart attack.  
• Tissue reactions, osteolysis, and/or implant loosening caused by [CONTACT_278010], 
allergy or wear debris or loose cement particles.  
• Myositis ossificans, especially in males with hypertrophic arthritis, limited 
preoperative range of motion and/or previous myositis. The incidence of myo sitis 
ossificans is increased with a history of prior surgery and in cases of infection.  
Early Post -operative 
Study Related Adverse 
Events   
• Hematoma  
• Delayed wound healing or wound dehiscence  
• Varus -valgus deformity  
 
Late Post -operative Study 
Related Adverse Events

9.3 Benefit Analysis  
For subjects  within the study arm, the study device ( VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution ) aims to result in a 
more precise, repeatable surgery reducing the risk of poor implant placement and the associated poor 
outcomes  but these benefits are not yet proven . For subjects within the control arm they will benefit fro m

identification and reporting of adverse events allowing faster resolution/treatment.  
9.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Table 9 -2: Adverse Event definitions  
Term  Details  
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in Subjects, users or other 
persons, whether or not related to a medical device.  
Adverse Event is synonymous with complicati on or medical event.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  An Adverse Event that  led to any of the following :  
• death,  
• serious deterioration in the health of the Subject that , resulted in any of the 
following:   
• life -threatening illness or injury,  
• permanent  impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• medical or surgical intervention to prevent  life-threatening  illness or 
injury or perma nent impairment to body structure or a body function,  
• fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_941] C linical Investigational Plan, without serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Expected/ Anticipated   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_277971] .  This determination is based on whether the severity, type and 
frequency of the AE is consistent with the Instructions for Use (IFU), in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439].
   
Awareness (Date of AE 
Awareness)  The day, month  and year that the study site becomes aware of information from 
any source that reasonably suggests that an Adverse Event has occurred.  
Note: This date may or may not correspond to the date of onset. The date of awareness is critical to reporting timelines (see Section 1.6).  
Device Deficiencies  Are defined as inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability safety or performance. Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors and inadequate labeling. Upon identification of device 
deficiencies  associated with the VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution , the investigator 
should complete a device deficiency eCRF, institute appropriate therapeutic and follow -up measures in accordance with good medical practice and notify the IRB 
as applicable. The Investigator must document follow -up treatment of any 
resul ting AE (if applicable) and the Sponsor will report the event through its 
applicable complaint reporting channels.

 9.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
This protocol requires each site to comply with all adverse event reporting requirements of their 
respective IRB/EC’s. For this protocol, not all AEs are required to be recorded in the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor. The below list are the reportable AEs  that must be recorded on the eCRF and submitted to 
the Sponsor as soon as the site becomes aware:  
• All SAEs , regardless of relationship, and  
• All  AEs related to the  Device  and/ or procedure, except for those listed in Exhibit A  
 
Table 9 -3: Adverse Ev ent Reporting  
Type of Adverse Event  Reporting Timeline  
All SAEs  As soon as site becomes aware but no later than [ADDRESS_339413] the nature, severity, seriousness, treatment and outcome of the AE, and will 
determine the association to the device and/or the study procedure.  
 
Determination of Relationship: The determination whether the AE is related to the device ( ATTUNE  or 
VELYS Robotic- Assisted Solution ) and/or procedure will be  conducted by [CONTACT_278012] a causal relationship between the device and/or procedure and the AE is a reasonable possibility , 
i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. A cau sal relationship cannot be ruled out if, in the medical 
judgment of the Investigator, the effect follows a reasonable temporal association with the use of the device and/or is confirmed by [CONTACT_278013], and/or the effect is not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_31388]’s clinical state.  
 
Relationship to study device or procedure should be rated as follows:  
 
1) Not related (definitely not related): there is no relationship between study device and/or 
procedure and the event.  
2) Possibly related (remote possibility, possibly, or probably related): the relationship between 
study device and/or procedure could exist if there is no contradicting evidence that can reasonably explain the Subject’s condition.  
3) Causal  relat ionship  (definitely related):  the relationship between study device and/or 
procedure and event does exist and is confirmed upon further investigation by [CONTACT_737].  
 
The following categories of AE severity to be used are presented in Table 9 -4 below:

mild  awareness of a sign, symptom or event that is easily tolerated and transient in nature 
with minimal or no impairment to normal activity.  
moderate  moderate symptoms that are poorly tolerated, sustained, interfere with normal activity 
and require medical attention.  
severe  symptom(s) require intervention, and the activities of daily living are significantly 
altered.  
 
Pre- existing medical condition s or symptoms reported prior to device implantation are not to be 
recorded as AEs. In the event there is an exacerbation of the pre- existing medical condition or symptoms, 
then an AE must be reported.   As described above, all SAEs, all device related AEs and all procedure related AEs [with the exception of 
the Anticipated Adverse Events listed in Exhibit A] (refer to section 9.1) are required to be recorded on the AE eCRF beginning from the time of the initiation of the surgery  until Subject participation has ended 
(study completed or withdrawal). AEs must be followed to resolution, or until the study completion or 
consent withdrawal. When an AE status changes (worsens, resolves), the AE eCRF should be updated to 
reflect the new information . When a Subject ends participation in the trial (either study completion or 
consent withdrawal) an AE must be designated either as “resolved” (end date must be provided), or as 
“ongoing.”  
Subjects should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously and may volunteer AE information at any time. At each evaluation, the Investigator will determine whether an AE has occurred that meets the 
requirements for reporting in this study. If it is determined that an applicable AE has occurred, the 
Investigator  should obtain all the information required to complete the appropriate AE form eCRF. If an 
event occurs at an outside institution, the Investigator should attempt to obtain, if possible, required 
AE information .

9.5 Minimization of Risks  
The Sponsor will further minimiz e the identified and/or emergent risks throughout the study, by [CONTACT_278014]. The Medical Monitor may contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_277972]_2019_08 Rev F  DePuy Orthopaedics Inc.  
06-June -[ADDRESS_339414] related to the determination of the event. All AEs reported to the Spons or will be reviewed by [CONTACT_278015].  
Should an IRB/EC decide to suspend or withdraw its approval for an Investigator to conduct the study at 
that institution, based on unacceptable risks to the study Subjects, the study Sponsor will notify all 
reviewing IRB/ECs and Investigators of this action. To further minimize risks, any new information 
obtained during the study relating to unanticipated adverse findings (that is those not mentioned in any 
of the IFU, this CIP or Exhibit B) will be provided to all Subjects, Investigators, and IRB/ECs.  
The study has been designed to minimize the number of Subjects  yet provide sufficient numbers of  
Subjects for valid scientific analysis of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_277973]. The study design, the procedures for 
monitoring and the documentation, reporting and evaluation of the results from its surgical use will further control risks. In addition, only trained o rthopaedic surgeons with expertise in treating this 
condition will conduct surgeries.  
10 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
 
The intended purpose, indications, contraindications and population are described in the Instructions for 
Use (IFU), which is contained in the packaging and the associated surgical technique. The instrumentation is the primary focus of this study but the associated implants are included and their performance will also 
be assessed by [CONTACT_15094].  
10.1 Surgical Instruments  
Surgical instruments aid the s urgeon in the execution of bone preparation to allow the implantation of 
the TKA implant components. The study design consists of two arms; the study arm will utilize the VELYS 
Robotic -Assisted Solution  in combination with the manual ATTUNE  Intuition instruments to support the 
implantation of the ATTUNE  Knee whilst the control arm will only use the manual ATTUNE  Intuition 
instruments to support the implantation of the ATTUNE  Knee.  
10.1.1 VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution   
The VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  assists the surgeon in the execution of the bone resections required 
during TKA.  The system uses a stereotaxic methodology whereby [CONTACT_278016], tibia and instrumentation to  generate a surgical plan on the graphical user interface 
based on the surgeon ’s instructions /preferences . The robot ic-assisted device  then moves the saw into 
position and controls the plane of the resection  (according to the plan) whilst the surgeon executes the 
resections , once the resection  is complete the robot ic-assisted device  then moves onto the next resection . 
It is intended  that this system/method will result in greater precision and accuracy in the execution of 
these resections . Once the resections  (distal femoral, p roximal tibia and femoral anterior, posterior and 
chamfer) are executed by [CONTACT_278017], femoral finishing , patella prep (if 
resurfacing) and trialing. The VELYS Robotic -Assisted Solution  is only indicated for use with the ATTUNE  
Total Knee system. The products codes associated with the system are listed in EXHIBIT C.

 10.1.2 ATTUNE  Intuition Instruments (Manual Instrum ents)  
The ATTUNE  Intuition Instruments were developed to aid the implantation of the ATTUNE  TKA implants. 
The system  includes jigs/fixture s that reference anatomical landmarks and help the surgeons to position 
a series of cutting blocks which are pi[INVESTIGATOR_277974] a saw blade/saw console. Once the resections are executed, other instruments  are used to complete 
the final bone preparation to prepare for the implants before finally trial components are used whereby 
[CONTACT_278018] ‘balanced’ soft tissues.  
 
10.2 Implants  
The implants to be used in this study are the ATTUNE  total knee system.  There are many different 
configurations of the ATTUNE  Knee system (see Table 10 -1). Depending on the standard of care , each site 
may use different configurations of the system but are required to remain consistent in the selection 
criteria bet ween the two study arms. e.g. if the investigator at a site uses the ATTUNE  cemented CR FB 
knees by [CONTACT_278019],  they should use this same construct for both the control and study arm. 
The product codes of the implants are listed in EXHIBIT D.

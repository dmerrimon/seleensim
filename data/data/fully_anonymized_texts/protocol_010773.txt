Confidential  Page 13 of 60 2.0 INTRODUCTION Currently, there is no treatment available to stop or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD share many common characteristics, including the central role of neurotoxic aggregating proteins in their pathogenesis. Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau aggregates (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively) have been traditionally associated with AD, while α-synuclein (αSYN) aggregates (Lewy bodies) have been associated with PD. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that all these proteins are involved in both diseases and that aggregation of one can lead to accumulation of another. Furthermore, in several studies of brains from older AD patients, a high percentage of all AD brains present mixed pathologies, such as Lewy body disease. Several clinical trials targeting just one (often Aβ) of the neurotoxic aggregating proteins have failed. Finally, other fragments of Amyloid β Precursor Protein (APP) have been implicated in AD pathology. Collectively, these facts point to the need for development of combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_635978], if we are to have a good chance of at least halting disease progression. Buntanetap has a unique mechanism of action, in that it inhibits the translation and, therefore, reduces the levels of several neurotoxic aggregating proteins both in vitro and in vivo, including αSYN, APP, its fragments, and tau. All three proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, at older ages, there is a high incidence of PD patients with mixed pathologies, such as PD dementia.  Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that inhibiting expression of all three proteins should lead to a better efficacy outcome in PD patients than inhibiting just one. αSYN, APP, and tau contribute to the progression of AD and PD in similar ways: they impair axonal transport and lower neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor release, they cause inflammation, they form aggregates, and, finally, they lead to nerve cell death. In our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, buntanetap has normalized all those actions. Preclinical data proves buntanetap’s efficacy in restoring colonic motility in a human SNCAA53T and SNCAA30T transgenic (tg) mice models of early PD, in restoring memory and learning in an APP/PS1 tg mouse model of AD, restoring axonal transport in DS trisomic mice, preserving memory, and learning in traumatic brain injury rats and in stroke mice, and preserving the retina in acute glaucoma. Buntanetap’s safety has been established in three Phase 1 clinical studies by [CONTACT_635998] (2012). Importantly, buntanetap normalized levels of αSYN, APP, and tau as well as inflammatory markers in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) of mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects at a dose of 4x60 mg/day (Protocol QR12001).   
Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-2023 
Confidential  Page 14 of 60 Recently, we also tested buntanetap in the DISCOVER study at 1x60, 2x60 and 3x60 mg/day for up to 25 days to see if it changes the synthesis and degradation kinetics of Aβ in a stable isotope labelling kinetic (SILK) study.  The DISCOVER study is conducted by [CONTACT_635999] 16 treated subjects (Protocol QR15001). The study officially finished in December 2021, with 7 patients treated in cohort 1 (1x60mg/day), 6 patients in cohort 2 (2x60mg/day), and 2 patients in cohort 3 (3x60mg/day). The CSF measurements of Aβ showed in a dose-dependent fashion that buntanetap slows the synthesis and lowers the total amount of Aβ synthesized by [CONTACT_2016]. It also showed improvement in cognition as measured by [CONTACT_458846]-Cog11 scale. We recently completed a double Phase 2a study (ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]) in both early AD and early PD populations. In PD, 54 subjects were recruited and randomized into 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80mg QD buntanetap for 25±2 days. CSF biomarkers were collected and analyzed. MDS-UPDRS and WAIS coding were tested. CSF biomarker results show that buntanetap lowered αSYN level, reduced inflammation (shown by [CONTACT_458847], YKL-40, sTREM and Complement C3), preserved axonal integrity shown by [CONTACT_458848] (NFL) and improved synaptic density shown by [CONTACT_458849] (NG). Although sample size was not powered to see efficacy, buntanetap improved PD subjects WAIS coding scores at all doses including 5mg QD. Buntanetap also improved PD subjects MDS-UPDRS Part II, III, IV and Total score.  In this study, we want to confirm buntanetap’s efficacy in early PD subjects. During the dose-finding Phase 2a study, we saw a dose-response curve between 0 and 10/20 mg QD. Therefore, we decided to dose subjects with 10 and 20 mg QD.  2.1. OBJECTIVES Study objectives include assessing buntanetap’ s efficacy and safety in early PD subjects.   Study drugs will be 10 mg, 20mg of buntanetap, or matching placebo capsules, taken once per day in the morning before food. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms: buntanetap [ADDRESS_849862] successfully completed the requisite certifications/trainings for each assessment. All efforts will be made to ensure subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_458851].  Participants should stop SOC Parkinson’s medications 12 hrs before clinical visit to ensure clinical OFF-state during visit.  2.2. ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoints: 1.

Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-2023 
Confidential  Page 18 of 60 3.1. Summary of Non-Clinical Findings In APP transgenic AD mice, buntanetap led to a decrease in APP levels, improved neuronal stem cell survival and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Marutle 2007; Kadir 2008, Lilja 2013). Chronic administration of buntanetap to APP transgenic mice totally prevented decline in memory and learning as well as in long-term potentiation at brain and plasma concentrations that are 10 times lower than originally published. These plasma levels are attainable with low oral dosing in humans (Teich 2018). In alpha-synuclein (αSYN) transgenic PD mice, buntanetap restored gut motility to normal and lowered aSYN in the brain and gut of the tg PD mice. Again, the efficacious levels were 10 times lower than originally published (Kuo 2019). In DS trisomic mice buntanetap fully restored axonal transport in vitro and in vivo (Chen 2021). In summary, buntanetap is a translational inhibitor of APP and aSYN and fully restores function at doses that are very low and very safe. Buntanetap was not mutagenic or clastogenic as assessed by [CONTACT_293689].  The cardiac electrophysiological properties of buntanetap tartrate were negative in vitro using human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Buntanetap did not adversely affect the interval seen in an electrocardiogram (ECG) test (QT (or QTc)) interval.  Toxicity studies in dogs showed brain toxicity (ataxia and tremors/twitching) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity at 30 mg/kg/day, which was dose-dependent and reversible. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 20 mg/kg/day in dogs. Buntanetap readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. The signs/symptoms noted at high doses of buntanetap may be related to cholinergic manifestations. In in vitro assays, buntanetap showed minimal inhibition of AChE or BChE (Butyrylcholinesterase) activity, however, a metabolic product of buntanetap, N1-norposiphen demonstrated acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity (Yu 2013). There were no effects on the reproductive organs associated with 4-week exposure to buntanetap in male or female rats or dogs.  Repeat Oral dose Toxicity Study of buntanetap in male and female rats giving 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 26 weeks showed that NOAEL dose was 40 mg/kg for both male and female rats. Repeat Oral dose Toxicity Study of buntanetap in male and female dogs giving 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg for 39 weeks showed that NOAEL dose was 20 mg/kg for both male and female dogs. 3.2. Summary of Clinical Findings  Three Phase [ADDRESS_849864] was a single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy volunteers; the second was a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy volunteers, and the third one was a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic study of CSF obtained from mild cognitively impaired participants (Protocol QR12001). One Phase1/2 study (Discover) was to test the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of  buntanetap in subjects with early Alzheimer's disease  (Protocol 
Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-2023 
Confidential  Page 19 of 60 QR12005). The other Phase 2a study was a double study for both early AD and early PD subjects to test buntanetap’s safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy (Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]). In the SAD trial, buntanetap was administered orally in doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg. Limiting side effects observed following the 160 mg dose resulted in curtailment of the study without administration of the 320 mg dose. The 160 mg dose was associated with an increased incidence of nausea and vomiting (four subjects were nauseous and three vomited). Adverse events were either mild or moderate; none were severe. Buntanetap [ADDRESS_849865] level. Following oral administration, peak concentration was achieved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], with mean observed Tmax between 1.3 and 1.6 hours for both males and females at all doses. Cmax increased disproportionately with increasing dose, as did the various measures of AUC. Differences in mean observed Cmax and AUC between males and females at each dose appeared to be related to body weight rather than gender differences. In the MAD trial, buntanetap was administered orally in doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg 4 times a day (QID). The first two treatments were dosed for [ADDRESS_849866] in the 60 mg group discharged because of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and “feeling warm.” The incidence of adverse events, all either mild or moderate severity, also occurred with similar frequency in the placebo group. The most common AEs were dizziness, headache, and nausea/vomiting.  Buntanetap was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], achieving maximum plasma and CSF concentration (Cmax) within 1.2-1.5 hours. For the 40 and 60 mg doses, with fully defined plasma profiles, the mean terminal t½’s were 3.80 ±0.88 and 5.23±1.24 hours, respectively after a single dose and 3.53±1.03 and 4.104±0.91 hours, respectively, after repeat dosing. The half-life (t½) of the plasma concentrations at the lower doses could not be calculated accurately. The Cmax increased disproportionally with dose (24, 144, and 2310 ng.h/mL after a single dose of 20, 40, and 60 mg, respectively and 110, 134, and 2101 ng.h/mL after multiple doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg, respectively). In the proof of mechanism of action study (Protocol QR12001), the PK of buntanetap was measured after 10 days of administration (4x60 mg) over [ADDRESS_849867] dose at day 11 of buntanetap administration. We found that the plasma concentrations of buntanetap overlapped with the plasma concentrations found in the MAD study. In this study, the N1-metabolite reached about 10 to 15%, while the level of the N8-metabolite reached about 20 to 25% of the buntanetap levels measured in plasma.  Because a substantial proportion of the adverse events observed in AD subjects treated with cholinesterase inhibitors appear to reflect the cholinomimetic properties of molecules in this

While the t1/2 of buntanetap in plasma was 5 hours as seen in the SAD and MAD studies, the t1/2 in CSF/brain was longer than [ADDRESS_849868]. For the Phase 2a trial (Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]), there are two parts of the study. In the first part, early AD and PD subjects were given 80 mg QD buntanetap or placebo for 25 days.  In the second part, early PD subjects were given 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg QD buntanetap or placebo for 25 days. In all doses and in both AD and PD subjects, buntanetap was safe and well tolerated. No SAE was reported.  Buntanetap was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], achieving maximum plasma and CSF concentration (Cmax) within 1-2 hours. For the 80 mg doses, with fully defined plasma profiles, the mean terminal t½’s were 2.76 ± 2.668 hours. The half-life (t½) of the plasma concentrations at the lower doses (5 & 10 mg) could not be calculated accurately. The Cmax increased disproportionally with dose (15.31, 40.19 and 112.31 ng.h/mL after a single dose of 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively). Consistent with Phase 1 POC study, 80mg QD buntanetap reduced AD subjects’ CSF levels of sAPPa, sAPPb, tau, phosphorylated tau (tau181), αSYN and a series of inflammatory markers (YKL-40, GFAP, sTREM2, Complement C3). Buntanetap also improved axonal integrity shown by [CONTACT_458854] (NFL) and synaptic function shown by [CONTACT_458849] (NG). Similarly, 80 mg QD buntanetap reduced PD subjects’ CSF levels of αSYN and a series of inflammatory markers (YKL-40, GFAP, sTREM2, Complement C3). Buntanetap also improved PD subjects’ axonal integrity shown by [CONTACT_458855].  Further, buntanetap treatment improved AD subjects’ cognition shown by [CONTACT_33341]-Cog11 and WAIS coding test and improved PD subjects’ movement shown by [CONTACT_274657]-UPDRS and WAIS coding test. 4.0 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE 4.1. Background A major pathological hallmark of PD is the appearance in the gut and in the brain of aSYN aggregates that form Lewy bodies. These aggregates are thought to occur one or two decades prior to overt symptom development. Recent research has shown that soluble forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and other neurotoxic proteins such as TDP43 may also contribute to neuropathology of PD. A high load of inflammation and microglia activating factors that contribute to neurodegeneration are also common in PD. 
Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-2023 
Confidential  Page 21 of 60 Buntanetap is the (+) enantiomer of phenserine, an orally available small molecule. While phenserine inhibits AChE, buntanetap has no AChE activity itself and develops some activity in vivo with the metabolism to N1-bisnorposiphen. In vivo, phenserine has about 10-20 times more AChE inhibitory activity than buntanetap’s metabolite N1-bisnorposiphen.  Buntanetap has been found to significantly reduce soluble APP and Aβ as well as tau, p-tau and αSYN in the rodent brain and in human CSF. In preliminary studies in animals and humans, inhibition of APP, Aβ, tau, p-tau and αSYN occurs at levels 8 to 16 times lower than the levels causing cholinomimetic effects. Buntanetap acts at the 5’UTR of the aSYN and APP mRNA and lowers their protein expression levels in animal models; it also decreased aSYN and sAPP levels in human CSF. Our data suggests that these effects are achieved via the same mechanism: the 5’UTRs of these mRNAs form a complex with iron regulatory protein [ADDRESS_849869] in PD, AD as well as other neurodegenerative disorders.

Dose selection: Qualified subjects will be randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms: buntanetap 10 mg, buntanetap 20 mg, and placebo.  Study Design:  [ADDRESS_849870]-time dosing with administration of 10 mg or 20 mg of buntanetap or placebo, followed by [CONTACT_636002] 6 months, with daily administration of 10 mg or 20 mg of buntanetap or placebo.  Participants will be required to attend clinic visits at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months (end-of-trial) time points, where they will undergo study procedures that include safety assessments (AE and concomitant medication monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical/neurological examinations), psychometric tests (MDS-UPDRS, WAIS, MMSE) and PGIC and CGIS. After all end-of-study procedures are complete, the subject will be discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call will occur after all clinic visits to assess the participants current condition and if there are any additional adverse events to report.   Subjects who drop out during the initial 5 months at home treatment period will be discontinued and should complete an Early Discontinuation visit as soon as possible following discontinuation. Subjects that drop out after the initial 5 months, will be scheduled for an End of Trial visit. If 4 subjects are discontinued due to serious adverse events, a safety review will be conducted without interrupting the study. Unscheduled visits are allowed and investigators will perform safety assessments and AE/SAE and concomitant medication reviews as needed.  The following figure shows how many times and when these procedures will be performed throughout the approximately 7 months of the study duration:

MDS-UPDRS sum of scores of Part II, Part III, Part II+III, and total score of first three parts will be measured to assess its improvement on PD subjects.  Safety outcome measures: Reports of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during exposure to buntanetap will be collected to evaluate if there are any significant clinical safety issues for the study population. Extensive clinical and laboratory safety data already exist for buntanetap; therefore, these safety measures will be sufficient in the proposed study. Clinical, functional and cognitive assessment measures: The subjects will be administered the Hoehn & Yahr (1967) and the MMSE (Folstein 1975) for determination of inclusion into the study. The MDS-UPDRS (Goetz 2008), Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIS, Hurst 2004), and Participant Global Impression of Change (PGIC, Hurst 2004) will be administered for subjects’ movement and daily function.  The Coding subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, 4th edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler 2008) will serve as a sensitive measure of CNS dysfunction. MMSE will also be measured to assess subjects’ cognitive change. Exploratory measures: Buntanetap has shown to reduce inflammation and preserve axonal integrity and synaptic functions as well as neurotoxic proteins in previous Phase 2a studies. In this study we plan to measure plasma GFAP, NFL and potentially TDP43 depending on assay availability. 5.[ADDRESS_849871] placebo (inactive ingredients) will be provided. The placebo used for the study consists of standard (non-lactose) pharmaceutical excipi[INVESTIGATOR_635979] (GRAS), with no known side effects anticipated. Buntanetap has been tested in animal safety studies. No adverse effects were observed in rats given doses up to 40 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. Drug-related effects observed in dogs included severe tremors at ≥20 mg/kg/day, ataxia and gastrointestinal erosion/ulcer/inflammation at ≥30 
Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-2023 
Confidential  Page 25 of 60 mg/kg/day, convulsions at ≥60 mg/kg/day, and duodenal necrosis and death at 100 mg/kg (equivalent to a human dose of 3,350 mg). In clinical studies to date, buntanetap has been well tolerated with single doses of [ADDRESS_849872] higher single doses. Aside from nausea and vomiting, which are well-known responses to treatment with AChE inhibitors, the only consistent pattern of AEs entailed dizziness/fainting, headache, and reduction in total serum protein. These effects were seen to varying degrees at all doses of buntanetap and also in the placebo group. There was a tendency, but no definitive pattern of increased incidence of AEs with increasing dose of buntanetap. There have been no SAEs in prior clinical studies with buntanetap. Definitive reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with buntanetap. As a result, women of childbearing potential will be excluded from participating in this study unless they agree to be on contraceptive for the whole duration of the trial and one month after. Female partners of male participants of childbearing potentials will also need to agree to be on contraceptive for the whole duration of the trial and one month after.  Male study participants should not donate sperm and female study participants should not donate eggs during the whole duration of the trial and one month after.  At this time, there is no controlled clinical data available for anyone receiving SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination while being treated with buntanetap. However, based on the intended mechanism of actions and currently available data for these vaccine candidates and for buntanetap, it is not believed that there are specific risks to consider in subjects participating in this study who have received SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination or who are planning to receive the vaccination. As such, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination is not prohibited. If appropriate, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination should be considered as a concomitant medication (see Section 7.8.2). 5.2. Risk/Benefit Associated with Blood Collections Phlebotomy is associated with mild to moderate discomfort due to pi[INVESTIGATOR_458820]. This can be minimized with the use of a well-trained phlebotomist/nurse. Sometimes the blood draw site may become discolored with a “bruised” appearance that is transient and not painful. Rarely, the blood draw site may become infected and require antibiotic treatment. 6.0 SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL PLAN A sample size of up to 450 subjects (1:1:1 randomized to 10mg, 20mg buntanetap and placebo respectively) is planned.

Safety and Tolerability Analysis Safety and tolerability will be assessed with physical/neurological examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory values, 12-lead ECG, use of concomitant medications, and AE reports. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities between the participants across the treatment groups will be compared.  Subjects who dropout during the initial 5 months at-home treatment period will be scheduled early discontinuation visit.  Subjects who drop out after the initial 5 monthswill be scheduled for an end-of-trial visit. If 4 subjects are discontinued due to serious adverse events a safety review will be conducted without interrupting the study.   6.4. PK Analysis Plasma concentration-time data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental methods using SAS version 9.4 or greater. Calculations will be based on the actual sampling times recorded during the study. Since the study is blinded, all subjects’ plasma will be included in the PK analysis. From the plasma concentration-time data, the following PK parameters will minimally be determined, as data permit: Area under the curve (AUC), Cmax, Tmax, t½, and CL. Dose-proportionality may be calculated on Cmax and AUC as appropriate. Plasma concentration-time data for buntanetap will be listed and summarized descriptively (number of subjects (N), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), and maximum (max)) and graphically presented. PK parameters will be listed and summarized descriptively (N, mean, median, SD, min, max, and 95% CI) by [CONTACT_636003].

The treatment effects and the differences of the treatment effects will be estimated. The two-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment differences will be presented. 6.9. Multiplicity Adjustment There are two active treatment groups (10 mg and 20 mg) in the study. Each of the two active treatments will be compared to the control (two hypothesis tests for the primary endpoint). Hochberg step-up procedure will be used to control the familywise Type I Error. Details are described in the SAP. 6.10. Interim Analysis An interim sample size review will be performed after in total 𝑛1 = 150 evaluable patients (50 patients per treatment group) have primary endpoint data, i.e., MDS-UPDRS part II+III at month 2. Evaluable patients are defined as randomized and having received at least once treatment with the study drug. The aim of the interim sample size review is to re-assess the size of the estimated mean and standard deviations of the primary effectiveness variable (MDS-UPDRS part II+III).  No interim analyses are planned for the purpose of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_635980]. The initial sample size estimation provides statistical power to demonstrate effectiveness among patients treated with buntanetap. A potential sample size adjustment is to assure that this trial will have the intended precision. The decision of sample size adjustment will be made based upon the estimates of MDS-UPDRS part II+III at baseline and after two months of treatment calculated for the first 150 evaluable patients with primary endpoint data. Sample size will not be decreased regardless of the results of this evaluation. To warrant the originally intended >90% power of the study at the 0.025 alpha level (2-sided), the evaluable sample size may be increased to a maximum of nmax=[ADDRESS_849879] deviation of treatment difference of the MDS-UPDRS part II+III score. The sample size re-estimation method is based on evaluation of conditional power in relationship to pre-specified decision rules defined by [CONTACT_636005]. Only an increase in sample size is possible under this approach when observed conditional power falls within the ‘promising zone’ as described below (Mehta and Pocock 2011). The conditional power at the interim analysis (𝐶𝑃𝛿̂1 (𝑧1, 𝑛̃2)) can be defined by [CONTACT_636006] (2011):  𝐶𝑃𝛿̂1 (𝑧1, 𝑛̃2) = 1 − Φ(((𝑧𝛼/2√𝑛2 − 𝑧1√𝑛1)/√𝑛̃2) – (𝑧1√𝑛̃2/√𝑛1)) + Φ(((−𝑧𝛼/2√𝑛2 − 𝑧1√𝑛1)/ √𝑛̃2)) – (𝑧1√𝑛̃2 √𝑛1)  where 𝑛̃2 = 𝑛2 − 𝑛1, 𝑧𝛼/2 = Φ-1(1 - 𝛼/2), and 𝑧1 is the value of the cumulative Wald statistic as computed at the interim analysis of 𝑛1= 50, 𝑛2= 150 evaluable patients. Define the estimated treatment difference, 𝛿̂1 = 𝜇̂1 − 𝜇0 at interim analysis, where 𝜇̂[ADDRESS_849880] interim review is 90%, however we pre-specify a range of conditional power values below 90% that would deem our interim results promising and

Identity of IP and Comparator Buntanetap will be provided in size 1 white opaque hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, vegetarian source) capsule shells.  Capsules contain buntanetap (either 10mg or 20mg) formulated with inert inactive (non-lactose) pharmaceutical excipi[INVESTIGATOR_635982]. Matching placebo capsules will be prepared with the same inert inactive ingredients and look exactly like the buntanetap capsules. 7.2. Dosage The study drug is to be taken orally; one capsule, once a day in the morning right before food, for 6 months at home.  Participants are encouraged to take a minimum of 80% of all doses (across 6 months).  Returned IMP will be examined at each clinic visit to assess compliance overall.  7.3. Packaging/Dispensing/Labeling The study drug (buntanetap capsules and placebo capsules) has been manufactured under cGMP, in a manner to preserve the blind, i.e., identical color and shape white opaque HPMC hard capsule shells and packaged 40 capsules per bottle.  The investigational drug supply will be shipped directly to the clinical sites to dispense to participants.

The dosing schedule and storage requirements will be clearly explained to the participants and caregiver before dispensing the study drug.  All packaging and labelling as well as the production of study medication will be in accordance with US FDA regulations and EudraLex volume 4, Annex 13 “Good manufacturing practices for Medicinal products for human and veterinary use” and applicable local regulatory requirements. 7.4. Storage Both buntanetap capsules and the matching placebo capsules must be stored at room temperature (not to exceed 25°C/77°F), protected from light and moisture, in a locked, temperature-controlled area with restricted staff access. 7.5. Drug Accountability  The investigator is responsible for investigational product reconciliation and records maintenance.  In accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the investigator or designated site staff must maintain investigational product accountability records throughout the course of the study.  The responsible person(s) will document the amount of investigational product dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_1766].  All used and unused study drug containers must be returned to the site for accountability.  Once authorized by a clinical monitor, unused study drug (including partially used bottles) will be shipped back to the contracted depot for destruction.  7.6. Compliance Site personnel will assess compliance based on the amount of study drug dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_3038], together with any related information, including the administration of study drug by [CONTACT_636007]. Participants are encouraged to take a minimum of 80% of all doses at home (6 months) depending on the end of trial date. Site personnel will count capsules and evaluate compliance from the bottle at each clinic visit.  Prior to the end of trial visit, site personnel will also contact [CONTACT_636008], to ensure that the necessary level of compliance has been achieved to continue with the end-of-trial visit procedures. It is possible that subjects will be discontinued early from the study due to insufficient study drug compliance. Site personnel will assess compliance at each clinic visit and again at the time of admission for the end of trial visit. . 7.7.

The screening visit procedures may be completed over multiple days. Participants do not need to stop their Parkinson’s disease SOC medications for screening visit.  Potential participants must sign an informed consent form prior to administration of any study-related procedures. Information regarding the subject’s demographics, concurrent medications, and medical history will be collected along with cognitive assessments, physical examination, and neurological examination. With investigator’s permission, lab re-testing is allowed within a month. If investigator deems re-screening is justified, they must contact [CONTACT_636009]-by-case basis.  Safety assessments will include an ECG that will need to be read locally and reviewed by [CONTACT_636010].

Baseline Visit Baseline procedures include functional, cognitive, and behavioral assessments, safety assessments, and review of concurrent medications and potential adverse events that might occur. Fasting is required for safety laboratory tests. Participants should stop all Parkinson’s disease SOC 12 hours prior to the visit to ensure a clinical OFF-state. For patients who are not on any Parkinson’s disease SOC, their natural state will be considered OFF-state and since they won’t have ON-state, it should be documented accordingly in the source documents. Baseline visit should be completed in one day except for the intense PK sub-group. Day 1: Subjects should arrive fasted in the morning after an overnight fast. Clinical safety labs will be drawn and sent to the central lab for analysis.  After safety lab, patients will be provided low-fat light meal before completing functional and cognitive evaluations (completed in an OFF state after holding PD meds for 12 hours prior to arrival at site), a physical and neurological exam, collecting vital signs, ECG, and reviewing and recording adverse events and concurrent medications. Sites should take detailed notes of contents of all meals provided to the patients. Following completion of all these procedures, subjects who continue to meet all protocol inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria should be randomized. Patients can take their SOC medication at this point if needed. For sparse PK group (i.e. any subject that is not participating in the intense PK sub-study), if no medical or compliance concerns are identified, the subject will move on to the PK sampling phase, which will entail the following procedures: 1) Collect initial samples of blood (hour 0) with venipuncture unless PI [INVESTIGATOR_635983]. 2) Administer first dose of assigned study drug after the hour 0 sampling. 3) Collect blood (10mL) at the 1.5hr timepoint.

Definition An AE is defined as per the US Code of Federal Regulation, Title 21, Part 312.32 (2016) and ICH E2A: International Conference on Harmonization - Tripartite Guideline: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting (1994).  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Collection of adverse events will begin once informed consent is signed and will continue until the 24-hour phone follow-up after the subject is discharged from the clinic at the end of study visit or discontinues from the study.  Adverse events include but are not limited to: (1) worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions or symptoms present at the start of the study; (2) Subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction. An abnormal laboratory value will only be reported as an AE if the investigator considers it clinically significant, or if it leads to the Subject being withdrawn from the study. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs or symptoms. Symptoms and conditions present at the beginning of the study will be characterized, so that AEs can be defined as any new symptom, or any increase in frequency or severity of an existing symptom. Adverse events should be described with medical terminology so that the event can be matched against a medical coding dictionary, such as MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). Investigators should report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to the protocol procedure, and to the investigational product, and/or drug delivery system used in the protocol.  Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether determined to be related or unrelated to the study drug by a medically qualified site PI [INVESTIGATOR_635988]’s records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Protocol ANVS-[ZIP_CODE]  Ver. 5.0 Global; 08-21-[ADDRESS_849904] subsided, the conditions are considered medically stable, or the subjects are no longer available for follow up. Subjects who discontinue due to adverse experiences will be treated and followed according to established medical practice. All pertinent information will be entered into the eCRF. Adverse events will be reported to the Medical Monitor, Sponsor, and DSMB, per Coordinating Center SOPs and the DSMB Charter. 15.0 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) 15.1. Definition  An SAE is defined as per the US Code of Federal Regulation, Title 21, Part 312.32 (2016) and ICH E2A: International Conference on Harmonization - Tripartite Guideline: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting (1994). An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 15.2. Reporting SAEs Collection of serious adverse events will begin once informed consent is signed (regardless of study drug exposure) and will be monitored throughout the trial.  All SAEs must be reported to the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_849905] Directors, which will lead to the initiation of the creation of the report. A notification will be sent to all participating sites and the DSMB once the report is available. Sites will inform their IRB of the event based on local IRB requirements. The Sponsor is the IND holder and is responsible for submitting any SAEs according to the FDA reporting requirements.  The Sponsor will work with the Coordinating Center personnel to submit any SAEs according to the EU local country requirements.

Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions The Sponsor is responsible for informing the Competent Authority (CA), the European Medicines Agency and the IECs as well as the Regulatory Authority (RA), the FDA and IRB of any individual case reports of SAEs that are determined to be reportable by [CONTACT_1034] (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) in Europe and the US, respectively. The Investigator will ensure that all relevant information is provided to the Sponsor to allow the Sponsor to meet their obligations to report the S[LOCATION_003]R to the CA/RA and IEC/IRB. For a S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life-threatening, this should be reported as soon as possible and not later than [ADDRESS_849906] Not applicable. 18.0 PRECAUTIONS/OVERDOSE If a subject receives a dose exceeding [ADDRESS_849907] swallows more than 10 capsules with the assumption of them being in the 20mg buntanetap group, this will be considered an overdose, and in such case, the information will be collected following the same timeframe and procedures as for a SAE, even if the overdose is not associated to any AE/SAE. No specific treatment is recommended apart from appropriate supportive measures. 19.[ADDRESS_849908] visit, if they believe that conception occurred during their participation in the study.  A pregnancy as such is not an AE, unless there is a possibility that the IMP has interfered with the efficiency of any contraceptive measures. However, the Investigator should report pregnancies according to the procedures and timelines described for reporting of SAEs (Section 15.2). The pregnancy report form should be used instead of the SAE form. The pregnant subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy. Any complication during the pregnancy should preferably be reported as an AE or SAE (if it fulfils SAE criteria).

The responsibilities of DSMB will be established in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB will review the safety information from the study on an ongoing basis. The DSMB, will identify the study-specific data parameters and format of the information to be reported, as well as the timing of reports based on the enrollment status of the study. The DSMB will initially be provided with data blinded to treatment status, but they may request unblinded data if there is a safety concern. First DSMB meeting will be when 75 patients (17% of the targeted sample size) received [ADDRESS_849911] of the study. These may include amending safety monitoring procedures, modifying the protocol or consent, terminating the study, or continuing the study as designed. Using the Safety Review Process (review of lab data, vitals, and adverse events) and the DSMB, there is substantial oversight and case review to alert the investigators, in a timely manner, to any safety issues that may arise. Further details will be provided in the DSMB charter. 21.0 RECORDING AND COLLECTION OF DATA  21.1.

2.1 Presby[CONTACT_115736], age- related, gradual loss in the ability to focus at intermediate and 
near targets without spectacle or surgical co rrection due to a progressive loss of elasticity in the 
crystalline lens. Symptoms of presby[CONTACT_115737], ocular discomfort/headache, 
fatigue/drowsiness from near work, increased working distance (arms too short), and need for brighter light for reading. In childhood, an amplitude of accommodation of 12 diopters (D) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  (Benzoni 2012).  Amplitude of accommodation declines linearly at a rate of about 0.[ADDRESS_129213] presby[CONTACT_115738], and this number is projected to increase to 1.78 billion people by 2050 ( Frick 2015 ), including virtually all adults 
>50 years old .  
Therapeutic approaches to presby[CONTACT_115739] a spectrum of nonsurgical to surgical techniques (Moarefi  2017). Non-invasive methods of correcting presby[CONTACT_19555] (e.g., bifocal or multifocal 
progressive addition lenses) can be effective, but many patients are dissatisfied for cosmetic or other reasons and desire independence from spectacles. Various surgical techniques have been applied on the cornea, lens, or sclera ( Gil-Cazorla 2016). However, surgery is invasive and 
difficult to reverse in the event of complications or patient dissatisfaction. Moreover, surgical corrections usually require that patients choose for one eye to be corrected for distance and one for near, or monovision. Many patients do not like this outcome as this leaves them  without 
binocular vision or depth perception at distance and near  (Goertz 2014, McDonnell 2003). There 
are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug products to treat presby[CONTACT_19555]. 
2.2 Investigational Pr oducts  
Visus Therapeutics , Inc. (Visus) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_115720] ( carbachol 2.75%/brimonidine 
tartrate 0.1% fixed -dose combination with BAK) and  BRIMOCHOL F ( carbachol 
2.75%/brimonidine tartrate 0.1% fixed-dose combination BAK- free) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] O phthalmic 
Solutions as novel fixed-dose combination eye drops for improvement in near visual acuity in 
emmetropic phakic and pseudophakic presby[CONTACT_19555].  
The active pharmaceut ical ingredients carbachol and brimonidine tartrate are currently approved 
for topi[INVESTIGATOR_115721]. Both carbachol  and brimonidine tartrate  have been used extensively 
in ophthalmic applications, and the approved products have been administered chronical ly at 
higher total daily doses than that in the se combination products.   
Five Investigator- initiated trials of a pharmacy -compounded formulation of BRIMOCHOL 
containing up to 3.0% carbachol and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate were conducted in presby[CONTACT_115740];  the results of 4 of these studies were published (Abdelkader 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019). 
These studies evaluated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_115722]: across a range of carbachol concentrations from 1.5% to 3.0%, the effects of BRIMOCHOL in older and younger presby[CONTACT_115741], the occurrence of tachyphylaxis over 3 months, and whether the fixed-dose

Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 20 of 98 combination demonstrated contribution of elements, i.e., that the combination is more effective 
to the individual monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). These studies were not conducted by [CONTACT_115742]. 
In brief, the studies concluded that there was a dose-response to carbachol concentration with the 
3% carbachol given the greatest peak and duration of effect on pupil size and near visual acuity (Abdelkader 2019). Commercially available carbachol and brimonidine tartrate was given 
concomitantly 5 minutes apart or as the fixed -dose BRIMOCHOL
 combination was more 
effective than carbachol and brimonidine tartrate given as monotherapy ( Abdelkader 2016 ), 
suggesting contribution of elements. No tachyphylaxis was noted over 3 months of daily dosing and clinical response was comparable in subjec ts older or younger than 50 years of age and in 
pseudophakes ( Abdelkader  2015). Additionally, there was no reports of headache in the largest 
of these studies in 57 patients ( Abdelkader  2019); suggesting the addition of brimonidine tartrate 
may have mitigated the incidence of headache, a common adverse event associated with the use of cholinergic agents alone. 
Please see the Investigator Brochure (IB) for additional information on the nonclinical and 
clinical support for BRIMOCHOL development.

other ag ents as treatments for presby[CONTACT_19555] ( Benozzi 2012, Karanfil 2017, Renna 2017) . There are 
two currently marketed miotic agents in the U.S.: pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (ISOPTOCARPI[INVESTIGATOR_44466] [ Prescribing 
Information ]) for the lowering of intraocular pressure ( IOP) and carbachol (MIO STAT® 0.01% 
[Prescribing Information]) for obtaining miosis during surgery. Carbachol was also marketed as 
ISTOPO® CARBACHOL for the lowering of IOP for more than 50 years but was withdrawn 
from the market for commercial and not safety reasons. Carbachol i s generally regarded as a 
stronger and longer- acting miotic than pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]  (Gelatt 1984) though with less corneal 
permeability with a dosing frequency of up to [ADDRESS_129215] the ciliary muscle , thereby [CONTACT_115743], thereby [CONTACT_115744] ( Nardin  1966).

Brimonidine tartrate is a selective alpha -[ADDRESS_129216] that  works presynaptically in the

10 SAFETY MONITORING AND R EPORTING 
10.1 Adverse E vents  
10.1.1 Definition and Reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigational s ubject who has been administered a pharmaceutical product that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
AEs include: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition 
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms 
• Concomitant diseases or accidents 
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject during 
a clinical study  
• Loss of ≥3 lines of distance or near visual acuity 
AEs comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease 
symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities), and accidents observed in the context of a 
clinical trial, irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance. Events occurring in the framework of a clinical trial during drug-free and post-treatment periods  are also to be designated as AEs . 
All AEs , whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, will be recorded 
throughout the study (i.e., from Screening until EOS). 
Subjects will be queried for resolution of ongoing AEs  or until any unresolved AEs  are judged 
by [CONTACT_115749]-up. Resolution of all AEs  will be 
promptly documented by [CONTACT_115750]’s CRF. 
Any AE related to COVID-[ADDRESS_129220] medical occurrence at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening event (i.e., puts the subject, in the view of the Principal Investigator 
(PI), at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes 
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current  IB. 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if a reasonable possibility exists that the drug may have caused the event . 
10.2.[ADDRESS_129221] also be reported. 
Report all SAEs (initial and follow -up information) on an SAE form and send the form to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the discovery of the event or information (see below). 
The Sponsor or designee  may request  follow-up and other additional information from the 
Investigator (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104782], laboratory results). SAEs will be followed up through completion or treatment termination.  
Report all deaths with the primary cause of death as the SAE term, as death is the outcome of the 
event, not the event itself. If an autopsy was performed, report the primary cause of death on the autopsy report as the SAE term. Forward autopsy and postmortem report(s) to the Sponsor or designee, as outlined above. 
If study treatment is discontinued, temporarily suspended, or the dose reduced because of an 
SAE, include this information in the SAE report.

Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 39 of 98 Suspected unexpected serious a dverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that qualify for mandatory 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities where the SAE is suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_115751] (i.e., not defined as expected in the current IB clinical study protocol, or approved labeling for marketed drugs). In this case, the Sponsor or designee will report to the relevant regulatory authorities and forward a formal notification describing the S[LOCATION_003]R to Investigators, according to regulatory requirements. Each Investigator must then notify his or her institutional review board ( IRB) of the S[LOCATION_003]R as required by [CONTACT_115752]. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_129222] or change in 
activities of daily living (ADL); subject  is aware of symptoms, but symptoms are easily 
tolerated.  
Moderate The event is an inconvenience or concern to the subject and ca uses interference with ADL, 
but the subject  is able to continue with ADL.  
Severe The event significantly interferes with ADL and the subject is incapacitated and/or unable 
to continue with ADL.  
Potentially life- 
threatening  An event/reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; 
it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
10.2.4 Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will make a  determination of the relationship of the AE to the study drug using 
a 4-category system (not related, possible, probable, definite), as shown below. 
 
Categorization for Determining Relationship of AEs  to Study Treatment   
Not related  An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug 
and that can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604], including underlying disease, 
complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment.  
Possible  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) and that cannot be excluded as being possibly caused by [CONTACT_33641] (e.g., existence of similar reports attributed to the drug and/or its analogues; reactions attributable to the pharmacological effect of the drug), although other 
factors such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment are presumable.  
Probable  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the drug (including 
the course after withdrawal of the drug) and that can be excluded as being possibly caused by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment.  
Definite  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect 
relationship, and (if appropriate) satisfies the following:

confidentiality, subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_115754].  
11.2 Site Monitoring  
The Sponsor or designee (e.g., Clinical Research Associate [ CRA ]) will be responsible for 
monitoring this clinical trial. The CRA will monitor  the study conduct, proper eCRF and source 
documentation completion and retention, and accurate study drug accountability. To this end, the CRA will visit the study site at suitable intervals and be in frequent contact [CONTACT_22291]. The Investigator will grant access to all documents (related to the study and subjects) at any time these are requested. In turn, the CRA will adhere to all requirements for subject confidentiality as outlined in the ICF. The Investigator and study st aff will be expected to 
cooperate with the CRA, to be available during a portion of the monitoring visit to answer questions, and to provide any missing information.

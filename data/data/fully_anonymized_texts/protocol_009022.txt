1.0 Study Summary  
Study Title  iThrive WI – A mobile health intervention to lower overdose 
risk and promote COVID -[ADDRESS_951801]  can help people who 
use drugs lower their risk of overdose and learn more about 
COVID -19 vaccines.  
Number of study sites  3 – Vivent Health offices located in the cities of Milwaukee, 
Eau Claire, and Appleton, WI  
Study Design  The mobile health system used in this study, called 
Thrive4Life Connect, has been developed for use in harm 
reduction settings by [CONTACT_701224]. Thrive4Life Connect is 
based on the Addiction Comprehen sive Health Enhancement 
Support System (A -CHESS) and facilitates brief, behavioral 
interventions targeting knowledge gaps, motivation, and 
social connectedness. This app is being used in another IRB -
approved study at UW -Madison (Study ID: 2017 -0866). In 
the proposed study, we will develop new intervention content 
for assessing and increasing vaccine confidence and lowering 
overdose risk. We will test the feasibility and preliminary 
effectiveness using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], pre -post study design with [ADDRESS_951802], to deliver an intervention 
focused on reducing overdose risk and supporting 
COVID -19 vaccine uptake among people who use 
drugs in Wisconsin.  
Secondary 
Objective(s)  To understand overdose risk, COVID -19 vaccine uptake, and 
related attitudes and behaviors before and after the mobile 
health intervention.

 Page 6 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951805] year of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
which collided with a worsening, ongoing overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_701202] 9,260 people in Wisconsin from 2000 -2019 from opi[INVESTIGATOR_571233]. Consistent with national and state -level trends 
indicating increases in fatal and nonfatal overdo ses,1,2 overdose 
mortality in Wisconsin increased by 27% during [ADDRESS_951806] drugs 
in Wisconsin conducted by [CONTACT_571296] -May 2021 indicated 
that 50% of respondents were hesitant to be vaccinated for COVID -
19, consistent with prior studies.[ADDRESS_951807] drugs 
(PWID), during the collision of a worldwide COVID -[ADDRESS_951808] conducted multiple prior 
studies in collaboration and partnership with Vivent Health, the 
state’s primary network of syringe services programs . Our research 
will describe how mHealth interventions can reduce overdose and 
COVID -19 risk at a critical time of climbing overdose mortality in 
Wisconsin.  
 
2.2 Preliminary studies - Mobile health Interventions with PWID: 
[CONTACT_701265]  and his research team have conducted several 
mobile health (mHealth) interventions among individuals with active 
substance use disorders that provide a strong theoretical basis for the 
proposed work and highlight our team’s ability to use mobile phones 
to collect rich behavioral health data from this population. Hep -Net, 
a UW -ICTR -funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_701203] C and respond to an overdose,6,7 showed the 
feasibility of a brief, computerized intervention involving 
individualized goal setting in the syringe services setting. We then 
studied the benefits of the Addiction Comprehensive Health 
Enhancement Support System (A -CHESS)8 within multiple 
treatment settings, including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2571]9 and HIV 
treatment (DP2DA042424).10 A-CHESS is guided by [CONTACT_6270] -
determination theory,11,12 which identifies three supports for intrinsic 
motivation for behavior change derived from basic psychosocial 
needs: relatedness (meaningful relationships with others; a sense of 
connectedness), competence (ability to deal with challenges), and 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 7 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  autonomy (sense of being in control of one’s own behavior and 
goals). A -CHESS also operationalizes the situated Information -
Motivation -Behavioral Skills (sIMB) Model,13 by [CONTACT_701225] (e.g., available community resources), Motivation (e.g., 
a weekly survey about health goals), and Behavioral Skills (e.g., 
messaging with a counselor).  
 
Existing Research Infrastructure to be Leveraged in The 
Proposed New Research:  
WI Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571245] - Formative Phase (UW -Madison 
IRB Study ID: 2017 -0866) : The Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_701204] a 
national, multi -site research consortium funded by [CONTACT_133312], CDC, 
SAMHSA, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The 
Wisconsin node of the consortium (grant numbers UG3DA044826 
and UH3DA044826, R. Westergaard and D. Seal, MPI ) is built on an 
academic -community partnership with Vivent Health. In 2018 -19, 
during the initial, formative (UG3) phase of this study, we enrolled 
[ADDRESS_951809] 30 
days, and resided in Brown, Outagamie, La Crosse, Marathon, 
Douglas, or Eau Claire counties. Through Audio Computer -Assisted 
Self-Interviews,17 participants reported sociodemographic 
characteristics, substance use behaviors, overdose history and risk 
behaviors, and were tested for HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually 
transmitted infections.  
 
WI Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571245] - Intervention Phase  (UW -Madison 
IRB Study ID: 2017 -0866) : We are currently in the intervention 
(UH3) phase of the WI Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571245], which involves a 
clinical trial of a short -term intervention, “prevention navigation,” to 
increase use of preventive health services and reduce risks from 
injecting drugs f or PWID utilizing syringe services programs. 
Prevention navigation is based on Project START, an evidence -
based, six -session, individualized case management intervention that 
was found to reduce HIV risk among recently incarcerated men 
using motivational i nterviewing techniques and a harm reduction 
framework.18,[ADDRESS_951810] START model 
for syringe services program settings. Clients receiving the 
intervention build skills and set goals to reduce their overdose, HIV, 
and hepatitis C risk, increase their readiness to engage in addiction 
and hepatitis C treatment, and address other areas of concern such as 
smoking and self -stigma. We are currently enrolling PWID in a non -
randomized, clinical  trial in the same syringe services program 
offices that participated in the formative phase of the study. Over 12 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 8 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  weeks, intervention recipi[INVESTIGATOR_701205] 4 sessions lasting 50 -70 
minutes each wherein a “prevention navigator” uses strategies 
including linkage -to-care case management, peer navigation, 
motivational enhancement, formative decision making, and harm 
reducti on to help participants develop an individualized risk 
reduction plan related to their injection drug use. Outcomes at 3 and 
6 months among the 270 total intervention participants will be 
compared with data from 135 control participants, all of whom are 
recruited from the same sites involved in the formative phase. 
Analyses will compare two primary outcomes between intervention 
and control participants: confidence in ability to access addiction 
treatment services when participants are ready for treatment an d 
engagement in addiction treatment services.  
 
An additional activity supported by [CONTACT_701226][INVESTIGATOR_701206]4Life Connect, a 
novel harm reduction mHealth application that adapts A -CHESS for 
PWID accessing syringe services programs at Vivent He alth. 
Thrive4Life Connect is guided by [CONTACT_701227] 
A-CHESS (i.e., self -determination theory11,12 and the sIMB13). The 
Thrive4Life Connect app will be used by [CONTACT_701228].  
 
2.3 COVID -19 exacerbated a worsening overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_901],20-22 
resulting in a 2 7% increase in overdose deaths in Wisconsin in 2020 
relative to 2019.23 Factors hypothesized to contribute to increased 
overdose mortality during the pandemic include an unsafe illegal 
drug supply contaminated with illicitly manufactured fentanyl,24 
increasing drug use while alone (i.e., away from potential overdose 
responders) due to physical distancing,[ADDRESS_951811] survey conducted by [CONTACT_701229],  2021 found that increases in 
overdose risk behaviors may be driving overdose mortality upwards. 
In total, 52% of PWID used alone more often (i.e., away from 
potential overdose by[CONTACT_701230]), 52% were 
concerned about the safety of the drug supply, 27% overdosed, and 
>75% reported greater depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the 
pandemic.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 9 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy may exacerbate health disparities 
among PWID. People who use drugs, especially those with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_701207]/ethnic minorities, are at increased risk for 
COVID -19 infection and poor outcomes (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
death).27 Unfortunately, like other studies,28 50% of PWID we 
recently surveyed were hesitant to be vaccinated for COVID -19. 
PWID are also under -vaccinated for other infections (e.g., hepatitis 
A and B29) and lack access to preventive services.30 To address 
disparities, interventions targeting upstream social determinants of 
health (i.e., stigma, social isolation, distrust in healthcare, food and 
housing insecurity) are needed. These may improve use of 
preventive services and change behaviors that  ultimately cause 
health disparities, including those from COVID -19 and overdose.  
 
3.0 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
3.1 The primary ob jective of this study  is to understand the feasibility of 
using a smartphone application to deliver an intervention focused on 
overdose and COVID -19. The secondary objective is to understand 
overdose risk, COVID -19 vaccine uptake, and related attitudes and 
behaviors before and after  the intervention.  
 
3.2 We hypothesize that an intervention to increase COVID -19 
vaccination and reduce overdose risk will be f easible to deliver via a 
smartphone based on intervention completion rates. We also 
hypothesize that engaging with intervention content may increase 
knowledge about COVID -19 and overdose and reduce risk 
behaviors.  
 
3.3 Study Endpoints:  
● Baseline:  At the beginning of the study, participants will complete a 
baseline survey to assess their pre -study overdose and COVID -19 
risk behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. These data will be 
used as a basis to assess change at 3 months and 6 months.  
 
● 3-Months:  After the [ADDRESS_951812] mobile 
intervention, participants will complete the same survey questions 
from baseline at 3 months to assess any changes in their overdose 
and COVID -19 risk behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. We 
will also examine the percentage of participants who completed 
intervention content each week, and the percentage of skipped 
intervention content questions to examine feasibility.  
 
● 6-Months:  3 months after the 12 -week mobile intervention, 
participants will again complete the same survey at 6 months to 
assess any changes in their overdose and COVID -19 risk behaviors, 
attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. The 6 -month survey will  help us to 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 10 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  understand whether any behavior changes from 3 -months were 
sustained.  
 
3.4 Participants who express any type of mental or other distress (e.g., 
thoughts of self -harm, harm to others, reports of child or elder abuse) 
based on any communications with the study team (e.g., by [CONTACT_701231]4Life Connect, on the Thriv e4Life Connect 
discussion board, via text or phone call with the study team, or any 
other way) will be engaged by [CONTACT_701232] (e.g., National 
Suicide Prevention Hotline). The participant wil l be reminded that 
they can stop study participation at any time. Participants in 
significant distress may be removed from the study by [CONTACT_701233].  
 
4.0 Number of Participants  
4.1 This study will include 60 participants in total across 3 Vivent 
Health syringe services locations in Wisconsin – Milwaukee, 
Appleton, and Eau Claire.  
- Milwaukee: 30 participants  
- Appleton: 15 participants  
- Eau Claire: 15 participants  
 
4.2 In a prior longitudinal study with Vivent  Health (WI Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_701208] - Intervention phase), we have experienced up to 50% 
attrition at [ADDRESS_951813] the study early  (i.e., before 
completing the 3 -month study assessment)  may be replaced.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_951814] information. The screening survey will ask 
for participant names, which will be stored confidentially on HIPAA 
compliant drives, for the duration of study recruitment. The names of 
ineligible participants and t hose not interested in participating in the 
study will be kept and used to ensure that ineligible participants do 
not screen again.  
 
We will retain screening data at an aggregate level to describe the 
number of people who screened as eligible or ineligible, as the 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 11 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  percentage eligible will be important in examining the feasibility of 
the intervention and study. For participants that screen as ineligible, 
choose to not participate, or do not consent to participating, only 
their name [CONTACT_701258]. As in this study 
participants are only permitted to screen once, the names of 
ineligible participants will be kept to ensure they do not screen 
again. These names will be stored on secure HIPAA -compliant 
servers at the UW      School of Medicine and Public Health as well 
as HIPAA -compliant Vivent Health Microsoft Teams. All the names 
of people who screen as ineligible will only be kept for the duration 
of participant recruitment for this study and will be destroyed after.  
 
If a participant screens as eligible and then schedules an enrollment 
appointment with the intent to participate (enrollment will occur one 
week after screening), but then decides to not consent or not 
participate at that time, their screening data, except for  their name, 
will be destroyed. Only their name [CONTACT_701259].  
 
We will retain all screening data for people who consent to 
participating in the study. For these participants who consent to 
participating in the full study, screening data will not be deidentified 
until recruitment and study analyses are complete and ban king 
occurs (described later in this protocol). Once recruitment and 
analysis procedures are complete for this study, all data collected 
during screening will be deidentified.  
 
Interested and eligible participants will complete a locator form 
(which is a part of the screening survey) containing individually 
identifiable data, including participant name [CONTACT_159006], address, and 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. Individually identifiable data will  be stored 
separately from study -related data collected as part of the screening 
survey. Ineligible participants or those not interested in participating 
in the study will not complete the locator form.  
 
5.2 Inclusion Criteria:  To be considered eligible to participate, clients 
must meet all the following criteria on the screening survey:  
● Be 18 years old or older  
● Willing to attend in person study encounters at any of the 
following Vivent Health locations: Milwaukee, Appleton, 
and Eau Claire  
● Used opi[INVESTIGATOR_701209] 30 days  
● Injected drugs at least [ADDRESS_951815] 7 days  
● Express interest in reducing their overdose risk  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 12 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951816] and to customize  content delivered in the  study intervention.  
 
5.3 Exclusion Criteria:  None in addition to the inclusion criteria    
 
If a client initially screens as ineligible to participate in the study, 
they cannot screen again. Eligibility and screening will continue 
until a total of 60 participants is reached across the three Vivent 
Health sites. The distribution of participants be tween the sites will be 
as follows: 30 participants in Milwaukee, 15 participants in Eau 
Claire, and 15 participants in Appleton.  
 
6.0 Special Populations  
6.1 ☒ Individuals who are receiving inpatient or outpatient services for 
mental illness, developmental disability, or alcohol and other drug 
abuse (AODA).  
 
Justification:  Our target study population involves people who 
inject drugs, who are at risk of overdose, necessitating the inclusion 
of these individuals in our study. Some of our participants may be in 
treatment programs, and others may be using drugs but not in 
treatment. We chose to target this population as our proposed 
intervention centers around lowering overdose risk, which requires 
engagement with individuals who engage in overdose risk -related 
behaviors.  
 
Safeguards:  To minimize the risks to people receiving treatment for 
substance use or who are using substances, participants will be 
provided with a paper or electronic copy of the informed consent 
when they initially screen as eligible to participate in the study. The 
informed consent process will be completed at the enrollment visit 
by [CONTACT_701234] a video of t he informed consent highlights then 
discussing with a Prevention Specialist OR by [CONTACT_701235] a Prevention Specialist. Vivent 
Health prevention specialists will be available to answer any 
questions that participants may have. Participants will be informed 
that their participation is voluntary, they can stop participating at any 
time, and they can skip any survey questions they are uncomfortable 
answering. We will also inform participants that study participation 
(and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_439076]) will not affect their access to 
services at Vivent Health or any treatment they are receiving. We 
also have a Certificate of Conf identiality to ensure that the research 
team cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify

civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.  
16.0  
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
7.1 Recruitment will occur out of the following Wisconsin Vivent 
Health locations: Milwaukee, Eau Claire, and Appleton. Previous 
participants from other Thrive4Life -related studies may also be 
included in recruitment efforts. Previous participants from prior 
studies at Vivent Health will be recruited using the same methods as 
other prospective participants if they attend an SSP visit at one of the 
study sites. They may also be recruited via phone call, text message, 
or other contact [CONTACT_701236] e4Life, if they 
indicated previously that such outreach is acceptable.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_951818] afterwards, they will be given a Vivent 
Health iPad to complete the eligibil ity survey.  
 
7.3 Described in section 7.2.  
 
7.4 Recruitment Materials:   
● General flyer: This flyer will provide introductory 
information about our study and will encourage interested 
individuals to ask staff at their local Vivent Health office 
about this opportunity.  
● One-pager and FAQs flyer: This flyer will be provided to 
individuals who have already expressed interest in 
participating in our study. This handout will have more 
specific information about enrollment and pi[INVESTIGATOR_701210]: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs

compensation, study expectations, and answers to FAQs.  
● Overview video: This video will be provided to people who 
have expressed interest in participating in our study. This 
video will cover the same information in the one -pager but 
in a video format. The video will include audio and 
PowerPoint slides that will  provide an overview of study 
information.  
 
7.5 Participants will receive cash compensation for completing specific study 
surveys. The maximum value for compensation for one participant in this 
study will be $150. Participants will also receive an iPhone (model SE) as 
part of their participation in the study. An unlimited phone service plan will 
be provided to participants for the duration of their participation in the study 
(6-7 months). Phone service will end after study completion, but participants 
will be able to keep their iPhone. If participants lo se their iPhone, up to one 
replacement will be provided after the participant informs Vivent Health and 
UW research staff of their need for a new phone . Cash compensation and 
iPhones will be provided to participants in person at their Vivent Health 
location (Milwaukee, Eau Claire, or Appleton) . Venmo, Paypal, or mailing 
remuneration will be alternative methods for providing compensation to 
participants as needed (E.g., If a participant moves locations).  Compensation 
will be provided to participants after confirmed completion of the study 
surveys (see below).  
 
Survey compensation:  
● Baseline survey: $20  
● First set of daily check -ins: After the baseline survey, three 
daily check -in surveys will be made available. The 
completion of one daily check -in will be remunerated at  
$10, for a total of up to $30 for completing all three check -
ins.  
● 3-month survey: $20  
● Second set of daily check -ins: After the 3 -month survey,

8.0 Consent/Assent Process  
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 15 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  8.1 This study will involve individuals who are using drugs, who may 
also be receiving inpatient or outpatient services for mental illness, 
developmental disability, or alcohol and other drug abuse (AODA). 
To minimize the risks to this population, participants  will be 
provided with a paper or electronic copy of the informed consent 
when they initially screen as eligible to participate in the study. The 
informed consent process will be completed at the enrollment visit 
by [CONTACT_701234] a video of the informed consent highlights then 
discussing with a Prevention Specialist OR by [CONTACT_701235] a Prevention Specialist. 
Participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary, 
they can stop participating at any tim e, and they can skip any survey 
questions they are uncomfortable answering. After watching the 
informed consent video or walking through the consent with a 
Prevention Specialist, participants will be prompted to ask the 
research team any questions. We also obtained a C ertificate of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health, which 
participants will be made aware of.  
 
Walkthrough of Study Informed Consent Process:  
Participants will first complete a screening survey  to determine their 
eligibility. This screener will be completed with Prevention 
Specialists at participating Vivent Health locations. Eligible 
participants who are interested in participating in the study will be 
invited to complete a locator form with Pr evention Specialists asking 
for multiple contact [CONTACT_41528], which will be utilized for follow -up 
throughout the study. Participants that express interest in enrolling in 
the study will be invited back to Vivent Health in one week for an 
enrollment and inform ed consent appointment. Participants will be 
given a paper or electronic copy of the study consent form and asked 
to review this information in the week before their enrollment 
appointment.

Health. Participants are also free to skip questions they are 
uncomfortable with answering and can reach out to study staff as 
needed.  
 
This study also involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required ou tside of the research context, as we ask 
participants to download an app available through the app store and 
participate in self -help type activities.  
 
9.2 Participants will be provided with a paper or electronic copy of the 
informed consent detailing the study procedures, risks, and benefits. 
They will be asked to review this information during the  week

to go to a Milwaukee, Appleton, or Eau Claire Viv ent Health 
location to complete their study surveys on the study iPad.   
 
11.0 Study Intervention  
11.1 Participants will be asked to complete  a series of intervention modules using 
the Thrive4Life app  on a smartphone provided by [CONTACT_1758].  These modules 
are meant to  simulate the format and style of the WI Rural Opi[INVESTIGATOR_701208]’s in -person interaction with a prevention navigator and are focused  
on overdose risk and vaccine hesitancy. Participants will answer a series of 
questions and receive immediate, tailored feedback within the intervention 
modules based on their responses to module activities and questions. The 
options and responses to module questions and activities were created 
collaboratively with Vivent Health staff  and by [CONTACT_701240] (i.e., worksheets used during the intervention) from our prior study 
involving in -person prevention navigation intervention sessions.  
 
The FDA Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical 
Applications states (in section V.B, page 12) states that mobile health 
applications that help patients self -manage their disease or conditions 
without providing specific treatment or treatmen t suggestions fall under a

prior consultations with Jake Rome at UW -Madison ICTR.  
 
Data from this study are not planned for use and are not being held in 
support of a future submission to the FDA for approval of the app.  
 
12.0 Study Timelines  
12.1 The duration of an individual participant’s participation in the study 
will last approximately [ADDRESS_951825] comparison study with 60 PWID from 
three Vivent Health syringe services programs in Milwaukee, Eau 
Claire, and Appleton. Participants will complete baseline surveys, a 
12-week intervention and will repeat surveys 3 months and 6 months 
after baseline. We will primarily examine feasibility outcomes 
(percentage of participants who complete each component of the 12 -
week interven tion). We will also compare overdose risk behaviors 
and COVID -19 vaccine confidence at 3 and 6 months to baseline.

 Page 21 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022   
 
13.3 After recruitment, s tudy participants will be involved in the 
following procedures:  eligibility screening, informed consent and 
study enrollment, baseline surveys, 12 -week intervention session, 3 -
month follow -up surveys, and 6 -month follow -up surveys .  
 

PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 22 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  Recruitment, screening for eligibility, and informed consent and 
enrollment will follow the procedures previously described (See 
“Recruitment” and “Informed Consent” sections).  
 
During the initial enrollment appointment  and after providing 
informed consent,  participants will complete the baseline survey and 
first of three daily check -ins (ecological momentary assessments). 
The baseline survey will involve multiple choice questions about 
overdose and COVID -[ADDRESS_951826]. Participants will be asked to complete two 
additional daily check -ins about their drug use in the prior day over 
the course of the week following the enrollment appointment. 
Participants will be notified through an in -app notification and/or 
private message that a new survey i s available. This event -level data 
will provide a detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_701211] -occurring overdose risk 
behaviors beyond what can be captured in surveys with longer recall 
periods. We will specifically assess the setting of use and whether 
the participant was alo ne, had naloxone nearby, tested drugs for 
fentanyl, or mixed drug classes.  
 
During the 12 -weekly intervention session, participants will 
complete weekly check -in surveys focused on 1) risk reduction 
planning tailored to their needs and motivation to change their 
overdose risk behaviors and COVID -19 vaccination status, and 2) 
goal setting and outlining steps they will take to achieve their 
overdose and COVID -[ADDRESS_951827] the same data  as 
the baseline survey and daily check -ins. Three months after 
beginning the study, participants will complete another survey 
assessing their overdose and COVID -19 infection and vaccine 
knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors. They will then be asked to 
complete the second set of three total daily check -ins. This process 
will be repeated for the 6 -month timepoint. A total of nine daily 
check -ins (ecological momentary assessments) will be completed by 
[CONTACT_701241].  
 
Throughout the study, participants will have access to and be 
encouraged to engage with a list of local resources and information 
about overdose risk and COVID -19. Participants will be regularly 
reminded that they can contact [CONTACT_701242]. Discussion boards and private messaging functions within 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 23 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951828] app will also be available to participants. 
Participants’ general usage (i.e., clicks) of resources or pages on the 
app are tracked within the Thrive4Life Connect app. Actions such as 
the frequency of participant engagement with res ources in the 
Thrive4Life Connect app, posting on discussion boards, and sending 
private messages may be analyzed as data for the study. Participant 
discussion board and private message text will be monitored 
regularly by [CONTACT_701243] i nteract with 
participants via Thrive4Life Connect data exports to ensure that no 
illegal or inappropriate activity is occurring in these areas and that 
participants are not expressing thoughts of harm to themselves or 
others, or any other signals of distre ss. All participants and study 
staff will be able to publicly post and view other discussion board 
posts. To protect participant confidentiality, participants are 
encouraged to choose anonymous public usernames (which are 
viewable by [CONTACT_701244]) 
and avoid posting identifiable information. All participants and study 
staff will also be able to utilize the private messaging function. 
Private messaging will primarily be used by [CONTACT_701245] 12 weekly 
intervention goals. Participants will also be able to message each 
other and study staff. When messaging with other participants, the 
same guidelines for discussion boards to ensure confidentiality will 
apply.  
 
Referrals to community resources (e.g., housing assistance) and 
sterile injecting supplies or other resources (e.g., naloxone) are 
provided as part of the regular care that participants may receive at 
Vivent Health. A majority of the resources available to pa rticipants 
in this study focus on general education that is publicly available 
online and/or in suggesting topi[INVESTIGATOR_701212] (e.g., 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a naloxone supply if they don’ t already have one). Once 
participants are connected with in -person resources or supplies at 
Vivent Health locations, that will be considered as part of regular 
Vivent Health care.  
 
Throughout the study, all resources provided in any survey or in the 
Thrive4Life Connect app will be continuously updated to reflect the 
most current information. All resources and any links will be 
updated as information changes or becomes available.  
 
We may use identifiable information from participants to link their 
information to databases like the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, 
Medicaid enrollment and claims data managed by [CONTACT_398400] -Institute 
for Research on Poverty (IRP), and Wisconsin hospi[INVESTIGATOR_701213]: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 24 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951829] drugs use health care resources as 
well as to gather outcome data such as COVID -19 infection or 
vaccination status, overdose events, and substance use or other 
treatment utilization.  To accomplish this, we will link multiple 
datasets using individual identifiers (name, date of birth, address, 
sex, race, phone number).  
 
The UW -Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) will assist in 
constructing the Medicaid study dataset. The IRP has longstanding 
technical expertise in the construction and secure use of integrated 
person -level electronic datasets that combine State of Wisc onsin 
administrative data. Specifically, the IRP maintains the Multi -
Sample Person File (MSPF) dataset which combines data for the 
universe of individuals interacting with several WI state agencies, 
including the Department of Health Services (home of the Medicaid 
program) and the Department of Corrections, at the person -level 
dating back to the late 1990’s through the present. The MSPF is 
structured at the person -level, and each individual has a unique ID 
over time and across state agencies (e.g., a person  who is 
incarcerated in a WI state prison and later enrolled in WI Medicaid) 
which supports longitudinal analysis. We will provide the UW IRP 
programming staff with our sample selection criteria (i.e., identifiers 
listed above for individuals enrolled in t he study). They will query 
the MSPF dataset with these criteria to identify possible linkages to 
our study. In addition to basic program participation information 
(e.g., dates of participation), the MSPF includes identifying variables 
for each unique perso n including Social Security number, date of 
birth, name, and the individual’s identification number for each state 
agency that contributes to the MSPF in which s/he receives or has 
received services. The IRP will submit a finder file with the relevant 
identification information to each entity that is providing person -
level data for the study. Upon receipt of these data, the IRP will then 
merge data from all sources at the person level, assign a unique, 
study number to each subject, and remove the personal i dentifying 
information used to match data across sources from the analytic 
dataset that is provided to the investigators. The exchange of data 
between the IRP and state agencies is governed by [CONTACT_701246] a strict data security protocol to protect the confidentiality of 
individuals. The DUA between the IRP and the WI Medicaid 
program will be obtained for this study once recruitment has ended.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 25 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022   
The remaining dataset owners are housed at the Wisconsin 
Department of Health Services (DHS) or with affiliated 
organizations (e.g., WHAIC) for whom DHS provides assistance 
with linkage projects. The process for gaining approval for linkage 
projects involv es putting together a formal request for review by [CONTACT_701247], which we will do upon completing 
recruitment. After approval from the board is obtained (including a 
review of proof of IRB approval for this protocol), we will work 
with the  data owners and University HIPAA privacy officers to draft 
a Data Use Agreement. Once all stakeholders are in agreement on 
the DUA elements and there is a draft ready, the DUA is routed for 
institutional signature, which will facilitate getting all of the  
appropriate persons to review and approve the document. Once DUA 
approval is obtained, the research team will work with the specific 
data owners at DHS, who perform the data linkage based on 
identifiers provided. No study data beyond identifiers will be s hared 
with DHS during this process (e.g., survey data about drug use). 
DHS data owners will then provide a file on matched encounters 
back to the research team, which will be identifiable via a unique 
participant ID number created for the linkage. This uni que identifier 
will allow the research team to link the received DHS datasets back 
to the original study data (e.g., survey data, Thrive4Life Connect use 
data).  
 
13.4 Identifiable Data Elements : Possible participants will complete a 
screener and locator form. The screener and locator form will both 
be administered via one REDCap survey. If a participant screens as 
eligible, the survey will pause and a Vivent Health prevention 
specialist will confi rm their interest in enrolling. Interested 
participants will then complete the rest of the survey by [CONTACT_701248].

things (text or pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]) that motivate them to meet their goals.  
 
“My Gratitude” prompts participants with the following, 
“Awareness and appreciation of things you're thankful for may 
help brig hten your day. What are you grateful for?” 
Participants can then curate a personal list of things (text only) 
that they are grateful for in “My Gratitude.”

specific data requested. The lead researcher would then supply a 
deidentified dataset based on the data requested. No PHI will be 
shared in a requested dataset.  
 
19.4 Participants will not be able to withdraw their banked data for future 
research use. All data will be fully anonymized prior to banking. If a 
participant decides to withdraw from the study, no additional data

20.0 Study Analysis  
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 34 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  20.1 Primary Outcome Null hypothesis (feasibility): the study is feasible based 
on intervention content completion rates of at least 50%. Alternative 
hypothesis: fewer than 50% of intervention content is completed.  
 
Secondary outcome null hypothesis #1 (preliminary effectiveness of 
overdose content): there is no difference in the number of days endorsing 
overdose risk behaviors per month at baseline vs. 3 months and baseline vs. 
6 months. Alternative hypothesis: the f requency of overdose risk behaviors 
decreased from baseline to 3 months, and baseline to 6 months.  
 
Secondary outcome null hypothesis #2 (preliminary effectiveness of 
COVID -19 content): there is no difference in proportion of participants 
who have been vaccinated against COVID -19 at baseline vs. 3 months and 
baseline vs. 6 months. Alternative hypothesis:  the proportion vaccinated 
will increase from baseline to 3 months, and baseline to 6 months.  
 
20.2 As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], the number of participants (n=60) reflects the 
maximum allowable participants in our budget and study timeframe. A 
formal sample size calculation was not done.  
 
20.[ADDRESS_951842] for differences 
using appropriate statistical tests, incl uding paired t -tests, McNemar’s test, 
and models appropriate for count outcomes and repeated measures (Poisson 
or Negative Binomial Generalized Estimating Equations). As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
we expect that most analyses will be descriptive rather than inferentia l in 
nature.  
 
20.[ADDRESS_951843] in analys es. We will track reported reasons 
for missing data such as loss of study phone, incarceration, withdrawal, etc.  
 
21.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 35 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951844] will also provide participants with information about local resources and 
harm reduction. The study may al so benefit other people in the future by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_701216] a smartphone app can lower overdose risk for people 
who use drugs.  
 
22.0 Risks to Participants  
22.1 Risks:  
● Information participants enter into Thrive4Life Connect can 
be viewed by [CONTACT_701254]. They may monitor discussion boards and post 
information there. Study staff will also reach out to 
participants via private messaging or other contact [CONTACT_41528] 
(texts, phone calls, social media, etc.). Information 
participants enter into Thrive4Life Connect is not stored on 
the phone, but this information is stored on the Thrive4Life 
Connect app.  
● When participants set up their Thrive4Life Connect account, 
they will be asked to create an account username. This 
username [CONTACT_701263] a list of participants that can receive private 
messages. To reduce the ris k of being identified, we will 
require participants to choose a username [CONTACT_701264], 
last name, date of birth, address, etc.  
● Other participants can see what is posted to the discussion 
boards. There is a risk that other participants could identify 
each other based on the information they provide in their 
discussion board posts.  
● Answering questions on sensitive issues (like drug and 
alcohol use, mental health, etc.) in surveys may cause 
anxiety, distress, embarrassment, or feelings of sadness. 
Participants do not have to answer any questions that they do 
not want to.  
● The Thrive4Life Connect app allows participants to share 
their views, opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], photos, and personal experiences. 
However, participants are NOT allowed  to post content on 
the Thrive4Life Connect app that promotes racism, bigotry, 
hatred, nudity, or physical harm of any kind against any 
group or individual. If a participant uses the app in an 
inappropriate or illegal manner, the research staff will delete  
the inappropriate content and follow up with them. If the 
behavior continues, the research staff may withdraw the 
participant from the study.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 36 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  ● There is a risk that study participants may send or receive 
private messages including unwanted or inappropriate 
content. If this happens, we ask that participants report this 
information to the study team (608 -294-7446).  
● Information from the internet and/or Thrive4Life Connect 
discussion boards could be wrong. However, a panel of UW 
staff review all information on the app, so this risk is 
unlikely. We will provide tips to help participants figure out 
whether they can trust  the information they receive from 
these sources.  
● There is a risk that participant information could become 
known to someone not involved in this study. If this happens, 
it could result in damage to reputation, which could also 
affect relationships with family and friends, affect 
employment, or make it harder to get insurance or a job.  
● The study team may discover behavior that raises concern 
about harm to themselves or others. If we see anything that 
suggests that a participant or others face imminent risk of 
harm, we will contact [CONTACT_701255] (e.g., 
your care team an d/or police).  
 
22.[ADDRESS_951845] be able to receive private messages or 
texts from study staff (with survey reminders and weekly 
intervention content feedback) but are not required to respond. 
Participants will be shown how to add a password to their study 
iPhone, and how to disable the function that shows a preview of the 
content received in messages during study enrollment to protect 
privacy.  
 
23.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
Participants  
23.1 The study team (lead researchers [CONTACT_701266] and [CONTACT_571391] and staff including [CONTACT_701267], [CONTACT_701268], 
and [CONTACT_701269]) will be responsible for monitoring the data 
to ensure the safety of participants. We will review all survey data 
collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months for any reports of 
serious events (i.e., death, life -threatening overdose, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_701217] 24 hours or more). Data will be monitored on a monthly 
basis. We will also review any reports of potentially se rious events 
received by [CONTACT_701256]4Life 
Connect app private message function or discussion board on a 
rolling basis. Given the sample size of only 60 participants and 
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 37 of 42 Revised: October 18, [ADDRESS_951846] date that 
the final participant completed their final study procedure (i.e., all 6 
months surveys).  
 
The severity of each event will be classified using the following 
guidelines adapted from the UW -Madison ICTR Trial Template:  
 
Mild (Grade 1)  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate (Grade 2)  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with 
the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some 
interference with functioning.  
Severe (Grade 3)  Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe 
events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  
Life Threatening 
(Grade 4)  The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  
Fatal (Grade 5)  The event caused death.  
 
The relationship of each event to study procedures will be 
classified using the following guidelines adapted from the UW -
Madison ICTR Trial Template:  
Definitely 
Related  Clearly related to the study procedures/intervention and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  
Probably 
Related  Likely related to the study procedures/intervention and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely.  
Possibly 
Related  Possibly related to the study procedures/intervention and there are 
other factors that could be equally likely.  
Unlikely to be 
related  Doubtfully related to the study procedures/intervention and there is 
another likely cause.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: iThrive  WI – A smartphone intervention for overdose and risk and 
COVID -19 among people who use drugs  
 Page 38 of 42 Revised: October 18, 2022  Unrelated  Clearly not related to the study procedures/intervention and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another cause.  
 
The event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previously described in the protocol, the IRB application, or the 
informed consent document.  
 
In consultation with the lead researchers, a trained member of the 
study team will be responsible for conducting an evaluation of 
adverse events or unanticipated problems and shall report these 
issues and evaluation to the reviewing Institutional Review Bo ard 
(IRB) in accordance with the Reportable Event Reporting 
Requirements.  
 
24.0 Economic Burden to Participants  
24.1 There are no costs associated with joining or participating in this 
study.  
 
25.0 Resources Available  
Will the research be conducted outside 
School of Medicine and Public Health 
or UW Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (e.g. the 
researcher does not have an SMPH 
research feasibility attestation for this 
study)?    ☒ YES (complete 25.1)  
☐ NO (remove text below, but retain this 
section)  
 
25.[ADDRESS_951847] completed the appropriate human subjects research trainings. 
Trainings for the study procedures will be completed prior to starting 
recruitme nt and enrollment.   
 
26.0 Multi -Site Research  
26.1 This study will involve multiple sites. Three Vivent  Health locations 
will be included in this study: the Milwaukee, Eau Claire, and 
Appleton Vivent Health locations. To ensure consistency in study 
operations, all Vivent Health sites will use the same procedures to

time of writing IRB review (a Federal Wide Assurance is being 
completed as soon as possible), Vivent Health personnel will not 
engage in any research activities until the Vivent Health sit es have 
been formally approved via a change of protocol and a finalized 
reliance agreement has been executed.

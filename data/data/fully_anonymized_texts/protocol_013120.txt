Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798841] Disease  and Cytokine Release Syndrome  after 
Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
 
1.1.1 Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
 
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is  a cornerstone of therapy for 
hematologic malignancies, often constituting the only curative intent treatment 
available. HLA -matched sibling donors have historically offered the best clinical 
results , but are unavailable for the majority of patients . HLA -matched unrelated 
donors (MUD)  are traditionally considered second line, but availability is limited, 
especially for ethnic minorities1,2. In contrast, the majority of patients have readily 
available related haploidentical donors.   Therefore, haploidentical HCT (haplo-
HCT) offers a crucial alternative to traditional HLA -matched HCT. Several studies 
have shown that haplo -HCT patients have outcomes equivalent to those of HLA -
matched unrelated donor transplantations3,4. Recent advances utilizing post -
transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) have allowed for selective depletion of post- transplantation alloreactive T cells while maintaining the graft-versus-
leukemia effect and acceptable rates of graft -versus- host disease ( GVHD) among 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306792]- HCT
5–10. Furthermore, haplo- HCT are less costly and faster 
compared with matched unrelated donor transplants.  B oth donor bone marrow and 
peripheral blood are viable sources for haplo- HCT grafts. Peripheral blood stem 
cells as a donor option provide larger donor T cell doses, which has been associated with lower relapse rates but may bring added toxicities , including higher incidence 
of GVHD and cytokine release syndrome
3,5,10 –12.  At our institution, rates of GVHD  
and engraftment failure after haplo -HCT were similar between patients who 
underwent myeloablative conditioning and reduced intensity conditioning13.  
Donor source may have a significant effect on rate of primary graft failure.  In a large retrospective analysis performed by [CONTACT_603295], patients receiving haplo- HCT from parent 
donors had a sig nificantly higher rate of graft failure compared with either sibling 
or offspring donor sources (14% vs. 6 and 7% respectively, p=0.02)
12. 
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_798842] Disease  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Background 
 Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) cures leukemia by [CONTACT_603296] T cells from the bone marrow allograft that exert an anti -leukemic effect called the Graft -versus-
Leukemia ( GVL ) effect
14.  The International Bone Marrow Transplant 
Registry (IBMTR) analyzed data from 2,254 patients who underwent HLA -
identical sibling BMT for leukemia (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia [CML] in chronic phase, AML and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia [ALL] in first 
Version 06/01/23   Page 8 of 81 remission ).  After adjusting for other variables that affect relapse, they 
showed that there was a statistically significant reduction in the relapse 
risk for patients who developed GVHD , especially chronic GVHD14. 
Thus, with traditional transplantation approaches, the GVL  and GVHD 
effects are coupled.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_603262], the negative imp act of acute GVHD on morbidity and mortality after 
allogeneic transplant is significant. According to a recent study by [CONTACT_603297]
[ADDRESS_798843] an increased 
risk of treatment related mortality (HR 2.51 (95% CI 2.18 – 2.89)), and 
lower overall survival (HR 1.71 (95% CI 1.55 – 1.89)) based on a time 
dependent multivariate analysis. Our own institutional incidence of acute GVHD after allo -HSCT is similar to that reported by [CONTACT_603298]. 
Clinically significant acute GVHD occurred in 52–66% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_603263] 
17–21% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. This is similar to incid ence in our haplo- HCT 
patients: clinically significant acute GVHD  occurred in 40 -50% of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_603264] 10- 15% of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Acute GVHD remains a significant problem in our patients; thus, 
finding a means to harness the GVL  effect while reducing or 
eliminating GVHD  is a major goal in designing novel transplant trials.  
 Both donor bone marrow and peripheral blood are commonly used graft sources in haplo- HCT.  Peripheral blood grafts contain much higher T -cell 
doses compared with bone marrow grafts, which affects toxicities and 
patterns of failure.  The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research  group published their experience after 681 haplo-
HCTs – 481 bone marrow and 190 peripheral blood, showing s imilar overall 
survival between donor sources
16.  Consistent with other donor types, rates 
of acute GVHD were significantly lower with bone marrow vs. peripheral 
blood grafts (25% vs. 42%, p < 0.001) and for severe grade III -IV acute 
GVHD, trended towards lower rates (7% vs. 10%, p=0.30).  The rates of chronic GVHD  were also lower with bone marrow grafts (20% vs. 41%, p 
= 0.001).  Conversely , the 2- year rate of relapse/progression was higher 
with bone marrow grafts  (45% vs. 28%, p < 0.001).  This finding again 
highlights the role of T -cells in both GVHD  and GVL , and the challenge 
inherent in reducing GVHD  without compromising GVL .   
 
Both GVL  and GVHD are largely driven through T -cell activity, and both 
phenomena can be abrogated through T -cell depleted  transplantation17. 
Published data and our preclinical data (see S ection 1.1.4) demonstrate that 
the IFN γ and IL -6 cytokine pathways and downstream JAK1 and JAK2 
signaling  are central to this process.  Acute GVHD remains a significant 
problem in our study population; thus, finding a means to harness the GVL  
Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798844] while reducing or eliminating GVHD  is a major goal in designing 
novel transplant trials.  We anticipate that modulation of these pathways 
in the peri -transplant period provides an opportunity to decouple GVL  
and GVHD  effects (see Sections 1 .1.5 and 1.1.6).  
 
Peripheral blood grafts have the additional advantage of ease and lower cost of collection of donor stem cells.  JAK1 inhibition may reduce the rate of GVHD after peripheral blood haplo- HCT to rates similar to bone marrow 
grafts, which at a minimum would expand access to haplo- HCT.  Ideally, 
we would achieve a reduction in GVHD while retaining lower relapse rates, 
leading to better overall survival in patients undergoing haplo- HCT.  
 In the trial described here we will begin to examine the safety and effectiveness of itacitinib treatment administered with haplo -HCT as 
GVHD prophylaxis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarkers for Acute GVHD 
  Currently, the gold standard for diagnosis of GVHD is biopsy of affected 
tissue.  A number of efforts have been made to establish biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of acute GVHD.  A serum biomarker panel would 
represent a safe and noninvasive tool to establish this vital diagnosis.  Predictiv e information could be used to determine which patients need more 
intensive therapy than steroids alone.  One example of these efforts is the  
Ann Arbor GVHD  score, which has been used as a predictor of steroid 
responsiveness in acute GVHD.  It involves  the measurement of 
concentrations of TNFR1, ST2, and REG3- alpha at the time of GVHD  
diagnosis , and a higher score was associated with steroid refractoriness and 
poor outcome
18.  These panels have not been validated in the haplo- HCT 
setting.   
 
1.1.3 Cytokine Release Syndrome  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Background  
 The cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been described as fevers, vascular leak, hypotension, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_603265]
19–21. CRS is characterized by 
[CONTACT_603299], including IL -6, interferon- γ, IL -2, 
and high peaks of C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin that result from 
robust activation of the  immune system. This syndrome was described after 
monoclonal antibody therapy and is now recognized as a common toxicity after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, dual -affinity re -targeting 
antibody (DART), and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
19,22 –30.  We published the 
first description of CRS after haplo -HCT in 201631, recently confirmed by 
a second report from another institution (Raj, Chhabra et al, BBMT, 
Version 06/01/23   Page 10 of 81 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.04.010 ).  
 
Neurotoxicity is a common and highly morbid clinical feature of CRS that 
has been described in numerous settings28,29,32,33.   Transient 
cardiomyopathy, likely similar to cardiomyopathy of sepsis or stress -
cardiomyopathy, has also been described in this highly inflammatory 
setting19,34.  This study will use ASTCT criteria to  grade CRS (Appendix 7). 
  Given the central role of IL -6 in the pathophysiology of CRS (see references 
and S ections 1.1.4 and 1.1.5), anti –IL-6 and anti –IL-[ADDRESS_798845]  (see Sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6).  
 In the trial described here we will begin to examine the safety an d 
effectiveness of itacitinib treatment administered with haplo -HCT as CRS 
prophylaxis. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcomes Worse in Haplo- HCT Patients who Experience Severe 
CRS  
 We previously described the occurrence of severe CRS after haplo -HCT 
and its association with poor clinical outcomes, including increased transplant related mortality, inferior overall survival, and delayed engraftment
31.  Of the [ADDRESS_798846] at our 
institution, 91% have suffered CRS, and 16% have suffered severe CRS. Severe CRS was associated with significant reduction in overall survival (median 7.5 months vs. not yet reached, p < 0.0001) and increased transplant related mortality at 100 days and one year (7.8% vs. 20.8%, 11.9% vs. 30.7%, p <0.015). Two  groups have since published comparable 
rates of CRS after peripheral blood haplo- HCT, as well as poor clinical 
outcomes for patients sufferin g from severe CRS
36,37.  In [ADDRESS_798847], Mariotti et al found an 18% 
incidence of severe CRS associated with worse 1y -NRM compared with 
CRS <3: 78% (95% CI: 6 -98) vs 20% (95% CI: 8- 37) (p=0.002).  Yasser et 
al found a 29% incidence grade [ADDRESS_798848] from CRS.  Therefore, a prop hylactic approach 
using a JAK inhibitor may be effective in improving long- term  
outcomes for these patients by [CONTACT_603300].    
 
Version 06/01/23   Page 11 of 81 [IP_ADDRESS] Engraftment Failure is High in Patients with DSAs and Severe  CRS 
  
In our patients undergoing haplo- HCT, our overall rate of delayed 
neutrophil engraftment at day 28 was 10%13,31, with a higher rate in patients 
with donor specific antiboodies  (DSAs ).  .  We also found a higher rate of 
delayed engraftment in patients suffering from severe CRS vs. mild and no CRS , with a hazard rate of engraftment three times higher in patients with 
mild or no CRS (p = 0.0003, Figures 1 and 2)
38.  While there are concerns 
of engraftment delay with a JAK inhibitor, reduction in CRS may in 
fact lead to similar or improved engraftment.   Critically  important, we 
have built in a safety lead in phase to this  study to provide a rescue product 
for patients in cases of engraftment failure (see Section 5.2).  Furthermore, 
engraftment rate is a primary safety endpoint and we will perform 
continuous monitoring with predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], ensuring that safety is assessed after every event (see Section 15).

1.1.[ADDRESS_798849] is associated with a lower rate of relapse, but it’s 
complicated by [CONTACT_603303], with a net neutral effect on survival16,31.  
In our institutional analysis, the incidence of moderate (grades II to IV) and severe 
(grades III to IV) acute GVHD (aGVHD) was not significantly elevated in patients 
with severe CRS compared with the rest of the cohort31.  Similarly, there was no 
difference in chronic GVHD.  However these analyses were limi ted by [CONTACT_603304].   The incidence of grade II to IV a GVHD in 
patients with severe CRS vs. the rest of the cohort was 22% vs. 33% (P = .71).  The incidence of grade III to IV GVHD in patients with severe CRS vs. the rest of the 
cohort was 11% versus 13% (P = 0.99).  In patients surviving to D ay 80, there was 
no statistically significant difference in chronic GVHD between patients with 

Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798850] of the cohort (17% versus 51%, P = .20).  Incidences of 
GVHD  and C RS in peripheral blood replete haplo transplants are high , and 
both independently contribute to morbidity and mortality .

preserving T- cell cytotoxic anti leukemia effects.     
 
[IP_ADDRESS] JAK1/[ADDRESS_798853] generated an in vitro model of CRS that uses cytotoxic activated T-cells, macrophage linage cells, and activat ing beads.  The combination of 
these reagents led to increased levels of IFN
γ and IL -6, similar to CRS.  The 
addition of Ruxolitinib led to a 50% decrease in both IFN γ and IL -6 levels 
(Unpublished).  This supports our hypothesis that Jak1/2 inhibition coul d 
be used to blunt the pathologic increases in IL -6 levels seen in haplo 
transplant.

Recently published institutional research demonstrates that 
IFNγR/IL6R or downstream JAK1/JAK2 are optimal targets to prevent GVHD  and to reverse ongoing GVHD  while preserving or 
enhancing both GVL  effects and mu lti-lineage hematopoietic 
reconstitution after MHC -mismatched allo -HSCT
45.  Mice transplanted 
with MHC -mismatched T cells genetically deficient in interferon gamma 
receptor (I FNγR -/-) have decreased aGVHD and improved survival (Figure 
3).  Furthermore, IL -6 inhibition combined with IFN γR-/- leads to complete 
prevention of a GVHD  (Figure 4).  Consistent with this, we saw higher 
hematopoietic cell counts in the combined blockade group (Figure 5).   Finally, the addition of JAK inhibition with mismatched T -cell 
transplantation led to increase tumor cell death compared with transplan tation without JAK inhibition.  
 
1.1.6 Clinical Data   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] IL-[ADDRESS_798856] of care for the treatment of CRS in multiple settings.  It is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_603267].  This agent is now 
being explored for prevention of both CRS and GVHD.  Kennedy et al performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] 1/2 study using single dose tocilizumab on D ay -1 
before sibling or unrelated fully matched T -cell replete stem cell 
transplantation for GVHD  prophylaxis
35.  They treated 48 patients with 
tocilizumab and compared them with 54 consecutive control patients, finding no difference in TRM, infections, or engraftment.  In the treatment group, they found lower than expected rates of acute GVHD (12%).  
Because JAK [ADDRESS_798857] downstream of the IL -6R, it is 
biologically plausible that these agents would be as or more effective that tocilizumab or siltuximab (a monoclonal antibody against IL -6R) 
at preventing CRS and GVHD . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] JAK Inhibitors for GVHD prophylaxis  
 Morozova et al used post -transplant cyclophosphamide and r uxolitinib, a 
JAK inhibitor, for GVHD prophylaxis after hematopoietic cell 
transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis
46.  Their prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_603268] 13 patients to date, with nine 10/10 MUDs, one 9/10 MUD, and two haploidentical donors.  They used a r uxolitinib dose of 45 
mg/day on D ays -7 to -2 and then 15 mg/day on D ays 5  to 100.  The regimen 
was safe wit h acceptable toxicities.  Engraftment was attained in all patients, 
although two required additional stem cell infusion.  Notably, the r uxolitinib 
Version 06/01/23   Page 15 of 81 dose was reduced to 10 mg/day in all but two patients secondary to poor 
graft function. However, they had enc ouraging rates of acute GVHD: two 
patients developed grade III a GVHD and one developed grade II a GVHD .  
Four patients developed c GVHD, and all but one were successfully treated 
with cyclosporine A without steroids.       
 
1.2 Investigational Agent:  Itacitinib  (INCB039110, Incyte Corporation )  
 
Itacitinib adipate is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein 
TYKs with selectivity for JAK1.  Itacitinib is an investigational product that is proposed for development for treatment of MPNs, including MF; inflammatory diseases, including 
RA and psoriasis; GVHD; solid tumors; and B -cell malignancies.  Janus kinases play an 
important role in signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor binding to their receptors.  Aberrant production of cytokines and growth factors has been associated with MPNs and a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, and JAK1 has been shown to cooperate with other JAKs to mediate the signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines.  Therefore, JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states.  
 In this trial we hope to extend to patients the observation from our mouse model that itacitinib treatment with haplo- HCT will reduce the incidence of both grade III -IV acute 
GVHD and severe CRS , while preserving or improving GVL  effect and engraftment .  
Itacitinib  (see Section 7.1)  is under active evaluation for treatment of GVHD.  Furthermore, 
itacitinib is currently being evaluated for GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing 
matched related or matched unrelated peripheral blood hematopoietic  cell transplantation 
(GRAVITAS -119, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  As a JAK1 selective inhibitor, it may be effective at 
preventing both GVHD and CRS without increasing inc idence of engraftment failure.  
 
1.2.1 Pharmacology 
 
Itacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 (IC50 = 3.6 nM at 1 mM adenosine triphosphate concentration), with 22- to > 500- fold selectivity over the other JAK family 
members, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.  It does not significantly inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of approximately 60 other kinases.  Itacitinib is also potent (IC50 values of approximately 10 nM to 350 nM) in cytokine -driven cell -based 
assays.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity.  Itacitinib also inhibits the growth of the cytokine- dependent cell line INA -6.  Itacitinib potently inhibits the 
phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of proinflammatory factors induced by [CONTACT_603305], such as IL -[ADDRESS_798858], itacitinib shows less inhibition in 
cell-based assays dependent on JAK2 with IC50 values of approximately 1 μM or 
greater, suggesting that itacitinib is JAK2 sparing in cells.  In in vivo models of JAK dependent malignancy, itacitinib impedes subcutaneous tumor growth of INA -
6 cells expressing WT JAKs when administered by [CONTACT_3365], achieving plasma concentrations well below those necessary to inhibit JAK2.  Oral itacitinib also reduced splenomegaly in a model of JAK2 V617F –driven neoplasia r elevant

1.2.2 Clinical Studies   
 
As of 12/13/2016, 10 Phase 1, 3 Phase 1/2, and 5 Phase 2 clinical studies with 
itacitinib, including studies of itacitinib in combination with chemotherapeutic 
agents, corticosteroids, pembrolizumab (anti –PD-1 monoclonal antibody), and 
investigational PI3Kδ (INCB040093 and INCB050465) and IDO1 (epacadostat) inhibitors, have either been completed or are ongoing.  A total of [ADDRESS_798859] identified was a rapid ly reversible dose -related decrease in neutrophil counts presumably 
caused by [CONTACT_603306]; neutrophil decreases generally resolved within 24 to 48 hours of dose discontinuation.  Other reversible hematologic abnormalities, including decreased re ticulocyte count, were observed after multiple -dose 
administration of higher dose levels at which JAK2 inhibition was noted.  
1.2.3 Clinical Experience With Itacitinib for the Treatment of a GVHD  
 
In a Phase 1 study that assessed the safety and tolerability of itacitinib in 
combination with corticosteroids, 30 a GVHD subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 
treatment cohorts (200 mg cohort, n = 14; 300 mg cohort, n = 16).  One subject was randomized to the [ADDRESS_798860] with 
pre-existing thrombocytopenia who was randomized to the 300 mg cohort.  
Adverse events reported in greater than 20% of all subjects include diarrhea, hypokalemia, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, hypophosphatemia, fatigue, headache, hypomagnesemia, and sepsis.  Thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreases were observed in 24.2% and 20.7% of subjects, respectively, with a higher proportion of these events occurring in the [ADDRESS_798861] -line a GVHD subjects in both 
treatment cohorts was 83.3%; for subjects with SR -aGVHD, the overall Day 28 
ORR was 64.7% (200 mg cohort, 62.5%; 300 mg cohort, 66.7%).  Most responses occurred within the first 14 days of treatment, and responses were durable, with a median DOR of 130 days and 136 days in the 200 mg cohort and 300 mg cohort, respectively.  Complete response rates of 66.7% and 17.6% were reported for first -
line and SR -aGVHD cohorts, respectively.  Pharmacokinetics of itacitinib were 
evaluated using plasma samples collected predose and at [ADDRESS_798862] variability was 
found to be high, PK exposure (Cmax and AUC) was consistent with historical data, 
Version 06/01/23   Page 17 of 81 and a large overlap in steady -state exposure was observed between the 200 mg and 
300 mg cohorts.  The higher incidence of thrombocytopenia and DLT of 
thrombocytopenia in the 300 mg cohort, as well as similarities in PK and efficacy 
between dose groups, led to the identification of the 200 mg dose of itacitinib as the recommended dose for future GVHD studies (Schroder et al 2016).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_798863] may mitigate GVHD and CRS while retaining GVL  and improving 
engraftment .  Both preclinical and clinical data (see Sections 1.1.4 and 1.1.5) suggest that 
inhibitio n of IFN γ and IL -6, directly and using downstream JAK Inhibitors , may be an 
effective strategy to decrease toxicities and improve disease control for patients undergoing haplo- HCT.   Itacitinib , as a specific JAK1 inhibitor, may have less deleterious effect on 
engraftment than less specific JAK inhibitors.  The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_603269] -HCT measured by [CONTACT_603307] I-IV GVHD . 
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_798864] been diagnosed with severe acute GVHD or chronic GVHD up to this 
point.  We therefore propose to further study the safety and efficacy of this 
intervention in an extension study of 20 patients.  In addition, we will extend the treatment period from 100 days to 180 days to allow tacrolimus  tapering to occur 
before itacitanib tapering. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], several patients had mild acute GVHD during the taper period which responded to resumption of higher dose of itacitanib.  Furth ermore, during the treatment period we observed neutropenia and/or 
thrombocytopenia which responded to growth factor support.  We have therefore 
amended the study to mandate that patients for whom  itacitanib is held for 
cytopenias receive growth factors to  continue until count recover y and resumption 
of itacitanib or toxicity.  
 During the study, time to engraftment has been encouraging.  Therefore, the original exclusion of patients with myelofibrosis and those whose donors fail to collect the target number  of CD34+ cells, may be unnecessary.  To examine the 
safety in these populations, we have amended the expansion phase to include: 1) 
Five patients with myelofibrosis, and 2) Three patients whose donors fail to collect the target number of CD34+ cells and t he treating physician choses to move forward 
with the haplo- HCT.  
 This extension study will provide more experience using itacitanib in this context  
and form the basis for a large, placebo -control led, multicenter trial evaluating 
itacitanib for prevention of GVHD and cytokine release syndrome after haplo -HCT.

 5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Overall Treatment Plan  
 
For subjects enrolled in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116], (prior to Amendment 3), we will administer 
itacitinib 200 mg/day from Day -3 to Day 100, followed by a taper as defined in Section 
6.4.1.  For subjects enrolled in the Expansion Phase ( Amendment 3 and later), w e will 
administer itacitinib 200 mg/day from Day - 3 to Day 180, followed by a taper as 
defined in S ection 6.4.1.  In cases of engraftment failure or severe infection, itacitinib  will 
be dose modified (see S ection 6.4).  Itacitinib  can be discontinued by [CONTACT_603308].  
 Safety Lead -In Phase (Three Patients): To address concerns of engraftment failure using 
itacitinib throughout the transplant period, for the first three patients we will conse nt the 
donor for a second CD34+ collection to use as a rescue in the case of engraftment  failure  
and for collection of a research blood specimen prior to mobilization (refer to Section 10.1.3) .  If by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_798878]  will undergo CD34+ selection per 
institut ional standards and infused as soon as possible .  After the first three patients are 
transplanted with an adequate CD34+ dosed product , further  enrollment will be held until 
two of the three have achieved engraftment . 
 5.[ADDRESS_798879] dose of itacitinib (Day -3) until 
Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798880] one dose of itacitinib are evaluable for the engraftment  endpoint. 
 
5.3 Replacement of Ineligible Patients  
 
Should a patient be enrolled and subsequently be unable to start treatment with itacitinib  
on Day -3 as per protocol (due to declining performance status, unacceptable lab results, 
or other reason), the patient  will be removed from the study and will be replaced.   Should 
a patient be enrolled and subsequently be unable to undergo stem cell transplant  protocol 
(due to declining performance status, unacceptable lab results, or other reason) , the patient 
will be re moved from the study and will be replaced.  Should a patient be enrolled and 
subsequently not receiv e goal cell infusion  (at least 5 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_293641] )), the patient will be removed from the study and will be replaced.  Amendment #5 
adds three slots for patients who do not receiv e goal cell infusion who will remain on the 
study drug.  Such subjects that receive study drug will be evaluable for treatment related toxicity and monitored for 30 days after study drug exposure but will not be evaluable for the safety endpoints of engraftment and GVHD.  
 
6.0 ADMINISTRATION OF PROTOCOL TREATMENT  
 
6.1 Conditioning Regimens for Transplant  
 
Although including myeloablative (MA)  and reduced -intensity conditioning (RIC) 
regimens may result in added variability, retrospective studies comparing MA and RIC in 
AML/MDS show similar outcomes of survival, treatment related mortality and GVHD
48,49.  
Both types of regimens are being allowed  in this protocol to tailor conditioning at the 
discretion of the treating physician  and to enhance patient enrollment.  Historically about 
50% of our transplants for AML and MDS are performed using RIC. 
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_603272] , 
which will be administered at the discretion of the treating physician : 
 
• Fludarabine + Cy clophosphamide + TBI  
• Fludarabine + Fractionated TBI  
• Fludarabine + Busulfan 2 
• Fludarabine + Busulfan 4 
 
Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798881]- transplant cyclophosphamide will be administered a t a dose of 50 mg/kg on D ays 3 
and 4. 
 
Tacrolimus will be administered  orally at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg  or intravenously at a dose 
of 0.03 mg/kg or an initial flat dose of 1mg/day  beginning on Day 5 and continue  for a 
minimum of 100 days prior to tapering.  T acrolimus should be titrated to maintain a 
suggested level of 5-15 ng/mL per institutional guidelines.  
 Mycophenolate mofetil will be administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/kg TID (based upon 
actual body weight) with the maximum total daily dose not  to ex ceed 3 grams (1g TID, IV 
or PO) beginning on Day 5 and continuing  until Day 35  then managed per institutional 
guidelines. 
 
6.3 Stem Cell Tr ansplantation (Day 0)  
 
On D ay [ADDRESS_798882] institutional practice .  In the event that 
less than 5.0 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg are infused, the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_603273] .  If study drug has already been administered, it will be discontinued and the 
patient will be followed for toxicity endpoints but not engraftment and GVHD.  This is to ensure consistency in the donor product cell count as this may independently affect incid ence of engraftment and GVHD. Amendment # 5 adds three slots for patients who do 
not receiv e goal cell infusion  who will remain on the study drug.   
 
6.4 Itacitinib   
 6.4.1 Administration  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (enrolled prior to Amendment 3)  
 Itacitinib will be administered PO at a starting dose of 200 mg QD (2 × 100 mg tablets) from Day -3 to Day 100.   
 
- After Day 100, for patients at a dose of 200 mg daily , reduce i tacitinib to 100 
mg daily for one month, then every other day for one month, then discontinue.   
 OR 
 
Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798883] to food.

Itacitinib will be administered PO at a starting dose of 200 mg QD (2 × 100 mg 
tablets) from Day -[ADDRESS_798884] to food. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Taper Period , Further Guidance  
 
Tapering of other immunosuppressive agents – such a tacrolimus or 
mycophenolate mophetil – should be avoided during the itacitinib taper if possible.  If patients develop new GVHD, or worsening of existing GVHD during itacitinib taper period, then itacitinib should be increased one dose level and taper discussed with principal investigator.  The taper may be done more slowly or in the presence of an adjunct immunosuppressive agent. 
 6.4.[ADDRESS_798885] the PI [INVESTIGATOR_603274] 06/01/[ADDRESS_798886] their dose reduced to 100 mg QD.  Subjects who are unable to tolerate itacitinib at a dose of 100 mg QD s hould be withdrawn from study treatment.

7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Itacit inib 
 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action/Classification  
 Itacitinib adipate (INCB039110 adipate), referred to herein as itacitinib, is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases (TYKs) with selectivity for JAK1. Itacitinib is an investigational product that is proposed for development for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms 
(MPNs), including myelofibrosis (MF); inflammatory diseases, including 
Version 06/01/23   Page 31 of 81 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis; graft-versus- host disease ( GVHD ); solid 
tumors; and B -cell maligna ncies. Janus kinases play an important role in signal 
transduction following cytokine and growth factor binding to their receptors. 
Aberrant production of cytokines and growth factors has been associated with MPNs and a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, and JAK1 has been shown to cooperate with other JAKs to mediate the signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states.  
 
7.1.2 Pharmacodynamics/kinetics  
 
Itacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 
3.6 nM at 1 mM  adenosine triphosphate concentration), with 22 - to > 500-fold 
selectivity over the other JAK  family  members, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. It does 
not significantly inhibit (< 30 % inhibition) a  broad panel of approximately 60 other 
kinases. Itacitinib is also potent (IC50 values of  approximately 10 nM to 350 nM) 
in cytokine -driven cell -based assays. This effect is not due to  general cytotoxicity. 
Itacitinib also inhibits the growth of the cytokine -dependent cell line INA-6. 
Itacitinib potently inhibits the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of  
transcription (STAT) proteins and the production of proinflammatory factors induced by [CONTACT_603309], such as interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_798892], itacitinib shows less inhibition in 
cell-based assays dependent on JAK2 with IC50 values of approximately 1 μM or 
greater, suggesting that itacitinib is JAK2 -sparing in  cells . In in vivo models of 
JAK- dependent malignancy, itacitinib impedes subcutaneous tumor  growth of 
INA-6 cells expressing wild -type (WT) JAKs when  administered by [CONTACT_158126], achieving plasma concentrations well below those necessary to inhibit JAK2 . Oral  itacitinib also reduced splenomegaly in a model of JAK2 V617F-driven 
neoplasia relevant to MF.  
 
7.1.3 Formulations 
 Itacitinib may be formulated as 25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg (free base equivalent) SR  tablets. These tablets contain the active ingredient, hypromellose, 
microcrystalline cellulose,  lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate, and may 
be coated with a nonfunctional coating.  Itacitinib may also be formulated as 100 mg or 300 mg (free bas e equivalent) IR 
tablets. These tablets contain the active ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate,  pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium starch 
glycolate, and magnesium stearate.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_798893] 
Version 06/01/23   Page 32 of 81 labels will be in the local language and will comply with the legal requirements of 
each country.  
 
7.1.5 Storage  
 
Itacitinib should be stored at ambient conditions (15°C to 30°C, or 59°F to 86°F) as per the IB.  
 
7.1.6 Administration  
 
Itacitinib will be administered PO at a starting dose of 200 mg QD (2 × 100 mg 
tablets).  Itacitinib may be taken without regard to food. It should be taken at the same time every day .  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_798894] be instructed in the handling of itacitinib as follows:   
• To store the bottles at room temperature, in a safe place and  out of the reach 
of children.  
• To only remove the number of tablets needed at the time of administration. 
• Not to remove tablets in advance of the next scheduled administration.  
• To make every effort to take doses on schedule.  
• To report any missed doses.  
• To take tablets with a glass of water.   
• Not to take another dose if vomiting occurs after taking study medication.  
• To bring all used and unused bottles of study medication to the site at each visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and B aseline C haracteristics  
 
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics including gender, age, performance status, FAB/WHO AML subtype, and cytogenetic abnormalities.  For continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables the number and percentage of patients in each category will be summarized.  
 
15.5.2 Primary Endpoint Analysis 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety monitoring rule for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 
 
A continuous bivariate Bayesian monitoring rule will be used to ensure that the rate of engraftment is sufficiently high and t he rate of acute GVHD 
grades III -IV is acceptably low.   The rates of engraftment and acute GVHD 
grades III-IV will be monitored simultaneously after each patient
50–52.  
Version 06/01/23   Page 55 of 81 Historical data on 200 patients at this institution indicates that 90% of 
patients are expected to have engraftment and 13% to experience acute GVHD grades III -IV. The minimum acceptable rate of engraftment is 80%, 
a decrease of 10%, and the maximum allowable rate of acute GVHD grades III-IV is 18%, an increase of 5%. The occurrence of engraftment and acute 
GVHD grades III-IV are considered to be independent. The probabilities of 
engra ftment and acute GVHD grades III -IV for the historical data are 
modeled by [CONTACT_525298] (beta (90, 10) and beta  (13, 87), respectively).  
The prior probabilities of engra ftment  and toxicity for the experimental 
regimen are also m odeled by [CONTACT_525298] (beta (1.8, 0.2) and beta 
(0.26, 1.74), respectively). The posterior probability that the study treatment is more toxic that the standard treatment at this institution is . 80. Patients 
experiencing either primary or secondary g raft failure will be counted as 
engraftment failure to wards stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. Decision criteria are described

15.5.3 Final  analysis of primary endpoint 
 
The cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 aGVHD at d ay 10 0 and its 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated using  Fine-Gray ’s sub -distribution model 
(treating death as competing risks).   
15.5.4 Secondary  Endpoint Analysis  
 
Incidence of adverse events will be documented as proportions with 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals patient, type and grade. A continuous toxicity monitoring rule will be used  to assess treatment  related mortality a t day 1 80

estimate the cumulative incidence of treatment- related mortality at d+30 (death and 
relapse as competing risks), relapse at 1 year (death as competing risk), and the 1 year cumulative incidence of infection, acute GVHD grades 2 -4, acute GVHD  
grades 3 -4 and chronic GVHD  at 1 year. The start time for chronic GVHD 
incidence will be day +80. Proportional hazards models will be used to estimate 1 year rates of death of any cause (overall survival), relapse free survival and GVHD  
+ relapse free survival (GRFS ). We acknowledge that the sample size of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_603285].

Version 06/01/23   Page 77 of 81 APPENDIX 9: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribu tion (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse event for which there is a reason able possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caus ed death. 
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event  
Version 06/01/[ADDRESS_798941] 
normal life functions 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate med ical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Defini tion: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materi als, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study. 
 A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

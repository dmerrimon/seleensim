(Neomedic)  compared to the widely utilized Capio™ Slim ([LOCATION_011] Scientific) 
device .  We will  enroll 60 patients who are planned to undergo sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724357].  The patients will be 
randomized into two study groups; one will have sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724358]™ Slim device and the other with the Anchorsure® device.  The 
patient’s pain will be recorded via numerical rating scales (NRS), a validated pain 
evaluation tool.  The study is powered to detect a 2 .5 point d ifference  in pain 
between the two groups, a value that has been shown in studies to be clinically 
significant to patients.   Secondary outcomes of surgeon satisfaction and 
efficiency with the devices  will be assessed via surgeon questionnaires.   The 
demonstration of a significant decrease in postoperative buttock or thigh pain, 
improved surgeon efficiency, or decreased operative time with the use of the 
Anchorsure device will demonstrate an advantage of the suture anchoring 
devices over suture c apture devices and will fuel the need for a larger efficacy 
study for the Anchorsure device.  Demonstration of improved safety and/or 
improved surgical outcomes could ultimately change the standard in

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Pelvic organ prolapse  (POP) describes the loss of anatomic support  of the 
vagina where women present with a vaginal bulge with or without associated 
bladder, bowel or sexual complaints.   The lifetime risk of undergoing surgery f or 
female pelvic organ prolapse is esti mated at 19%.[ADDRESS_989058] pra ctice is to use  a self-capturing suture delivery systems  
like the Capio™ Slim Suture Capturing Device .  This procedure is associated 
with a significant risk  of postoperative buttock and posterior thigh pain.2,3  
Such p ain can arise from entrapment of the pudendal or sciatic nerves given their 
close anatomic proximity to the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724360] n (Figure 1) 
or from entrapment of the levator ani nerve that runs along the surface of the

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_264035], MD       Version # 3                    Page 3/20 coccygeus muscle .4 Immediate postoperative buttock and p osterior thigh pain 
with the Capio™  device has been  reported in 55-84% of patients with persist ent 
pain at 6 weeks postoperatively in 15-16%.4,[ADDRESS_989059] been s tudied and utilized domestically and internationally  for 
mesh -based prolapse repair kits .  However , there is currently little evidence 
about the rates of postoperative buttock and posterior thigh  pain from anchor -
based fixati on to the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724361].  
The Anchorsure®  (Figure 2 and Figure 3) is a new FDA -approved sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724362] a permanent anchor directly into the 
ligament and requires high pull -out force for extraction. The device is a Class II 
surgical device that was FDA approved via a 510(k) premarket no tification in 
2012.  Its approval was based on the FDA approved device Surelift ® 
(Neomedic).  Surelift ® uses the same anchoring system as Anchorsure but is 
attached to vaginal mesh as oppose d to Anchorsure which is designed to attach 
to suture material.  Surelift® is used widely  and has been studied in abstracts5-[ADDRESS_989060] additionally been published indicating safety and efficacy 
of use.11,12  A summary of the available data for the Capio Slim™, Surelift®, and 
Anchorsure® devices is listed in Appendix  1. 
The primary aim  of this study is to conduct a prospective randomized trial of this 
new anchor -based system versus our current suture -capture -based fixation 
systems to compare  the rate s of postoperative buttock and posterior thigh pain . 
This is important because d ecreased buttock and posterior thigh pain can reduce 
patient sufferi ng and potentially reduce postop narcotic use.  Our secondary 
aims  are to compare intraoperative complications , general postoperative pelvic 
pain and post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724363] . The demonstration of a significant decrease in 
postoperative buttock or thigh pain, improved surgeon efficiency, or decreased 
operative time with the use of the Anchorsure device will demonstrate an 
advantage of the suture anchoring devices over suture cap ture devices and will 
fuel the need for a larger efficacy study for the Anchorsure device.  
Demonstration of improved safety and/or improved surgical outcomes could 
ultimately change the standard in sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724364].

STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
Hypothesis  1: Anchorsure® System  will reduce postoperative buttock and 
posterior thigh pain at 1 day, 1 week, and 6 weeks following sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724365] 1:  
To conduct a prospective, randomized , single -blind  trial of  sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724366]® system  versus the 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_724367] ≥ Stage II p elvic organ prolapse who are 
undergoing native tissue vaginal repair.   The primary outcome  will be the level 
of postoperati ve pain using a 10 -point numerical rating scale (NRS)  on 
postoperative day 1, week 1 , and 6 weeks postoperatively  for pain that is 
localized to the posterior thigh or buttocks on the side(s) that the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724368].   The difference in mean pain ratings will be at least 2.5 
on the 10 -point NRS .   
 
Hypothesis 2: Surgeon satisfaction, surgical efficiency , intraoperative 
complications , objective surgical success, symptomatic success, opi[INVESTIGATOR_724369], and 
overall postoperative pelvic pain  will be similar for both devices.

RANDOMIZATION AND MASKING  
A computer -generated r andom allocation  using a random ly permutated  block 
design (10-patients per block) will be utilized . Randomization will be performed at 
the start of the study with study group assignments placed in sealed non -
transparent envelopes.  The envelopes will be numbered in order.  The next 
envelope in numerical order will be brought to the operating ro om where it will be 
opened by a participating surgeon and another operating room staff member.  
Both personnel will sign the envelope to validate that proper envelope opening 
and interpretation were performed.  The envelopes will then be collected for 
record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  This procedure will help to minimize surgeon bias  as it is 
impossible for surgeons to be masked to the randomization .  Participants and 
research staff will be masked during the study as much as possible,  however 
there will be a description of the type of sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724378] . Intraoperative data, including any adverse event that may 
unmask the study coordinators, will be reporte d by [CONTACT_724407] .

colporrhaphy  (plication of fibromuscular vaginal tissue) , enterocele repairs, 
transvaginal hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy, perineoplasty, 
midurethral sling procedures , or other procedures not involving the pelvis, anus, 
buttock, or lower extremities may be performed.  Prolapse procedures will be 
recorded but not controlled by [CONTACT_18113]. Participating surgeons are all 
extensively experienced in sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11592].  Any use of allograft, 
xenograft, or synthetic graft material  for POP repair  will not be permitted .  
 
Access to the retroperitoneal space will be accomplished either via a 
circumferential pericervical , an anterior, or a posterior . The method of surgical 
approach will be recorded.  Sharp and blunt dissection will be performed to gain 
access to the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11599] (s). Surgeon discretion will determine if 
unilateral or bilateral fixation is performed for vaginal vault suspension but only 
unilateral sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724381] . 
Surgeon discretion will determine the type and number of sutures or anchors to 
be placed through the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724382].  All 
sutures and anchors placed into the sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11599] w ill be placed at  least 
2cm medial to the ischial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . Suture(s) will be placed through any anchors 
with the choice of suture to be determined by [CONTACT_724408].  The suture (s) placed through anchors o r

POWER CALCULATION : 
This study is a head to head two sample comparative study . The null hypothesis 
is that the re is no difference in the prevalence of  immediate postoperative new 
buttock or posterior thigh pain with the use of the Anchorsure® System 
compared to the Capio™ Slim device for sac rospi[INVESTIGATOR_11592]. In prior

Anchorsure® System does not lead to  significantly less postoperative buttock 
and posterior thigh pain than does the Capio™ Slim Device in favor of the 
alternate hypothesis that the Anchorsure® System leads to significantly less 
postoperative pain than the Capio™ Slim Device using  a two -sample normal 
approximation test of means  with a  two-sided 5% significance level. Assuming a 
15% loss to follow -up or drop -out rate for the duration of the study, the total 
enrollment goal is 48 patients ( 24 in each group) .  The null hypothesis will be  
declared  rejected  if the mean of immediate postoperative buttock and posterior 
thigh pain with use  of the Anchorsure® device is less from the mean with the use 
of the Capio™ Slim device with a p -value of 0.05 or less .  The power calculations 
and their adjustment from the original study goal of 60 recruited patients (using 
90% power and a standard devia tion of 3) were confirmed with the Wake Forest 
Baptist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724388].

Please note that underlying diseases are not reportable as AEs unless there is 
an increase of severity or frequency during the course of the study  that is directly 
attributable to the surgical intervention .  If an AE has not resolved at the time of 
AE Form completion, the form will be save d as incomplete in REDCap until 
resolved. Once the AE is resolved, the AE form  will be updated , saved as 
complet e, and enter ed into REDCap.  
 
Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event: any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, 
or any untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, 
whether or not related to the operative  procedures  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event: an adverse event that:  
 
  Led to death  
  Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either    
resulted in  
o a life -threatening illness or injury  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
o in-subject or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272563]  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function  
 Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

 Unrelate d: No evidence that the timing o f the AE has a relationship to the 
operative procedures performed.  
 Possibly Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the operative 
procedures performed, however a potential alternative etiology may be 
responsible for the AE.  
 Probably Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the operative 
procedures performed and the causative relationship can clearly be 
established. No potential alternative etiology is apparent.  
 
Relationship of AE to Device :  
 Unrelated: No e vidence that the timing o f the AE has a relationship to the 
device placement .  
 Possibly Related: The AE ha s a timely relations hip to the device 
placement , however a potential alternative etiology may be responsible for 
the AE.  
 Probably Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the device 
placement  performed and the causative relationship can clearly be 
established. No potential alternative etiology is apparent.  
 
 
 
STUDY SUBJECT PROTECTION  
 
Protection of each subject’s personal health information will be a priority in this 
study. One master Excel file containing subject personal information including 
name [CONTACT_114279] a password -protected file, on a 
designated pro tected research drive on a password -protected computer in a 
locked office at the study  institution. In that file, each subject will be assigned a 
subject identification number that will be used for the purposes of data collection 
in order to de -identify su bjects.  
 
All paper forms used for data collection will be kept in a research cabinet 
dedicated to this project, which will be locked at all times, in a locked office at 
Wake Forest Baptist Health . All forms will contain de -identified information  when 
sent to the Data Monitoring Safety Board . Identification numbers will correspond 
to the subjects listed in the master excel file.  
 
All study data will be transferred and managed electronically using REDCap. 
Each subject will be entered into REDCap using the a ssigned identification 
number from the master excel file. REDCap is a secure, web -based application 
designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user -friendly 
web-based case report forms, real -time data entry validation, audit trials, a nd a 
de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical packages. The

Analysis Plan:  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], the analysis will adhere to the principle of intention -to-treat with 
anticipated causes of drop -out including ESRD, death, and loss to follow -up. ESRD and death will be 
treated as end -points and for these, as well as, in the event of loss to follow -up, exposure time will 
include only the time accrued until last contact ( last study visit ).  
Aim 1:  Several (and heterogeneous) adverse safety events will be recorded both individually (e.g. 
hypoglycemia, hypotension, etc .) and collectively (count of all events in a given group) with a summation 
of all events as reported at each study visit. Each participant will likely experience multiple events and 
since follow -up time may vary from individual to individual (if subjects are lost to follow -up prior to the 
final six -months) we will use person -months derived from study visits to calculate an event rate and will 
contrast pooled crude event rates in the two groups (intervention/CCHT vs usual care).  
Aim 2:  Difference in kidney function will be de termined by [CONTACT_149106] (6 months), or last available measure (3 months), from initial (baseline) measurement. 
Kidney function will be calculated from measured serum creatinine at study visit and using the C KD-Epi 
[INVESTIGATOR_149104].  Rate of change in renal function will be calculated as quotient of difference 
in kidney function last to first visit over the time in months between two index visits resulting in 
ml/min/1.73m2 per month change in GFR.  Neg ative values representing loss in kidney function.   We will 
contrast median change in kidney function in the two groups (intervention/CCHT vs usual care).  
Aim 3: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149105] 1.  Pooled e vent rates will be reported 
and contrasted for the two study groups.

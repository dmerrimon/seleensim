Study Title : Physiolog y of GERD and Treatment Response  
 
Objectives  
Primary Aim: To determine in a randomized controlled trial (n=60) whether an expanded, 
compared to a standard, provider  visit can augment the effects of a medication  targeting 
traditional or functional GERD symptoms.  
Secondary Aim s:  
1. To identify physiologi c markers of enhanced therapeutic relationships.  
2. To identify patient and physician behaviors associated with GERD symptom 
improvement.  
Design and Outcomes   
This is a randomized controlled  trial to assess the physiologic and behavioral mechanisms 
associated with augmented medication effects in adult patients with functional GERD -
related symptoms.   
Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two different semi -scripted visit types – 
eithe r a “standard visit” modeled after an empathic, conventional primary care evaluation 
or an “expanded visit” modeled after an integrative medicine consultation. During the 
visit, we will measure heart rate variability (HRV) and galvanic skin response (GSR) in 
the patient -provider dyads; in addition, we will video record the interactions for later 
Version 11.0  8 of 48 analysis of behavioral responses. Subjects will receive a two -month supply of 
amitriptyline  (10 mg/day) or omeprazole (20 mg/day , depending upon the nature of their  
GERD symptoms ), along with instructions for taking it.  Following the visit, subjects will 
complete questions assessing their relationship/rapport with the study provider. Subjects 
will complete a daily GERD symptom diary during the first and eighth weeks of the 
study. At the end of the [ADDRESS_301217] a single visit with a “study provider,” a physician or nurse pract itioner 
who they have never previously met. Subjects will complete a daily symptom diary for 
the 1st and 8th weeks following this visit and return for a second study visit in which they 
will complete questionnaires and be debriefed by a member of  the study  team.  
Sample Size and Population   
We plan to enroll [ADDRESS_301218] visit intervention (1:[ADDRESS_301219] randomization).  We will also enroll approximately 5 -6 physicians 
or nurse practitioners and stratify randomization by [CONTACT_247810] 10-12 subjects ( 5-[ADDRESS_301220] visits).    
1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The patient -provider relationship is central to the art of medicine and affects a range of health 
outcomes. However, the specific benefits, and exact mechanisms, by [CONTACT_247811]. Emerging data suggests that physiologic 
biomarkers such as galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate variability ( HRV) are 
associated with empathy and correlated with the complex verbal and non -verbal behaviors of 
patients and providers during an encounter. Physiologic synchrony in patient -provider dyads 
and supportive non -verbal behaviors may be associated with subse quent health outcomes. This 
study  will test these hypotheses using GERD as a model condition.  
     1.[ADDRESS_301221] symptoms.  
  1.2     Secondary Objective s 
1. To identify the physiologic responses/markers associated with improvement in 
GERD symptom severity in response to an enhanced vs. standard provider visit and 
amitriptyline  or omeprazole . 
2. To determine whether an expanded patient -provider visit modeled after an 
integrative medicine consultation leads to more supportive provider behaviors , an 
enhanced patient -provider interaction , and greater improvements in GERD 
symptom severity compared to a standard provider visit.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The patient -physician relationship is central to the art of medicine1,2. The qual ity of 
this relationship affects a range of health outcomes, from irritable bowel3 and cold 
symptoms4 to blood pressure, pain levels, and diabetes outcomes5–8. However, the 
specific benefits, and exact mechanisms, by [CONTACT_247812]. Previous work has demonstrated that when providers 
maintain eye contact, actively listen, and express empathy, their patients improve more 
after receiving a placebo than patients receiving care from apparently more detached 
providers3,4. Though studies have suggested a role for communication skills and both 
cognitive and emotional components of empathy, the variety of measures used and 
lack of clarity in definitions have limit ed the interpretation of this work5,6,9,10.  
In most conventional medical settings, practice demands have resulted in reduced 
time to focus on rela tional aspects of care. Concomitantly, medical educators and 
professional societies have called for greater emphasis on humanism, patient -centered 
care, and improved patient -provider communication11,12. Indeed, patients are 
frequently stressed/in distress when they visit a physician13. Perceived lack of time 
and anxiety about the visit likely contributes to this stress, one manifestation of which 
is white coat hypertension14. 
The public has become increasingly interested in complementary and integrative 
medicine (IM) healing approaches in which patient -provider dynamics often differ 
substantially from most conventional medical visits15–19. IM providers frequently 
spend more time with patients and ask questions that are quite different from those 
asked during conventional visits. The IM consult ation process may produce enhanced 
placebo effects19. It is unclear whether these effects represent a form of interpersonal 
healing20, an enhanced patient -provider relationship (e.g., increased perceived 
empathy or trust), or simply provide patients with the opportunity to reflect on their 
symptoms in a safe and non -judgmental space (a form of ther apeutic narrative 
medicine21) creating an openness to perceiving symp toms differently and enhancing 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]22. Some patients feel “more heard” by [CONTACT_247813]23. IM providers may make 
patients feel more “at ease” and relaxed, promoting a physiologic response (e.g., 
reduced heart rate and blood pressure) similar to that elicited by [CONTACT_247814]24. Feeling less stressed during a medical visit may create an 
openness to change and improved memory of, and follow -through with, the 
provider’s recommendations25. Yet  there are few studies of these interactions and 
they largely rely upon patient interviews or responses to surveys15–18. 
Gastroes ophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most prevalent health -related 
conditions in the Western world with prevalence estimates ranging from 20 -40%26,27. 
GERD is primarily a clinical diagnosis, characterized by  [CONTACT_247815]. It is associated with decreased health -related quality of life and 
significant healthcare costs and lost productivity28,29. Standard treatment in cludes 
antacids, H2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), with the latter 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301222] functional heartburn symptoms and/or co -
occurring dyspepsia symptoms (e.g., upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, and gas) 
that do not respond well to this class of medication31,32. Moreover, awareness of the 
interconnections between the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems has led to 
the recognition that stress can profoundly affect gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such 
as GERD33, suggesting that interventions targeting these pathways may improve 
symptoms34. Notably, the placebo response rate in trials of GERD medications can be 
as high as 40%35.  
Many individuals with GERD symptoms who do not respond to PPIs have functional 
heartburn which is defined as less than 4% acid exposure on pH manometry and 
esophageal hypersensitivity36,37. These patients respond better to neuromodulators 
such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and other 
agents.   
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant originally  used to treat depressi on but now 
frequently prescribed in low doses to treat functional GERD -related symptoms as 
well as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel, fibromyalgia, and interstitial cystitis as 
well as other pain -related conditions36,38.  
Omeprazole is a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_247788] a first line treatment for patients who initially 
present with GERD symptoms.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
Studies are beginning to reveal the neural 
correlates of empathy, both in general39 and 
in patient -provider relationships40,41. 
Activat ion of specific neural pathways 
drives changes in autonomic nervous 
system regulation42, resulting in 
downstream changes in physiologic 
biomarkers su ch as galvanic skin response 
(GSR) and heart rate variability (HRV)43,44. 
A growing body of research has identified 
concordance in physiologic biomarkers 
between individuals. An excellent review 
of this topic, also known as “interpersonal autonomic physiology” or “physiologic 
synchrony,” has been published45. The authors reviewed [ADDRESS_301223] -client relationship which 
examined either heart rate (HR) or skin conductance/galvanic skin response (GSR). 
Multiple studies found positive correlations between empathy ratings and physiologic 
synchrony. The study I have proposed would be the first to examine physiologic 
biomarkers in the context of physician -patient interactions in a medical setting.  
1. Provider statement 
or behavior2. Patient’s neural 
response
3. Change in autonomic 
activity
4. Patient statement 
or behavior6. Change in autonomic 
activity
5. Provider’s neural 
responseProvider PatientFigure 1: Proposed model for mechanisms 
underlying the patient -provider relationship
Version 11.0  11 of 48 As illustr ated in Figure 1 above, we hypothesize that moment -to-moment autonomic 
changes in patients and providers over the course of a visit collectively influence 
perceptions of the encounter (part of the “neural response”) and response to treatment 
and that impro ved treatment response is associated with increased concordance in these 
autonomic changes.  
GSR and HRV can also be used to assess relative physiologic stress vs. relaxation46. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_247789]24,47,48. While empathic visits may theoretically reduce patients’ allostatic load 
and distress49, this hypothesis has not been studied rigorously. Newer comp utational 
approaches incorporating complexity theory to the analysis of physiologic data50 have 
yielded valuable insights to the study of human disease (e.g., decreased HRV is 
assoc iated with increased cardiovascular mortality51,52) and the effects of integrative 
modalities such as tai chi53,54. There is limited data using these approaches to study 
client -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_247790]55–57. 
Social p sychologists have developed and validated a variety of coding schemes to 
analyze providers’ verbal and non -verbal behaviors and to link these behaviors with 
patient satisfaction, understanding, trust, rapport, empathy, and a variety of related 
factors9,58–63. This ric h literature has yielded many insights and a variety of tools used 
in studies of physician -patient communication, but rarely have these tools been linked 
with physiology or health outcomes7.  
[CONTACT_247843]  recently observed  that an “expanded” provider visit modeled after a visit 
to an IM provider was more effective in decreasing heartburn and dyspepsia 
symptoms in patients with GERD than a “standard” provider visit modeled after an 
empathic conventional medical visit64. This study  used a script of pre -determined 
questions for each visit type. The standard visit script included questions about 
GERD history, symptoms, prior evaluation and treatments, and past medical history. 
The expanded visit script included the same questions plus additional questions that 
inquired about their GI symptoms, non -GI symptoms, and overall temperament. Thus, 
the main differences between the visits were the length of time spent with the subject 
and the additional questions that were as ked. Many of the subjects in this study were 
already taking pharmaceutical medications for GERD, suggesting that symptom 
improvement resulting from the expanded provider visit may enhance the efficacy of 
some medications in providing adequate symptom relie f. We intend to formally test 
this hypothesis, that augmented patient -provider visits can enhance medication -
related benefits, in this current study.   
While some may argue that increasing visit length is impractical in conventional 
healthcare settings, one reason why payers will not adequately reimburse for 
increased visit lengths is the lack of data linking visit length with health outcomes. 
Increased visit length has been associated in clinical practice with reduced number of 
prescriptions an d increased patient satisfaction, engagement, and quality of care65–67. 
Other studies suggest mechanisms by [CONTACT_247816] (verbal & non -
verbal) may affect health outcomes68. Yet we really do not know what makes longer 
visits more effective. By [CONTACT_247817], we will be able to make informed decisions 
Version 11.0  12 of 48 regarding future changes to this intervention and adaptations that may make it more 
feasible in today’s healthcare environment.  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
Study design:  Single -center, single -blind, randomized contro lled trial  
  
Primary outcome :  
1. Change in the average daily GERD symptom severity score from baseline to the last 
week of the study in the expanded vs. standard group. GERD symptom severity is 
based on the sum of scores assessing the severity of daytime heartburn, nighttime 
heartburn, and acid reflux each on a 0 -4 point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, 
very severe ; higher scores signify worse symptoms ). 
 
Secondary outcomes : 
1. Ratio of the sum  of positive correlations over the sum of negative correlations in GSR 
(or HRV) across patient -provider encounters for standard vs. expanded visit types and 
for responders vs. non -responders (those with a 50% or greater improvement in their 
GERD symptom se verity).   
2. Absolute change in GSR (or high frequency HRV signal) in patient recordings from 
the beginning of the study visit to the end of the study visit and correlation with 
subsequent change in GERD symptom severity.   
3. Differences in blinded ratings of 2 minute thin slices of study visit videos from the 
beginning to the end of the study in supportive global impressions (e.g., engagement, 
relaxed, patient seems pleased/satisfied) and non -verbal behaviors (e.g., smiling) 
between standard and expanded visit  types and correlation with subsequent change in 
GERD symptom severity.  
Study population :  
Men and women age 2 4-70 with heartburn symptoms 3 or more days per week  not 
responsive to proton pump inhibitors or with known functional heartburn . We will enroll 
until we reach 60 completing subjects.  
Study location :  
University of [LOCATION_004] Davis Medical Center  
Length of subject participation : 8 weeks  
Length of study enrollment : 2 years  
Groups :  
1) Standard visit (n=30), modeled after an empathic, high quality conventional primary 
care visit.  
2) Expanded visit (n=30), modeled after a visit with an integrative medicine provider  
Randomization:  
Version 11.0  13 of 48 The randomization code will be generated by [CONTACT_247818] 
(section s 4.3 and 9.2 ). The study will be single -blinded (study providers and the research 
team will know what the subject is receiving but the subject will not). Randomization 
will be stratified based on study provider. We anticipate 5 or 6  providers each seeing 10-
12 subjects ( 5-[ADDRESS_301224] visits, 5-6 expanded visits).    
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures   
Patient Recruitment :  
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301226] additional 
information during their appointment or may call the phone number on the flyer. 
Providers may also obtain verbal permission to give their  prospective subjects’  contact 
[CONTACT_10975] a study staff member who can provide furt her details  about the study . 
This information may be shared with study staff in the form of an Epic patient list.  We 
will also recruit using Study Pages and may use similar electronic recruiting platforms . 
 
We will also recruit patients from the UCD Otola ryngology Reflux Clinic using 
procedures similar to those described above.  
 
Patient Screening :  
Potential subjects  will undergo  a telephone  or in person prescreen  by [CONTACT_247821]  (see telephone  script). Potential 
subjects  will be informed that the study  involves  taking amitriptyline  or omeprazole  
(depending upon their diagnosis and treatment plan with their physician) daily for [ADDRESS_301227]  
will be reviewed  as part of the eligibility  assessment.  A standardized form  (see attached)  
will be  used to ascertain  potential  eligibility  and an electronic screening  log will be  kept 
to keep  track  of reasons for  ineligibility.  Those  who are deemed potentially  eligible and  
are interested  in participating  will be  sent a 7 day baseline symptom diary  (by [CONTACT_247822])  and scheduled for a baseline  visit and [ADDRESS_301228] of  medications, vitamins,  herbs,  and supplements  that they are taking  
to the baseline  visit.  Potential  subjects  will be called  several  days after  the diary  is mailed  
to ensure  that they received  it and that the instructions for  completing  the diary  are clear.  
One day prior to the scheduled study visit, potential subjects will also be called and 
screened for COVID -19 symptoms/exposure to ensure the safety of the study staff and 
other employees of UD Davis Health.  
 Baseline  Visit and Consent :  
At the first study  visit, t he baseline symptom diary will be reviewed by a study team 
physician (one of the study investigators ) and potential subjects will be rescreened. If 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301229] an opportunity to review the written informed 
consent document, ask any questions, and will be consented by a study team physician. 
The consent process will include a discussion of the risks and benefits of taking 
amitriptyline  or omeprazole  (whichever medication is most appropriate to their 
condition) . 
To avoid alerting subjects to the fact that we are directly studying the effect of the 
patient -provider relationship  on health outcomes (which could influence study 
results69,70), subjects will be told during the consent process that 1) we are studying the 
relationship between their symptoms, their physiology, and their response to 
amitriptyline  or omeprazole  and 2)  we are studying whether physicians mirror patients’ 
physiology as has been suggested by [CONTACT_247823]40,71 (to explain why 
providers are being similarly monitored). While it is challenging to study patient -
provider interact ions without subjects’ direct knowledge, particularly since both are 
being monitored in this study, we believe that framing the study in this way is the most 
sensible way to proceed and the least likely to substantively affect the study’s results . As 
the standard vs. expanded visit intervention  is minimal  risk, we believe  it meets  the federal  
criteria for  modification of informed  consent72, which allow s us to conceal  from  
participants that  we are studying  the patient -provider  interaction.  
Individuals who sign the informed consent document and ele ct to participate in the study 
will be considered enrolled. Only individuals who can provide informed consent will be 
eligible to participate.  
 
 
Provider Recruitment and Screening : 
We will advertise the study to primary care internal medicine and family medicine 
physicians and nurse practitioners via email. We may also recruit providers from the 
division of gastroenterology. We may also present the study at practice group meetings. 
Providers must  be willing  to adh ere to the study  protocol and not provide  specific 
treatment recommendations (pharmacologic or  non-pharmacologic) as this is outside the 
scope of the  study. Providers must also be willing  to receive  a brief training  to 
understand how to deliver the  standar d and expanded visit  interventions.  
Provider Consent : 
Participating  providers will be consented by [CONTACT_46575]. As study  providers will deliver  
both visit interventions, they  will be trained in both visit type formats. Providers will be 
notified of which  intervention  they are delivering  immediately  before walking  into the 
room to conduct the study  visit.  
Randomization:  
Once enrolled, subjects  will be  randomized to receive  either  the standard visit  
intervention  (n=30)  or the expanded  visit intervention  (n=30).  They  will not  know that 
there  are two possible visit choices.  This aspect  will be revealed  to subjects  during  a 
debriefing at  the follow -up visit  at the end of their participation in the study . We will 
stratify  by [CONTACT_247824]  [ADDRESS_301230] the randomization scheme and we will 
consent additional providers.  
 
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Subjects  will be randomized to receive  either a “standard visit” or an  “expanded visit”  
with a study  provider. The standard visit is based  on a high quality, empathic,  
conventional primary  care encounter. The  expanded visit is based on an integrative  
medicine consultation.  Both visits are  based on a script of questions and st atements to t he 
patient/subject (see Appendix  E). The  standard visit script includes questions about  
GERD history, symptoms, prior evaluation and treatments, and past medical history  as 
well as a brief physical exam. The expanded visit  script includes the same  questions as  
the standard visit script plus additional questions that inquire  about the modalities of their  
GI symptoms (e.g., nature of the  reflux  taste, sensation of heartburn pain and/or  
abdominal fullness, time of day  better/worse), d etails about non -GI symptoms, quality  of 
sleep, the effect of the weather  on symptoms, food cravings and  aversions,  menstrual  
flow, fears/phobias, and  overall temperament.  In this way, the expanded visit tries to  
understand the patient’s/subject’s constitution in a way  that many  systems of integrative  
medicine attempt to do.  To reduce the potential for introducing  bias by [CONTACT_247825]  
“standard” and “expanded”, the visit templates that the  study  providers  will follow will  
simp ly refer to the number of  questions to be asked on the template (e.g., 6  Question  
Template).  
 
At the end of both the standard and expanded visits, the provider will recommend the 
subject take the study medication and describe how to take it and what to exp ect. Subjects 
will receive the same scripted advice in both groups. Each subject will receive an 8 -week 
supply of amitriptyline or omeprazole with instructions for how to take it ( 10 mg daily at 
bedtime  or 20 mg daily when waking up , respectively ).   
 
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]64 we did not limit the  amount  of time spent  with the study  subject.  On 
average,  the standard  visit lasted  18 minutes (range 11-32 minutes)  and the expanded  
visit lasted 42 minutes (range 23-74 minutes).  The study  providers will be instructed  to 
maintain equal  empathy  in both groups  (e.g.,  kind and friendly  manner, maintain  eye 
contact,  active  listening  and repeating  back the patient’s words,  expressions  of empathy).  
Thus, the main  differences  between  the visits will  be the length  of time spent  with the  
subject  and the  additional questions that are asked.  
 
Each  study  provider  will participate in an orientation  session to learn  how to deliver  the 
standard  and expanded  visit interventions . Providers  will be explicitly  instructed not to  
offer  lifestyle treatment advice for GERD  to maintain uniformity of the intervention 
across providers . The study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_247791].  As each study  provider finishes  
his/her  portion of  the study,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_247792],  the two  visit types,  and their views on the doctor -patient  relationship.   
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301231]  of the doctor -patient  interaction  on response  to treatment.  
Concealment  of these  aspects  of the study  protocol  is essential  to maintaining  the 
validity  of the  study  as data suggests  that patients’  responses  change when they  know 
that the doctor -patient interaction  is being  studied69,70. The  study  PI, or another  study  
team  member , will notify  subjects at their  follow -up study  visit, after the exit 
interview,  that there  were  two possible  types  of physician  visits, that this aspect  of the  
study  was concealed  from  them  initially,  and of the rationale  for doing  so.  A script  
outlining  this planned  debriefing  is present in  Appendix  F. We believe that this 
intervention  is minimal  risk and that our plan  meets  the federal  criteria  for permitting  
alteration  of some elements  of informed  consent72. 
Subjects will be informed about taking amitriptyline or omeprazole as part of the study 
during the consent process and the study physician will discuss this with them during 
the study visit. Subjects will receive a container  with an [ADDRESS_301232] treatment  regimen  (with the exception of 
introducing amitriptyline  or omeprazole ) during  the study.  This will be  monitored  via 
the daily  symptom  diary  and a follow -up visit medication review . 
5.[ADDRESS_301233] 6 out of 7 days during that week . Adherence will be  assessed 
when  subjects  return  their symptom diaries  at their follow -up visit. For subjects  who 
return  incomplete  symptom  diaries, average daily  symptom  severity  for the days 
completed will be calculated.  If there  is insufficient data  to make  this calculation,  we 
will assume  that symptoms  are unchanged  from  baseline .

6.2.1  Telephone Screening (Day -30 to -7) 
A standardized pre-screening form will be used to assess the potential subject’s 
eligibility for the study.  See Appendix B.  
6.2.2  COVID -19 Screening (Day -1) 
A standardized COVID -[ADDRESS_301235] 2 weeks later in 
order to ensure everyone’s safety. See Appendix B.3.  
 
6.2.3 Enrollment, Baseline, and Randomization (Visit 1, Day 0)  
Potential subjects  will be rescreened  using  the pre -screen form  by a study  
physician.  The study  physician  will also review the baseline  symptom dairy  to 
ensure  that the  individual  is symptomatic  enough  to enroll.  If the individual  is 
eligible to participate in the study,  they will be  given  a copy  of the  consent  form  
to review.  
  Consenting Procedure  and Enrollment  
Written informed  consent  will be obtained  by a study  team physician  (see 
also section  4.3). The subject  will be  given  adequate time to read the 
consent  form, and any questions  the subject  has will be  answered.  The 
study  team physician  will confirm  that the subject  understands  that 
he/she  will be  connected  to physiologic  monitors  during  the visit and 
that the visit will be  video  recorded.  The physician will also discuss the 
risks and benefits of taking amitriptyline  or omeprazole . The subject will 
also have the opportunity to choose whether or not to consent to blood 
draws as part of the study which will involve one blood draw at the first 
visit and one blood draw at the second visit. The subject  will receive  a 
copy  of the  consent  form  and the  original  signed  copy  will be  kept in a 
study  binder.  If the subject agrees  to participate  and signs  the informed  
consent  form,  they will be  considered  “enrolled”.  
Study  providers will be consented  by [CONTACT_46575], following  a similar  
process,  using  a different  written  informed  consent  form . 
 
Baseline Assessments  
Evaluations for study participants/patients  (self-administered questionnaires take 
about 15 -25 minutes to complete) : 
Version 11.0  24 of 48 • Current medication List – will be pulled from Epic and verified with the 
patient by a study team physician  
• Height and weight – will be obtained by a study team m ember.  
• Demographics and health behaviors – will access things such as age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol & caffeine use (see 
Appendix D)  
• Blood draw (optional) – [ADDRESS_301236]. Blood will be processed to obtain 
RNA, DNA, and plasma then frozen at -80oC for later omics analyses.  
• Baseline Symptom Diary – 7-day diary indicating the frequency and 
severity of [ADDRESS_301237] 3 symptoms (daytime 
heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid reflux) will be used to assess 
severity of GERD symptoms.  
• GERD -HRQL  – a validated [ADDRESS_301238] symptoms on health -related quality of life73. 
• NIH PROMIS GERD scale – a validated [ADDRESS_301239] sympto ms over a 7 -day recall period26. 
• GSRS: The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale is a validated 15 item 
instrument for measuring the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms74.  It 
contains 5 subscales: abdominal pain, reflux syndrome, diarrhea 
syndrome, indigestion syndrome, and constipation syndrome.  
• Current Stress Question – 1 item self -report measure of current stress 
level on a scale of 0 (no stress) to 10 (ext reme stress)  
• Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) – a widely used [ADDRESS_301240] week (7 days), rather than the 
past month, to better fit the timeframe of the study.  We have used this 
timeframe in other studies.  
• NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO -FFI) – a validated 60  item instrument 
that measured five major dimensions of personality: extraversion, 
neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to 
experience76.  Some dimensions have been associated with response to 
enhanced patient -provider interactions in others’ studies77. 
• Physiologic Measures and Video Recording: During the intervention we 
will measure HRV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], skin temperature, and GSR i n both 
study patients and study providers. The study visit will also be video 
recorded.  During the COVID -[ADDRESS_301241] 
physiologic and nonverbal behavior data (e.g., smiles) with the patient 
and physician unmasked, while also  complying with institutional and 
state public health guidelines, the patient and doctor will sit in separate 
but adjacent, exam rooms with the door closed and use a video telehealth 
platform (e.g., Zoom, Cisco Meeting) to communicate. We will use the 
recording function to capture video data.  
Version 11.0  25 of 48 Evaluations for study providers:  
• Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) – a validated 28 item self -assessment 
of cognitive and affective components of empathy78. 
• NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO -FFI) – a validated 60 item instrument 
that measures five major dimensions of personality: extraversion, 
neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience 
[73]. Some dimension s have been associated with response to enhanced 
patient -provider interactions in others’ studies77. 
• Demog raphics and practice – will assess things such as age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, and clinical experience (see Appendix D).  
• Current Stress Question – 1 item self -report measure of current stress level 
on a scale of 0 (no stress) to 10 (extreme stress).  Study  providers will 
complete this question immediately prior to each study subject visit.  
• Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) – a widely used [ADDRESS_301242] visit.  
• Fatigue Scale – 1 item self -report measure of the current fatigue level on a 
scale of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (extreme fatigue).  Study providers will 
complete this question immediately prior to each study subject visit.  
• Physician Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) – 20 item self -report measure 
assessing physician satisfaction with the patient visit.  This measure 
includes a global satisfaction question and 19 items assessing 4 other 
domains: satisfaction with the patient -physician relationship, with the data 
collection process, with the appropriateness of the use o f time, and with 
the absence of excessive demands on the part of the patient.  Study 
providers will complete this questionnaire immediately after each study 
visit79.  
Randomization  
Subjects  will be randomized  on the day  of their baseline visit (Visit  1) to receive  
either  the standard or  expanded  visit with the specific provider  that they  are 
scheduled  to see that day. We  will stratify  randomization by [CONTACT_247826]. 
Randomization  will occur during or immediately after subjects have completed  
their baseline  questionnaires,  immediately  prior to the  study  visit.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_301243] -Intervention Measures (Day 0)  
Immediately  following  the study  physician  visit, subjects  will be  asked to 
complete  the following  questionnaires:  
• Impressions  of the Study Physician questionnaire – a 4 item measure 
assessing the patient’s impression of the study physician including 
overall rating of the physician, satisfaction with the physician, 
willingness to recommend the physician to others, and desire to see the 
physician again.  
• Consultation and Relational Empathy questionnaire (CARE) – a 
validated and commonly used 10 item measure for assessing the quality 
of the patient encounter and perceptions of empathy from the treatment 
provider80.  I used it in my pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
• HEAL Patient -Provider Conn ection – a subset of the Healing Encounters 
and Attitudes, a recently validated 7 -item measure of the patient -provider 
connection. This is a patient -reported outcome developed as part of a set 
of tools to measure non -specific factors in treatment using the  NIH 
PROMIS methodology81. 
• Current Stress Question – 1 item self -report measure of current stre ss 
level on a scale of 0 (no stress) to 10 (extreme stress)  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_301244] 
study visit and the second time 1 week before the second study  visit.  These 
telephone  check -ins will 1) serve  as a reminder to participants  to complete their 
daily  symptom diary,  2) remind participants to take the medication as 
prescribed 3) address  any participant questions or concerns,  and 4) 
remind/confirm  participant s’ second  study  visit appointment.  
Participants who wish to discontinue the study medication and unenroll from th e 
study will be directed to speak with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_247793].  
 
6.27 Completion/Final Evaluation  
We will attempt  to schedule  subjects’  Visit 2  appointments as close  to the  8-
week  window as possible but  will allow a  window of  several days (53-60 days) .

• Blood draw (optional) – 7.[ADDRESS_301247]. Blood will be processed to obtain RNA and 
plasma then frozen at -80oC for later omics  analyses.  
• Current  medication  List – will be  pulled  from  Epic or the  prior  visit and 
verified with the subject  by a study  team physician.  
• GERD -HRQL  - a validated [ADDRESS_301248]  symptoms  on health -related  quality  of life73. 
• NIH PROMIS  GERD  scale  – a validated  [ADDRESS_301249]  symptoms over a 7 day recall  period26. 
• GSRS:  The Gastrointestinal  Symptom  Rating  Scale  is a validated  15 item 
instrument  for measuring  the severity  of gastrointestinal  symptoms74. It

adverse  events  and ask about  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247794].  
• Daily  symptom  diary  – Identical  in content  to the  baseline symptom  diary,  
this diary  allows  subjects  to track  the frequency  and severity  of [ADDRESS_301250] and dyspepsia -related  symptoms  on a 5 point scale  as well as any 
medications,  supplements,  or other  products  used to help manage  symptoms.  
• Debriefing  – a study  team member will debrief  with each subject  
regarding  the two different visit types and the patient -provider 
interaction being studied . See Appendix  F for a debriefing  script.  
 
If a subject experienced benefit taking amitriptyline  or omeprazole , they will be 
offered a [ADDRESS_301251] did not 
experience any benefit and/or wishes to stop the medication, they will be 
instructed in how to taper off of it.  
 
 
Version 11.0  28 of 48 7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Expected  risks to subjects  are as  follows:  
• Study  questionnaires:  Symptom and behavioral  data collection  involves  virtually  no 
risk; however,  psychosocial  tests or questions  about  symptom  intensity  may cause  
minor  emotional  distress.  Because participants  are free to stop at any time and will be  
reminded  of this throughout  the assessment  process,  the risk of  distress  is low.  In our 
experience,  such questionnaires  are well-tolerated  and complications  are extremely  
rare. 
• Discomfort  from  ECG/GSR leads  and physiologic  monitoring:  Some participants  
may experience minor skin irritation due  to the  adhesive  used to apply  leads  for 
physiologic  monitoring.  Subjects  with known adhesive  allergies  will not be eligible 
to participate in the study.  Some participants may  experience psychological  distress  
knowing  that their  physiology  is being  monitored. The  physiologic monitoring  will 
be described  in the  consent  document  and care will be  taken  to minimize  such 
distress.  Participants  will be  free to stop at any time.  In general,  such monitoring  is 
well-tolerated.  
• Discomfort from blood draws: some participants may have an aversion to needles, 
blood, and/or the drawing of blood. Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_247827]. Blood 
draws are g enerally well -tolerated, although occasionally there may be bruising or 
discomfort at the site. Rarely an infection can occur. The blood draw will be an optional 
component of the study, and if an enrolled subject consents to the blood draw and is 
particula rly challenging to draw blood from, we cancel the blood draw and will not 
require a successful blood draw to be a condition of continued enrollment in the study.  
• Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Some participants  may experience psychological  distress  knowing  that they 
are being  videotaped. Participants  will be free to stop at any time.  In general,  videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_247795]-tolerated.  
• Amitriptyline: The most common side effects are dry mouth, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and 
constipation.  Less common side effects include dizziness, fati gue, headache, agitation, 
tremor, blurred vision, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction.  Rare side effects 
include an allergic reaction, changes in heart conduction causing slowing or speeding 
up of the heart rate, serotonin syndrome , and suicidal idea tion. We are prescribing low 
doses of this medication and have excluded those most vulnerable to adverse effects 
and so do not anticipate any serious adverse events. If a study subject calls with 
concerns about side effects, they will be directed to speak with a physician on the study 
team to assess their symptoms and determine whether any dose modification or further 
evaluation is needed. If it is deemed that the subject should stop the medication, they 
will be instructed in how to do so. If it is determin ed that they need further medical 
evaluation, they will be instructed what to do.   
• Omeprazole: The most common side effects are headaches , abdominal pain,  diarrhea, 
and nausea. Less common side effects include skin rash,  constipation, dizziness, and 
back pain . Rarely someone may develop a hypersensitivity reaction, acute interstitial 
nephritis, lupus, or an enteric infection. Long -term use may increase the risk of 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301252] should stop 
the medication, they will be instructed in how to do so. If it is determined that they 
need further medical evaluation, they will be instructed what to do.   
• Severe GERD sympto ms: It is possible that subjects may experience a flare in their 
GERD symptoms during the study. If a subject calls with severe GERD symptoms, he 
or she will be directed to speak with a study physician to discuss their symptoms and 
determine the best cours e of action. In some cases as needed antacids may be 
recommended for refractory symptoms. If this recommendation does not suffice, the 
subject may need to initiate additional medication and possibly be removed from the 
study.  
• Deception:  Subjects  may exper ience minor psychological  distress  at study  visit [ADDRESS_301253]  experience  conducting  such debriefings  and subjects  generally  
understand why such information  was withheld initially.  
 
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
As amitriptyline is known to cause cardiac conduction delays and lower the seizure 
threshold in so me individuals, we will not enroll anyone with known cardiac disease 
or seizure history  that would be allocated amitriptyline during the study . We will also 
not enroll anyone with bipolar disorder (to avoid causing mania) or medications that 
could interact with amitriptyline and cause serotonin syndrome  that would be 
allocated amitriptyline during the study .  
7.[ADDRESS_301254] any questions or conc erns. If 
so, a physician on the study team will reach out to them.  
When subjects  return  for their follow -up visit, a  study  team member will inquire  
about  any changes  to their health or medical  visits (including  emergency  room visits 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) since  their initial  study  visit. We will ask specifically if they 
experienced any adverse effects from the amitriptyline  or omeprazole . If a subject  
reports  a new or worsening  symptom that is medically  concerning  (e.g.,  bright  red 
blood per  rectum),  they will be  referred  for further evaluation . 
Version 11.0  30 of 48 7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE)  is any unfavorable or  unintended diagnosis,  symptom,  sign,  
syndrome  or disease  which either  occurs  during  the study  (having  been  absent at  
baseline),  or if present  at baseline,  appears  to worsen.  
A serious  adverse event  (SAE)  is any  untoward  medical  occurrence that results in 
death,  is life  threatening,  requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56901], results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity,  or is 
a congenital  anomaly.  
During  the follow -up visit, the study  team  member  will specifically  ask about any  new 
or worsening  symptoms  in the last [ADDRESS_301255]  
any health  concerns  reported  by [CONTACT_1766]  (not specifically  solicited)  and report 
these  to the  study  PI. If there are any signs  or symptoms  of concern  or that require 
further  clarification,  the study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_247796].  
• Unexpected  fatal or life-threatening  AEs related  to the intervention  will be  
reported  to the  National  Center  for Complementary  and Integrative Health  
(NCCIH) Program  Officer  within 3 business days of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event and to the study’s  Independent  Safety  
Monit or(s) and UC Davis  IRB within 5 business  days of the investigator  
becoming  aware  of the event.  Other  serious  and unexpected  AEs related  to 
the intervention will be  reported  within 5  business  days.  
• Anticipated  or unrelated  SAEs  will be  handled  in a less urgent  manner but  will 
be reported  to the  Independent  Safety  Monitor(s),  IRB,  and other oversight  
organizations  in accordance with their requirements  and will be reported  to 
NCCIH  on an annual  basis.  
• All other  AEs documented during  the course  of the trial will be reported  to 
NCCIH  and the UC Davis  IRB on an annual  basis  by [CONTACT_247828].  The Independent  Safety  Monitor(s)  Report 
will state that all AEs have been reviewed  (see Data  Safety  and Monitoring  
Plan).  
 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
Study  staff and visit intervention  providers  will be instructed  to report  all adverse  
events  (or potential AEs)  to the  study  PI ([CONTACT_247843]).  Determination  of relatedness  
will be  made  in conjunction  with [CONTACT_184301] and/or [CONTACT_142041]. An electronic log of 
various  types  of AEs will be  kept and updated  by [CONTACT_49124].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_301256]  and/or  
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301257]  until they  are resolved or  considered  stable.  Formal  
AE follow -up will end with subjects’  follow -up visit unless they  have an  ongoing  
issue  or call to report  an event after completing the study.  
 
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
Please see the separate  data safety  and monitoring plan for this study, found in  
Appendix  G. 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Subjects who decline to participate in study procedures (e.g., completion of study  
questionnaires,  physiologic  monitoring,  and/or  video  recording ) will be terminated from the 
study without further follow -up. Any subjects  who are  disruptive  or felt to pose  a threat  to 
study  staff will also be  terminated without follow -up. If a subject experiences an adverse 
reaction to amitriptyline or omeprazole and decides to stop taking the medication, or if a study 
physician deems it in the subject’s best interest to stop the medication, the subject will 
continue to be followed for the duration of their initially planned participation (out to 8 
weeks), unless the subject declines to participate further.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
Design: This is a  single -blinded  randomized  controlled  trial in which  subjects  will 
be randomized  in a 1:[ADDRESS_301258] visit .  
Primary  hypotheses : 
1. Subjects who receive an expanded visit will have a greater improvement in 
their GERD symptoms after [ADDRESS_301259] visit.   
Secondary  hypothesis : 
1. Patient -provider dyads in expanded visits will have a greater percentage of 
the total visit time spent in physiologic concordance (measured by [CONTACT_247829]) compared patient -provider dyads in standard visits.   
2. Percentage of visit time with physiologi c concordance (in GSR or HRV) will 
be correlated with GERD symptom improvement.  
3. Subjects who experience  physiologic  changes  similar  to those  elicited by [CONTACT_247830] -
body  techniques (i.e.,  decreased  GSR  and increased  high frequency  HRV)  over 
the course  of their visit (first several minutes compared to the last several 
minutes of the visit) will demonstrate  greater  improvements  in GERD  symptom  
severity  than subjects  who do not. 
Version 11.0  32 of 48 4. Healthcare providers in expanded visits will demonstrate more patient -
centered no n-verbal behaviors (e.g., smiles and gazes) and global impression 
(e.g., engaged, friendly, relaxed) compared to providers in standard visits as 
rated by [CONTACT_247831].  
5. Patient and provider smiling at the end of study vi sits will be significantly 
associated with GERD symptom improvement  8 weeks later.  
 
Primary  outcome : 
1. Change in the average daily GERD symptom severity score from baseline to 
the last week of the study in the expanded vs. standard group. GERD 
symptom severity is based on the sum of scores assessing the severity of 
daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, an d acid reflux each on a 0 -4 point 
scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe; higher scores signify 
worse symptoms).  
Secondary  outcomes : 
1. Ratio of the sum of positive correlations over the sum of negative correlations in 
GSR (or HRV) across patient -provider encounters for standard vs. expanded visit 
types and for responders vs. non -responders (those with a 50% or greater 
improvement in their GERD symptom severity).   
2. Absolute change in GSR (or high frequency HRV signal) in patient recordings 
from the b eginning of the study visit to the end of the study visit and correlation 
with subsequent change in GERD symptom severity.   
3. Differences in blinded ratings of 2 minute thin slices of study visit videos 
from the beginning to the end of the study in supporti ve global impressions 
(e.g., engagement, relaxed, patient seems pleased/satisfied) and non -verbal 
behaviors (e.g., smiling) between standard and expanded visit types and 
correlation with subsequent change in GERD symptom severity.  
Validity  and reliability  of outcome  measures : 
1. Assessment  of physiologic  concordance  has been described  by a number  of 
groups  and we will be using  similar  methodology45,82. 
2. GERD symptom  severity  will be  assessed  by a daily  symptom  diary  used by a 
number  of other  groups  in medication  trials and in our previous  study64,83,84. 
The average daily  GERD  symptom  severity  is based on the daily  sum of scores  
from  the first three  questions  assessing  severity  of daytime  heartburn,  
nighttime  heartburn,  and acid reflux  averaged  over a  [ADDRESS_301260] developed  and validated  a variety  of coding  schemes 
to analyze providers’  verbal  and non-verbal  behaviors  and to link these 
behaviors  with patient satisfaction,  understanding,  trust, rapport, empathy,  and a 
variety  of related  factors9,58–63. We  will use  a subset of  these  validated  coding  
Version 11.[ADDRESS_301261] deviation (root mean square error) in my pi[INVESTIGATOR_247797] 1.564. We are c onservatively assuming that this number will likely be larger 
in this study given the greater number of providers involved. Given 30 subjects in 
each group (n=60 total), 80% power, a two -sided 
significance test with alph a = 0.05, the minimal detectable 
difference (MDD) in GERD symptom severity scores 
between the standard and expanded groups given the 
estimated standard deviations (SD) is shown in the adjacent 
table . These MDD values are similar to those found in my 
fellow ship study64 and are clinically meaningful86,87. 
 
Treatment Assignment  Procedures  
A randomization  scheme  will be  devised  before the start of the  study  by [CONTACT_247832].  We do not anticipate  a need to break  the blind during  the 
study  because  we are not expecting  serious adverse  events  to occur more frequently  
in one  visit group  than another.  Randomization will be  stratified  by [CONTACT_48368],  with 
permuted block sizes of [ADDRESS_301262] udy, the statistician may need to 
rebalance the randomization scheme.  
Subjects will be informed of their visit group  assignment during the debriefing at the 
end of the second study visit.  
9.3  Definition of Populations  
For analyses  including  the intervention  group  type, we will analyze our data 
according  to which  visit intervention  subjects  received (standard or  expanded). We  
do not anticipate  any discrepancies  between  what subjects  were assigned to receive  
by [CONTACT_247833].  Study  visit type will be  guided  
by a written  script that the providers  will follow during  the visit.  The actual 
intervention  received  will also be verified  by [CONTACT_247834].  
The intent to treat analysis will include all randomized subjects who received a 
study visit intervention. The per protocol analysis will include all individuals who 
received a study visit intervention and completed the follow -up questionnaires at 8 Minimal Detectable

If at any point 20% or more of participants have dropped from the study due to 
adverse effects from amitriptyline  or omeprazole  and/or there is a serious adverse 
event likely due to amitriptyline  or omeprazole , the study team will meet with the 
study safety monitor to determine whether any protocol modifications are necessary.   
 
9.5 Outcomes  
A combination of descripti on statistics, pearson correlations, and general linear models 
(GLM) such as ANCOVA, will be used for analyzing the data.

9.5.[ADDRESS_301268] 
symptom severity is based on the sum of scores assessing the severity of 
daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, an d acid reflux each on a 0 -4 point 
scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe; higher scores signify 
worse symptoms).  We will use ANCOVA for the primary analysis, 
adjusting for baseline GERD symptom severity and visit type assignment 
using the [ADDRESS_301269] symptom severity as the outcome. 
Potential moderators that will be assessed in exploratory analyses will 
include gender (both patient and provider), race, visit length, patient stress, 
personality type, and perceived connection with/empathy of the provider.    
 
9.5.[ADDRESS_301270], an average slope of the GSR 
will be calculated in the patient and provider recordings in moving 5 second 
window s, offset by 1 second. Next, Pearson correlations with lag zero will be 
calculated over successive 15 second windows between time -locked patient 
and provider GSR slope values. Then, a single session index will be calcula ted 
from the ratio of the sum of the positive correlations across the entire visit 
divided by [CONTACT_247835]. To reduce skew, the natural logarithm of the index will be 
calculated. Thus, a n index value of zero reflects equal positive and negative 
correlations, a value greater than zero reflects more concordance in GSR than 
not, while a value less than zero reflects less concordance in the dyad (less 
than 50%)82. These index values will be used in GLM analyses with GERD 
symptom severity and/or correlated with visit type.   
We will also perform  similar  analy ses on  the HRV  data – comparing  variation  in 
the beat-to-beat intervals  over short  segments  of time and calculating  Pearson 
correlation coefficients for time-locked  patient  and provider  data for these  
intervals.  
2. We will calculate  absolute  changes  in both GSR  and also high frequency  HRV  
within  study  subjects from  the beginning  to the end of the study  visit. We will 
assess  the Pearson  correlation  between  these  changes  and reported  changes  in 
GERD  symptom  severity. We will also look at absolute levels of GSR and HRV 
at the end of the study visit and compare those values with change s in GERD 
symptom severity in GLM models. As an exploratory  analysis,  I will test whether  
changes  in GSR  and HRV  are a function  of baseline  perceived  stress  and if that 
relationship  differs between  the standard and  expanded  visit interventions.  
3. To analyze study visit videos, 2 minut e thin slices  of each video at three time 
points (beginning, middle, and end of study visits) will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_247836],  for the presence of 1)  micro -level non -verbal  supportive 
behaviors (e.g., gazes, smiles, nods, gestures – measured as absolute number or 
Version 11.0  37 of 48 length of time) as well as 2) macro -level  impression  ratings  of the interaction 
(e.g.,  engagement,  friendliness, relaxed, empathic, reciprocity – measured on a 
1-9 scale ). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_247799] 70% concordance  is achieved  
between  coders  using Cronbach’s alpha . Each of these variables will be assessed 
in a GLM examining time, visit type, and time x visit type effects. We will also 
calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for each  variable relative to 
improvement in GERD symptom s and construct a GLM examining patient and 
provider smiling as a predictor of improvement in GERD symptoms. Other 
models may also be constructed based on the results of the initial video analyses.  
9.6 Data  Analyses   
We will perform  descriptive  statistics  on the  sample demographics  similar to our  
prior paper64 including  age, gender,  race,  ethnicity,  body  mass index  (BMI),  smoking  
status,  and current  medication  use for GERD  symptoms.  We will also assess  whether  
perceived  stress,  perceived  empathy  (both patient  and provider),  personality  type 
(five  factor  inventory) , or demographic factors  modify  improvement in GERD 
symptoms  using  generalized  linear  models.  We will use  the GERD -HRQL,  NIH 
PROMIS  GERD, and GSRS as adjunct/corroborating  measures of GERD symptom  
severity.  Blood samples will be processed and stored at - 80oC for later omics -based 
analyses that will be the subject of a future grant/study.  
 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.[ADDRESS_301271] q uestionnaire  data will be  collected  on iPads  at the study site using  Research  
Electronic  Data  Capture (REDCap;  http://project -redcap.org/ ) forms . In the event 
that a subject cannot physically return for the second study visit, a link to the 
follow -up questionnaires will be emailed to the subject.  Subjects will complete 
GERD  symptom dairies  either  online  (REDCap) or in paper  format  daily.  Paper  
data will be  doubled entered  into a REDCap  database  by [CONTACT_247837].  REDCap  is a secure,  web-based  application  developed at 
Vanderbilt University for electronic collection and management of clinical research 
study data  and is hosted locally by [CONTACT_45102] . 
Study staff will maintain an electronic screening file and enrollment log file and 
paper files of consent forms.  
Study participant confidentiality will be maintained by a unique identifier. An 
electronic file linking par ticipants’ personally identifying information and study ID 
will be password protected. All paper data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet. 
Only study affiliated personnel will have access to the study database and 
associated files. Electronic communi cation with collaborators will only involve 
deidentified information. All published data will be presented in aggregate format 
and deidentified .   
Version 11.0  38 of 48  
10.2 Data Management   
All paper  symptom  diaries  will be  reviewed  in real time with subjects  to ensure  that 
data can be transferred  completely  and accurately  to electronic  form. Such  data will 
be double entered  and cross checked  as described  above. All data  (questionnaire,  
physiologic,  video)  will be cleaned  by [CONTACT_247838]  1-2 months by 
[CONTACT_46575] [INVESTIGATOR_247800],  completeness,  and timeliness of  subsequent  
analyses.   
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1  Training  
The study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_247801].  All research coordinators/interns  will have  
completed  the appropriate  human subjects  training  programs  and may complete  
additional  training  depending  upon  the capacity  in which they  will serve  in the  
study.  
10.3. 2 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol  deviations  will be documented  and reported to the UC Davis IRB . 
Unapproved  major protocol deviations  will be  reported  to the  IRB and NCCIH  
within  5 business days of discovery.  
 
Unapproved  minor protocol  deviations  will be reported  to the  IRB at the time of  the 
annual  continuing  review  and to NCCIH  annually  as well.  Should  a protocol  
deviation  become  repetitive  and/or  problematic,  the investigational  team  may 
consider  submitting a protocol amendment  to adjust  study  procedures.  
 
10.3. [ADDRESS_301272] (IRB) Review   
This protocol  and the  informed  consent  documents and any subsequent  
modifications  will be  reviewed  and approved  by [CONTACT_247839].  
Version 11.0  39 of 48 11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
Written informed  consent  will be obtained  by a study  team physician  at the initial  
study  visit after reviewing  inclusion and exclusion criteria,  the participant’s  symptom  
diary,  and the electronic medical record  if the participant is a  patient  at UC Davis . 
The consent  form will describe  the purpose  of the  study, the procedures  to be  
followed,  and the risks and benefits  of participation.  Participants  will have the  
opportunity  to ask questions. A copy  will be  given  to each participant and  this fact 
will be documented  in the  participant’s record.  Participants  who cannot  consent for  
themselves  or who are  not fluent  in English  will not be  eligible to participate due  to 
the nature  of the  study.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality   
Study  visits will be  conducted in a  private  setting.  Whenever  possible,  
questionnaire  data will be collected  electronically  using  REDCap. REDCap  is a 
secure,  web-based  application  developed  by [CONTACT_247840].  All electronic data not 
gathered  using  REDCap  (symptoms diaries,  physiologic  data, video  recordings)  
will be stored  on a UC Davis  shared  drive  which is backed  up regularly  to protect  
against  data loss and is behind the  UC Davis firewall.  Any data that cannot be 
collected  directly  onto a shared  drive  (i.e., must be saved  on a local  hard disk 
during  data collection)  will be collected  on an encrypted  laptop  and transferred  to a 
UC Davis -affiliated  server  shortly  after collection. Any  paper  questionnaire  data 
will be  stored  in a locked filing cabinet . 
Only  those researchers  involved in the study  will have ac cess to electronic  and paper  
data.  The file linking  participants’  personally  identifiable information  with their 
participant  identification  number  (PID)  will be  password protected  and access will 
be restricted  to the  fewest  number  of staff required  but will include  at least the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238] a research  coordinator.  Electronic  access  to videos  will also be password  
protected.  All paper  records  will be  kept in a  locked  file cabinet.  All computer  
entry  and analysis will  be done  using  PI[INVESTIGATOR_247802].  Any data, forms,  reports, video 
recordings,  and other  records  that leave the site  will be  identified  only by a PID to 
maintain  confidentiality.  Digital  video files may be stored  for up to 12  years  but 
may be destroyed  sooner.  
Information  will not be  released  without written  permission of the  participant,  
except  as necessary  for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744],  the NCCIH,  and the OHRP . 
 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study  may be discontinued at any time by  [CONTACT_1201],  the NCCIH,  the Office  of 
Human  Research  Protections  (OHRP ), or other  government  agencies  as part of their 
duties  to ensure that research  participants are  protected.  
Version 11.0  40 of 48 12. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
12.1 Potential Benefits to Participating Individuals  
Study  subjects  (“patients”)  may experience  improvement  in their GERD  symptoms  by 
[CONTACT_48777].  The placebo  response  in GERD -related  trials  may be as 
high as 40% [35] and our prior  data suggests that  a therapeutic  encounter  such as the 
expanded  visit can result  in at least temporary  symptom  improvement  for some  
individuals  [61].  In addition, subjects may also experience improvement in their 
GERD symptoms from taking amitriptyline  or omeprazole . It is also possible  that 
subjects  may not experience  any direct  benefit  from  participating  in this study.  
Subjects  will receive $[ADDRESS_301273] study visit and $50 for attending the second study visit . 
Participating  study  providers will also be  remunerated  for their time ($80.00  per 
visit)  and may benefit by [CONTACT_247841].

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634693] of these clinical trials. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network 
(HVTN)  and HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) [hereafter referred to as the 
“Networks”]  have addressed ethical concerns in the f ollowing ways:  
• Network  trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base 
necessary to find new methods for the prevention of HIV infection , using 
methods that are scientifically rigorous and valid, and in accordance with 
International Council  for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)  and/or other  Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines.  
• Network  scientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies 
underlying major codes (1-3), declarations, and other guidance documents 
relevant to human subjects research into the desig n and conduct of HIV 
vaccine and prevention clinical trials.  
• Network  scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
[CONTACT_493413].  
• Network  clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are  
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infection 
according to local guidelines. Staff members will also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
• The Networks require that all international Network sites lacking national 
plans for providing antiretroviral therapy  (ART ) develop plans for the care 
and treatment of participants who acquire HIV infection during a trial. Each 
plan is developed in consultation with representatives of host countries, 
communities from which potential trial participants will be drawn, sponsors, 
and the Networks. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are 
referred to medical practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify 
potential clinical trials they may want to join.  If a program  for ART provision  
is not available at a site and ART is needed, a privately established fund will 
be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent possible.  
• The Networks  provide training so that all participating site s similarly ensure 
fair participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and 
obtain meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634694] extent possible, their privacy 
prote cted. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
• Prior to implementation, Network  trials are rigorously reviewed by [CONTACT_115552].  
• Network  trials are reviewed by [CONTACT_493414].  
• The Networks design their research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to 
both study participants and their local communities. For example, Network  
protocols provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV 
prevention, as well as counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social 
impacts that may result from research participation. Network  protocols also 
include careful medical review of each research participant’s health conditions 
and reactions to study products while in the  study.  
• Network  research aims to benefit local communities by [CONTACT_115553], support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Res earchers involved in Network trials are able to conduct 
other critical research in their local research settings.  
• The Networks recognize the importance of institutional review and value the 
role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , Ethics Comm ittees 
(ECs) , and other Regulatory Entities (REs)  as custodians responsible for 
ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting . 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 13 of 188 3 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of these research requirements. Each Network  
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
The sections below address each of the review concerns by [CONTACT_1202]/ECs and any 
applicable REs regarding how the  research will  be conducted.  
3.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can joi n in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c) performing direct observation of participants post  study product 
administration  and collecting information regarding side effects for several days 
post study product administration ; (d) having staff properly trained in 
administering study procedures that may cause physical harm or psychological 
distress, such as blood draws, study product administration s, HIV testing and 
counseling a nd HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk reduction 
counseling and checking on contraception use (for persons assigned female at 
birth ); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
3.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.11 1(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to asse ss 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and may have 
exhausted all conventional treatment options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the  risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowledge it is designed to generate.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 14 of 188 3.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not because of positions of vulnerability or privilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and  enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
3.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 and 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 and 5: Informed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the su bject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 
21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by [ADDRESS_634695] be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section  9.1). Each 
site is provided training in informed consent by [CONTACT_493415] i ts 
entering the Network . The Networks  require a signed consent document for 
documentation, in addition to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
3.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring  the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section  11). Safety is 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_493416] l staff and routinely by [CONTACT_106885] 136/HPTN 
[ADDRESS_634696] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to pr otect the privacy of subjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unauthorized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable in formation about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns 
research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 15 of 188 term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects  the privacy of participants by [CONTACT_106807] 
(Appendix A  and Appendix B ). The privacy of participants is protected by 
[CONTACT_269954]’s name [CONTACT_269971]. In the [LOCATION_002], research participants in N etwork protocols are 
protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the US NIH, which can prevent 
disclosure of study participation even when that information is requested by 
[CONTACT_106809]. Participants are told of the use and limits of the certificate in t he study 
consent form. In addition, each staff member at each study site in this protocol 
signs an Agreement on Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens with the 
Networks. In some cases, a comparable confidentiality agreement process may be 
acceptable . Each study site participating in the protocol is required to have a 
standard operating procedure on how the staff members will protect the 
confidentiality of study participants .

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 16 of 188 4 Background  
In 2017, more than 35 million people were living with HIV, and 1.8 million 
people were newly infected with the virus  (4). While many countries have 
achieved progress toward leveling HIV incidence over the past seve ral years, 
micro -epi[INVESTIGATOR_493385], even in countries 
with robust public health infrastructure . Effective biomedical interventions are 
urgently needed to reduce HIV acquisition. A vaccine is the preferred intervention 
(5) but remains a major challenge. Antiretroviral treatment can decrease HIV 
transmission (6) and the use of pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can decrease 
acquisition (7), but both interventions face limitations due to adherence, side 
effects and the logistics and co sts of implementation (8). Alternative interventions 
are being considered that use passively administered, long -acting antiretroviral 
drugs or neutralizing antibodies (nAb) for prevention (9-14)

antibody (mAb) directed against the F protein of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] 
(RSV), has been used for nearly 2 decades as RSV pro phylaxis in preterm and 
other high -risk infants (16-18). Administration of palivizumab serves as a model 
for the use of mAbs to block a mucosally -acquired infection.  
The most promising approach for applying passive immunization to HIV -1 
involves broadly neutralizing antibodies (bn Abs). These naturally occurring  
antibodies (Abs) may be isolated from many HIV -1–infected individuals, usually 
after at least several years of infection  (19), and feature unusual characteristics, 
such as long hypervariable loops, an ability to overcome host tolerance control, 
interaction with glyca ns, and high levels of somatic mutation in the variable 
domains facilitating binding to the highly glycosylated HIV -1 envelope protein 
(20-22). These distinctive features are selected for during natural infection and co -
evolution of the virus and antibodies in an infected host; potency and 
heterologous breadth is acquired over long term iterative cycles of immune 
escape, epi[INVESTIGATOR_493386],  and antibody adaptation to resistant variants (23).  
While it is challenging to emulate these processes by [CONTACT_33853], u sing bnAbs to 
inform and expedite the development of HIV vaccines may eventually enable 
elicitation of  such antibodies by [CONTACT_15199] (24-29). Meanwhile, there is great 
interest in studying passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
modeled on these naturally -occurring bnAbs to prevent, treat, and potentially cure  
HIV-1 infection.  
Until recently, these antibodies were few in number, targeted a narrow spectrum 
of HIV strains and Env epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and were not potent enough for practical use. 
Since 2012 , the field has changed dramatically: new developments in antigen -
specific memory B cell sorting and high throughput single -cell polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR ) amplification have led to the isolation of new monoclonal 
antibodies with extraordinary potency and breadth (11, 12, 30) .

Prevention (AMP) Trials (HVTN 704/HPTN 085 [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] and HVTN 
703/HPTN 081 [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) include assessment of neutralizing and non -
neutralizing antiviral activity ( ie, Fc effector functions), neutralization and genetic 
sieve analyses, and correlates analyses (31). These important proof -of-concept 
trials will help us determine whether antibodies that neutralize  HIV-[ADDRESS_634699] nonhuman primates (NHPs ) from experimental simian -human 
immunodeficiency virus (SHIV ) challenge will protect against the acquisition of 
HIV infection in humans. They also aim to determine the protective titer – a 
critical parame ter in designing future clinical trials of passive immunization and 
vaccines.  
As of 2019, dozens of bnAbs have been identified, and their HIV -[ADDRESS_634700] been elucidated  (20, 21, 23, 24, 32, 33) . 
These efforts have set the stage for evaluation o f these antibodies’ potential to 
contribute to HIV -1 prevention, treatment, and possibly cure  (25-29). Passive 
infusion studies in NHP s demonstrated that bnAbs were effective in protection 
against mucosal SHIV challenge (34-43) and broadly neutralizing investigational 
mAb products can reduce HIV RNA levels in humans (43-50). Results from 
early -phase human clinical trials using different classes of bnAbs, such as those 
targeting the CD4 binding site ( eg, VRC01 and 3BNC117) and a glycan -
dependent epi[INVESTIGATOR_493387] V3 loop ( eg, 10-1074 and PGT121), have 
been encouraging, demonstrating the potential for and challenges of developi[INVESTIGATOR_147164]-HIV-1 bnAbs as preventive and  therapeutic agents (41, 44 -47, 49 -51).

These mAb products display a broad range of neutralization potency and breadth 
and some of the more promising molecules have been engineered for improved 
neutralization, manu facturability, stability, and serum half -life. Additional 
improvements continue to be made, including the construction of engineered, 
chimeric bi - and tri -specific mAbs (53-55). While relatively few HIV neutralizing 
mAbs  are currently  available for clinical evaluation, those th at are include some 
of the broad est and most potent mAbs identified to date. Thus, the available 
products, though limited, provide opportunities to address important scientific

As mentioned above, the VRC01 AMP trials are important proof -of-concept trials 
to demonstrate whether bnAbs can prevent HIV infection, and to gain insights 
into the potency needed for prevention. Howev er, we recognize that much 
stronger and broader neutralization will be required to counter the genetic 
variability of HIV across diverse geographic locations. Indeed, models that 
combine  in vitro  neutralizing activity and NHP protection data predict that [ADDRESS_634702] bnAbs may be needed, either as a combination of individual 
bnAbs, as bi - or tri -specific bnAbs, or both (13). 
The overarching aims guiding this  study are to characterize the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of 2 broadly -neutralizing mAb investigational products , VRC07 -523LS 
(CD4 -binding site) and PGT121.414.LS (V3 -glycan), when co -administered IV 
and SC, and to describe whether there is an increase in neutralization potential in 
humans with this mAb combination as predicted by [CONTACT_493417] -infused clinical products. The data collected in 
this protocol wi ll contribute significantly to future analyses that aim to combine 
LS versions of [ADDRESS_634703] the combination of VRC07 -523LS, 
PGT121.414.LS and PGDM1400LS because of the superior  in vitro  neutralization 
profiles across all major global subtypes (see below). If efficacious, this 
combination would likely be developed as a global product. Data collected in this 
protocol will contribute significantly to this end goal.  
It is reasonable to ask why we are working to advance these specific mAbs from 
among the various options available. CD4 -binding site  bnAbs are likely going to 
serve as the “backbone” of any mAb combination approach, owing to their 
exceptional breadth. VRC01 ha s detectable inhibitory concentration (IC 80) 
responses for 80% of the 403 globally sampled pseudoviruses summarized in 

HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 19 of 188 Figure 4-2, with a median IC 80 of 1.75 mcg/mL. Ongoing clinical studies have 
begun to assess VRC07 -523LS, which has substantially improved performance  in 
vitro , neutralizing up to 97% of circulating strains, with a median IC 80 of only 
0.162 mcg/mL. Among all of the diverse pseudoviru ses with neutralization data 
collected in the Los Alamos Immunology database ( Compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829], Analyze and Tally 
nAb Panels [CATNAP ]), 59% (412 of 704) have an IC 50 < 1 mcg/mL using 
VRC01, while 91% (365/402) have an IC 50 < 1 mcg/mL using VRC07 -523LS  
(www.hiv.lanl.g iv/components/sequence/HIV/neutralization/index.html) . 
V3-glycan and V2 -apex bnAbs have a narrower breadth than CD4 -binding site  
bnAbs, but their potency often exceeds CD4 -binding site  Abs for a subset of 
viruses ( Figure 4-2). V3 -glycan and V2 -apex bnAbs are also complementary in 
coverage (42), individually neutralizing 50 -70% of viruses – whereas combined, 
they neutralize >90% of viruses at IC 50 < 1 mcg/mL. Studies of  in vitro  
neutralization have shown that a triple combination of CD4 -binding site  + V2 -
apex + V3 -glycan bnAbs outperforms “best -in-class” single and dual bnAbs, 
while the addition of a fourth bnAb provides minimal additional benefit in terms 
of enha ncing the predicted combined IC 50 values (13, 14, 58) . Such a triple 
combination also increases the cha nce that at least 2 of the 3 antibodies in the 
combination will be simultaneously active (dual coverage) on any given strain. 
This in turn diminishes the chance for rapid selection of immune escape variants 
following exposure . Dual coverage also accounts f or differences in PK among the 
antibodies, and for differences in the neutralization profiles of circulating viruses 
and the complex viral quasispecies  encountered at transmission (42) , to improve 
the probability that at least [ADDRESS_634704] to other “categories” of bnAbs, those targeting the gp120 -gp41 
interface/fusion peptide an d the gp120 silent face are not currently being pursued 
for passive prevention but remain of interest for vaccine design (59). Such

exhibit promising potency and breadth but often possess lipid -binding properties 
that could have undesirable effects. In a recent trial, the lead MPER bnAb  clinical 
candidate, 10E8VLS, had a disappointing PK profile, and 1 participant who 
received subcutaneous injections experienced severe erythema and panniculitis at 
the injection site, resulting in suspension of the trial (61). It is possible that MPER 
or fusion peptide -targeting bnAbs may eventually be useful as clinical products, 
but are currently not ready for evaluation.

against a subset of viruses that are least sensitive to PGT121, whereas it gained 
potency against a subset of viruses that are most sensitive to PGT121. Des pi[INVESTIGATOR_493389], there was excellent overall concordance between the 2 
antibodies (r2= 0.736 and 0.776 for IC50 and IC80 values, respectively,

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 21 of 188 p<0.0001).  These findings support the use of PGT121 neutralization data to 
predict PGT121.414.LS activity.  
As shown in Figure 4-3, PGT121 displays limited breadth but has outstanding 
potency against the viruses that are neutralized, having among the lowest median 
IC50 and IC 80 titers among all bnAbs identified to date (30) (see Section 4.2.1 ). 
VRC07 -523LS, a highly engineered derivative of the bnAb VRC01, displays 
somewhat lower potency than PGT121 but has outstanding breadth and an 
improved PK profile (see Section 4.2.2 ).

Modeling by [CONTACT_493419], Wagh, and colleagues, using PGT121  in vitro  data and the 
predicted neutralizing activity of PGT121.414.LS based on PGT121 data, suggests 
that the addition of PGT121.414.LS provides enhanced breadth and potency of 
heterologous variants relative to VRC07 -523LS alone. In particular, 22 of the 403 
pseudoviruses tested for neutralization had no detectable sensitivity  to VRC07 -
523LS , and of these 9 were sensitive to PGT121. Perhaps more importantly, for 37% 
of the 403 pseudoviruses tested, PGT121 was more potent than VRC07 -523LS, so it 
often makes a very substantial contribution to the overall potency of the combination 
(Figure 4-3). The combination of VRC07 -523LS + PGT121.414.LS is predicted to 
provide no dual coverage o f CRF01 because of broad resistance of this subtype to 
PGT121. PGT121 also has far more limited activity against clade A and CRF02, 
common viral lineages in west and central Africa. Thus, while in vitro  neutralizing 
activity suggests that VRC01 -523LS + PGT 121.414.LS  has potential for success in 
subtype B populations where both antibodies tend to be highly active (Figure 4-2) the 
addition of a V2 -apex class antibody  (eg, PGDM1400LS), because of complementary 
coverage with PGT121.414.LS and complementary potency with VRC07 -523LS, 
would be the best candidate for a third bnAb addition.  
Early product development assessment of the PGT121 and  
VRC07 -523LS mAbs has revealed an att ractive product profile, including safety

tolerability data of these 2 mAbs, it is scientifically sound to evaluate 
PGT1 21.414.LS alone and in combination with VRC07 -523LS in a phase 1 
human clinical trial to assess safety (including anti -drug antibodies [ADA]), PK, 
and functional activity, and to contribute to the development of an experimental 
platform for a triple bnAb c ombination. This approach for optimizing future

4.1.1  Cross -network implementation  
DAIDS has requested that its two major prevention trial networks —the HVTN 
and the HPTN —work together in the rapid development of HIV -directed bnAbs 
for both the adva ncement of vaccine research and HIV prevention purposes. This 
priority program leverages the historical partnership between the HVTN and the 
VRC (a major developer of anti -HIV bnAbs) and other commercial developers, 
the strong portfolio of biomedical -based  HIV prevention trials that the HVTN and 
HPTN have developed over the past 2 decades, the multidisciplinary expertise of 
investigators in each network, and the networks’ complementary laboratory and 
statistical expertise. In addition, the two networks have  complementary CRSs that 
allow for rapid enrollment of participants, worldwide. The engagement of CRSs 
from both networks, particularly in early phase trials, accelerates recruitment, 
diversifies the trial cohort, and builds capacity for the conduct of fut ure bnAb 
efficacy trials.  
4.2 Study products  
4.2.1  PGT121.414.LS  
PGT121.BIJ414.LS (referenced and labeled as PGT121.414.LS ) was produced by 
[CONTACT_493420] (Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center) , and collaborative engagement of  CAVD investigators . The drug 
substance  was manufactured under cGMP standards at Just Biotherapeutics  under 
contract to DAIDS’s Vaccine Translational Research Branch (VTRB). The drug 
product was filled and released for the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Re search 
Center (VRC) by [CONTACT_52606] (VCMP), Leidos 
Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD.  The PGT121.414.LS mAb is an 
engineered variant of PGT121. It contains a total of 8 residue modifications to 
improve various aspects of manufacturing, stability and in vivo  elimination half -
life. Six of the modifications are in the Fragment crystallizable (Fc) region,

life in vivo (62, 63) . The magnitude and breadth of neutralizing activity of 
PGT121.414.LS and its PGT121  in vitro  were shown to be nearly equivalent 
against a multiclade panel of Env -pseudotyped viruses ( Figure 4-3).  
The bnAb, PGT121, was identified from African donor 17 of the International 
AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI ) Protocol G cohort. It targets the V3 glycan -
dependent epi[INVESTIGATOR_493392] -1 virus. This epi[INVESTIGATOR_493393]120 outer 
domain includes both protein and glycans and is centered on the conserved 
residue N332 (64-66). Using a 162 -pseudovirus panel, representative of all major 
HIV-1 circulating clades, the PGT121 h ad a 10 -fold higher median neutralizing 
potency than mAbs PG9, VRC01, or PGV04 and a 100 -fold higher potency than 
2G12, b12, or 4E10 (30). While PGT121 neutralized a smaller percentage of the 
panel of pseudoviruses than VRC01 at an IC 50 < 50 mcg/mL (63% for PGT121 
vs. 93% for VRC01), it exhibited high potency against the sensitive strains, with 
neutralization of 44% of the 162 -virus panel at an IC 50 < 0.1 mcg/mL. This 
percentage is almost twice the neutralization under the same conditions as PG9, 
VRC01, PGV04 and 20 –[ADDRESS_634710] been investigated previously in passive protection studies (30, 
67, 68) . 
4.2.2  VRC07 -523LS (VRC -HIVMAB075 -00-AB) 
VRC07 -523LS is a human mAb targeting the HIV -1 CD4  binding site , developed 
by [CONTACT_18127] -NIH at the VRC. A similar antibody, VRC01, also targeting the CD4  
binding site, is currently in clinical  trials for both HIV -1 prevention (IND 113,611 
and IND 125,494) and therapeutic (IND 126,001, IND 126,664, and IND 
113,017) indications. VRC01 was originally isolated from a subject infected with 
HIV-1 for more than 15 years whose immune system controlled the virus without 
ART (69, 70) . Through advances in B -cell immunology, cloning, and structure -
guided optimization techniques, numerous HIV -1 neutralizing mAbs, including 
VRC07 (“07” denotes sequential numbering when discovered), were isolated and 
subsequentl y engineered to have potency and breadth greater than those of earlier 
antibodies (36). This protocol will use VRC07 -523LS (“523” denotes sequential 
numbering when the engineered variant was generated; “LS” denotes 2 ami no 
acid mutations).  
The VRC07 (wild -type) heavy chain was identified by 454 deep sequencing based 
on its similarity to VRC01 and  was then engineered to pair it with the VRC01 
(wild -type) light chain. The mutations that together define the [ADDRESS_634711] amino acid residue of the light chain  (36). The LS 
designation in VRC07 -523LS specifies methionine to leucine (L) and asparagine 
to serine (S) (M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) changes within the C -terminus of 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 24 of 188 the heavy chain constant region. The LS mutation was introduced by [CONTACT_3725] -directed 
mutagenesis to increase the binding affinity for the neonatal Fc -receptor (FcRn); 
this mutation increases the recirculation of functional immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
(40, 62) , thus, increasing plasma half -life. 
VRC07 -523LS was found to be 5 - to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, with an 
IC50 < 50 mcg/mL against 96% of HIV -1 pseudoviruses representing the major 
circulating HIV -1 clades, and an IC 50 < 1 mcg/mL against 92% of HIV -1 viruse s 
tested (36). In addition, it displayed minimal levels of autoreactivity.

escalation, open -label clinical trial is aiming to examine the safety, tolerability, 
dose, and pharmacokinetics of PGT121.414.LS with and without  
VRC07 -523LS, a CD4 binding site  mAb. The hypothesis is that PGT121.414.LS 
alone and paired with VRC07 -523LS will be safe for administration to healthy 
adults by [CONTACT_493421].  
In Part A of the study, PGT121.414.LS will be administered via IV infusion at 3, 
10, or 30 mg/kg (G roups 1 -3) or via SC infusion  at 5 mg/kg (Group 4). Each 
group in Part A will have 3 participants . At each of 3 visits in Part B of the study, 
participants will receive consecutive administration of PGT121.414.LS followed 
by [CONTACT_33805]07 -523LS, at 20 mg/kg IV eac h per dose (Group 5) or 5 mg/kg SC each 
per dose (Group 6).  Each group in Part B will have [ADDRESS_634713] administration via SC infusion . 
Cumulative safety data will be reviewed on a daily basis by [CONTACT_493422] ( ie, Clinical Safety Specialist nurses and physicians) and reviewed at 
least weekly  by [CONTACT_106885] 136/HPTN 092 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT)

safety at least [ADDRESS_634714] administration in all groups (see Section

intravenously and subcutaneously, and that the half -life of PGT121.414.LS is

gathering additional data on this mAb (see Section 4.6).  
Additionally, IAVI T001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is assessing PGT121 alone, IAVI T002 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is gathering data on PGT121 administered in combination with 
PGDM1400 (10, 45 -47) and IAVI T003 (NCT037215 10) is evaluating PGT121 
administered in either a dual combination with VRC07 -523LS or a triple 
combination with VRC07 -523LS and PGDM1400 (see Section 4.6). 
HVTN 136/HPTN 0 92 Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 26 of 188 Furthermore, the HVTN 130/HPTN 089 study is designed to gather safety 
information on the dual combination groups (PGT121+VRC07 -523LS) and in the 
triple combination Group (PGDM1400+PGT121+VRC07 -523LS). The HVTN 
130/HPTN 089 protocol opened in  July 2019 (see  Section 4.6). 
4.3.1  Dose, schedule and route of administration  
The doses and dosing schedule to be used in the HVTN 136/HPTN 092 clinical 
trial were sele cted based on prior clinical experience with VRC07 -523LS and 
PGT121, as well as on PK modeling using nonclinical and clinical data for 
VRC07 -523LS and PGT121.  
The proposed doses for Groups 1, 2, and 3 in Part A (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg IV), 
were selected based on previously tested doses of PGT121 in preclinical studies 
and in the IAVI T001 and IAVI T002 clinical trials. Because PGT121.414.LS is 
formulated in higher concentrations than PGT121, it is possible to administer a 
higher dose (5 vs. 3 mg/kg) via the SC route.  
Part A has a dose -escalation design, starting at the same low dose of antibody (3 
mg/kg IV) that was used as a starting dose in IAVI T001, the first in human trial 
of PGT121.  
In Part B, dosing is scheduled every 16 weeks based on preclinical and cl inical 
data of VRC07 -523LS and PGT121. The choice of 20 mg/kg dose IV and 5 
mg/kg SC aligns with ongoing protocols using VRC07 -523LS either alone 
(VRC605 and HVTN 127/HPTN 087) or in combination with PGT121 (IAVI 
T003 and HVTN 130/HPTN 089).  
The doses of V RC07 -523LS in Part B were selected using model -based 
predictions of this mAb serum concentration over time following IV and SC 
administrations of VRC07 -523LS. Predictions were generated through 
simulations of PK data on VRC07 -523LS serum concentrations bas ed on a PK 
model of the VRC605 study. Moreover, dose and dosing intervals of [ADDRESS_634717] high probability of achieving a trough 
above 1 mcg/mL for VRC07 -523LS and likely for PGT121.414.LS ( Figure 4-5), 
where 1 mcg/mL was shown to provide excellent coverage of the bnAb 
combination against a broad panel of viruses in vitro  (Figure 4-2). 
An additional benefit to testing low doses of PGT121.414.LS, particularly the 5 
mg/kg SC dose, is to collect PK data at low concentrations where this product 
may still have antiviral activity. Data from the IAVI T001 tria l have shown that 
the antibody PGT121 has very high potency in humans, with suppression of virus 
in HIV infected individuals (off all antiretr ovirals) at concentrations 
< 0.7 mcg/mL. Therefore, it would be important to know the PK parameters of the 
antibod y at these very low concentrations. This window of the concentration -time 
profile is more likely to be captured following low dose administrations, given the 
more frequent sampling following product administration. Characterizing low 
concentrations could b e missed following the high dose administration as these

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 27 of 188 are likely to occur when sampling is sparse, with the possibility that 
concentrations fall below the limit of quantification between visits.  
Moreover, Figure 4-4 shows the predicted serum concentrations of VRC07 -523LS 
following multiple IV infusions at 20 mg/kg or multiple SC injections at 5 mg/kg 
every 8 to 20 weeks. These concentrations were simulated based on population 
PK models using PK data observed in VRC605  for VRC07 -523LS.

at 20  mg/kg or SC injections at 5 mg/kg. Shown are median (solid lines), 5th and 95th percentiles  
(shaded areas) of predicted drug levels with values truncated at 0.55 mcg/mL.  
In these simulations, the body weights of hypothetical trial participants were 
randomly drawn with replacement from the sample of body weights collected in 
the HVTN 104 study of  VRC01 in US sites, some of which will be used in this 
study (71, 72) . In addition, linear PK was assumed for the VRC07 -523LS so that 
PK parame ters estimated based on single -dose settings carried forward to 
multiple -dose settings. The PK parameters used in the simulations were estimated 
based on observed serum concentration data for VRC07 -523LS at 5, 20, and 40 
mg/kg following a single IV infusio n, at 20 mg/kg following three 12 -weekly IV 
infusions, at 5mg/kg following a single and at 5 mg/kg following three 12 -weekly

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634718] IV infusion of 
VRC07 -523LS at a dose level of 20 mg/kg, the mean serum concentrations were 
predicted to be 28.5, 9.0 , and 2.8 mcg/mL, respectively at 16, [ADDRESS_634719] SC injection at a dose level of 5 mg/kg,  the mean 
serum concentration was predicted to be 3.9, and 1.2 mcg/mL, respectively, at [ADDRESS_634720] injection. In addition, the chance of observing trough serum 
concentrations that are greater than  1 mcg/mL at [ADDRESS_634721] 
administration is >95% for both 20 mg/kg IV and 5 mg/kg SC VRC07 -523LS. 
Given the IC [ADDRESS_634722] diverse 
panels of viruses (see Section 6.1). Thus, based on currently available data, in 
Groups [ADDRESS_634723] high 
probability of achieving a trough above 1 mcg/mL for VRC07 -523LS, and  likely 
for PGT121.414.LS. This threshold of 1 mcg/mL is the limit of detection of the 
currently used anti -idiotypic enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 
mAb serum concentrations . 
Substantial safety data have already been collected over several tr ials on products 
related to VRC07 -523LS, including VRC01 and VRC01LS. These studies have 
demonstrated the safety and tolerability of the IV administration of each of these 
individual mAbs at doses similar to or greater than those proposed in this study. 
For example, in VRC 606 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the doses for VRC01LS in HIV -
uninfected participants ranged between 1 and 40 mg/kg for IV administrations. 
Moreover, in multiple studies, including VRC 601, VRC 602, HVTN 104, 
RV397, RV398, A5340, A5342, and P1112, dose s for VRC01 in HIV -uninfected 
and/or HIV -infected participants ranged between 1 and 40 mg/kg for IV 
administrations.  
Given the reassuring safety profile of VRC07 -523LS, PGT121, and similar mAbs 
given via IV and SC routes in previous studies and ongoing tri als evaluating these 
mAbs either individually or in combination (see Section 4.6), placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_493394].

This protocol is part of a path to an efficacy trial of a triple bnAb combination 
comprising CD4 -binding site  + V2 -apex + V3 -glycan bnAbs. The CD4 binding 
bnAb (VRC07 -523LS) will serve as the “backbone” for future dual - and triple -
combination mAb regimens. This protocol complements HVTN 130/HPTN [ADDRESS_634725] to PK, neutralization breadth, 
and potency. HV TN 130/HPTN 089 is testing the combination of VRC07 -523LS 
and non -LS versions of PGT121 and PGDM1400. It is expected that future 
studies will evaluate mAb combinations incorporating LS -modified versions of all 
3 antibodies  in preparation for a planned effi cacy trial . HVTN 136/HPTN 092

is important to establish the behavior of VRC07 -523LS and PGT121.414.LS 
when co -administered intravenously and subcutaneously, to determine whether 
co-administr ation alters the expected safety, tolerability, PK and neutralizing 
activity of the products compared to when they are administered as single agents.  
Other mAb  interventions for HIV -1 in the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_493395]:  
1. Trispecific antibody SAR441236 (Sano fi), inc orporating Fa b portions of 
VRC01, 10E8v4, and PGDM1400 along with an LS modification, which will 
undergo phase 1 clinical testing in HVTN 129/HPTN 088  
2. Bispecific 10E8.4/iMab (ADAR C/Gates) that began phase 1  testing in early 
2019  
3. Dual combination of 3BNC117LS (CD4 -binding site ) and 10 -1074LS (V3 -
glycan) slated to begin phase 1/2 testing in the second half of 2019 
(Rockefeller University/IAVI/Gates), and  
4. Dual combination of VRC07 -523LS and CAP256LS for South Africa, 
(VRC/CAPRISA).  
The u nique dual combination of VRC07 -523LS + PGT121.414.LS in HVTN 
136/HPTN 092 will provide critical information to guide future trials of mAbs 
incorporating LS -modified versions of a V2 -apex bnAb ( eg, PGDM1400LS). This 
triple combination is expected to have f avorable safety, tolerability and PK, and to 
be superior to VRC01 for protection efficacy against multiple genetic subtypes of 
HIV-1 in different parts of the world.  
4.5 Preclinical studies  
4.5.1  Preclinical studies of PGT121  
PGT121 has been assessed in a non -Good Laboratory Practice  (GLP ) 
pharmacokinetic rat study, a GLP  in vitro tissue cross -reactivity study (TCR), and 
a GLP repeat -dose toxicity study in rats. In the repeat -dose toxicity study, animals 
were given 30 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg intravenously or 30 mg/kg sub cutaneously at 
weekly intervals over a 28 -day period. There were minor disturbances in the 
plasma proteins with higher total protein, albumin and globulin resulting in a 
lower albumin/globulin ratio. There was also transient local microscopic 
inflammation (fibrosis, mixed cell inflammation) at the injection site following 
subcutaneous administration, which increased in severity and/or incidence 
compared to the control animals. The findings resolved after a [ADDRESS_634727] -level (NOAEL) for intravenous 
administration was 300 mg/kg and for subcutaneous injection was 30 mg/kg, 
which were the highest dose levels administered.  
PGT121 can neutralize a wide array of HIV -1 viruses  in vitro  and can treat and 
prevent simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in the NHP model.

The Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH evaluated the in vivo 
pharmacokinetic profile of PGT121.414 .LS in three human FcRn transgenic mice  
(74-76). In this study, we tested PGT121.414 .LS (lot #S -20190121 -1) produced 
from a stably transfected CHO cell line. The antibod y was given at a single bolus 
dose of 10 mg/kg via the intravenous route. The levels of antibody in the sera of 
these animals at various time points up to 28 days after administration were then 
quantitated by [CONTACT_2017] -PGT121 idiotype based ELISA method. Figure 4-5 shows 
the sera levels of PGT121.414 .LS in each animal, with levels maintained above 
10 mcg/mL up to day [ADDRESS_634728] infusion in all animals. After day 9, the sera levels of

4.5.3  Preclinical studies of VRC07 -523LS  
VRC07 -523LS has been assessed in several preclinical safety studies evaluating 
potential off -target binding, TCR, toxicity, and local tolerance.  
VRC07 -523LS was found to be 5 - to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, with an 
IC50 < 50 mcg/mL against 96% of HIV -1 pseudoviruses representing the major 
circulating HIV -1 clades, and an IC 50 < 1 mcg/mL against 92% of HIV -1 viruses 
tested. In addition, it displayed minimal levels of autoreactivity.  
In vivo p roof-of-concept studies showed that VRC07 -523LS is about 5 -fold more 
potent than VRC01LS in Rhesus macaques and displays a longer half -life (9.8 
days) than VRC07 (4.9 days) after a single dose of mAb at 10 mg/kg administered 
intravenously (36).

4.6.1  Clinical studies of PGT121  
[IP_ADDRESS]  IAVI T001  
IAVI T001 is a phase 1 randomized placebo -controlled clinical trial of the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of PGT121 in HIV -uninfected and HIV -
infected adults. The study design is shown below in Table 4-5. 
Table 4-5: IAVI T001 study schema  
 
The hypothesis in IAVI T001 is that PGT121 administration will be safe by [CONTACT_493425]. The secondary  hypothesis is that PGT121 will be detectable in 
human sera with a definable half -life. As of March 2019, accrual is complete in 
Groups 1A -1C (HIV -uninfected, 3 -30 mg/kg, IV route), Group 1D (HIV -
uninfected, 3 mg/kg, SC route), Groups 2A -2C (HIV -infected o n ART, 3 -30 
mg/kg, IV route) and 2B (HIV -infected, 10 mg/kg, IV route) , and Group 3A  
(HIV -infected not on ART, 30 mg/kg IV route). There are 2 remaining slots open 
for enrollment in Group 3D (HIV -infected off ART with low viral load). Among 
all participan ts, there was short -lived, mild or moderate local and systemic 
reactogenicity. There were no HIV infections, pregnancies or deaths. One 
participant discontinued early after 10 weeks of follow up. There has been 1 
serious adverse event (SAE) that was assess ed as not related. The SAE was a case 
of pre -patellar bursitis occurring 2 months after administration of the

In VRC 605, a total of 41 administrations of VRC07 -523LS occurred during the 
study. VRC07 -523LS was safe and well tolerated, with no SAEs or dose -limiting 
toxicities. All reported local and systemic reactogenicity was mild to moderate in 
severity. Six AEs were determined to be possibly related to VRC07 -523LS 
administration. One participant in group 5 exhibited grade 1 dizziness on the day 
of infusion, and 1 in group 7 reported grade 1 abdominal pain the day after 
infusion. Two volunteers (one each in groups  5 and 7) displayed either grade 1 or 
grade 2 infusion reactions following each administration, with symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_493396]: fever, chills, 
myalgia, nausea, and headache. Sera collected from the group 7 participant after 
each infusion showed an elevation of serum cytokines including Tumor necrosis 
factor  alpha  (TNF -a), Interleukin  (IL)-6, and IL -13. Importantly, the levels of

Between February and October 2018, HVTN 127/HPTN 087 enrolled 124 
healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants to receive multiple administrations of 
VRC07 -523LS via IV, SC, or IM routes (IM added in protocol version 2.0; 4 IM 
participants receive placebo). The primary objectives of the study are to assess 
safety and tolerability of repeated IV, SC, or IM administrations of VRC07 -
523LS and to characterize serum concentration over time for different doses, 
schedules, and routes of administration. Additional ob jectives include building a 
population PK model of VRC07 -523LS and determining whether ADAs emerge 
in response to repeated administrations of the antibody.  
One Grade 3 elevated alanine aminotransferase  (ALT ) deemed related to VRC07 -
523LS has been reported ; the remaining AEs deemed related have been grade 1 
(mild) or grade 2 (moderate). No related SAEs have been reported as of May 
2019.  Four mAb reactions have been reported in three participants, including: (1 ) 
grade 1 generalized pruritus in a participant in Group 2 (5 mg/kg IV) after her 
first infusion; (2) grade 1 generalized pruritus in a participant in Group 5 (5 mg/kg 
SC) after the second series of SC injections; and (3) two infusion related reactions 
in a participant in Group 3 (20 mg/kg IV) - the first occurred after his first infusion 
and was grade 2 and characterized by [CONTACT_346566], myalgia, arthralgia, malaise/fatigue,

4.7 Potential risks of study products and administration  
General Risks of mAbs : 
Overall, the side effects of mAbs (including for indications other than HIV)  are 
mild and can include fever, flushing, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
pain, pruritus, rash, u rticaria, angioedema, headache, dizziness, shortness of 
breath, bronch ospasm, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, and chest pain. 
There can also be a risk of infection from mAbs targeting human cytokines or 
human cell antigens, but since PGT121.414.LS and VRC07 -523LS target viral 
antigens rather than human cell surface a ntigens and are human mAbs, serious 
infusion reactions are expected to be rare (77). 
Additional reactions such as tumor lysis syndrome and cytokine release syndrome 
have been previously described with chimeric and humanized Abs, usually with 
mAbs targeting human antigens  used in the treatment of rheumatological 
disorders and cancer . Cytokine release syndrome has been described with human 
mAbs targeting lymphocyte cell -surface antigens. Serious allergic reactions suc h 
as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and hypoxia are rare 
and often associated with mAbs targe ting human proteins or with non human 
mAbs. These mAb -related events typi[INVESTIGATOR_493397] [ADDRESS_634746] been described for several FDA -licensed mAbs. Cytokine release 
syndrome can be effectively managed by [CONTACT_493428], 
administering anti -histamines, and restarting the IV infusion at a slower rate (78). 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634747] 24 hours after beginning 
administration. Delayed allergic reactions to a mAb may include a serum sickness 
type of reaction, characterized by [CONTACT_22815], fever, lymph node enlargement, and 
joint pains. These symptoms may no t appear until several days to a few weeks 
after the exposure to the mAb and are noted to be more common with chimeric 
types of mAb (77, 79) . 
Other potential side effects of mAbs include thrombocytopenia, autoimmune 
diseases, cancer, dermatitis,  and cardiotoxicity (77). 
Risks of the study product(s):  
Experience is accruing with ea ch of the PGT121 and VRC07523 -LS mAbs alone 
and in combinations mentioned above (Section 4.6) but HVTN 136/HPTN [ADDRESS_634748] been no related SAEs. There has been 1 unrelated SAE (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493398]-patelar  
bursitis ) in T001. To date, there have been n o study safety pauses for AEs and 
product administrations have been generally well tolerated.  
To date, the clinical trial safety experience with VRC01 -class mAbs has been 
reassuring. In HVTN 104, IV administration of VRC01 was generally well -
tolerated with  mild pain and/or tenderness commonly reported at the site of the IV 
infusion. Mild -to-moderate systemic reactogenicity symptoms were reported by 
[CONTACT_33805]01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_493399] 1 of the infusions, but there was no clear 
relationship with frequency or severity to the dose of VRC01 (72). SC 
administration of VRC01 was generally well-tolerated and associated with mild to 
moderate local pain and/or tenderness, but there was no difference in the 
frequency or severity between VRC01 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_493400]. 
Erythema and/or induration at the SC injection sites were generally less than 25 
cm2 whether VRC01 or placebo was injected (72). No hypersensitivity reactions 
or cytokine rele ase syndrome symptoms were reported in HVTN 104 (72).  
The ongoing efficacy trials HVTN 704/HPTN 085 and HVTN 703 /HPTN [ADDRESS_634749] accumulated significant additional VRC01 clinical experience . More than 
20,000 infusions of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg VRC01 have been given to more than 
5000 HIV-uninfected adults in both trials . However, as these trials remain 
blinded, they do not yet contribute to the unblinded VRC01 safety profile.  
Early -phase human experience with administration of VRC07 -523LS has been 
reassuring in the VRC605 and HVTN127/ HPTN 087 trials (see Section 4.6.2 ). 
The majority of participants have reported no local or systemic Solicited AEs and 
no Unsolicited AEs. Severe reactions associated with mAb administration, such as 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634750] not been observed to date in trials of VRC01 -class mAbs.  
Risk of HIV seroreactivity: There is a possibility that receipt of the study products 
will cause a reactive result on some currently available HIV test kits, especially if 
testing occurs close to study product administration timepoints (see Section 
9.5.1 ). 
Risks of blood drawing : Blood drawing may cause pain and bruising and may 
infrequently cause a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting. Rarely, it may cause 
infection at the site w here the blood is taken. Problems from use of an IV for 
blood drawing are generally mild and may include pain, bruising, minor swelling 
or bleeding at the IV site and rarely, infection, phlebitis, or blood clot. Risk will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_493429]. Blood drawing 
may also cause anemia.  
Risks of IV infusion : The placement of an intravenous catheter can allow for the 
development of bacteremia because of the contact [CONTACT_493430] . Risk of infection from IV infusion will be 
minimized through careful decontamination of local skin prior to catheter 
placement and through the use of infection control practices during infusion. The 
risk of product contamination will be minimized by [CONTACT_493431].  
Risks of SC infusion : SC administration can result in pain, nodule formation, local 
edema, and possible infection. The risk of infection from SC administratio n will 
be minimized through skin decontamination of the skin prior to needle insertion. 
The risk of product contamination will be the same as for IV administration and 
will be minimized through the use of aseptic technique during product preparation 
and ad ministration.

6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target enrolling 32 healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants. In 
Part A of the study, PGT121.414.LS  will be administered a s a single IV infusion 
at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg (Groups 1 -3) or a 5 mg/kg SC dose (Group 4)  with n=3 
participants per group. Groups 1 and 2 will enroll sequentially, and Groups 3 and 
4 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. In Part B of the study, participants wi ll receive 
3 doses of PGT121.414.LS + VRC07 -523LS at 20 mg/kg IV each per dose 
(Group 5) or 5 mg/kg SC each per dose (Group 6).  Groups 5 and 6 will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio with n=[ADDRESS_634753] approximately 40% of each . In Part A, each of Groups [ADDRESS_634754] administration, all 
participants will provide some safety data. However, it is possible that data may 
be missing for various reasons, such as participants terminating from the study 
early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406] , or high assay background. For this reason, 
the sample size calculations account for 20% of enrolled participants having 
missing data for the primary lab endpoint at a given timepoint. As a reference, 
immunogenicity data from 17 phase 1 and 2 phase 2a HVT N vaccine trials, which 
began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of September 2014), indicate that 17% is 
a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data at a given timepoint. In HVTN 
104 (phase 1 trial of VRC01), approximately 15% of mAb concentration data 
were missing at the primary timepoints .

true rate of such an event is 53.6% or more; and there is a 90% or more chance of

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for serum mAb concentrations  
Primary objective 2 of this study is to evaluate serum concentrations of VRC07 -
523LS and PGT121.414.LS  at several timepoints (ie, pharmacokinetics) 
following IV or SC administration of these mAbs. This objective is descriptive in 
nature and will be accompl ished by [CONTACT_493433]. The precision with which a true mean concentration can be 
estimated from observed data depends on the standard de viation (SD) of the 
measurements and the sample size. Table 6-2 displays two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for the mean mAb concentration for se veral values of the observed 
average mAb concentration. The construction of these confidence intervals 
assumed sample sizes of n = 8 per arm, reflecting a missingness rate of 20%, 
compared to a planned treatment group size of 10 participants. The calculati ons

6.2 Randomization  
There will be no randomization for Groups  1 and 2 as they will be enrolled 
sequentially for dose escalation. Contingent on safety data from Groups 1 and 2, 
Groups 3 and 4 will be randomized and enrolled simultaneously. Contingent on 
data from Groups 1 -4, Groups 5 and 6 will be randomized in blocks  to ensure 
balance across groups for simultaneous enrollment. A participant’s randomization 
assignment will be computer generated and provided to the CRS pharmacist 
through a Web -based randomization system.

Participants and CRS staff will be unbl inded to participant group assignments. 
Laboratory program staff will be unblinded to whether a sample is from Part A or

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634761] administration time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
will address how to analyze the participant’s safety data. Analyses of safety data 
are modified intent -to-treat (MITT) in that individuals who are randomized but 
not enrolled do not contribu te data and hence are excluded. Because of the brief 
length of time between randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 
working days —very few such individuals are expected. The primary analysis of 
mAb concentration and neutralizing activity data are per -protocol (PP) in that 
only individuals who receive the expected mAb combination at the expect dose 
level within the expected visit window contribute data. Secondary analysis will 
also involve the MITT cohort, and when necessary account for the actu al 
specimen collection time, and the actual time and dose amount of each product 
administration.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be performed using SAS and R. Additional 
software may be used to perform non -compartmental PK and population PK 
analyses (e g, NONMEM). All other descriptive and inferential statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS, StatXact, or R statistical software.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple 
primary or secondary endpoints. However, multip licity adjustments will be made 
for certain primary or secondary endpoint assays, as discussed below, when the 
assay endpoint is viewed as a collection of hypotheses (eg, testing multiple 
pseudoviruses to determine a positive antiviral activity response). Unless 
otherwise noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be considered 
statistically significant if p  < 0.05.

Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 55 of 188 6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollme nt is concurrent with receiving the first study product 
administration, all participants will have received at least [ADDRESS_634763] administration 
and therefore will provide some safety data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Solicited AEs  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of Solicited 
AE sign or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_493434]. For a given sign or symptom reported 
more than once, each participant’s Solicited AEs will be counted once under the  
maximum severity for all infusion visits. In addition, to the individual types of 
events, the maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, 
and of systemic symptoms will be calculated. Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to 
test for differences in severity between arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAEs and Unsolicited AEs  
Unsolicited AEs will be summarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and 
preferred terms. Tables will show by [CONTACT_493435] a System Organ Class or 
within preferred term category by [CONTACT_145661]. For 
the calculations in these tables, a participant with multiple Unsolicited AEs within 
a category will be counted once under the maximum seve rity or the strongest 
recorded causal relationship to study product. Formal statistical testing comparing 
arms is not planned since interpretation of differences must rely heavily upon 
clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory S upport Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study product, time between onset and last study product administration, and 
number of study product administrations received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local laboratory values   
Box plots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for 
values measured during the course of the study by [CONTACT_31703]. Each 
box plot will show the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Outliers 
(values  outside the box plot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines 
representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by 
[CONTACT_106865], as well as ch anges from baseline for postenrollment 
values. In addition, the number (percentage) of participants with local laboratory 
values recorded as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as specified in the 
Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult a nd Pediatric Adverse 
Events (version specified in Study Specific Procedures [ SSP]/Statistical Analysis 
Plan [ SAP]) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_493436] 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019

associated clinical diagnosis will also be included in the tabulation of AEs 
described above.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for study product administration discontinuation and early study 
termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue study product 
administration and who terminate the study early will be tabulated by [CONTACT_493437].  
6.4.4  Serum concentration and PK analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary analyses of serum concentrations  
The primary analysis of serum concentration and pharmacokinetics of the 
evaluated mAb s (Primary Objective 2) will be restricted to participants who 
received all scheduled administrations per -protocol. Serum concentrations that 
appear unreliable, or from specimens collected outside of the visit window, or 
from HIV -infected participants post infection may be excluded. The primary 
analysis of serum concentration will be descriptive and will be performed 
separately for each mAb. A non -compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis will be 
performed on the concentration data. Pharmacokinetic parameters m ay include, 
but are not limited to: area -under -the-curve (AUC), maximum concentration 
(Cmax), time to C max (Tmax), clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd), terminal 
elimination rate constant (λz) and the terminal half -life (T 1/2). Data will be 
summariz ed by [CONTACT_493438], Vd, and T 1/2. Individual -level two -
compartmental models may also be considered. Graphical displays of the data ( eg, 
boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, spaghetti plots) will be generated to visually 
explore distributional pr operties of the data as well as potential pairwise 
associations. These summary statistics and graphical displays may be produced 
for each treatment arm and each timepoint separately.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory analyses of serum concentrations via population PK models  
Population PK (popPK) models of each mAb may be developed to describe the 
overall kinetics of serum concentration and the variation of the kinetics between 
and within healthy, HIV -uninfected adults based on non -linear mixed effects 
models. Data from all enrol led participants will be analyzed regardless of how 
many administrations and how much mAb dose they received (MITT analysis). 
Serum concentration data from specimens collected outside of the visit window 
may be included in popPK analyses that account for t he actual specimen 
collection time, and the actual time and dose amount of each product 
administration. Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any serum level 
data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative 
sample and thereafter may be excluded. All data from HIV -infected participants 
who have no seronegative samples post enrollment may be excluded from the 
analysis.  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 57 of 188 The popPK models will describe the pharmacokinetics of each mAb at the 
individual level using a compartmental approach. Based on a previous population 
PK analysis of the serum concentrations of VRC01 (71), we anticipate that a two -
compar tmental model can characterize the kinetics of the serum concentrations of 
the mAbs. In the event that modeling assumptions appear violated, we will 
consider other compartmental models. Comparisons of PK parameters across 
treatment groups will be performed  using either likelihood ratio or Wald tests. 
Estimates of metrics of interest as a function of the PK parameters, including half -
life and steady state concentration will be derived from these analyses.  
6.4.5  Analysis of neutralization activity and correlation w ith serum 
concentrations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary and secondary analyses of serum neutralization titers  
The primary analysis of serum neutralization titers against each mAb -specific 
virus will be restricted to participants who received all scheduled administrations 
per-protocol. Serum neutralization titers that appear unreliable, or from specimens 
collected outside of the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants post 
infection may be excluded. This analysis of serum neutralization titers will be 
descriptive and will be performed separately for each mAb. To address Secondary 
objective 3, at each specified timepoint, the area -under -the-magnitude -breadth 
curve (AUC -MB) to a panel of viral isolates (80) will be computed for each 
participant with evaluable neutralization ID 50 or ID 80 data, as described in (81). 
Magnitude –Breadth (M -B) curves may be employed to display individual - and 
group -level response breadth as a function of magnitude. Response breadth is 
defined as the percentage of viruses in the panel with neutralization titer above 
certain thresholds. T wo choices are to compare the M -B curves among arms, as 
follows: a non -parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test on the subject -specific area -
under -the M -B curve (AUC M -B) or a Kolmogorov -Smirnov type test on the [ADDRESS_634764] approach may be adopted. Details of either approach will be 
described in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary analyses of correlations between serum concentrations and 
serum neutralization levels  
To address Secondary objective 1, data from all enrolled participants will be 
analyzed regardless of how many administrations and how much mAb dose they 
received (MITT analysis). Besides descriptive analyses of the correlations, 
pharmacodynamics (PD) models based on either linear or non -linear mixed 
effects models may be performed to characterize the correlation between serum 
concentration (observed or popPK model -predicted) and serum neutralization 
against each virus or the AUC -MB of serum neutralization against the panel. 
Similar to the popPK analysis, data from specimens collected outside of the visit 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 58 of 188 window may be included in the PK/PD analyses that account for the actual 
specimen collection time, and the actual time and dose amount of each product 
administration. Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any serum 
concentration data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last 
seronegative sample and thereafter may be excluded. All data from HIV -infected 
participants who have no seronegative samples post enrollment  may be excluded 
from the analysis.  
6.4.6  Analysis of ADA and other functional activities in serum  
For the analysis of ADA (Secondary objective 4), data from enrolled participants 
will be used regardless of how many administrations they received (MITT). For 
Expl oratory objectives regarding non -neutralizing anti -viral functionality, data 
from all enrolled participants will be used. Assay results that are unreliable or 
from HIV -infected participants post infection will be excluded. Additional 
exploratory analyses e xamining the impact of ADA on PK will be described in 
the SAP.  
Univariate and bivariate descriptive analyses of continuous assay data (eg, 
ADCC) will be performed using mean, median, standard deviation, range, 
skewness, Spearman’s and Pearson’s correlation coefficients, for example. 
Graphical displays of the data base d on appropriate techniques (eg, boxplots, 
histograms, kernel density estimates, probability plots, two - or three -dimensional 
scatterplots, and spaghetti plots) will be generated to visually explore 
distributional properties of the data as well as potentia l pairwise associations. 
Statistics and graphical displays will be produced for each treatment arm across 
timepoints.  
Comparisons of continuous assay data between treatment groups or timepoints 
will be primarily performed using nonparametric rank -based tes ts, the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test, or Friedman nonparametric two -way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). In the event the data appear normally distributed, the results of these 
tests may be compared to those produced by [CONTACT_493439] (eg, two -sample t -
tests with  unequal variances). Appropriate data transformations (eg, square -root, 
logarithmic) may be applied prior to testing hypotheses in order for key 
distributional assumptions [eg, normality, homoscedasticity (ie, constancy of 
variance)] to be satisfied.  
Analy ses of categorical variables (eg, binary) will be conducted by [CONTACT_493440]. One such table will be produced for each treatment group and 
each timepoint. Crude response rates will be presented with their corresponding 
95% confidence interv al estimates calculated using the score test method (72). 
Associations between categorical variables will be assessed using Fisher’s exact, 
Barnard’s exact test, or Chi -squared tests.  
Analysis of longitudinal data may be performed using mixed effects model s or 
generalized estimating equations (GEE). These approaches allow describing 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634765] correlation.  
To achieve unbiased statistical estimation and inferences with nonparametric tests 
and generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_493441], missing data need to be 
missing completely at random (MCAR). MCAR assumes that missingness does 
not depend on any observed or unobserved data (ie, the observed data is just a 
random sample of all the potential data). When missingness is negligible (eg, less 
than 20%), statistical methods (eg, nonparametric tests and GEE methods) based 
on the MCAR assumption can be used with limited impact on the analysis.  
When the frequency of missing data is more subs tantial, methods that require the 
MCAR assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, statistical 
analyses will be performed based on appropriate modeling assumptions and 
adjusted using weighting methods, or combined with imputation, under the 
assumption that the missing data are missing at random (MAR). MAR assumes 
that the probability of an observation being missing only depends on the observed 
responses or covariates. Thus, this assumption is less stringent than the MCAR 
assumption. Weighting  adjustments (eg, weighted GEE) and imputation methods 
are valid under MAR. We will consider including any of the available baseline 
predictors of the missing outcomes as covariates in statistical models. Please see 
Little and Rubin (82), Chapters 1, 3, and 6] for elaborate definitions and examples 
of missing data mechanisms and Ibrahim et al (83) for a review of missing data 
methods in clinical  studies . 
Generalized linear models for response rates will use a binomial error distribution 
and for quantitative endpoints, a normal error distribution. We will assess 
repeated functional measurement using linear mixed effects models. If functional 
activ ity outcomes are left - and/or right - censored, we will use Hughes’  (84) linear 
mixed effects models to accommodate censoring. In addition, exploratory 
analyses of repeated functional measurements may be done using weighted GEE 
(85) methods, which are valid under MAR. We will again consider in cluding any 
of the available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes as covariates in 
statistical models.  
6.4.7  Analyses prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromis e the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or laboratory endpoint assessments.

Participants will be healthy, HIV -uninfected (seronegative) adults who 
comprehend the purpose of the study and have p rovided written informed consent. 
Volunteers will be recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. Final 
eligibility determination will depend on information available  at the time of 
enrollment, including results of screening laboratory tests, medical history, 
physical examinations, and answers to self -administered and/or interview 
questions.  
Investigators should always use good clinical judgment in considering a 
volun teer’s overall fitness for trial participation. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other conditions may make evaluation of 
safety and/or other end points  difficult, and some volunteers may be poor 
candidates for retention.  
Determination of eligibility, taking into account all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, must be made within 56 days prior to enrollment unless otherwise noted 
in Section s 7.1 and 7.2. 
7.1 Inclusion criteria  
General and Demog raphic Criteria  
1. Age of 18 to 50 years  
2. Access to a participating CRS  and willingness to be followed for the planned 
duration of the study  
3. Ability and willingness to provide informed consent  
4. Assessment of understanding : volunteer demonstrates understanding of this 
study  and completes a questionnaire prior to first study product administration  
with verbal demonstration of understanding of all questionnaire items answered 
incorrectly  
5. Agrees not to enroll in another study  of an investigational res earch agent  until 
completion of the last required protocol clinic visit  
6. Good general health  as shown by [CONTACT_9870], physical exam, and screening

The schedule s of clinical procedures are shown in Appendix N , Appendix O , 
Appendix P , and Appendix Q . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them while participating in a research 
study. The informed consent form (ICF) documents that a participant (1) has been 
informed about the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, and 
(2) is willing to participate in the study. Informed consent encompasses all written 
or verbal study information CRS staff provide to the particip ant, before and 
during the trial. CRS staff will obtain informed consent of participants according 
to HVTN and HPTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the study. Key study concepts 
should be reviewed periodically wit h the participant and the review should be 
documented. At each study visit, CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any new information is learned that might affect t he participants’ 
decisions to stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
A CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant consent ing. For 
example, some CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen people before they come 
to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must sign a screening or 
protocol -specific consent before any procedures are performed to determine 
eligibility. CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening materials to their 
IRB/EC and any applicable RE for human subjects protection review and 
approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “ Any 
entity/body that has the power to reg ulate which includes authorities that review 
submitted clinical data and those that conduct inspections. These are sometimes 
referred to as competent authorities. These are entities/bodies whose 
approval/authorization/acknowledgment of a clinical trial is required for 
conducting a clinical trial. Any organization whose approval is required prior to a 
CRS's participation in DAIDS funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trial. Includes 
but not limited to approvals from state/national health systems and administrativ e 
bodies, drug agencies etc. (DAIDS adopted from ICH E6). ” CRSs are responsible 
for knowing the requirements of their applicable REs.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634812] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE to use a 
general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
prevention clinical trial . In this way, CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
enrollment consent. Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any applicable RE may u se the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the eligibility criteria.  
9.1.2  Protocol -specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used and all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. 
Sample protocol -specific consent forms for the main study are located in 
Appendix A  and Appendix B . A separate sample consent form for other uses of 
specimens is located in Appendix D . 
Each CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent form(s) for 
local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent forms in Appendix A , 
Appendix B , and Appendix D . The consent form(s) must be developed in 
accordance with requirements of the following:  
▪ CRS’s IRB/EC and any applicable REs,  
▪ CRS’s institution, and  
▪ Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and 
Title 21 CFR, Part 50, and in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -
specific consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, 
issue s of cultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed consent forms include instructions for developi[INVESTIGATOR_493401].  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in  the 
current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634813] on the procedures 
and issues presente d, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant’s 
understanding of key concepts in this clinical trial. The participant must complete 
the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff ma y provide assistance 
in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
Participants must verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. 
This process and the participant’s understanding of the key concepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (includin g the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained thoroughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE, whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before study product administration on day 0. All inclusion and 
exclusion criteria must be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless 
otherwise specified in the eligibility criteria (or below in this section).  
After the appropriate informe d consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are performed:  
• Medical history, documented in the case history record  
• Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection (see  
Appendix R ).  
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin  
• Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], 
alternative/complementary medicines (eg, herbal and health food 
supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots

▪ Screening HIV  
▪ Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),  
▪ Anti-HCV Abs,  
▪ Syphilis,  
▪ Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential,  
▪ Chemistry panel (alanine  aminotransferase [ALT], creatinine),  
▪ Urine dipstick (urinalyses if indicated; see Section  9.7), 
▪ Urine or serum pregnancy test (volunteers who were assi gned female sex 
at birth); persons who are not of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (verified by 
[CONTACT_30219]) are not required to undergo pregnancy testing;  
• Administration of behavioral risk a ssessment questionnaire  
• Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 
2001 (available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-
053.html ) 
• Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section 9.5. 
• Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was assigned 
female sex at birth and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead 
to that partici pant becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin adequate birth 
control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the participant 
becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming 
pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from  another HVTN or HPTN study  
If a participant screens for an HVTN or HPTN study at the same CRS but then 
does not join that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant 
consent, the participant has signed a consent form to begin screening for this 
study, and the tests were conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2).

scheduled visits. These con tacts are reported as interim visits.  
9.5 HIV counseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the protoc ol-specific HIV testing algorithm 
following enrollment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV -infected during screening are not 
enrolled. Potential and e nrolled participants identified as HIV -infected will be 
referred for medical treatment, counseling, and management of the HIV infection. 
With respect to enrolled participants who become HIV -infected, see Section 9.12. 
It is theoretically possible that an anti -HIV mAb may suppress viral replication, 
which can reduce the ability to detect HIV, even if a person is actually infected.

administration timepoints.  
Study staff will advise study participants to confine their HIV testing while in the 
study to that provided through the CRS. Staf f will also inform study participants 
of the likelihood of routine HIV testing being offered or performed outside the 
study CRS at emergency rooms, clinics, and medical offices, and will inform 
participants of their right to opt out of HIV testing outside the study site. CRS 
staff should inform study participants if local and/or state/regional policies and 
regulations permit medical providers to perform HIV testing without first 
informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS staff should advise study 
participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff should also 
inform participants if positive results must be reported to local public health 
authorities. CRS staff should provide participants with CRS contact [CONTACT_493446]. 
The CRS can verify that the participant is in an HIV mAb clinical trial and should 
only be tested at the study CRS.

should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of using 
contraception and should be referred to specific counselin g, information, and 
advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in Section 7.1). 
This reminder should be documented in the par ticipant’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 
year) or having undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy —must be 
documented in the participant’s study record.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 86 of 188 9.7 Urine testing  
Dipstick testing may  be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is 
performed on urine obtained by [CONTACT_106916].  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to non -urinary blee ding (eg. 
menstruation) or infection, document this issue in the participant’s source 
documentation. For infection, provide appropriate treatment and/or referral and 
document this in the participant’s chart. Following resolution, repeat the dipstick 
and, i f within the eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the participant may be 
enrolled.  
Follow -up visit dipstick testing should be deferred if a participant is menstruating 
but should be performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnorma l 
due to a participant’s menstrual period, document in the comment section of the 
case report form (CRF) and repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer 
menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is not required. If a follow -up visit dipstick or 
micro -urinalysis is abnormal due to infection, provide appropriate treatment 
and/or referral and document this in the participant's source documentation. See

HIV-1–specific nAb assays will be performed on serum samples from study 
participants taken at post administration timepoint(s) and at baseline. The TZM -bl 
assay will test neutralization of a panel of mAb -specific viruses (one virus per 
mAb). The assay will  also test the neutralization of a panel of viruses that exhibit 
a range of known sensitivities to mAbs VRC07 -523LS and PGT121.414.LS . 
These viruses will be selected from a global panel and/or clade -specific  panels  
(80, 86)  and may be modified by [CONTACT_3725] -directed mutagenesis to be capable of 
measuring  the activity of each mAb individually.  
10.4.1  ADA detection assay  
A tiered testing approach will be used to identify and characterize ADAs that may 
arise. Anti -PGT121.414.LS  and VRC07 -523LS  antibody detection assays  will be 
performed on serum samples from study participants at indicated timepoints . 
Samples will be evaluated with a sensitive screening assay in Tier 1. Samples 
showing positive responses in the screening assay will be evaluated in a 
confirmatory assay of specificity. Specific, or Tier 2 positive res ponses will be 
characterized by [CONTACT_210578] (Tier 3).

10.5 Monoclonal Ab reaction assays  
To investigate mAb  reactions, serum samples collected after the onset of reaction 
may be tested to measure levels of certain markers (eg, tryptase, complement 
components [ C3 and C4 ], and cytokines ). ADA detection and functional assays, 
as described above, may be performed on serum samples taken prior to the study 
product administration associated with the reaction. Refer to the HVTN 
136/HPTN 092 SSP for more information . 
10.6 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be used for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology, antibody mediated prevention, or vaccines. In 
addition, cryopreserved samples may be used to perform additional assays to 
support standardization and vali dation of existing or newly developed methods.

The Networks  store specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by [CONTACT_106927] ( see Appendix D ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, the immune 
system, and other diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, 
genome -wide studies. This research is done only to the extent authorized in each 
study site’s informed consent form, or as otherwise authorized under applicable 
law. Other research  on specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and 
approval by [CONTACT_106885], the HPTN, the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the 
specimens, and the CRS’s IRBs/ECs/REs if required.  
As part of  consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimen s, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The Networks will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.

forwarding them to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE . 
11.1.3  Roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
The roles and responsibilities of the SDMC in relation to safety monitoring 
include:  
• Maintaining a central datab ase management system for clinical data;  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 94 of 188 • Providing reports of clinical data to appropriate groups such as the HVTN 
136/HPTN 092  PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section  11.1.2 ); 
The roles and responsibilities of the HVTN C linical Safety Specialist (CSS)  or 
HVTN Core designee in relation to safety monitoring include:  
• Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section 11.4); 
• Notifying CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds are 
instituted and lifted (see Section 11.4); 
• Querying CR Ss for additional information regarding reported clinical data; 
and 
• Providing support to the HVTN 136/HPTN [ADDRESS_634837] submit all safety forms (eg, Solicited AEs, Unsolicited AEs , 
urinalysis, local lab results, and concomitant medications) before the end of the 
next business day , excluding federal or bank holidays. The forms should not be 
held in anticipation of additional information at a later date. If additi onal 
information is received at a later date, the forms should be updated and 
resubmitted  before the end of the next business day after receiving the new 
information.  For the case of a longer site holiday closure, site staff must submit 
the data by [CONTACT_63277] 5th day (local time) after receiving the information even 
if this day is a holiday.   
For example : If the site becomes aware of an AE on Thursday (Day 0), the site 
must submit the data by [CONTACT_106930], on Friday. If there is a 
longer site h oliday closure, then this AE must  be reported no later than the end of 
the fifth day, Monday (Day 4). If Monday is a holiday as well, all safety forms

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 104 of 188 12.1 Social impacts  
It is pos sible that participants’ involvement in the study could result in social 
impacts. For example, a participant’s involvement in the study could become 
known to others, and a social harm may result (ie, because participants could be 
perceived as being HIV inf ected or at “high risk” for HIV infection). Participants 
could be treated unfairly, or could have problems being accepted by [CONTACT_493451]/or communities. Alternatively, a social benefit may result (eg, a participant 
could feel good helpi[INVESTIGATOR_38609]).  
Social harms are negative social impact events and social benefits are positive 
social impact events that a participant reports as affecting them as a result of 
being involved in a research study. It is not the researcher’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_493402] e vent has affected a participant. Social impacts will be collected and 
reported on CRFs during scheduled visits (see  Appendix N , Appendix O , 
Appe ndix P , and Appendix Q ). A social harm that is reported by [CONTACT_493452]/designee to be serious or unexpected will be reported to the 
responsible site’s IRB at least annually, or according to their individual 
requirements. In the event that a participant  reports a social harm, every effort 
will be made by [CONTACT_493453], and/or referral to appropriate resources for the safety and 
wellbeing of the participant. While maintaining partici pant confidentiality, study 
sites may engage their CAB in exploring the social context surrounding instances 
of social harms to minimize the potential occurrence of such an impact . 
12.[ADDRESS_634863] that its IRB/EC and 
any applicabl e RE  expedite review of the message. If this review cannot be 
completed in a timeframe consistent with the urgency of the required 
communication, the site can contact [CONTACT_106938]/EC approval if 
such communication is necessary to avoid immin ent harm to the study participant. 
The CRS must  notify the IRB/EC and any applicable RE  of the matter as soon as 
possible.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decid e to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the sam e as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
Key Information  
These are some of the things you should know about this study:  
• The purpose of the study is to understand how well antibodies against HIV 
work  when given alone and combined with other antibodies. We also want to 
see if the antibodies are safe to give to people and do not make them too 
uncomfortable.  
• If you choose to join, we will ask you to come to several study visits over 
about 6 -8 months. At  one of these visits you will get the study antibody in a 
vein (by [CONTACT_16228]) or under the skin (by [CONTACT_493458] , called SC). 
We will take blood from you at each study visit to see how your body 
responds to the study antibody and how much antibo dy is in your blood. We 
will test you for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and 
pregnancy (if applicable). We will ask you to complete questionnaires (many 
with questions of a personal nature) and you will have physical exams.  
• Some gene ral risks of antibodies include fever, chills, shaking, nausea, 
vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue, flushing, trouble breathing, high 
or low blood pressure, itchiness and rash. There may be other side effects that 
we don’t yet know about, even se rious ones. Because this is the first time the 
study antibody is being given to people, we do not know what all of the risks 
may be. We think that the risks will be similar to these general risks.  
• We do not expect the study antibody to benefit you in any w ay.

Please read it carefully.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network 
(HPTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a study to test a combination of different 
antibodies against HIV. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Antibodies are on e of 
the ways the human body fights infection. Antibodies are natural proteins that the 
body can make to prevent infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses from 
making you sick. Researchers can also make antibodies in laboratories and give 
them to peop le in a vein  (by [CONTACT_16228] ) or under the skin (by [CONTACT_493459] , called SC) . We will tell you more about these procedures below. 
Officially approved antibodies have been used successfully  to prevent or treat 
some other health problems, such as a virus that causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_493408].  
About 32 people will take part in this study at multiple clinics. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
There are 2 parts of this study, Part A and Part B. In Part A, we will give different 
doses of one of the study antibodies by [CONTACT_310152] . People in Part A will o nly get 
the study antibody one time. There will be about 12 people in Part A. When we 
know that there were no serious health problems in Part A , we will decide 
whether or not to do Part B . If we decide to do Part B, we will give about 20 more 
people a comb ination of both study antibodies by [CONTACT_310152]. We will give these 
antibodies three times . 
You are being invited to join Part A of the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
• Is the study antibody safe to give to people?  
• Are people able t o take the study antibody without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How much of the study antibody remains in the body as time passes?  
• How does the body’s response change depending on how the study antibody is 
given?  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8 , 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634888] study testing this antibody in people.  
The study antibody was developed by [CONTACT_493460] (CAVD).   
In laboratory studies, the study antibody attached to HIV. It also prevented 
infection by [CONTACT_493461].  
In animal studies, the study antibody protected animals from infection with the 
animal viruses t hat are very similar to HIV. The study antibody has also been 
tested for safety in the laboratory and in animals and it did not cause health 
problems. Even if something looks like it is safe or works in animals, it may not 
be true for people.  
We do not kn ow if the study antibody will prevent HIV when given to people. It 
will take many studies to learn if it will be useful for HIV prevention. This study 
will not answer that question.  
Risks of the study antibody : 
PGT121.414.LS  
Because this is the first time the antibody is being given to people, we do not 
know what all of the risks may be. We think that the risks will be similar to the 
general risks described  below . 
PGT121  
A similar study antibody called PGT121 was changed to make it last longer in the 
body, and that new version is what we will use in this study. PGT121 is being 
tested in a study with HIV -positive and HIV -negative participants. As of March 
2019, about [ADDRESS_634889] gotten a placebo (a 
liquid with no antibody in it).  This study is still going on and we don’t know who 
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 122 of 188 got the study antibody and who got a placebo , or what the safety results are . 
General risks of antibodies:  
There are different types of antibodies officially ap proved for use in preventing or 
treating other diseases. From all of these uses of antibodies, we know that  most 
side effects happen within the first [ADDRESS_634890] caused serious reactions that may be life -
threatening. These reaction s may include:  
• Anaphylaxis – a physical reaction that may include hives or rash, swelling in 
the mouth and face, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing, possibly 
leading to low blood oxygen. This may occur soon after getting an antibody.  
• Serum Sickne ss – a physical reaction that includes developi[INVESTIGATOR_493409] a rash, 
fever, big lymph nodes, muscle and joint pains, chest discomfort and shortness 
of breath. This may occur several days to a few weeks after getting an 
antibody.  
These rare reactions have not  been seen in other studies with similar experimental 
antibodies.  
Please tell us if you have ever experienced reactions similar to anaphylaxis or 
serum sickness, and the cause of the reactions if you remember.  
Rarely, antibodies officially approved  for tre atment of other diseases have been 
linked to a blood disorder that interferes with blood clotting, to cancer, to damage 
to the heart muscle, and to the body’s immune system attacking healthy cells.   
These rare side effects and reactions have not been seen in other studies with 
similar  experimental antibod ies.  
Antibodies given to a person usually do not last in the body more than a few 
months. One of the goals of this study is to see how long the study antibodies will 
stay in the body. We don’t know yet how  long they will last, but it may be several 
months.

We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of 
your health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We 
will also test you for syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. We will ask you about 
medications you are taking. We will ask you personal questions about your HIV 
risk factors such as sexual behavior, alcohol, and drug use.  
If you were assigned female sex at birth, we will test you for pregnancy. If you 
have had your uterus or ovaries removed (a  hysterectomy or  oophorectomy),

12. In addition to giving you the study antibody, we will:  
• Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV  
• Do physical exams  
• Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned female sex at birth  
• Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking  
• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study  
• Ask questions about your experience  getting infusions  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 25 mL and 130 mL (a little less than 2 tablespoons 
to a little more than ½ cup). Your body will make new blood to replace the blood 
we take out. Please tell us if you have blood drawn for other purposes during this 
study.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare , people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix F  and Appendix G , Table s of procedures (for informed consent 
form) in this section or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study 
participants. You are not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your healt h, we will tell you.

study antibody.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_493463], which are located in the [LOCATION_002]. In rare cases, 
some of your samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_493464].  
The samples will be tested to:  
• Measure how much antibody is in your blood, and  
• See how your immune system responds to the study antibody . 
Researchers m ay also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while  others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you get HIV, the rese archers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study antibody.  
The tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs  will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN and HPTN 
will continue to store them with your permission.  
Site: Delete next section if using separate consent for use of samples and information 
in other studies

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 128 of 188 15. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN and HPTN 
may want to use them in other studies and share them with other 
researchers.  
These samples are called “extra samples”. The HVTN and HPTN will only allow 
your extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark 
your decision at the end of this form. If you have any qu estions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any  negative 
consequences here.   
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repositor y in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a res earcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be use d in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN or HPTN sell my samples and  information? No, but the HVTN 
and HPTN may share your samples with other researchers. Once we share your 
samples and information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_269967]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) 
or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB/EC/RE is also requi red, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs 
protect the rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN and HPTN will send your samples to the researcher’s 
location.   
What information is shared with HVTN, HPTN or other researchers? The 
samples and information will be labeled with a code number . The key to the code 
will stay at this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN,  HPTN  or other 
researchers.  Your  name [CONTACT_107030]. However, some

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634898].  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, the immune 
system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic  testing on your samples.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of  genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it. Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to 
you as a person. However, if another database exists that also has information on 
your genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. The risk of t his is very small . There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government ag encies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews clinical trials  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• The people who work with the researcher  
All of these peopl e will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name [CONTACT_107005].

Other Risks  
20. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new th at may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of giving blood and receiving SC infusions :  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These include taking 
blood from you and giving SC infusions  to people in Group 4 . These proce dures 
can cause bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, 
bleeding, blood clots, forming a bump under the skin , and (rarely) muscle 
damage, or infection where you got the SC infusion . Giving blood can cause  
swelling of the vei n where the needle is placed , or a low blood cell count 
(anemia), making you feel tired.  
Risks of getting an IV infusion : 
Getting an infusion  may cause stinging, discomfort, pain, soreness, redness, 
bruising, itching, rash and swelling where the needle goe s into the skin. Rarely, 
needle sticks can result in a blood clot or infection.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
Some people who join HVTN and HPTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV prevention study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
HIV testing  
HIV antibody tests are the usual way to test for HIV infections. We have used 
several common HIV antibody tests to test samples of blood containing different 
amounts of another study antibody, VRC07 -523LS, that will be used in Part B of 
this study. These tests show that very high levels of this antibody in the blood can 
cause positive or uncertain results on a few brands of HIV tests. Such high levels 
might exist for a short time after a person gets the stud y antibody. This means that 
for a few days after getting the antibody, certain HIV tests might say a person is 
infected with HIV when they really aren’t. We don’t know if the different brands 
of tests will have similar results for the study antibody being used in Part A.

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634900] in the body for 
that long . 
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could  make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can te ll you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could le ad to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your ge netic information becomes linked to your 
name, a US federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about gi ving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study antibody will increase, decrease, or n ot change your 
risk of becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we 
do not know how the study antibodies might affect your HIV infection or how 
long it takes to develop AIDS.

you don’t yet know about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine or other methods to prevent HIV. 
However, if the study antibody or a related product later gets approved and sold, 
there  are no plans to share any money with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
22. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
23. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, bu t it is important for you to let us 
know.  
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples.  We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from  being in the study. We 
believe these steps are important to protect your health, but it is up to you whether 
to complete them.

Your health is important to us. (Sites: adjust the following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the care that 
we can give here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we 
will help you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, the HVTN has  a process to decide if it 
is related to the study antibody and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related 
injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain 
conditions are met.  
Some of the study product providers m ay pay medical costs for study -related 
injuries that are determined to be caused by [CONTACT_493465]. If 
provider funds are not available or are not enough, or if the injury is determined to 
be caused by [CONTACT_57219], the HVTN has limited fun ds to pay medical costs 
that it determines are reasonable.  (Sites: insert locale -appropriate medical 
insurance language in the following sentence)  If the injury is not study related, 
then you and/or your health insurance will be responsible for treatment c osts.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_493466]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot 
go to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are  study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, independent experts will be asked to review the decision. You always 
have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you deci de to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the sa me as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
Key Information  
These are some of the things you should know about this study:  
• The purpose of the study is to understand how well antibodies against HIV 
work when given alone and combined with other antibodies. We also want to 
see if the antibodies are safe to give to people and do not make them too 
uncomfortable.  
• If you choose to join, we will ask you to come to several study visits over 
about 14 -16 months.  At 3 of these visits you will get combinations of the 
study antibodies in a vein (by [CONTACT_16228]) or under the skin (by [CONTACT_493459] , called SC). We will take blood from you at each study visit to see 
how your body responds to the study antibodie s and how much antibodies are 
in your blood. We will test you for HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs) and pregnancy (if applicable). We will ask you to complete 
questionnaires (many with questions of a personal nature) and you will have 
physical exams.  
• Some general risks of antibodies include fever, chills, shaking, nausea, 
vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue, flushing, trouble breathing, high 
or low blood pressure, itchiness and rash. There may be other side effects that 
we don’t  yet know about, even serious ones. We think that the risks will be 
similar to these general risks.  
• We do not expect the study antibody to benefit you in any way.

read it carefully.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network 
(HPTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a study to test a combination of different 
antibodies against HIV. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Antibodies are one of 
the ways the human body fights infection. Antibodies are natural proteins that the 
body can make to prevent infectious age nts such as bacteria and viruses from 
making you sick. Researchers can also make antibodies in laboratories and give 
them to people in a vein  (by [CONTACT_16228] ) or under the skin (by [CONTACT_493459] , called SC) . We will tell you more about these proced ures below. 
Officially approved antibodies have been used successfully  to prevent or treat 
some other health problems, such as a virus that causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_493408].  
About 32 people will take part in this study at multiple clinics. The rese archer in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
There are [ADDRESS_634903] different 
doses of  one of the study antibodies by [CONTACT_493467]. People in Part A got the study 
antibody one time. There were about 12 people in Part A and t he results showed 
that it is safe to move ahead with Part B of the study. In Part B, we will give about 
20 more people a combination of both study antibodies by [CONTACT_493467]. We will 
give the antibodies three times.  
You are being invited to join Part B of the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study antibodies safe to give to people together?  
• Are people able to take the study antibodies without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How much of the study antibodies remain in the body as time passes?  
• How does the body’s response change depending on how the study antibodies 
are given?  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634904] study in people using this combination of antibodies.  
The 2 study antibodies were developed by [CONTACT_493460] (CAVD) ( PGT121.414.LS ) and at the  Dale and Betty 
Bumpers Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland (VRC07 -523LS).  
In laboratory studies, these study antibodies attached to HIV. They also prevented 
infection by [CONTACT_493461]. Each of the study 
antibodies was  strongest against different strains of HIV. When combined in lab 
tests, they were able to protect human cells from almost all global strains of HIV.  
In animal studies, the study antibodies protected animals from infection with 
animal viruses that are very  similar to HIV. The study antibodies have also been 
tested for safety in the laboratory and in animal studies, and they did not cause 
health problems. Even if something looks like it is safe or works in animals, it 
may not be true for people.  
We do not kn ow if the study antibodies will prevent HIV infection when given to 
people. It will take many studies to learn if they will be useful for HIV 
prevention. This study will not answer that question.  
Risks of the study antibodies:  
This section lists the side effects we know about when the antibodies are given 
individually. There may be side effects that we don’t yet know about, or side 
effects from  this combination , even serious ones. We will tell you about any new 
information that might change your willi ngness to stay in this study.  
PGT121.414.LS  
Because this is the first time the antibody is being given to people, we do not 
know what all of the risks may be. We think that the risks will be similar to the 
general risks described  below .

liquid with no antibody in it). This study is still goi ng on and we don’t know who 
got the study antibody and who got a placebo , or what the safety results are . 
VRC07 -523LS  
The VRC07 -523LS study antibody was given to [ADDRESS_634906] gotten this study antibody by [CONTACT_493468] a clinical trial called HVTN 127/HPTN 087. This study is 
taking place at clinics in the US and in Switzerland. In this study, the antibody has 
not made people too uncomfortable or caused serious health problems so far.  
A similar study antibody called VRC01 has been given  in 20,000 infusions  to 
more than 5000 adults  in severa l studies. Many of these studies are still going on 
and we don’t know who got the study antibody and who got a placebo. After 
receiving VRC01, many people said they had mild pain, itching, or redness where 
the IV infusion or SC injection was given to them.  Some of these people said they 
felt like they had the flu afterward, but this feeling lasted a few hours at the most.  
General risks of antibodies:  
There are different types of antibodies officially approved for use in preventing or 
treating other diseases . From all of these uses of antibodies, we know that  most 
side effects happen within the first [ADDRESS_634907] caused serious reactions that may be life -
threatening. These reactions may include:  
• Anaphylaxis – a physical reaction that m ay include hives or rash, swelling in 
the mouth and face, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing, possibly 
leading to low blood oxygen. This may occur soon after getting an antibody.  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Versio n 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 142 of 188 • Serum Sickness – a physical reaction that includes developi[INVESTIGATOR_493411] a rash, 
fever, big lymph nodes, muscle and joint pains, chest discomfort and shortness 
of breath. This may occur several days to a few weeks after getting an 
antibody.  
These rare reactions have not been seen in other studies  with the antibodies in this  
study or with similar experimental antibodies.  
Please tell us if you have ever experienced reactions similar to anaphylaxis or 
serum sickness, and the cause of the reactions if you remember.  
Rarely, antibodies officially approved  for treatment of other di seases have been 
linked to a blood disorder that interferes with blood clotting, to cancer, to damage 
to the heart muscle, and to the body’s immune system attacking healthy cells.   
These rare side effects and reactions have not been seen in other studies w ith the 
antibodies in this study or with similar  experimental antibod ies.  
Antibodies given to a person usually do not last in the body more than a few 
months. One of the goals of this study is to see how long the study antibodies will 
stay in the body. We  don’t know yet how long they will last, but it may be several 
months.  
Joining the study  
4. It is completely up to you whether or not to join the study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your 
doctor, friends or famil y. If you decide not to join this study, or if you leave it 
after you have joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits or rights you 
would normally have will not be affected.  
If you join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV prev ention 
studies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you are in another 
study where you get a study product. Being in more than one study may not be

When getting a subcutaneous infusion, a sterile needle is put under the skin on 
your abdomen or thigh. A pump similar to an IV pump is used to control how fast 
the study antibody is injected through the needle. We will administer each 
antibody as a separate infusion, so you will get [ADDRESS_634911] no say in which group you are

will study only  the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study antibodies.  
The tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your

These samples are called “extra samples”. The HVTN and HPTN will only allow 
your extra samples to be used in o ther studies if you agree to this. You will mark 
your decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind

How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you  are.

Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
resea rch purposes.  
Will the HVTN or HPTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN 
and HPTN may share your samples with other researchers. Once we share your 
samples and information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my s amples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_269967]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) 
or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs

approved, the HVTN and HPTN will send your samples to the researcher’s 
location.   
What information is shared with HVTN, HPTN or other researchers? The 
samples and information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code 
will stay at this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN,  HPTN , or other 
resea rchers.  Your name [CONTACT_107030]. However, some 
information that we share may be personal, such as your race, ethnicity, sex, 
health information  from the study, and HIV status. We may share information 
about the study product you recei ved and how your body responded to the study 
product.   
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, the immune 
system and other diseases.  
Researchers may als o do genetic testing on your samples.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common  patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it. Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and li nk it to 
you as a person. However, if another database exists that also has information on 
your genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. T he risk of this is very small . There may be other unknown risks.

This section describes the other risks and restrictions we  know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of giving blood (Group 5 and 6) and receiving SC infusions  (Group 6) :  
In this study, we  will do some routine medical procedures. These include taking 
blood from you and giving you SC infusions . These procedures can cause 
bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, 
blood clots, forming a bump under the sk in, and (rarely) muscle damage, or 
infection where you got the  SC infusion . Giving blood can cause  swelling of the 
vein where the needle is placed , or a low blood cell count (anemia), making you 
feel tired.  
Risks of getting an IV infusion  (Group 5) : 
Getting an infusion  may cause stinging, discomfort, pain, soreness, redness, 
bruising, itching, rash and swelling where the needle goes into the skin. Rarely, 
needle sticks can result in a blood clot or infection.  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 152 of 188 Personal problems/discrimination/testing H IV antibody positive:  
Some people who join HVTN and HPTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV prevention study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high ris k 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
HIV testing  
HIV antibody tests are the usual way to test for HIV infections. We have  used 
several common HIV antibody tests to test samples of blood containing different 
amounts of one of the study antibodies, VRC07 -523LS. These tests show that 
very high levels of this antibody in the blood can cause positive or uncertain 
results on a few  brands of HIV tests. Such high levels might exist for a short time 
after a person gets the study antibody. This means that for a few days after getting 
the antibody, certain HIV tests might say a person is infected with HIV when they 
really aren’t. We don ’t know if the different brands of tests will have similar 
results for the other study antibody.  
Although it has not been seen so far, getting the study antibodies may cause 
common HIV antibody tests to show that someone is HIV -negative, even if they 
are a ctually infected.  
Because of these risks, you should  get HIV tests only at this clinic during the 
study. Our tests can always detect your true HIV status . They can also tell if 
someone does not have HIV. We do not expect you to have any problems with 
HIV t esting after the study ends  because the antibodies do not last in the body for 
that long . 
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or othe r health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal informa tion:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, a nd embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
HVTN 136/HPTN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634915]  
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_116485] s that sell life, disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study antibodies will increase, decrease, or not change 
your risk of becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, 
we do not know how the  study antibodies might affect your HIV infection or how 
long it takes to develop AIDS.  
We do not know how the study antibodies will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784].  
Benefits  
21. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not expect that getting the study antibodies will benefit you in any way. 
However, being in the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling 
that you get as part of the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests 
and physical exams that you get while in this st udy might detect health problems 
you don’t yet know about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine or other methods to prevent HIV. 
However, if the study antibody or a related product later gets approved and sold, 
there are no plans to share any m oney with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
22. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.  We will give you a

decision at the  end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affe ct your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repository. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a r esearcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with 
you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be u sed in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being 
done for research purposes.  
HVTN 136/HP TN 092  Version 1.0  / October 8, 2019  
HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 160 of 188 6. Will the HVTN or HPTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN and HPTN may share your samples with other researchers. 
Once we share your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them 
back.  
7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to  use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_493470] . Also, the researcher’s institutional 
review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If 
review by [CONTACT_106954]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating 
this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well -being of peo ple in research. If the 
research plan is approved, the HVTN and HPTN will send your samples to the 
researcher’s location.  
8. What information is shared with HVTN, HPTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the 
code will stay at this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, or other 
researchers . However, some information that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, and HIV status. 
We may sh are information about the study product you received and how your 
body responded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, the immu ne 
system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.   
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
comp are the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able  to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but the genetic te sts done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or

HVTN136 -HPTN092_v1.0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_634919] 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA  keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or  long-term care insurance.   
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra  samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monito r the research using your  extra  
samples and information  
• Any regulatory agen cy that reviews clinical trials  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to pr otect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name [CONTACT_107005].

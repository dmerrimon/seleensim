Adverse Event Notification Form (Appendix 1).  
If the Product Defect  is not associated with an adverse event,  the investigator  shall report  the Product Defect  via 
the Clinical Product Defect Notification Case Report Form (Appendix 2).

Device Deficiency is defined as the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, usability, safety or performance.  
The Sponsor  will review  the Product  Defect  Notification  Case  Report  Form,  gather  additional information if needed 
from the Investigator and determine whether the notification represents a Device Deficiency. Device Deficiencies will be reported as per Internal CVI procedures.  
A summary of Device Deficiencies will be documented  in the clinical study report. If no Device Deficiencies are 
observed in a study, then a statement stating as such will be included in the clinical study report.

The null and alternative hypotheses  are: 
H
0: μt = μ c 
H1: μt ≠ μc 
Where  μt refers  to the LogMAR  of Test lenses  and μc refers  to LogMAR  of Control  lenses.  
 
 
10.2 Sample Size Calculations  
 
The number of subjects  that has  been  chosen in  this study  is to provide sufficient evidence  to demonstrate the 
study  hypothesis  of “there  is no difference between  the Test and Control”  versus  “there  is a difference  between 
the Test and Control” on visual acuity (LogMAR) measurement. With assumed standard deviation is equal to 
0.06, a sample size of 24 subjects per group will provide adequate power (92%) to detect a visual acuity 
difference of 0.06 (3 letters) at α=0.05 level.  
 
Therefore, for this parallel arm study design with 2:1 ratio, minimum 72 subjects ([ADDRESS_177914] arm and 24 in control arm) to complete is required.  To account  for subject  attrition  of 10%,  up to 79 subjects  will be enrolled in this study.

produced for primary  and/or second interests. Paired t- test may be used to compare  slit lamp  biomicroscopy,  lens 
fit and subjective scores between study lens types. Where applicable, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  or paired analysis  may be used to compare  the variables  between study  visits.  The critical alpha level for 
statistical significance will be set at p ≤  0.05, with adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Unless  otherwise documented,  the CRFs  will be considered the source  document.  
 
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access to the source documentation for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study.  
If study information is collected using an automated pi[INVESTIGATOR_502], the information may be  recorded directly 
from the instrument display, captured electronically as output, or printed and entered into the CRF. The CRF will become the source document if there is no printout.

1. BACKGROUND  
IRB NUMBER : HS3C-MS-15-0895   
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/16/2018    
Induction of labor (IOL) is the initiation of labor in a viable pregnancy by [CONTACT_761436], and occurs before the spontaneous onset of labor. A common obstetric 
intervention, the rate of IOL increased from 9.5% to 22.8% in the US from 1990 to  
[ZIP_CODE]. Obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) are more likely than their normal -weight 
counterparts to require IOL because of increased rates of obstetric complications 
including pregnancy related hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and prolonged gestations2,3. 
Several stu dies have shown that obese women experience increased labor duration and 
oxytocin needs when compared to normal -weight women4–8. This in turn results in 
increased rates for unplanned cesarean delivery (CD) as a result of failed IOL, arrest 
disorders and no n-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, that is dose -dependent with 
increasing class of  obesity9. 
 
Mechanical and pharmacological agents are routinely used for IOL. The supracervical 
insertion of a Foley balloon catheter acts by [CONTACT_761437]. This process strips the fetal membranes from the lower uterine segment and 
causes rupture of the lysosomes in the decidual cells. The lytic enzymes released include 
phospholipase A, which acts on phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_761430]10. Misoprostol (prostaglandin E1, PGE1) is a prostaglandin analogue 
used to induce labor that is associated with enzymatic collagen degradation, increased 
water content in the extracellular matrix and stimulation of the myometrium resulting in 
intrauterine contractions10. Both methods are supported and recommended by [CONTACT_265737] (ACOG) due to their high safety 
profile and comparative effectiveness11. In addition, they are  often preferred over 
oxytocin alone, PGE2 tablet, gel and insert given their low cost, availability and ease of 
use. 
 
A number of randomized trials have compared the use of the Foley balloon in 
combination with misoprostol, against misoprostol alone for l abor induction (Table 1). 
Carbone et.al.12 randomized 123 women undergoing IOL with singleton pregnancies at ≥ 
24 weeks’ gestation with unfavorable cervix (Bishop score ≤ 6) to Foley balloon plus 
vaginal misoprostol or vaginal misoprostol alone. The mean i nduction -to-delivery time 
was shorter with the combined approach when compared to vaginal misoprostol alone 
(15.3 ± 6.5 compared with 18.3 ± 8.7 hours, difference -3.1 hours, 95% CI -5.9 to -0.30). 
No differences were noted in labor complications, CD rates  (37.3 vs 26.2 %, P = 0.90) or 
neonatal outcomes, likely due to small sample size. These findings contrast with the 
results by [CONTACT_761438].al.[ADDRESS_1042839] be i nterpreted with caution given 
potential biases due to unclear random sequence generation, high allocation concealment 
and selective reporting. In a recent meta -analysis of eight studies and 1153 patients by 
[CONTACT_761439].al.15, the use of Foley balloon plus miso prostol was associated with a significant 
reduction in the mean time to delivery when compared to misoprostol alone (mean 
difference -2.36 hours, 95% CI -4.07 to -0.66; P = 0.007). Differences in cesarean 
delivery rates, however, remain elusive likely due to the small sample sizes of the trials 
included.  
To our knowledge no studies have compared  the  effects  of these  interventions     in  
IRB NUMBER : HS4C-MS-15-0895   
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/16/2018   women with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The exact mechanism of failed cervical ripening 
and dysfunctional l abor patterns in obese women is not completely understood. Elevated 
cholesterol levels have been shown to decrease uterine contractility, and obese women  
are more likely to have elevated cholesterol levels than are normal -weight women16. In 
addition, obes ity has been associated with lower prostaglandin sensitivity when used 
locally for cervical ripening8. This association is directly proportional to obesity class. 
Although many reviews list obesity as a risk factor for failed IOL, this risk has yet to be 
quantified by [CONTACT_761440]. In a large study of 1273 women who underwent IOL with vaginal misoprostol, 
obese women had a longer induction -to-delivery interval (median 22.7, 24.9 and 27.0 
hours for normal weight, BMI between 30 -39.9 kg/m2 and BMI ≥40 kg/m2, respectively; 
P < 0.01) and higher CD rates (21.3%, 29.8% and 36.5% for normal weight, BMI 
between 30 -39.9 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2, respectively; aOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.58 -3.42). 
These result s were adjusted for parity, race and treatment group. Noteworthy, obese 
women were more likely to require a CD during the first stage of labor when compared to 
normal -weight women (74% and 83% vs 62%, respectively). These results were further 
confirmed by [CONTACT_761441].al.9 in a large cohort of 80,887 women from the Ohio Department 
of Health’s Birth Certificate Database. Indeed, pregnant women with class III obesity had 
a 2.[ADDRESS_1042840] method of cervical ripening that 
would decrease CD rates in this high risk  populations.  
 
The combination of Foley balloon plus vaginal misoprostol has not been 
prospectively compared to the use of vaginal misoprostol alone among women with  BMI  
≥ 30 kg/m2. We hypothesize that obese pregnant women and unfavorable cervix (Bishop 
score ≤ 6), IOL ≥  32 weeks gestation using the Foley balloon plus vaginal misoprostol 
will result in reduced cesarean delivery rates when compared to vaginal misoprostol 
alone. To prove this hypothesis, we propose a comparative -effectiveness, open -label, 
randomized control led trial of induction of labor with transcervical foley balloon and 
vaginal misoprostol versus misoprostol alone for cervical ripening in obese pregnant 
women and a Bishop score ≤ 6.

2. METHODS  
 
2.1. Study  Objectives  
 
2.1.1.  Objective  
 
To compare the CD rate when transcervical Foley balloon plus misoprostol versus 
vaginal misoprostol alone is used for cervical ripening among nulliparous obese women 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and unfavorable cervix (Bishop score ≤ 6).  
 
2.1.2.  Rationale  
 
Obese pregnant wom en are less sensitive to local use of prostaglandins for 
cervical ripening. Although the best agent and method for IOL remains uncertain among 
obese women, it is biologically plausible that a combination of a mechanical device 
(Foley balloon) and a local p harmacological agent (misoprostol) may have an additive or 
synergistic effect, resulting in a greater degree of cervical ripening, shorter induction -to- 
delivery time and reduced need for CD due to dystocic labor patterns. The addition of 
misoprostol to th e Foley balloon may also overcome the frequent observation of cervical 
dilation with the Foley balloon without significant  effacement.  
 
2.1.3.  Primary Outcome  Measures  
 
 Cesarean delivery  rate 
 
2.1.4.  Secondary Outcome Measures:  Maternal  
 
 Indication for  CD 
 Induction -to-delivery interval  (hours)  
 Need for oxytocin  augmentation  
 Occurrence of tachysystole (≥ 5 contractions in a 10 minute period 
averaged over a 30 -minute window) requiring terbutaline or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_761431].  
 Clinical chorioamnionitis: maternal fever  ≥ 100.4F, uterine fundal 
tenderness, maternal or fetal tachycardia (>100/min and >160/min, 
respectively) and purulent or foul amniotic  fluid19 
 Need for operative vaginal  delivery  
 Composite of maternal  morbidity:  
o Maternal ICU  admission  
o Postpartum  endometritis  
o Surgical -site infections prior to  discharge  
o Venous  thromboembolism  
o Need for  transfusion  
o Maternal  death

2.2. Design  Summary  
 
This is a comparative -effectiveness, open -label, randomized controlled trial of 
induction of labor with transcervical Foley balloon and vaginal misop rostol versus 
misoprostol alone in nulliparous obese pregnant women and Bishop score ≤ 6.  
 
2.3. Inclusion  Criteria

 Gestational age ≥ 32  weeks  
 
2.4. Exclusion  Criteria  
 
 Patient not candidate for IOL with misoprostol as deemed by [CONTACT_30780]  
 Multiple  gestation  
 Major fetal  anomalies  
 Fetal  demise  
 
2.5. Recruitment and  Feasibility  
 
Recruitment will occur at the Labor and Delivery units at Memorial -Hermann 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – [LOCATION_007] Medical Center, Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761433], Ba kersfield, CA.  
IRB NUMBER : HS7C-MS-15-0895   
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/16/2018    
2.6. Randomization  
 
Randomization will be achieved by [CONTACT_22123] -generated random sequences. 
Permuted block randomization will be performed, stratified by [CONTACT_384]. Women will be 
randomized to either Foley balloon plus misoprostol or misoprostol alone as the method 
of choice for IOL. Enrollment number and assignments will be placed in opaque sealed 
envelopes. Envelopes will be kept secured in a locked office and will be accessible only 
by [CONTACT_147849].  
 
2.7. Intervention and  Procedures  
 
Nulliparous pregnant women at ≥ 32 week s’ gestation admitted to labor and 
delivery for IOL and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be approached by 
[CONTACT_16133] (Figure 1). Group [ADDRESS_1042842] the  
internal os. The catheter of the Foley will be taped to the patient’s inner thigh under 
gentle traction. If the Foley is unable to be placed, the patient will be reexamined in 1 
hour and placement will be r eattempted if Bishop’s score is still [ADDRESS_1042843] passed since insertion as per protocol, further management of labor will be 
left at the discretion  of the labor  team.  
 
Group 2 will be composed of women allocated to vaginal misoprostol -only. These 
women will receive 25 micrograms of misoprostol per vagina every 4 hours. This time 
interval has been shown to be more effective that different time interva ls in a Cochrane 
review20. Once the cervix becomes favorable (Bishop score > 6), misoprostol 
administration will be discontinued. Similarly, further management will be left at the 
discretion of the labor team.  
 
In both groups, if IV oxytocin is indicated, it will be withheld until [ADDRESS_1042844] dose of misoprostol to prevent uterine hyperstimulation. Other aspects of labor 
management will be similar for both groups, including continuous electronic fetal 
monitoring with external Doppler device or fetal scalp electrode. Uterine contraction 
assessment will be performed with either an external tocodynamometer or an intrauterine 
pressure catheter.  
 
Participant data including demographic characteristics, medica l and obstetric 
history, labor course and outcomes will be collected by a dedicated research nurse.

2.8. Safety  Assessment  
 
2.8.1 Risks Associated with Vaginal Misoprostol of Foley Balloon for Labor 
Induction  
 
There is biologic plausibility that a Foley balloon catheter for cervical ripening 
may be associated with an increased rate of chorioamnionitis because it represents a 
foreign body in the lower uterine segment and could potentially facilitate an ascending 
infection. However, a systematic review by [CONTACT_761442].al.21 (Figure 2) and a Cochrane review 
from Jozwiak et.al.22,23 (Figure 3) concluded that the rates of chorioamnionitis were 
comparable for the Foley balloon and misoprostol when used independently. Carbone et. 
al.12 also reported no differences in the rates of chorioamnionitis when the Foley balloon 
was used concomita ntly with misoprostol versus misoprostol alone.

Tachysystole is a common complication of misoprostol administration  for 
cervical ripening, and tachysystole with FHRT changes is more frequent among women 
receiving misoprostol than among those treated with mechanical devices, alternate 
prostaglandin compounds or oxytocin20,24,25 . However, the frequency of uterine 
tachysystole with FHRT changes was lower when a Foley balloon catheter was added to 
misoprostol than when misoprostol alone was used22,26, purportedly due to the reduced 
need for additional doses of vaginal misopr ostol. The combination could provide extra 
benefits to patients who are at higher risk of fetal hypoxemia, such as those with sickle 
cell disease, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction or other chronic diseases for which 
the use of misoprostol is not c onsidered contraindicated27,28.

care. The medications/interventions are not new in pregnancy and misoprostol is k nown 
to not be teratogenic in the third trimester. Therefore, the establishment of a safety data 
monitoring board is not necessary. The principal investigator (PI) and mentor will 
monitor the progress of study and determine the safety  parameters.  
 
2.8.3.  Manageme nt of Adverse  Events  
 
Any adverse events will be reported to the Committee for the Protection  of 
Human Subjects (CPHS). Due to the use of medications that have been used in pregnancy 
in the past, there is no increased anticipation of severe adverse events . 
 
2.8.4.  Procedures in the Event of Abnormal Clinical  Findings  
 
In the event of an abnormal clinical finding, the health care provider caring for the 
participant will be notified to allow treatment in the usual clinical manner.  
 
2.9. Statistical  Considerations  
 
2.9.1.  Sample  Size 
 
Assuming a cesarean delivery rate of 53% at Memorial Herman Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761434] 2012 at ≥ 32 weeks and met our 
inclusion criteria, 250 women (125 women per group) would be required for 80% power 
to detec t a 33% cesarean delivery rate reduction between the [ADDRESS_1042847] and α of 0.05 (Table 2). Interim analysis after 50% enrollment will be performed in 
order to determine if the risk of adverse events discussed in the secondary outcomes  is 
increased in one arm relative to the other arm.

U test will be used for non -parametric comparisons. Tests with a p -value < 0.[ADDRESS_1042849] (IRB) for review and 
approval prior to the start of the study. A properly executed written informed consent 
shall b e obtained from each patient prior to entering the study. All prospective study 
candidates will be given a full explanation of the consent form, allowed to read the 
approved form, and be provided the opportunity to ask any questions. Once all questions 
have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the individual understands the 
requirements of the study, the subject will be asked to sign the consent. The Investigator 
shall provide a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the patient and the 
original shall be maintained in the patient’s study files. Patients who do not sign the 
consent form will not be permitted to participate in the  study.  
 
2.10.2.  Institutional Review  Board  
 
Before initiation of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_761435]. The study will be registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov  as required by 
[CONTACT_761443].  
 
2.10.3.  Subject  Confidentiality  
 
Each study’s subject anonymity will be maintained throughout the study. Prior to 
collection of the data a unique study number will be assigned to each case thus de - 
identifying the individual subject. Each study site will maintain a log of the study subject 
to the assigned study number.

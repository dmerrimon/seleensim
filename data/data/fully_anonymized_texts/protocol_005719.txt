Does the intraoperative administration  of tranexamic  acid  (TXA) increase the incidence 
of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  3 of 11 Version Date: January 26, [ZIP_CODE].Objectives
1.1.The purpose of this study is to estimate  the incidence of diagnosable 
deep-vein thrombosis  (DVT) in total knee  arthroplasty (TKA) patients 
after administration of tranexamic acid (TXA).
1.2.The hypothesis is  that intraoperative  administration of TXA will increase  the 
incidence of DVT  as detected  by [CONTACT_217015]-extremity  ultrasound on postoperative  
day 1 in TKA  patients when compared  to the  historic incidence of this 
complication in patients not administered TXA.
2.Background
2.1.The administration of  the anti-fibrinolytic  agent tranexamic acid (TXA) to 
prevent bleeding and transfusion has become commonplace in  a variety of  
clinical settings following the publication of  many studies  documenting its 
efficacy (1-4). However, questions remain regarding the safety of this  agent in 
known thrombogenic settings such as total joint arthroplasty.   Because TXA directly inhibits the activation  of plasmin,  an increase in  risk of pathologic  
thrombosis is possible.    Safety claims to date  for TXA  are based upon 
secondary outcomes of clinically  apparent  deep  venous thrombosis/pulmonary  
embolus (DVT/PE) between treated and control  groups  in studies designed 
primarily to assess blood loss  (5,6).   None  have  prospectively  examined  the risk 
of DVT as  a primary outcome in patients treated with TXA  in total joint 
arthroplasty.  Furthermore,  most studies have  only used the presence of clinically  
apparent DVT to define  the complication, which is known  to significantly 
underestimate the true incidence  (13).   This lack of safety data has been noted by 
[CONTACT_823214] a recent meta-analysis  of TXA, who  concluded:   “The effect of 
tranexamic acid on thromboembolic events remains uncertain”(1).  Conversely, a recent retrospective study of total hip arthroplasty  patients using  screening  lower  
extremity ultrasound  did show a significant increase in DVT in the TXA  treated 
patients (8).  Case  reports of  DVT,  myocardial infarction and  PE temporally  
associated with TXA  administration  continue  to accumulate (9-11).  Clearly, the 
safety of routine  TXA administration  remains a topic  of concern.
2.2.The investigators have not obtained  any preliminary  data.
3.Study Design
3.1.This is  a prospective  observational study.  
3.2.This is  an open-label study.  
4.Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
4.1.Participants will be recruited from among those presenting for total knee arthroplasty (joint replacement) at UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center.
4.2.Inclusion criteria include: 
Age >18  years
Does the intraoperative administration  of tranexamic  acid  (TXA) increase the incidence 
of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  4 of 11 Version Date: January 26, 2017Scheduled for total  knee arthroplasty  at SRMC with  administered 
tranexamic acid, according  to UNM Orthopedic Surgery protocol
Exclusion criteria:
Previous deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]
Known coronary  artery disease or peripheral  vascular disease
Previously diagnosed hypercoagulable states (e.g. Leiden factor V,  
antiphospholipid antibody, protein  C or S deficiency)
Pregnancy
Creatinine  clearance less than 30 ml/min
Non-fluency  in English
4.3.This study  will not include  participants  from  the special  populations  of: adults 
unable to consent, individuals  who are not yet adults, pregnant women,  or 
prisoners.
4.4.The investigators will not enroll participants who  are not fluent in English.  
Funding for this study  is limited, and thus its study size is small.  If the 
investigators were  to obtain  translation for the consent/HIPAA documentation, 
the cost of  that service would have a substantial adverse effect on the available 
sample size and  thus on  study power,  likely rendering its findings 
uninterpretable.  Also, there  is not a substantial  a priori  reason to  suspect that 
language skills themselves have any  effect  on postoperative thrombotic risk, so  
the investigators believe that this  exclusion  will not  adversely  affect the rights  of 
Spanish-speaking people to enjoy the benefits  of clinical  research.   Because this 
exclusion will  not present  an injustice, but will serve to preserve study validity, 
the investigators plan  to exclude non-English speakers.
5.Number of  Subjects
5.1.We currently  plan to complete data  collection for 30 patients for this study, but  
may extend it to 100.  With traditional  thresholds  of 80%  power  and α=0.05, [ADDRESS_1141517] a statistically-significant increase in  DVT  
rate from  the historic 12% to  approximately 32%.  The investigators are  seeking 
additional funding to further  refine the  actual  incidence of  post-TKR DVT,  and if  
this funding  is obtained may extend the study to 100  patients.  Due to  dropouts 
and exclusions, we may  enroll up to 50 patients  in order to complete data 
collection on the  planned initial sample of 30.
6.Study Timelines
6.1.
Individual  subjects  will be involved in the research on two consecutive  days:  
they will provide  consent on the day of  surgery,  and receive an ultrasound 
scan for deep vein  thrombosis on postoperative  day 2.
The investigators  estimate that  approximately  10 participants per  month will 
choose to enroll  in this study;  hence  enrollment  is estimated to  take 
approximately 3 months.
Does the intraoperative administration  of tranexamic  acid  (TXA) increase the incidence 
of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  5 of 11 Version Date: January 26, 2017Upon completion of enrollment and data  collection, analysis and manuscript 
preparation are estimated to take one year.
7.Study Endpoints
7.1.The primary  study  outcome  is the incidence of deep vein  thrombosis observed by 
[CONTACT_217015]-extremity ultrasound on postoperative  day 2.  The investigators have  not 
identified secondary  outcomes.
7.2.The investigators have not identified  safety outcomes.  The only modification to  
routine practice  that is entailed in this study  is the  administration  of an ultrasound 
scan for lower-extremity  preclinical DVT.
8.Research Setting
8.1.All study  activities  will occur  in the  context  of normal medical  treatment at UNM 
SRMC, including recruitment/consent,  medical treatment, and ultrasonography.  
8.2.Potential subjects will be identified from among investigators’ routine  patients.   
Recruitment will occur in the preoperative  holding areas  at SRMC, where the 
preoperative anesthesia consultation already  occurs.   
8.3.The ultrasound scan for thrombosis will occur  in the patient’s room  on 
postoperative day  2.  The scan will be read by [CONTACT_823215].  
9.Resources  Available
9.1.Investigators Drs. David Siegel and  Neal Gerstein are  faculty members in  the 
Department of  Anesthesiology with substantial research experience.  Investigator  
[CONTACT_823225] is  a faculty  member in the Department of Radiology and the 
Chief of  Radiology at SRMC.  Investigator Tim Petersen PhD is  a member of the  
Anesthesiology department and routinely advises that department’s researchers.  
9.2.All medical decisions  will be  made  by [CONTACT_823216].  This is an observational trial and does not  involve any  
manipulation of patient  treatment for  research  purposes.  
9.3.Other resources:
Approximately 250 one-sided knee  replacement surgeries are performed  
annually at SRMC.  The investigators  estimate  that approximately  10 per 
month would consent to participate.   
Investigators will conduct this study and associated activities as part of their routine job duties.   
10.Prior Approvals
10.1. The Departmental Review  Form is included with  this application.
10.2. The Drug Attachment is included  with this  application.
11.Multi-Site Research
11.1. This is  not multi-site  research.  
Does the intraoperative administration  of tranexamic  acid  (TXA) increase the incidence 
of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  6 of 11 Version Date: January 26, 201712.Study Procedures  
12.1.
Subjects included in the study will have ultrasonic (US) examination of their lower extremity veins performed on postoperative  day #2 by [CONTACT_823217].  The  US examination will  be interpreted by [CONTACT_823218] ([CONTACT_823226])  for the presence or absence of deep and superficial 
venous thrombosis.  No other investigations  are planned.
Each  patient will have been scheduled for elective total knee  replacement, 
which by [CONTACT_823219] (TXA).  Some surgeons administer  it intravenously,  and others use intra-
articular administration during surgery.  The  use of this medication is not  
modified by [CONTACT_823220].   Other than the study 
intervention (bilateral lower extremity  US examination) described above, no 
alteration in the  patient’s perioperative care will occur as a result of the study.  
The use of  TXA for  this purpose is widespread in orthopedic surgery but is 
technically off-label. 
The main  data source will  be the stored ultrasound images  and the associated  
radiologic interpretations, provided in a  routine radiology report. 
Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty  who develop clinical evidence of 
deep venous thrombosis (pain, swelling, redness in the lower extremity) or evidence of  pulmonary embolus would be referred for ultrasound of the  lower  
extremity regardless of study participation.  Conversely, each study patient who is found to have an asymptomatic  DVT  on US on postoperative day 2 
will be referred to their orthopedic  surgeon for  appropriate management.  This  
management may  include medical or intravascular therapy, as appropriate in  
the clinical judgment of the  physicians involved.
13.Data Analysis
13.1. The primary  outcome (rate of development of DVT) will be  analyzed  with a 
binomial test of proportion.  The null hypothesis is that  the one-sided 95% 
confidence interval around the observed  rate of DVT  will include the  historic  
rate of 12%.   The alternate  hypothesis is that this 95% confidence interval will 
be higher than  and exclude 12%.   
13.2. With traditional  thresholds of 80% power  and α=0.05, [ADDRESS_1141518] an increase  in DVT  rate from the historic 12% to 
approximately 32% with statistical  significance.
14.Provisions to Monitor the  Data to Ensure the  Safety  of Subjects
This section is required  when research  involves  more than Minimal Risk to  subjects.  
Describe:
14.1. This is  an observational trial,  so participation  in this study does not increase 
patient risk.  This study does  not modify  patients’ surgical experience, drugs  
administered, route of  administration,  or any other component of  surgery.  The 
only change  from routine practice  is the  addition of a screening exam.

of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  7 of 11 Version Date: January 26, 201715.Withdrawal of Subjects
15.1. The investigators have not identified  any likely  circumstances in  which  subjects 
may be  withdrawn from  the study without their  consent.  They may do so,  
however, if in  their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_823213].  An exhaustive listing  of these  unlikely situations is not  possible,  but one 
example would be  a disruptive  patient.  
15.2. As it does not involve treatment, this study does not include  a plan for orderly  
termination/safe withdrawal.   
15.3. This study  involves  a single ultrasound scan after routine surgery.  Partial 
withdrawal is not practical.   
15.4. If a subject  withdraws, existing data will be maintained  but with a  note 
indicating that withdrawal.   
16.Data Management/Confidentiality
16.1. Investigators include physicians  who treat  prospective  subjects as part of their 
routine job duties.   
16.2. The research requires the use  of direct  identifiers in order to  accurately  match 
scans to patients.  The scans and  the surgical  information constitute Protected 
Health Information.
16.3. The data  do not include information  that is usually considered “sensitive.” 
16.4. The investigators  do not plan to obtain a Certificate of  Confidentiality. 
16.5. Data will be maintained in locked files  in secure  areas.  All electronic data will 
be maintained  on UNM HSC secure password-protected servers.  All 
investigators are HIPAA-certified and have completed  CITI  training.  
16.6. Data will not be collected or transmitted via the  internet.
16.7. The data do not include  audio  or video recordings, or photographs. 
17.Data and Specimen Banking
17.1. Deidentified data may be  stored indefinitely to serve as underlying data to 
inform future  studies, such as for sample  size estimation.  
18.Risks to Subjects
18.1. Ultrasound scans do not involve substantial risk.  It is possible that some  
patients’ scans  may  indicate underlying health conditions  that are not known at 
the time of the  scan.   All scans involve  the lower extremity, so  this probability 
is low.   
18.2. The investigators have minimized  risk by [CONTACT_823221].  
19.Potential Benefits to Subjects
Does the intraoperative administration  of tranexamic  acid  (TXA) increase the incidence 
of deep  venous thrombosis in total knee  arthroplasty?
Page  8 of 11 Version Date: January 26, 201719.1. The scans may  indicate pre-clinical thrombosis and allow the patient to  obtain 
antithrombotic treatment earlier  than  would otherwise be available.  
20.Recruitment Methods
20.1. Patients will be  recruited in the preoperative holding areas at SRMC,  during the 
preoperative anesthesia consultation.  
20.2. Potential subjects will be identified from among investigators’ regularly scheduled patients.    
20.3. Other than the  consent/HIPAA materials,  there will not be any recruitment 
materials.  
21.Provisions to Protect the Privacy  Interests of Subjects
21.1. Recruitment and  consent discussions  will occur in  the context of the  
preoperative anesthesia consultation, which is already handled in a private/confidential manner.  Investigators  will first ask whether potential  
subjects are  interested in participating in a study,  and if so, the details will be 
discussed and the consent material introduced.

Waiver or  Alteration of Consent  Process  (consent will not be obtained, required 
element of consent  will not be included, or one or more required elements of 
consent will  be altered) 
We are not requesting waiver or alteration  of the consent process.
26.Documentation of  Consent
26.1. A consent/HIPAA form is  included with this application.  Only consenting  
patients will be  enrolled.
27.Study Test Results/Incidental Findings
27.1. Individual  Results: Individual results will be shared with  participants inasmuch 
as they  will be kept apprised of  their condition by [CONTACT_823222];  a 
DVT is a medical condition that would be  brought to the attention of the patient.  
As noted in section  12 above,  this treatment may involve medical or 
intravascular treatment as appropriate,  depending on the clinical judgment of the 
physicians involved.
27.2. Incidental  Findings: The radiologist  who reads the ultrasound scan will report 
any incidental findings to an investigator or the patient’s surgeon for  followup.  
The exact nature  of this followup depends on the nature of the incidental

discussed with the  patient as appropriate.   
28.Sharing  Study Progress or Results  with  Subjects
28.1. The investigators  do not plan to share partial study results with  subjects.  
Similarly, the  investigators do not plan to keep patient identifiers or contact 
[CONTACT_823223], so it will not be possible  to 
contact [CONTACT_823224].  In any  event, the outcome of  interest 
will have either occurred or not occurred  for each subject, so the experiences  of 
others will not be  useful  information to the subjects.
29.Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations
29.1. The study  does  not include vulnerable populations.  Some  subjects may be 
students or employees of UNM or UNM HSC, but these are  not specifically 
targeted or  excluded.
30.Community-Based Participatory Research
30.1. This study does not involve community-based participatory research.
31.Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations
31.1. American Indian/Native persons may be incidentally enrolled in this study, but  
they are not specifically targeted  or excluded.    
32.Transnational Research
32.1. This study does not involve transnational research.   
33.Drugs or  Devices
33.1. Tranexamic  acid is approved by [CONTACT_1622], but is off-label for the usage 
described above.   This study does not modify its usage in  any way.  The 
investigators have not sought an IND.

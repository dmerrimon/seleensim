Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double- blind, Crossover Study to Assess the Injection Site 
Pain Associated With a Modified Etanercept Formulation in Adult Subjects With Either 
Rheumatoid Arthritis or Psoriatic Arthritis  
Study Phase:   3b 
Indication:  Rheumatoid Arthritis  (RA) or Psoriatic Arthritis  (PsA)  
Primary Objective:    
• To assess the injection site pain associated with a modified formulation of etanercept 
compared to the currently marketed etanercept in adult subjects with either rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as measured by a visual analog scale ( VAS)   
Secondary Objective:    
• To describe the injection site pain by [CONTACT_198046]:    
• To evaluate  the safety of etanercept  
Hypotheses :  The primary hypothesis of this study is that the modified etanercept formulation will 
be associated with less injection site pain compared to the currently marketed etanercept 
formulation.  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Change in injection site pain score between the current formulation and the modified 
formulation as measured by [CONTACT_198047]:    
• Advers e events  
Study Design:  This is a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, 2- period, 2- sequence 
crossover study in subjects with RA or PsA who are naive to etanercept.  The study will evaluate 
injection site pain associated with the current formulation of etanercept and the modified 
formulation of etanercept immediately after injection of each formulation.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_235345] treatment sequence 
(ie, sequence AB) will receive [ADDRESS_235346] study period 
(ie, treatment A), followed by a second visit 1 week later during the second study period at which 
time subjects will receive 1 dose of the modified formulation (ie, treatment  B).  Subjects 
randomized to the second treatment sequence will undergo the same procedures but will receive investigational product in the opposite order (ie,  sequence BA).  Subjects who dropout after the 
first injection will not be replaced by [CONTACT_160516].  At each study visit , subjects will inject the 
blinded treatment and immediately (ie, within 30 seconds of injection) record the associated 
injection site pain using the VAS .  A total of 112 subjects will be enrolled with 56 subjects in each 
treatment sequence, stratified by [CONTACT_198048] (RA or PsA).  A minimum  of 20 PsA subjects 
will be enrolled.  
After study completion subjects may continue with commercially available etanercept.  The study 
will consis t of a screening period of up to 14 days, a treatment period of 2 weeks , and a 30-day 
safety follow -up period.  
Sample Size:   The proposed sample size of 112 (ie, [ADDRESS_235347] 
10 subjects with PsA) would provide approximately 53 subjects for each sequence treatment arm 
at the completion of the study, assuming an early termination or dropout rate of 5 % for each 
sequence treatment arm over the course of the study.

Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  [ADDRESS_235348] Eligibility Criteria:   
• Male or female subject is ≥ 18 years of age at time of signing the informed consent form .  
• Subject has a diagnosis of RA or PsA and indicated for treatment with etanercept per the 
current label, based on investigator judgment.  
• Subject is naïve to etanercept . 
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section  4.1.  
Investigational Product 
[COMPANY_010] Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  All injections of etanercept will 
be administered by [CONTACT_198049] a subcutaneous injection at the study site on the scheduled 
dose day.  The subject must demonstrate to the site staff that he or she is competent to correctly 
administer the subcutaneous doses.  Supplies of etanercept will be dispensed to subjects during the study visit.   
Each dose of etanercept will consist of the complete contents of [ADDRESS_235349] injection should be on either the right or left half of the abdomen with the second injection occurring on the opposite side of the abdomen.  Each dose will follow the recommended label dosing for subjects with RA and PsA: 50 mg weekly (scheduled approximately 7 days apart) .  Throughout the entire study , 
administration of etanercept should occur on the scheduled day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the dose is not within 3 days of the previous or next scheduled dose.  If the dosing window is missed, that dose should be skipped.  Etanercept is to be taken the 
day of a study visit in the presence of the investigator or designee.  
Procedures:   At specified time points outlined in the Schedule of Assessments subjects will 
undergo the following procedures: collection of informed consent form, medical /medication 
history , demographics, physical exam ination,  height, weight, vital signs, and chest x -ray (if 
needed) .  Subjects will provide samples for hematology, blood chemistry, hepatitis B and 
C serologies , and tuberculosis testing.  Females  of childbearing potential  will provide serum and 
urine pregnancy tests.  Research staff will document the use of concomitant medications and all 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_423].  Thirty  days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of etanercept , 
subjects will undergo a safety follow -up visit.  For a full  list of study procedures, including the 
timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ).   
Statistical Considerations:  The primary analysis set will include all subjects who received the 
dose of investigational product during each study period and who completed the injection site 
pain score  during each study period.  The primary endpoint will be evaluated based on this 
prima ry analysis set.  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_235350] during the study .  All safety endpoints will be evaluated using the safety analysis set.  
Analysis of covariance will be used to compare the difference in injection site pain score  within  
subjects receiving etanercept in the current ly marketed formulation and in the modified 
formulation, with the disease indication (RA or PsA) and the treatment as factors, adjusting for period effect and sequence effect.  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables, consist s of number of observations, mean, 
standard error and/or standard deviation, median, 25th percentile (Q1), 75th percentile (Q3), minimum, maximum, and f or categorical variables, the number of observations, frequency, and 
percentage will be presented.  Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety information will be summarized.  There will be no adjustment for multiplicity and no 
imputation techniques for missing values .  All analyses will be based on observed data.

1. OBJECTIVES 
1.1 P rimary 
• To assess the injection site pain associated with a modified formulation of 
etanercept compared to the currently marketed etanercept in adult subjects with 
either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as measured by a 
visual  analog scale (VAS)  
1.2 Secondary  
• To describe the injection site pain by [CONTACT_198048] 
1.3 Safety 
• To evaluate the safety of etanercept  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory arthropathy of 
unknow n etiology.  Symptoms include joint stiffness, pain, and swelling that can 
progress to deformities and loss of function of both small and large joints .  Rheumatoid 
arthritis occurs worldwide in approximately 1%  of adults of all races .  Disease onset 
occurs most often between the ages 20 and 60 years, with peak occurrences at 40 to 
45 years .  The prevalence of RA increases with age in both sexes, and prevalence is  
higher in women than men, with a ratio of approx imately 2.5 ( Alamanos et al, 2006 ). 
PsA is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the peripheral joints and axial skeleton that  
occurs in 7%  to 34%  of patients with psoriasis  ([PsO] Scarpa et al, 1984;  
Biondi  et al, 1989;  Espi[INVESTIGATOR_198031], 1992;  Shbeeb et al, 2000), which in turn has a 
prevalence of 1 % to 3% in the general population ( Biondi et al, 1989 ; Koo, 1996) .  
Articular involvement  can vary  widely from an isolated monoarthritis to a very destructive 
diffuse arthritis mutilans.   Other symptoms associated with PsA include dactylitis, 
enthesitis, and nail changes.   Typi[INVESTIGATOR_198032], onycholysis, 
ridges, and thickening of the nail.  Although most patients have associated PsO, PsA 
can present without skin changes.  Radiographic features include joint erosions, joint 
space loss, osteolysis that  may cause penciling of the phalanx, and periostitis.  Psoriatic  
arthritis  can lead to permanent  destruction of joints and functional disabilities.  
2.[ADDRESS_235369]  Background  
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory and immune responses .  It plays a role in the inflammatory process of RA 
and PsO.  Elevated levels of TNF alpha (α) are found in involved tissues and fluids of

Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  [ADDRESS_235370] naturally as monomeric 
molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms .  Biological activity of TNF is de pendent 
upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptor.  
Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand -binding 
portion of the human 75-kilodalton TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human 
immunoglobulin G1 .  Etanercept  inhibits binding of TNFα  and TNF beta ([β] lymphotoxin 
alpha ) to cell surface TNF receptors, rendering TNF biologically inactive.  In the United 
States (US) and Canada, etanercept is currently indicated for the treatment of:  
1) moderately to severely active RA, alone or in combination with methotrexate; 
2) moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients ages 
2 and older in the US and 4 to 17 years in Canada; 3) PsA alone or in combination with 
methotrexate; 4) active ankylosing spondylitis; and 5) adult patients with chronic 
moderate to severe plaque PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy or 
phototherapy.  
Refer to the specific section of the Etanercept  Investigators’  Brochure, or the product 
label  for additional information related to the  physical, chemical , and pharmaceutical 
properties and formulation(s) . 
2.3 Rationale  
Injection- related pain can often contribute  to the poor compliance of drug administration.  
It is believed that route of administration, physical and chemical attributes of injected 
drug products, and the physical attributes of needles used to administer these drugs play a role in injection pain associated with drug administration ( Flanagan et al, 2007; 
Laursen et al, 2006 ; Palmon et al, 1998 ; Robb and Kanji, 2002).  Alleviation of injection 
site pain can occur through modification of the solution composition.  An etanercept 
modified formulation with minor excipi[INVESTIGATOR_198033].  The modified etanercept 
50 mg/mL liquid formulation designed for use in this study is similar to the currently 
marketed etanercept product and has been shown in a single dose study to reduce injection- related pain.  This study is designed to investigate the injection site pain of the 
modified formulation in comparison with currently marketed formulation of etanercept.   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, [ADDRESS_235371]:  Enbrel  
Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  30 March  2017 Page 15 of 65 
measured by a 100  mm VAS specifically designed to query these  data.  The VAS scores 
will be collected immediately (ie, within 30 seconds after injection) after subcutaneous 
administration to assess injection site pain.  A difference of 13 to 16 mm on the VAS is 
considered to be clinically meaningful (Gallagher et al, 2002) in a setting of acute pain.  
Both internal and published data on clinicaltrials.gov have demonstrated that patients 
with RA , in general , report injection site pain with lower intensity as compared to healthy 
volunteers.  RA and PsA were the indications chosen for this study as prior studies with 
this formulation were in healthy volunteers.  These are of the most common indications 
for which etanercept is prescribed.  These populations use the same dosing interval of 
etanercept, which allows them both to be included in this study.  Additionally, including 
both populations allows the results of this study to be applied in a broader context for the medical community.  
Prior internal studies have demonstrated that attenuation of the injection site pain response occurs with repeated injection of investigational product.   This study will collect 
data using [ADDRESS_235372]:  Enbrel  
Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  30 March  2017 Page 16 of 65 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_235373] treatment sequence (ie, sequence AB) will receive 1 dose of the current formulation (ie, treatment A) during 
the first study period, followed by a second visit 1 week later during the second study period at  which time subjects will receive 1 dose o f the modified formulation 
(ie, treatment B).  Subjects randomized to the second treatment sequence will undergo 
the same procedures but will receive investigational product in the opposite order (ie, sequence BA).   At each study visit subjects will inject the blinded treatment and 
immediately (ie, within 30 seconds of injection) record the associated injection site pain 
using the VAS.  A total of 112 subjects will be enrolled with 56 subjects in each 
treatment sequence, stratified by [CONTACT_198048] (RA or PsA).  A minimum  of [ADDRESS_235374] of a screening period of up to 14 days, a treatment period of 
2 weeks and a 30-day safety follow -up period.   
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.2 Number of Sites 
Approximately 30 sites in the US will participate in this study.   
Sites that do not enroll subjects within 3 months  of site initiation may be closed.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
A total of 112 subjects are expected to enroll in this study with 56 subjects in each 
treatment sequence.  Subjects  will be randomly assigned in a blinded manner to 1 of 
2 crossover sequences.  The sample size accounts for 5 % withdrawal or dropout.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/ independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed  consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  
Subjects  must personally sign and date the  IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] approved informed 
consent form before commencement of study -specific activities /procedures.    
Upon completion of the screening period the subject is evaluated by [CONTACT_198051]/exclusion criteria , the subject is 
subsequently eligible to be enrolled in the study and either randomized or assigned to a 
treatment regimen.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The  investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the 14-day screening period for the study receives a 
unique subject identification number bef ore any study -related activities /procedures are 
performed.  The subject identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_75595]/IWR.  This 
number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be 
used on all study documentation related to that subject.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study.  If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 14- day window, the subject will be registered as 
a screen fail.  Screen failed subjects may be eligible for re -screening once.  
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.

5.1 Randomization/Treatm ent Assignment  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_235400] treatment sequence (ie, sequence  AB) will receive 1 dose of the 
current formulation (ie, treatment A) during the first study period, followed by a second 
visit 1 , week later during the second study period at which time subjects will receive 
1 dose of the modified formulation (ie, treatment  B).  Subject s randomized to the second 
treatment sequence will undergo the same procedures but will receive investigational 
product in the opposite order (ie, sequence BA).  At each study visit , subjects will inject 
the blinded treatment and immediately (ie, within 30 seconds of injection) record the 
associated injection site pain using the VAS.   
The random ization will be performed via IVR/IWR system on-study day [ADDRESS_235401]’s medical record and on the 
enrollment CRF.   
5.[ADDRESS_235402]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject  on this study .  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.   
The investigator  is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_198052]’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event  (ie, unbl inding) .

Etanercept  will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_21931]. and distributed using 
[COMPANY_010] clinical study drug distribution procedures.  The solution of etanercept is clear 
and colorless.  Etanercept will be supplied in a single- use SureClick autoinjector as  a 
sterile, preservative- free solution for subcutaneous injection.  Each single -use SureClick 
autoinjector contains 0.98 mL of 50 mg/mL  etanercept in either the currently marketed 
formulation (Treatment A) or a modified formulation (Treatment B).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
All injections of etanercept will be administered by [CONTACT_2180] a subcutaneous injection at the study site on the scheduled dose day.  The subject  must demonstrate to 
the site staff that he or she is competent to correctly administer the subcutaneous doses.  
Supplies of etanercept will be dispensed to subjects during the study visit.   
Each dose of etanercept will consist of the complete contents of [ADDRESS_235404] injection should be on either the right or left half of the abdomen with the second injection occurring on the opposite side of the abdomen.  Each dose will follow the recommended label dosing for subjects with RA and PsA: 50 mg weekly (scheduled approximately 7 days apart).  Throughout the entire study , administration of etanercept 
should occur on the scheduled day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the dose is not within 3 days of the previous or next scheduled dose.  If 
the dosing window is missed, that dose should be skipped.  Etanercept is to be taken the 
day of a study visit in the presence of the investigator or designee. 
The volume (full, partial, or non e), dose date, and box number of etanercept are to be 
recorded on each subj ect’s CRF.

9.[ADDRESS_235435]:  Enbrel  
Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  [ADDRESS_235436]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening  indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcom e than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on-study , 
is not  considered an adverse event.    
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or 
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject  request s to 
withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198041] , refer to 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_235437] 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event such as worsening of symptoms of RA or PsA is to be reported 
as a serious adverse event if : 
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becom es worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a subject  with the same underlying condition, or

• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75587] ,  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria.  
All adverse events of malignancies should be classified as serious adverse events.  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”,  if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient 
surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_198059]. 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol), 
• Assessment of relatedness to  etanercept and SureClick device,  study 
procedures/study activities , and 
• Action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Toxicity Criteria .  The 
grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  If the severity of an 
adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as 
a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF.  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the  
etanercept and SureClick device.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_198060]?

recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_198061] [ADDRESS_235439]’s medical record and are submitted to 
[COMPANY_010] .  A shorter or l onger safety follow -up interval can be utilized following 
consultation with the [COMPANY_010] Global Safety Officer and are recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and are submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All serious adverse events must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.    
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies  where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the etanercept and SureClick device.   This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_198060]?

assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be unblinded by [CONTACT_198062] n to regulatory authorities.   
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting  requirements according to local regulations and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with local regulatory requirements and procedures . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after  end-of-study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events  reported outside of the protocol- required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical study  cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.

In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by [CONTACT_21975]’s  Global Research & Development Compliance 
and Audit function (or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, 
protocol -required therap y storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related 
records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, 
ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to C RFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_53435].  
• The investigator  signs only the Investigator  Verification Form for this EDC study or 
the investigator applies an electronic signature [CONTACT_198068].  This signature [CONTACT_198069], the data queries, and agrees with the content.  
[COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform Self-Evident Cor rections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical study  database.  The Self-Evident Corrections  will be documented in the CRF 
instructions available in the EDC system.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be 
corrected by [CONTACT_11337] (or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data ( ie, the 
same results sent twice with the same date with different visit , [eg, week 4 and early 
termination] ) and updating a specific response if the confirming datum is provided in the 
“other, specify ” field (eg, for race, r eason for ending study) .  
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator  is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subject’s  not receiving protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as 
stipu lated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw 
before  completion of all protocol- required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1), the investigator can search publically available  
records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] may facilitate the formation 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate [COMPANY_010] 
staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does 
not guarantee authorship .  The criteria described below  are to be met  for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  [ADDRESS_235453] of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals , which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for im portant intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the 
work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the 
work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 
2, 3, and 4.  
• When a large, multi center  group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals should fully meet  the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this  study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator , and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3 require 
the following:  
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg,  Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in  whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_235457] or ALT elevations > [ADDRESS_235458] or 2-fold increases 
above baseline values for subjects with elevated values before drug are to undergo a 
period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s 
baseline levels.   
Assessments that are to be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin  (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR  is to be performed every [ADDRESS_235459](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL.  The following are to be considered depending on the clinical situation:  
− Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
CONFIDENTIAL    
 
  
Product:  Enbrel  
Protocol Number:  20140339  
Date:  30 March  2017 Page 56 of 65 
− Serum total immunoglobulin G, Anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA), Anti Smooth Muscle 
Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 ( LKM1 ) to assess for 
autoimmune hepatitis  
− Serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− A more detailed history of:  
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
• Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Viral serologies  
− CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear 
− Appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Appropri ate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not already been 
collected  
• Hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal  or considered stable by [CONTACT_093] .  
The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_235460](s) and protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in the corresponding CRFs .

DESIGN   
The objectives of this study will be met by [CONTACT_746] a  24-week,  randomized, controlled, single -blinded, two -
arm, parallel group, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] a t a single center. A total of 200 subjects may be screened to identify 110 
participants  to be enrolled and randomized. T hese participants will be ≥ [ADDRESS_1031199] one year  with an HIV viral load < 75 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at screening , and have major 
depression using the PHQ -9 questionnaire . The se participant s will be randomized 1 :1 to ei ther depression 
treatment with the Beating -the-Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program  (N=55) or usual care (N=55).   
 
OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to compare 12-week  changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the 
brachial artery in HIV -infected, depressed adults already receiving virologically suppressive antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) who are then randomized to either depression treatment with the Beating the Blues (BtB) 
cognitive behavioral therapy program or to Usual Care (UC) . Key s econdary objectives include comparing 
changes in FMD between the two groups at 24 weeks and comparing changes  in circulating IL -6, hsCRP, D -
dimer , EPCs /ECFCs, and markers of monocyte activati on (CD14+CD16+ cell proportions and sCD14/sCD163)    
at both 12 and 24 weeks.  
 
DURATION  
Each individual participant  will be followed for approximately 28 weeks ( up to 4 weeks from  screening to 
randomization and 24 weeks  on study) . We expect to enroll [ADDRESS_1031200] achieved HIV -1 viral loads less than 75 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL while receiving stable ART for at least [ADDRESS_1031201] a PHQ -9 score ≥ 10. Participants  will be 
recruited from the infectious diseases outpatie nt clinics of Eskenazi  Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753248].   
 
SAMPLE SIZE  
The total sample size for this study will consist of 110 enrolled participants . Up to 200 participants  may be 
screened to identify the 110 eligible for enrollment.  If a consented and otherwise eligible participan t withdraws 
prior to the Baseline/Entry Visit, this participant will be replaced.

 2.2 Background  
 
2.2.1 HIV and cardiovascular events  
  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a leading cause of death in the HIV -infected population 
receiving ART ( 1). Given that lifespans of the HIV -infected population are nearing those of the uninfected 
popula tion with the widespread use of ART ( 2-5), there is growing concern that the risk of HIV -CVD will be 
magnified several -fold worldwide, especially as the population ages ( 6). Although previously attributed to the 
dysmetabolic effects of ART, the greater risk of CVD in HIV remains, even when newer ART drugs are used that do not induce severe dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, or insulin resistance ( 7). Attention has thus turned to HIV -
specific mechanisms as potential explanations for HIV -CVD. In fact, elevated markers of generalized 
inflammation (IL -6, hsCRP) and coagulation (D -dimer) have been found to predict HIV -CVD events ( 8-11). 
HIV may also be associated with impaired endothelial  function ( 12, 13) , perhaps due to this dysregulated 
inflammation and coagulation ( 14). 
 One possible etiology of the heightened inflammation, altered coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction 
in HIV, and consequently  of the increased risk of HIV -CVD, may be depression. Depression is an independent 
predictor of incident CVD in the general population ( 15) with heightened inflammation ( 16), altered 
coagu lation ( 17-19), and endothelial dysfunction (20-23) among the leadi ng candidate mechanisms underlying 
this relationship. Thus, it stands to reason that depression may contribute to or exacerbate these pathways in HIV and thus increase the risk of HIV -CVD. Indeed, our preliminary data (section c1) indicate that depressive 
disorders independently increase the risk of incident acute myocardial infarction (MI) in HIV -infected veterans. 
However, it is unknown if depression leads to HIV -CVD through inflammatory, coagulatory, and/or endothelial 
dysfunction pathways. It is also unknown if depression treatments (antidepressants and/or psychotherapy) modulate these pathways and, therefore, may be useful as HIV -CVD primary prevention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 It is important to note that there are as yet no definitive studies demonstrating that low ering systemic 
inflammation or coagulation reduces HIV -CVD events in those already on ART ( 12, 24, 25) . Although 
pharmacological studies of low -dose met hotrexate and ‘statins’ are underway to address this issue, it is not 
known if such interventions will be beneficial. Even if these interventions are found to be successful, they may be associated with adverse events, drug interactions, and increased cost when provided over the years to decades required to prevent CVD events in the aging HIV -infected population.  
 2.2.2 Depression, depression treatment, and CVD risk in the general population 
  Thirty years of evidence indicates that depression is an independent risk factor for CVD ( 26). Meta-
analyses have shown that adults with depressive disorders or elevated symptoms have a 64% greater risk of future CVD ( 27, 28 ). The de pression- CVD relationship is comparable in strength to conventional CVD risk 
factors and is independent of other emotional factors ( 29). In addition, CVD risk increases with depression 
severity ( 27). Finally, depression has been linked to several atherogenic factors ( 30, 31) , which supports the 
biological plausibility of the depression- to-future -CVD connection. Because depression meets 8 of Hill’s 9 
criteria for causation ( 32), it is reasonable to conclude that depression is an independent, and potentially causal, 
CVD risk factor. The cri terion not yet met is experimental evidence; however, our recently published study ( 33) 
indica tes that d epression treatment may be a CVD primary prevention strategy.  
 To date, few clinical trials have evaluated if depression treatments reduce the likelihood of CVD events 
(34-38). In general, these trials have not observed the anticipated benefits. A key study was the Enhancing 
Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) Patients trial, in which 2,[ADDRESS_1031203] -MI patients with 
depression and/or low social support were randomized to cognitive behavioral treatment or usual care. After 29 months, no difference in nonfatal MI or death was found ( 34). Similar negative results were observed in the 
Myocardial Infarction and Depression Intervention Trial (MIND -IT), in which depressed post -MI patients were 
randomized to a staged pharm acologic intervention or usual care ( 38).  
 
September 1, 2017   6 
  We recently proposed a novel explanation: the depression interventions in past trials, all of which 
involved patients with pre -existing CVD, may have been delivered too late in the natural history of CVD ( 39). 
We hypothesized that treating depression before, versus after, the ons et of clinical CVD could reduce risk of 
CVD events because: (1) earlier treatment of another CVD risk factor, hypercholesterolemia, yields more 
pronounced benefits ( 40-43), (2) depression exerts a cardiotoxic influence early in CVD pathogenesis ( 22, 29, 
44, 45) , (3) depression treatments may have greater antidepressive efficacy prior to clinical CVD onset ( 46-48), 
and (4) conventional prognostic factors may override depression's effect during the later stages of CVD ( 15, 
49). To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted an 8- year follow -up study ( 33) of the Improving Mood-
Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) trial ( 48), in which older depressed patients were 
randomized to a collaborative stepped care intervention involving antidepressants and psychotherapy or usual care. Results supported our hypothesis. IMPACT patients (24/85=28%) without baseline CVD had a 48% lower 
risk of first MI or stroke (HR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.31- 0.86) than Usual Care patients (39/83=47%). There was no 
treatment benefit among patients with baseline CVD. These findings strengthen the case for depression being a causal CVD risk factor and suggest that depression treatment is a potential CVD primary prevention strategy.  
 
2.2.3 Associations between depression and depression therapy with inflammation, coagulation, and 
endothelial function in the ge neral population 
  Systemic inflammation is one candidate mechanism that might explain how depression promotes CVD 
(50). A recent meta -analysis revealed that inflam matory markers, including IL -6 and hsCRP, are upregulated in 
depressed individuals ( 51). Depression also predicts increases in inflammatory marker levels up to 10 years 
later ( 51-53). Notably, the inflammatory markers elevated in depression are predictive of incident CVD ( 46). 
Depression -related dysfunction in the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous 
system, two systems that normally exert anti- inflammatory effects, have been proposed to explain how 
depression may promote inflammation ( 50, 53) . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been 
found to reduce IL -6 levels in depressed patients ( 54, 55) , and this potentially beneficial effect seems limited to 
those whose depression improved ( 56-60). In addition, two small trials in patients with cancer or recent CABG 
found that cognitive behavioral treatment led to reduced IL -6 and hsCRP levels ( 61, 62) , results similar to our 
preliminary data (section c6).  
 Depression has been variably associated with altered coagulation ( 18, 19, 31 , 63-71). For instance, 
Lukas et al. ( 18) found that depressive disorders were associated w ith higher D -dimer levels, and von Kanel et 
al. (72, 73)  found that acute psychological stressors in depress ed patients led to higher D -dimer levels even after 
the stressors resolved. However, other studies have not observed similar associations ( 70, 74, 75) . Little is 
known about the effects of depression treatment on altered coagulation, although a small study recently found 
that SSRI treatment may counteract elevated D -dimer levels associated with depression ( 64). Given the known 
utility of D -dimer in predicting HIV -CVD and the availability of this marker in the large VACS Biomarker 
Cohort, it is reasonable to study this marker of coagulation in relation to depression in this application. Endothelial dysfunction is also a candidate mechanism through which depression may increase CVD risk. A recent meta- analysis of 12 studies revealed the depression is moderately  and inversely associated with FMD in 
the general population (overall r=0.19, p=0.001) ( 22). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690] (section c4) are in line with these 
findings. A few small studies have suggested improvements in FMD or nitric oxide availability with SSRI treatment ( 23, 76, 77) . Of note, SSRIs could reduce inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction 
either via depres sion reduction or potential direct medication effects on these systems (
78-80). We are not 
aware of any studies, other than our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (section c6), that have examined the effect of cognitive behavioral treatment for depression on endothelial function.

 2.2.4 HIV, depression, and CVD risk 
 
 Depression is highly prevalent in the HIV -infected population, including in those receiving ART, with 
rates ranging from to 20 -40% ( 81-84). Several studies have suggested that the rate of depression in HIV is two -
fold greater th an in uninfected individuals ( 85). Give n this high prevalence of depression, it stands to reason 
that this comorbidity may appreciably contribute to HIV complication. In fact, chronic depressive symptoms are associated with greater Framingham risk scores in HIV -infected persons ( 86), but our recent work is the first to 
show a relationship between depressive disorders and HIV -CVD (section c1). This current application seeks to 
identify the underlying mechanisms for this association and a new intervention to mitigate the risk of depression- related CVD in HIV.  
 2.2.5 Endothelial progenitor cells, soluble markers  of monocyte activation, and cardiovascular disease 
 
Endothelial Progenitor cells (E PCs) are defined as cells that are found circulating within the bloodstream 
and when cultured are capable of taking on the phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature endothelial cells. EPCs are thought to home in to sites of vascular damage and as sist in angiogenesis by [CONTACT_753264]. Multiple studies have now shown an inverse relationship between metabolic syndrome, CAD, and levels of circulating EPCs ( 87).   
The published literature regarding EPCs in HIV are conflicting with some showing no difference 
between HIV -infected and uninfected groups and others suggesting a lower level in those with HIV and an 
inverse association with FMD ( 88-92). These studies use differing methodologies in assessing EPCs. However, 
the laboratory of [CONTACT_753288] and has established a ‘gold standard’ phenotype for differentiating EPCs from endothelial colony forming cell (ECFCs) ( 93). We will employ this method in the current study for 
assessing the relationships between depression treatment and ECFC levels.  
In addition, CD14
+CD16+ cell subsets and the soluble monocyte activation markers sCD14 and sCD163 
have been linked to greater inflammatory atherosclerotic disease burden in those with HIV infection ( 94). 
Moreover, monocyte activation has been linked in some studies to more severe depression ( 95, 96) . As such, 
these markers of monocyte activation will also be measured in this trial. Understanding the relationship between these cell  subsets, monocyte activation, endothelial dysfunction i n HIV during depression treatment is crucial to 
the continued efforts to explain the conferred increase in cardiovascular in those with HIV  and possibly identify 
new biomarkers for risk assessment in this population.  2.2.6 Cognitive behavioral treatment to improve depression: the Beating the Blues  program  
  Beating the Blues  (U Squared Interactive; see www.beatingthebluesus.com
 for a video tutorial) is an 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_4260], stand- alone, cognitive behavioral treatment program appropriate for adults with little 
computer experience and at least a 5th-6th grade reading level ( 97). This program utilizes an interactive, 
multimedia format to delive r eight 50- minute, weekly sessions, the structure and content of which mirror face -
to-face cognitive behavioral treatment. Although sessions are tailored to each patient’s problems, general topi[INVESTIGATOR_753249], activity scheduling, problem solving, graded exposure, task breakdown, sleep management, and relapse prevention. Patients are also assigned tailored homeworks.  Beating the Blues  is an appropriate selection for the proposed trial, as it is efficacious, acceptable, and an  
excellent fit with our goals. First, it has more empi[INVESTIGATOR_753250], including a positive randomized trial of 274 depressed patients ( 98, 99) . It is a potent intervention ( 98-106), 
with effect sizes comparable to face -to-face cognitive behavioral treatment (107). In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we also 
observed a large Beating the Blues  effect size for depressive symptoms (d=1.33). Because of its strong evidence 
base,  the National Institute for Health and Care Evidence recommended this program for managing depression 
in the English National Health Service in 2006 ( 108). In addition, since 2012, Beating the Blues  has been listed 
in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) National Registry of 
 
September 1, 2017   8 
 Evidence -based Programs  and Practices. Second, Beating the Blues has been shown to be acceptable to patients 
(97, 105, 106, 109) . Third, Beating the Blues  is an excellent fit with our long -term g oal of equippi[INVESTIGATOR_753251] a new tool to simultaneously manage depression and CVD risk in their patients, g iven that it is a 
safe, inexpensive, and easily implemented intervention due to the lack of dependence on trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
 
2.2.7 Flow -mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery  
  Endothelial dysfunction is the impaired ability of the vascular lining to maintain normal homeostasis. 
Endothelial dysfunction is an early precursor to atherosclerosis and has been shown to predict future 
cardiovascular events in most population studies ( 110-112). Improvement in endothelial function, as measured 
by [CONTACT_361600], is associated with a reduced risk of future cardiovascular events ( 113, 114) . 
FMD is a non- invasive technique using high- resolution ultrasound which was developed to measure changes in 
brachial artery diameter due to a stimulus ( 115), with results correlating closely with coronary endothelial 
function ( 116, 117) . Measurements are made before and after endothelium -dependent and endothelium -
independent stimuli ( 118). The endothelium -dependent stimulus is hyperemic blood flow triggered after the 
release of an inflated blood pressure cuff aro und the forearm. The shear stress from the increased blood flow 
subsequently causes endogenous vasodilators, predominantly nitric oxide, to be released from the endothelium which then relaxes the vascular smooth muscle. This flow -mediated dilation (FMD) of  the brachial artery is 
thus a measure of the endothelium’s ability to respond normally to hyperemic shear stress. A second stimulus, nitroglycerin, which directly relaxes smooth muscle is then applied to determine the smooth muscle’s functional capacity. This endothelium -independent measurement is called nitroglycerin -mediated dilation (NTGMD). If 
FMD is low, but NTGMD is normal, the endothelium, and not the smooth muscle, can be safely assumed to be dysfunctional. FMD and NTGMD are calculated as the percent increases, respectively, in diameter.  
 FMD is an ideal measure of cardiovascular risk in this current trial for several reasons. First, as a 
continuous measure, use of FMD as a CVD endpoint in the proposed trial provides greater statistical power and thus requires smaller sample sizes compared to a hard endpoint trial. Second, as opposed to anatomic 
measurements such as coronary calcium or carotid intima media thickness, FMD is a dynamic and mechanistic physiologic assessment of vascular function. Third , FMD responds within days to weeks of an intervention 
(119) and, thus, can be used to detect changes in cardiovascular ris k quickly, which is vital when evaluating the 
potential efficacy of a new intervention such as cognitive behavioral treatment.   2.[ADDRESS_1031204] incident CVD in the HIV -infected 
population as they do in the general population. We previously found that HIV infection independently increases the risk of incident acute MI by 48% overall and by 39% in those with HIV -1 RNA levels <500 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml in the VACS Virtual Cohort ( 120). Using this same cohort, we examined relationships between the 
presence of a depressive disorder at baseline and 6 -year incidence of incident MI (CROI 2014). Of the 27,350 
HIV-infected male veterans free of CVD at baseline (1998 -2003), 6,219 (23%) had a b aseline depressive 
disorder (ICD -9 codes 296.2, 296.3, or 300.4) and 367 (1.3%) suffered incident acute MI [defined using enzyme 
and EKG clinical data, inpatient ICD-9 code 410 in Medicare data, or ICD -10 code 121 as underlying cause of 
death on the death certificate] during the follow -up period (2003- 2009). Cox models adjusted for demographic 
factors (age, race/ethnicity), CVD risk factors (hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, smoking, diabetes, body mass index), and other potential confounders (hepatitis C infec tion, renal disease, alcohol and cocaine abuse, 
hemoglobin level, CD4 cell count, HIV -1 RNA level, antiretroviral medications) revealed that the presence of a 
baseline depressive disorder was an independent predictor of incident acute MI (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.03- 1.67, 
 
September 1, 2017   9 
 p=0.03). Our results (a) confirm that depressive disorders are highly prevalent in HIV -infected adults and (b) 
are the first to indicate that depression is a novel candidate risk factor for HIV -CVD events.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1031205] CVD events  
 
 Depression treatment has been unsuccessful in preventing subsequent CVD events in HIV -uninfected 
patients with pre -existing CVD. Providing depression treatment as primary prevention, however, appears to 
hold promise. As reported in our 2014 paper in Psychosomatic Medicine  (33), we tested our hypothesis that 
treating depression before clinical CVD onset reduces the risk of CVD events by [CONTACT_56078] [ADDRESS_1031206] trial ( 48, 121) . In that multisite RCT, 1801 depressed 
primary care patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_1031207] depression intervention (a collaborative stepped care intervention involving primarily SSRIs and/or brief cognitive behavioral treatment) or usual care. 
The 235 patients (76% female, 47% Black) from the Indiana sites were assessed for hard CVD events during follow -up using electronic medical record data linked with Medicare/Medicaid claims.  
During follow -up, 119 patients (51%) had a hard CVD event (MI or stroke). As hypothesized, we 
detected a Treatment x Baseline CVD interaction (p=0.021), indicating that time to CVD event varied across the groups (Figure). Among the [ADDRESS_1031208] patients had a 48% lower risk of a hard CVD 
event than Usual Care patients (28% vs. 47%, HR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.31- 0.86; p=0.01). Highlighting clinical 
significance, the number needed to treat to prevent one hard CVD event over [ADDRESS_1031209], among the 67 patients with baseline CVD, t he likelihood of a CVD event did not differ between arms (86% vs. 
81%, HR=1.19, 95% CI: 0.70- 2.03; p=0.52), consistent with prior trials (
34, 38) . A similar pattern of results 
was found for men and women, for MI and stroke, and after adjustment for potential confounders. The 
IMPACT intervention was efficacious for depression treatment among patients without (p<0.001) but not with 
baseline CVD (p=0.83). In sum, we found that depression treatment, delivered before clinical CVD onset, 
halved the excess risk of first CVD events amo ng depressed, HIV -uninfected adults, suggesting that depression 
treatment could be used as CVD primary prevention strategy.

 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_753252], we examined the cross -
sectional relationship between depression and FMD in 35 HIV -uninfected 
primary care patients. Participants were 41 -72 years old (66% female, 49% 
non-white) with no history of CVD or other chroni c conditions. A total of 
29% screened positive for depression defined as Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) score ≥10, which has 88% sensitivity and 88% 
specificity for major depressive disorder ( 122). Values [mean (SD)] for the 
PHQ- 9 scores [6.0 (6.5)] and FMD [4.6% (3.1%)] fell within expected 
ranges. As is shown in the Figure, mean FMD of depressed adults was significantly lower than that of non- depressed adults (2 .76% vs. 5.32%; p = 
0.045), which is consistent with prior studies ( 22). Adjustment for brachial 
artery diameter, which is the strongest variable associated with FMD reactivity, increased the FMD difference to 3.5% (2.08% vs. 5.60%). This difference is likely clinically meaningful giv en that a 1.0% higher baseline FMD predicted a 6% lower risk of CVD events over five years in 
the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( 123, 124) . 
 2.3.[ADDRESS_1031210] future increases in inflammation  
 
 We evaluated longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and both IL -6 and hsCRP in 263 
healthy, older adults ( 53). At baseline and follow -up visits, adults completed the Beck Depression Inventory -II 
(BDI -II) to assess depressive symptoms and underwent blood draws to quantify IL-6 and hsCRP. Path analyses 
revealed that baseline BDI -II score ( β=0.18, p=0.005)  predicted a [ADDRESS_1031211] 6- year increases in BDI -II score ( β=-0.04, 
p=0.48). These resul ts suggest that depression promotes future increases in systemic inflammation over time as 
opposed to inflammation promoting depression severity. Thus, treatment of depression may consequently lead 
to reductions in inflammation.

circulating inflammatory markers, and depressive symptoms at baseline and [ADDRESS_1031213] -20 (SCL -20) depression scores. As hypothesized, post -treatment FMD 
adjusted for pre -treatment FMD was higher in patients rand omized to the intervention versus usual care 
(p=0.21, d=0.61). This difference was not statistically significant; however, the moderate effect size is clinically meaningful ( 123, 124) . Similarly, post -treatment IL -6 levels adjusted for pre -treatment levels were lower in the

 intervention versus usual care group (p=0.43, d=0.43 pg/mL). Although not statistically significant, this 
difference in IL -6 between groups are in line with levels associated wi th a greater risk of CVD events in the 
SMART trial (39% greater risk for each IL -6 increase of 0.34 pg/mL) (10). Finally, post -treatment SCL -20 
score adjusted for pre -treatment score was significantly lower in the intervention versus usual care group 
(p=0.02, d=1.33), suggesting that Beating the Blues  improved depression while im proving FMD and lowering 
IL-6. 
The lack of statistically significant group differences in FMD and IL -[ADDRESS_1031215] significan t group differences. Importantly, Beating the Blues alone (without antidepressant medication) led to 
the observed improvements in FMD and inflammatory markers, suggesting that cognitive behavioral treatment alone without pharmacologic therapy can reduce CV D risk.  
 
2.3.6 ECFCs and monocyte activation in HIV  
  In a recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], w e compared ECFC, intermediate monocytes (CD14
+CD16+), and 
non-classical monocytes (CD14dimCD16++) levels in HIV -infected participants virologically -suppressed on 
antiretroviral therapy, HIV -infected treatment -naïve participants, and HIV -uninfected healthy controls. ECFC 
levels were significantly higher in the HIV -infected, virologically -suppressed group compared to the uninfected 
controls. CD14+CD16+ percentages (b ut not CD14dimCD16++ cells) were significantly higher in both HIV -
infected groups vs uninfected controls. In the HIV -infected groups, ECFCs and CD14+CD16+ intermediate 
monocytes were significantly and inversely correlated. Lower availability of ECFCs may p artly explain the 
relationship between greater intermediate monocytes and atherosclerosis in HIV.  
 As such, this trial will provide an opportunity to confirm these associations in a depressed population. 
Furthermore, it will be of great interest to determine if depression treatment leads to reduction in monocyte activation, and in turn greater ECFC levels, in HIV -infected patients.  
 2.[ADDRESS_1031216] the hypotheses that depressive disorders  
contribute to greater systemic inflammation, altered coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction in HIV -infected 
patients and that depression treatment reverses these potential mechanisms of HIV -CVD. Our preliminary data 
support these hypotheses by [CONTACT_753265] a  strong relationship between depression and a higher risk of incident acute 
MI in HIV -infected veterans, thereby [CONTACT_753266] a new and, until now, completely unexamined approach 
(depression treatment) to reducing HIV -CVD events. However, we now need to dete rmine the underlying 
mechanisms for this association to validate the link between depression and HIV -CVD risk and to justify future 
large- scale trials. These studies may also open a whole new area of investigation focused on the relationships 
between mood disorders in general and HIV complications. This application will also test the effects for the first time the Beating the Blues  therapy program in an HIV -infected population.  
We have chosen to use a cognitive behavioral treatment program as our intervent ion without the 
addition of pharmacologic antidepressant therapy based on the strength of our preliminary data in which the Beating the Blues  program alone improved FMD and reduced inflammation. If Beating the Blues  alone is found 
to be insufficient to imp rove depression and CVD risk in the proposed study, then we will investigate in future 
trials the effects of antidepressants (with and without CBT) on HIV -CVD. We cannot ethically restrict initiation 
of antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially in the Usual Car e arm, by [CONTACT_3038]’ primary providers during the 
trial, but we will adjust the results for such antidepressant initiation.  
We chose to IL -6, hsCRP, and D -dimer as our inflammation and coagulation biomarkers of interest due 
to their known associatio ns both with depression and HIV -CVD. We will also measure markers of monocyte 
activation (sCD14, sCD163, CD14+CD16+ cells) and ECFCs. However, we will also archive plasma, serum, PBMCs, and urine at each visit for future investigation to measure other biom arkers of potential impact on HIV -
 
September 1, 2017   12 
 CVD if the primary markers are not affected by [CONTACT_753267].  
 If our hypotheses are supported, then the depression treatments studied in this  application can be 
investigated in future trials to prevent HIV -CVD. In addition, these data may also justify trials of depression 
treatment to prevent other HIV complications linked with greater inflammation and coagulation, such as 
neurocognitive dysfunction, nephropathy, osteoporosis, and mortality ( 8).  
      
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 3.1  Overview  
 
 The objectives of this study will be met by [CONTACT_746] a 24 -week, randomized, controlled, single -
blinded, two- arm, parallel group, pi[INVESTIGATOR_753253] a single center. A total of 110 participants will be enrolled and 
randomized. These participants will be ≥ [ADDRESS_1031217] one 
year with an HIV viral load < 75 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at screening, and have major depression using the PHQ -9 
questionnaire. These participants will be randomized 1:1 to either depression treatment with the Beating -the-
Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program (N=55) or usual care (N=55).   
 
3.2  Screening Visit  If deemed eligible for screening, the participant  will be approached (with permission/referral  of the 
potential participant ’s primary ca re provider) by [CONTACT_5640] a study investigator or by [CONTACT_753268] s 
Research Clinic study coordinator  to enter the screening phase of the study. After written, informed consent is 
provided by [CONTACT_2299], a random study code number will be assigne d to the participant  to ensure 
confidentiality. This study code number will be used for laboratory transport and processing, result reporting, and data recording.  
 The study participant need not be fasting for this visit. At the Screening Visit, the parti cipant’s medical, 
psychiatric, and medication history  will be reviewed. A  brief physical examination will be performed.  The 
PHQ- 9 questionnaire will be administered. If the potential participant is eligible based on these initial 
assessments, then b lood wi ll be drawn to determine if the participant  meets the laboratory eligibility criteria  (see 
Section 4.0) . Urine pregnancy testing for female study volunteers of reproductive potential will also be 
performed. All screening tests will be performed at the Indiana Clinical Research Center  (ICRC) . If the 
eligibility criteria are met, then the participant s will enter the clinical trial.  For those who score ≥ [ADDRESS_1031218] of local mental health service 
providers and clinics will be given to the patients’ primary HIV  providers  or social workers.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_1031219] will be repeated for w omen of 
reproductive potential. Blood and urine samples will be obtained for archiving.  
 
3.4  Second Entry Visit  
  This visit will occ ur within 30 days of the Screening Visit  and will occur at the ICRC . During this visit, 
updated psychiatric management (such as new medical or behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_753254]) and medications will be reviewed. The PHQ -9, SCL -20, Internationa l Physical Activity, Moriskey, Tobacco Use , 
General Anxiety Disorder -7, Buss -Perry Aggression, PANAS (Positive Affect subscale of the Positive and 
Negative Affect Schedule), and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_753255]. The study 
participant must be fasting for this visit.  Vital signs will be measured and a brief physical examination will 
be performed  prior to performing the FMD procedure and obtaining blood for the circulating markers of 
interest. A urine pregnancy test will be re peated for women of reproductive potential. Urine will also be 
obtained for archiving.  
 Blood will also be drawn  at this visit for archiving DNA for future studies of interest linking genetics 
with endothelial function and depression scores.  
 Randomization will occur at this visit. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_753269].  The participants’ primary providers will be notified of the 
randomization assignment.  3.[ADDRESS_1031220]. Stewart’s laboratory, the ICRC, the Infectious Diseases Research C linic at Eskenazi Health

chosen by [CONTACT_2299]. To help maintain privacy, patients will be provided with ear bud headphones if they plan to complete BtB sessions at remote locations and do not already own a pair of headphones that they would rather use.  We will also tell patients that, if they choose to co mplete BtB session where others are present, these 
other people (e.g., family member or friend) may realize that they are completing a treatment for depression. It will be up to each patient to decide if the available remote locations provide sufficient pr ivacy. Up to [ADDRESS_1031221] 
homework and will start the appropriate session on a computer. The patient will then w ork through the session 
alone at his/her own pace. At the end of the session, the research assistant will give the patient the printed homework assignment and will schedule the next session. 
Remote BtB sessions will scheduled, just like in -person sessions. Patients who select the remote 
treatment option will complete the first BtB session in person, at which time they will be given a BtB binder with printouts of all future homeworks. To begin each remote BtB session, an assistant will call the patient to instruct the patient to put last week’s homework in the BtB binder, to address any technical issues, and to ensure 
that the patient has launched the correct BtB session for that day. The patient will then work alone through the BtB session at his/her own pac e, with the assistant monitoring progress remotely on the secure BtB website set 
up for this trial. To end the session, the assistant will call the patient back to address any questions and ensure that the patient has identified the correct printed homewor k in the BtB binder.  
 
 
September 1, [ADDRESS_1031222] trial’s control group (48). Patients randomized to the Usual 
Care group will be informed of their depression diagnosis and will be encouraged to follow -up with their 
primary care or HIV provider. There will be no formal interac tion with the participants between the Second 
Entry Visit and the Week [ADDRESS_1031223] shown that informational support alone is unlikely to improve depression outcomes ( 125). In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_753256], only 14% of Usual Care patients had >50% reduction in symptoms versus 43% of Beating the Blues  patients. There will be no restrictions on the care that can be received, although we will 
assess changes in care duri ng the trial.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_1031224] be fasting for these visits.  
 During these visits, updated psychiatric management (such as new medical or behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_753257]) and medications will be  reviewed. The PHQ -9, SCL -20, International 
Physical Activity, Moriskey, Tobacco Use, General Anxiety Disorder -7, Buss -Perry Aggression, PANAS 
(Positive Affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_753258]. Vital signs will be measured and a brief physical exam will be performed 
prior to performing the FMD procedure and obtaining blood for the circulating markers of interest. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated for women of  reproductive potential. Urine will also be obtained for archiving.  
 Participants who continue to exhibit elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ -9 ≥ 10) at the final study visit 
will be urged to follow -up with their primary HIV provider and/or clinical social worker regarding their 
depression.  In addition, the study team will notify  the primary HIV provider that his/her patient has completed 
participation in our trial and still has clinically  elevated depressive symptoms. A list of local mental health 
service providers and clinics will be given to the patients’ primary HIV  providers  or social workers.  
  
3.6    Brachial artery reactivity indices   
  FMD and NTGMD will be measured according to established guidelines  (126) at both Entry Visits, the 
Week [ADDRESS_1031225] vasomotor function include environmental conditions, tobacco and alcohol use, diet, and medications  (127). Therefore, it is desirable to control these factors in order to obtain results that more 
accurately reflect the underlying condition being studied. Therefore, the room temperature will be controlled at 
68-71°F. The participant  will rest supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_1031226] urine pregnancy testing performed prior to the ultrasound tests; if the participant  is 
found to be pregnant, the participant ’s participation will end.  
 A [ADDRESS_1031227] protection . ECG 
leads will be placed on the participant ’s chest and automatic blood pressure cuff to left upper arm, set at q.[ADDRESS_1031228] part of the participant ’s proximal right forearm 
 
September 1, 2017   15 
 (approximately 1 -2 cm dista l to the antecubital fossa). The brachial artery will then be located with the image 
optimized for best resolution of all three layers of the anterior and posterior walls (with special emphasis on 
identifying the media -adventitia interface). T hree consecut ive cardiac cycles of B -mode images of the brachial 
artery to the disk s will be acquired and stored.  
 After this baseline evaluation, the measurement of endothelium -dependent vasodilation, or FMD, due to 
increased blood flow will begin. The forearm pressur e cuff will  be inflated to [ADDRESS_1031229] one hour of the participant’s time. 
There will be no documentation on the ultrasound scans indicating the randomization assignment of the study participants. This will ensure that [CONTACT_84137], who will assess all the ultrasound results, will be blinded when reading the ultrasound scans. Female participants of reproductive potential will have the ir main study visits 
during the same phase of their menstrual cycle to minimize confounding by [CONTACT_753271] ( 128, 129 ). 
  
3.[ADDRESS_1031230] trial ( 48), we will also assess depressive symptoms using the SCL -20, a reliable and 
valid measure responsive to change ( 130-133). We will examine total score and % responded (≥ 50% 
reduction). We will also assess tobacco use (Tobacco Use Questionnaire from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System), exercise habits (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), and CVD medication adherence (Morisky Questionnaire).  We will also assess anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder -7 (GAD -7),(134) hostility/anger using the Buss -Perry Aggression Questionnaire,( 135) trait positive 
affect using the Positive Affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), (136, 137)  and 
sleep quality using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272],( 137) all of which are widely used and validated 
instruments.   Each of these scales is widely used and possesses strong psychometric properties ( 138-140). Although 
our focus is on physiologic pathways, we are assessing changes in these factors as they are potential behavioral pathways through which depression and its treatment may influence the outcomes ( 141).  
 These questionnaires will be administered in private with availability of the study team to assist only 
when asked by [CONTACT_2299]. The participant may refuse to complete any of the ques tionnaires.  
 3.7  Study Duration and Participant Retention  
 
The maximum study pe riod for each participant  will be 31 weeks  (screening phase of [ADDRESS_1031231] 27 weeks  if the participant requires extra time to schedule the Week 24 vi sit). In order to 
promote retention in the study, the participant  participants will be financially compensated at each visit .

 [IP_ADDRESS] Weight  
  Weight will be recorded on CRFs at both Entry Visits, the Week 12 Visit, and the Week 24 Visit. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Resting Blood Pressure  
  Blood pressure measurements will be recorded on the CRFs at each non -BtB study visit. Blood pressure 
measurements should be obtained prior to the brachial artery ultrasound measurements.  
 Blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm throughout the study. The 
participant  should first sit quietly for five minutes. With the elbow and forearm resting comfortably on a flat 
table, the blood pressure should then be measured. Aft er two minutes, repeat blood pressure measurement in the 
same arm. After another two minutes, repeat blood pressure measurements again. Therefore, three blood pressure measurements are to be documented in the CRFs.  [IP_ADDRESS] Resting Heart  rate 
  Resting heart  rate measurements will be recorded on the CRFs at each non -BtB study visit. Heart  rate 
measurements should be obtained prior to the brachial artery ultrasound measurements. This may be done prior 
to the first blood pressure measur ement. The participant  should f irst sit quietly for five minutes  prior to 
measurement of heart rate.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Brief Physical Examination  
  The following assessments will be performed at each non- BtB study visit: 
 
• Auscultation of heart for signs of cardiac arrhythmias  and valvular murmurs  
• Auscultation of carotid arteries for bruits  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Signs and Symptoms  
  All signs and symptoms must be documented in the source documentation . All signs and symptoms 
occurring within 30 days of Screening and/or since the last study visit, regardless of grade, must be recorded on

[IP_ADDRESS] Brachial artery ultrasound measurements  
  All brachial artery ultrasound measurements must be recorded on CRFs.  
 Perform the assessment in the morning to avoid adrenergic stimulation after an overnight fast 
(appr oximately 8 hours).  
 Participant s may not use tobacco- containing products or eat or drink anything other than water for [ADDRESS_1031249] this event in our previous studies in HIV-uninfected depressed patients (please see Appendix at end of this pr otocol). If a participant reports having 
thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or 
spontaneously reports suicidal ideation), the visit will be immediately stopped, and the research ass istant will 
interview the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form (see Appendix). If the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ 10 years ago, the visit will proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to the principal investigator.  
 If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1031250] 10 years), the research assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_54852]. [CONTACT_579886] (a clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_84137] (a physician) will review the case as soon as possible, but no later than the same day, to determine th e appropriate course of action (e.g., immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s 
primary care provider , primary HIV provider, clinical social worker , or care coordinator, consult with clinicians 
 
September 1, 2017   24 
 at Midtown Community Mental Health Center , and/or escort  the patient to the Crisis Intervention Unit at 
Eskenazi Health).  Additional authorities, including the police, may be contact[CONTACT_753273].  Participants may  be withdrawn from the study.  
 A direct correspondence by [CONTACT_753274]  (both an ema il and a hard copy version ), will also be 
sent to the potential participant’s primary provider notifying him/her of the situation (see below).   
 If an enrolled participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself 
during a ny telephone calls (e.g., a scheduling call or a call to the study team initiated by [CONTACT_2299]), the 
exact same procedures as outlined above will immediately be initiated. Please see the Appendix for the full 
Suicide Management Plan.  
Since it is unknown if depression therapy (or lack thereof) results in somatic adverse events in 
antiretroviral- treated HIV -infected patients, we will also carefully document Grade 3 or 4 level toxicities 
defined using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences . Clinical management 
decisions  and decisions to discontinue participants from the trial will be made by [CONTACT_458] (s) in 
conjunction with the participant ’s primary caregiver; care plans and outcomes must be inclu ded in the source 
documentation. All s erious adverse events (SAEs) will be documented on CRFs  with unexpected SAEs 
forwarded to the IUPUI IRB within 10 working days of the event and the remainder to be documented on the 
annual continuing review. 
 
8.0 CRITERIA FOR  STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
 
• Request by [CONTACT_266329]  
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he believes the study is no longer in the best interest of the 
participant  
• If the participant  is found to be pregnant or begins breastfeeding during  the course of this study  
• If the participant  has develops fever, need for systemic therapy for acute or serious illness, or 
hypotension after screening that precludes completion of the study visits within the allowed timeframe s  
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication(s)  
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by [CONTACT_099]  
• Participant , as judged by [CONTACT_473], to be at risk of failing to comply with the provisions of the 
study protocol as to cause harm to self or interfere with the validity of the study results  
  
9.[ADDRESS_1031251] deviations. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. Additional exploratory analyses will be performed when appropriate. Normality of variables will be checked and, if violated, nonparametric methods will be adopted. Changes from the analysis plan will not require an amendment to the protocol unless it changes a signif icant feature of the study. All analyses will be performed using SAS 9. 4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).  
 
9.2 Study Design  
 This trial will be a randomized, controlled, single -blinded, two- arm, parallel group study. Eligible 
patients will be randomized 1:1 to eithe r Beating the  Blues  (BtB) or Usual Care (UC). Stratifications for 
 
September 1, 2017   25 
 randomization include usage of pharmacologic antidepressants at the Second Entry Visit  and sex. Permuted -
block randomization will be adopted to ensure the two arms are balanced. Randomizatio n sequences will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_753275].  
9.3  Sample Size Justification  
 
 We calculated the trial’s required sample size to achieve sufficient power to detect treatment group 
differences in FMD at Week 12. Using the effect size of Beating the Blues  on FMD in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], and 
assuming a power level of 0.80 with a Type I error of 0.05, we will need 88 partic ipants (44 per arm) to detect 
an absolute difference in FMD of 1.7% at Week 12. This would be a clinically meaningful difference, as a 1.0% higher baseline FMD predicted a 6% lower risk of CVD events over five years in MESA ( 123, 124) . We will 
increase the sample size to 110 (55 per group) to account for a conservative attrition rate of 20%. For the secondary outcomes of FMD (Week 24) and circulating  IL-6, hsCRP, and D -dimer  levels (Weeks 12 and 24), 
we will be able to detect effect sizes as small as 0.[ADDRESS_1031252] deviations.  
 9.4 Criteria f or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753259].  
 
9.5 Analysis Datasets  
 
Datasets  Definition  
Intention- to-treat (ITT)  This will comprise all patients who meet the 
eligibility criteria and are randomized onto the study 
irrespective of their compliance to the planned 
course of treatment . 
Per Protocol Set  
 This will comprise all UC patients and BtB 
participants who finish at least [ADDRESS_1031253] one session of treatment.  
 9.6 Patient Characteristics and Significant Protocol Violations  
 
Demographic and other baseline data will be summarized descriptively for all patients in the ITT set. 
Comparisons between the two groups will be performed using Pearson’s chi -square tests and Student’s t -tests. 
Significant protocol violations will be documented. 
 
9.7 Disposition  
 
The number of enrolled subjects will be summarized in a flow chart with frequency of completion and 
discontinuation. The subjects discontinued from BtB and their corresponding information will be listed.  Significant protocol violation s will be tabulated and/or listed.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1031254] our primary hypothesis, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to test for 
treatment group differences in Week 12 FMD adjusted for baseline FMD  using the intent -to-treat set . Statistical 
significance will be considered if two -sided p -value <0.05.This analysis will be also repeated using the per -
protocol set. 
 
9.11 Analysis Plan for Secondary Objectives  
 
Both unadjusted comparisons and adjusted comparisons between UC and BtB will be performed for 
secondary outcomes defined in 1.2.1- 1.2.3. For adjusted comparisons, multiple  linear regression models will be 
constructed to include treatment group, baseline characteristics [demographics, SCL -20 scores, 
tobacco/exercise/adherence questi onnaire results, ART drugs/regimens (including efavirenz ( 142-144)), 
antidepressant use, co -morbidities, CD4 cell counts, and HIV -1 RNA levels], and time -varying characteristics 
(changes in SCL -20 scores, questionnaire results, CD4 cell counts, ART drugs/regimens, HIV -1 RNA levels) to 
determine their effects on the outcomes. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients will be estimated for FMD, IL -6, hsCRP, D -dimer, circulating EPCs /ECFCs  levels , and markers of monocyte activation 
(CD14+CD16+ cell proportions and sCD14/sCD163)  with PHQ- [ADDRESS_1031255] a range from 0 to 8, will be 
explored. 
Safety assessment s will be performed using the safety dataset. HIV -1 RNA levels  and CD4  cell counts 
of the BtB arm during the trial will be summarized and compared to the UC arm. 
 
9.12 Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analysis will be performed.  
 
9.13 Subgroup Analysis  
 
Exploratory subgroup analysis will be performed based on sex , age (<50 vs. ≥50 years) , and 
pharmaceutic antidepressants.  
 
9.14 Missing Data  
 
Multiple imputations will be adopted to account for missing data. If differential missing patterns are 
observed, sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the consequences of potent ial missing mechanisms.  
 9.15 Data Management  
 
A comprehensive web -based data management system will be developed for this study using REDCap 
by [CONTACT_753276]. REDCap provides a secure, web- based 
environm ent that provides an intuitive data entry interface and has real -time validation rules (with automated 
data type and range checks). The system offers easy data manipulation with logged auditing, functionality for  
reporting, monitoring and querying subject records. An experienced Database Administrator provides database creation, daily backup, and installation of security patches.

locked file cabinet. All entryways to the IDRC are secured by [CONTACT_753277]. Initial screening, consenting of potential subjects, and data abstraction and recording will be completed by [CONTACT_753278].  
 The data management system will facilitate quality control efforts, prevent entry of erroneous values, 
provide warnings for possible outliers, generate missing data reports, track subjects and samples, and assist in the preparation of data for statistical analysis. All data will be reviewed and p rocessed through multiple 
verification and edit checking programs post entry to ensure data quality.  
 
10.0 HUMAN PARTICIPANT S RESEARCH AND PROTECTION  
 10.1 General Considerations/ Investigator Training  
 
The Human Participants Research outlined in this proposal meets the definition of a Phase II clinical 
trial for the purpose of identifying biological and physiological mechanisms of human disease (not for identifying the superiority of one agent over the other). Therefore, a formal Data and Safety Monitoring Boar d 
is not required, although appropriate monitoring through the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan with independent monitor as described below will be fully implemented. This trial will be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov and updated regularly as needed for protoc ol updates and results. All Indiana University personnel involved with 
this application have successfully completed the training and examination involved with the  Collaborative 
Institutional Training Initiative  Course.  
 10.2 Risks to the Participant s 
 10.2.1  Human Participant s Involvement and Characteristics  
 
• A total of [ADDRESS_1031257] a 
screening HIV -1 RNA level <75 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL while on ART for at least one year, and have a 
screening PHQ -9 score ≥10. 
o The chief exclusion criteria include known CVD, congestive heart failure, treatment for malignancy (besides localized skin cancers) within 6 months of screening, uncontrolled 
diabetes (defined as screening Hgb A1c >8.0%) or newly diagnosed glucose intol erance 
(defined as screening glucose ≥140 mg/dL), uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP >160 
mmHg or diastolic BP >110 mmHg), screening eGFR < 50mL/min/1.73
2 (using the 2009 
CKD- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_361987]), screening total cholesterol >240 mg/dL, pro- inflammatory 
conditions besides HIV infection (e.g. autoimmune diseases, but allowing hepatitis B or C co-infection). 
o Potential participants will be recruited from the HIV outpatient clinics of Indiana University 
Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753260] . All b iologic/physiologic study procedures 
will occur in the Indiana Clinical Research Center at Indiana University Health University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
10.2.2 Sources of Materials  
 
 
September 1, 2017   28 
 • All data for this study will be obtained only after written, informed consent is provide d by [CONTACT_37117]. Existing medical records will be reviewed for demographics, medical diagnoses, and 
medications. Blood samples will be obtained for testing of chemistries, cell counts, HIV -1 RNA 
levels, CD4 cell counts, inflammatory/coagulation marke rs, and metabolic markers. Urine samples 
will be obtained for pregnancy testing. Urine, serum, plasma, and DNA will be obtained for future studies of interest. Questionnaires to assess depression, medication adherence, tobacco use,  physical activity , anxi ety, anger/aggression, positive/negative e ffects, and sleep quality  will also be 
implemented. Ultrasound images from the brachial artery flow -mediated dilation testing will also be 
collected.  
• Results from pertinent medical records and procedures performed for these studies, as outlined above, will be recorded on the human participants involved in the projects in this application. 
• Data will be stored in a password -protected computerized database via REDCap that will include 
only the participants’ study identification number (names and other identifiable information will not be included). Therefore, the SID# will be the only link to the participant. Only the principal investigators, co -investigators, and research personnel who will directly obtain the necessa ry data 
will have access to the participant identities. All data obtained for this study will be obtained only after written, informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_20908].  
• Records will be reviewed manually. Urine specimens will be obtained via standar d clean -catch 
technique. Blood specimens will be obtained via peripheral venipuncture. Flow -mediated dilation of 
the brachial artery will be measured using high frequency ultrasound with images downloaded to a 
secure, encrypted electronic database. Beating  the Blues treatments and questionnaires will be 
completed in private settings. These data will be collected solely for the purpose of the proposed 
research projects.  
 
10.2.3 Potential Risks  
 
• There are minimal risks to the participants enrolled in the prop osed research. The first is the potential 
loss of participant confidentiality. The second consists of the risks associated with blood drawing/needle sticks, which include pain, bruising, infection, and phlebitis. The amounts of blood to be drawn at screeni ng and at each main study visit are 15 cc (one tablespoon) and 60 cc (four tablespoons), 
respectively. The total amount of blood to be obtained over the 24 week study period would be approximately 255 mL (17 tablespoons), which is well within the accepted standards for blood donation over a 6 month period. The primary risks associated with nitroglycerin administration as part of the brachial artery testing are headache and transient hypotension. NTG may also infrequently cause the sensation of flushing of t he skin and rash. There may also be moderate pain associated with the inflation 
of forearm cuff as part of the brachial reactivity testing. There are no known risks related to the implementation of the Beating the Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program . Participants may also 
feel unease in completing the questionnaires.  
• The principal alternative to these procedures would be not to participate in the research.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1031258] Risks  
 10.3.1 Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
• Recruitment will only begin once the Indiana University Institutional Review Board has approved this study. All participants will be recruited from the outpatient HIV care clinics at Indiana University Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s and  Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Self -referrals from other venues will also be considered. If the 
primary caregiver for the patient believes he or she is eligible for the study and allows the patient to be 
 
September 1, [ADDRESS_1031259] all concerns addressed. If the participant wishes to pursue screening, then written informed consent will be obtained (and a copy given to the participant). All consent forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet.  
 10.3.[ADDRESS_1031260] Risk  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality . To minimize the risk to participant confidentiality, patient identifiers will be removed 
once his or her data is abstracted and recorded, and only the random study identification number (generated when consent is provided) will be used. All hardcopy study data will be kept in a secured and locked file cabinet. All electronic data will be kept in a password -protected computer database. The only link between 
patient identifiers and the randomized study identification number will be kept in separate files. Ide ntifiers will 
never be used in the analysis or presentation of study results.  
   
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood draws . The risks of blood drawing will be minimized by [CONTACT_473410]. The amount of blood that will be drawn falls well within safety standards for 
blood donation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Questionnaires . Participants may feel uneasy or discomfort in completing the depression, treatment 
adherence, and physical activity questionnaires. To m inimize this risk, questionnaires will be completed in 
private settings with any questions regarding completion of the questionnaires addressed by [CONTACT_753279].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nitroglycerin . Brachial artery reactivity testing will be performed in a controlled setting in the Indiana 
University General Clinical Research Center. To protect against the risks of nitroglycerin administration, registered nurses in the ICRC will monitor the participant’s blood pressure throughout brachial reactivity testing. Participants with inh erent resting hypotension will be excluded from the NTG -mediated flow dilation 
portion of the brachial reactivity testing. If the participant becomes symptomatic (e.g. dizzy, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_246359], weak or nauseated, or if the systolic blood pressure falls below 80mm Hg or more then 30mmHg below their baseline 
systolic blood pressure, the study will be stopped immediately). The patient will be placed in Trendelenburg  
position and be given fluids through the previously placed IV heplock if the blood pressure does not re cover 
spontaneously. If the patient develops a headache, an analgesic will be recommended. In addition, participants with recent use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. erectile dysfunction medications) prior to NTG administration or planned use after NT G administration will be excluded with the study visit to be rescheduled.  
Patients with a history of migraine headaches will also not receive NTG as part of their endothelial function assessments.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidal ideation  and management . Although not an inherent risk of the study intervention or study 
procedures, participants for this study are eligible only if they have depression as determined through completion of the PHQ -[ADDRESS_1031261] this event in our previous studies in HIV -uninfected depressed patients (please see Appendix at end of 
this protocol). If a part icipant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., 
responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal ideation), the visit will be 
immediately stopped, and the research assistant will interv iew the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality 
Form (see Appendix). If the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers 
 
September 1, 2017   30 
 “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ 10 years ago, the visit will 
proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to the principal investigator.  
 If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1031262] 10 ye ars), the research assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_54852]. [CONTACT_579886] (a clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_84137] (a physician) will review the case as soon as possible, but no later than the same day, to determine the appropriate cour se of action (e.g., immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s 
primary care provider , primary HIV provider, clinical social worker , or care coordinator , consult with clinicians 
at Midtown Community Mental Health Center, and/or escort  the patient to the Crisis Inter vention Unit at 
Eskenazi Health). Additional authorities, including the police, may be contact[CONTACT_753280]. Participants may  be withdrawn from the study.  
 A letter, both an email and a hard copy version, will also be sent to the potential participant’s primary 
provider notifying him/her of the situation (see below).    If an enrolled participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself 
during any telephone calls (e.g., a scheduling call or a call to th e study team initiated by [CONTACT_2299]), the 
exact same process as outlined above will be initiated.  Please see the Appendix for the full Suicide Management Plan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event financial management , grading, and reporting . In the event of an adverse event, 
necessary medical and professional intervention will be provided immediately and billed to the participant’s medical insurance (if available). If the participant does not have insurance, care will be provided via the indigent care program at Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Standard procedures for reporting deviations from protocols will be followed; serious adverse events that meet the Indiana University IRB prompt reporting requirements 
will be reported within 10 business  days .  All adverse events will be graded using The Division of AIDS Table 
for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences is located at: 
http://roc.s -3.com/members/download/adulttox.pdf . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Data and  Safety Monitoring . [CONTACT_753290]  of the Division of Infectious Diseases , Indiana 
University will serve as the independent chair  and monitor for this trial. Sh e will receive reports at least every 
six months regarding the progress and participant safe ty during the trial.  
 
10.3 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Participant s and Others  
 
• Potential benefits to the participants include an evaluation of their cardiovascular and immunologic status. They may also derive short -term benefits from the  Beating the Blues depression treatment program, 
although this is not guaranteed.. Finally, the participants may also benefit from knowing that their participation will accrue knowledge that could benefit other HIV -infected patients.  
• Although there are no guaranteed clinical benefits from those who are randomized to treatment with Beating 
the Blues, this program appears quite safe when used in HIV -uninfected participants. The standard of care 
will not be altered in the control participants. Therefore, the ancillary benefits to the participants in the proposed studies significantly outweigh the minimal risks in this study. Moreover, the proposed research may lead to other prevention and therapeutic studies that would demonstrate how to reduce inflammation and improve endothelial function, which consequently may reduce future cardiovascular events in the HIV -
infected population. This would benefit society directly by [CONTACT_473412].  
 
10.4 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
• The knowledge that wi ll be gained from this study will determine the relationships between HIV, 
depression, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. This would potentially impact the clinical care of HIV-infected patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, prev ention and therapeutic strategies 
 
September 1, [ADDRESS_1031263] 
to the patients and society in general.  
• Again, the risks to the participants are considered minimal. Even if the r esults are negative, the results of 
these investigations will add substantially to our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying inflammation and cardiovascular risk in older, HIV -infected patients with depression. Therefore, the importance of the 
knowledge g ained outweighs the risks to the participants.  
 10.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
• Progress of these studies, including data monitoring, participant enrollment, protocol deviations, and all 
SAE, will be reviewed by a panel including the PIs (Drs. Gupta  and Stewart), the study statistician ([CONTACT_753291]), and an HIV  expert investigator at Indiana University not directly connected with this study ( [CONTACT_753292] of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Indiana University School of Medicine). Reports, which 
will include descriptions of all adverse events, will be prepared for review by [CONTACT_753281] [ADDRESS_1031264] procedures for reporting deviations from protocols to the Indiana University ICRC, IRB, and NHLBI will be implemented. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will also be reported to the IRB within 30 working days and subsequently forwarded to NHLBI as required.  
 
10.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 There are no exclusion criteria based on gender, racial category, or ethnicity. Based on our previous 
cumulative experience and the general HIV -infected population cared for at the study sites at the Indiana 
University Health Medical Center (Eskenazi Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307], Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], VA Roudebush Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
Indiana University Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), it is anticipated that approximately 25% of the study participants will be women.  
It is also anticipated that approximately 40% and 10% of the study participants will  be black and 
Hispanic, respectively. American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders are not expected to be represented in the proposed study population due to extremely low representation of these groups within the Indiana University Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753261].  
 
10.8 Inclusion of Children  
 Subjects over the age of 18 will be eligible for enrollment into the proposed trial in Aim #2; as such, 
children of ages 18- 21 will be included in this Aim. However, participants under age 18 will be excluded to 
minimize confounding from hormonal fluctuations that are encountered during adolescence on the proposal’s endpoints of systemic inflammation, altered coagulation, and endothelial function.

Appendix: Suicide Management Plan  
 Suicide management plan s very similar to the one described below ha ve previously been approved by [CONTACT_753285] w ere successfully implemented in the two other depression trials conducted by [CONTACT_753286]  (IRB #’s [PHONE_068] and [PHONE_15705]).  Those suicide management plans were constructed with input 
from Eskenazi Midtown Community Mental Health Center leadership (Dean Babcock, Associate Vice President , and Michael Hughes ), who concluded that the  plans provide  a high level of protection while 
minimizing disruption to usual clinical activities.   In the present trial, w e will assess suicidal ideation at every 
study v isit, and we are prepared to appropriately handle the situation should one of the enrolled patients exhibit 
suicidal ideation.   Of note, zero enrolled participants in our two prior depression trials have exhibited suicidal 
ideation during the ir involvement  in the studies, likely because patients exhibiting suicidality were not eligible  
to be enrolled, as is the case for the present trial.  
 
(a) In-Person Study Visits  
Suicidal ideation will be assessed using Item #9 of the PHQ -9 at the Screening Visit and all  Main Study Visits  
(see Section 6.1) .  If a participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., 
responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal ideation)  during  the Screening, 
First Entry, Second Entry, Week 12, or Week 24 Visits , the visit will be immediately stopped, and the study 
coordinator s (Patricia Anderson , Danielle Grounds ) running these visits will interview the participant to 
complete the Patient Suicidality Form (see below ).  If this interview is required at one of the Weekly BtB 
Session s, the graduate student research assistants will perform this interview , as they will conduct these 
treatment sessions.    The study coordinators have  been trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart, a clinical  psychologist, in conducting the interview to 
comple te the Patient Suicidality Form and in following this protocol .  [CONTACT_4341] will also serve as the  primary 
supervisor to these study coordinators when it comes to their tasks related to this s uicide m anagement plan.  In 
[CONTACT_4341]’s completed ( IRB #’s [PHONE_068] and [PHONE_15705]) and ongoing ( IRB #  [PHONE_069]) clinical 
trials, he  has tr ained ResNet research assistants  to effectively conduct this interview and provide a high degree 
of protection to patients . 
 The graduate student research assistants are doctoral students enrolled full -time in IUPUI’s clinical psychology 
Ph.D. program, which is accredited by [CONTACT_753287]. Stewart is a core member.  The research assist ants have completed graduate coursework in psychological assessment, 
psychological interventions, psychopathology, and ethics  and have acquired supervised clinical experience in 
local healthcare settings .  The graduate student research assistants have also  been trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart in 
conducting the interview to comple te the Patient Suicidality Form and in following this protocol.  [CONTACT_4341] is 
also the primary supervisor of graduate student research assistants.  
 It is worth noting that neither the study coordinators nor the graduate student research assistants will be making 
any decisions regarding how to handle a situation.  Instead, they will collect information by [CONTACT_17801] a highly structured, 3 -question interview (Patient Suicidality Form, found below ) and will follow the 
straightforward,  step-by-step protocol  described in the next paragraph.  They will be instructed to call [CONTACT_579886] if they are unsure about a participant’s response to any of the  three  questions.  As he has d one in his 
past d epression trials  and is described above , [CONTACT_4341] will train the study coordinators  and the graduate 
student research assistants in administering the brief i nterview and in following the protocol.  Th is training will 
be repeated periodi cally during the study period.

 If the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers “yes” only to Question 3 
(previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ [ADDRESS_1031269]. Stewart.   
 If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1031270] 10 years) , the study coordinators  or the graduate student research assistant will immediately stop 
the visit, will contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta , and will stay with the participant until a decision is made .  If 
clinically indicated (e.g., the situation is an emergency), a graduate student research assistant a nd/or [CONTACT_4341] 
will go to the visit location ( Infectious Diseases Research Clinic or ICRC) to assist the study coordinators . 
 Drs. Stewart and/or Gupta will review all cases screening positive for suicidal ideation  immediately to 
determine the appropria te course of action – e.g., interview the patient to obtain further information, 
immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s HIV provider or clinical social worker  to involve them in the decision- making 
process , consult with clinicians at the Eskenazi Health Midtown  Community Mental Health Center  to aid in the 
decision -making process , escort the patient to the Eskenazi Health Crisis Intervention Unit (‘warm handoff’), 
and/or contact [CONTACT_4329] .  Either [CONTACT_4341] 
or [CONTACT_84137] will also call the participant’s HIV provider notif ying him/her of the situation if the provider was 
not involved in the decision- making process.   Regardless of the exact course of action, the study team will 
ensure that the p articipant is connected to the appropriate existing clinical services.  If the patient’s HIV 
provider  no longer believes that the patient is appropriate for this trial following this  situation , the patient will 
be withdrawn from the trial.    Of note, because patients exhibiting active suicidal ideation  are not eligible for this trial, we expect that it will 
be a rare occurrence that an enrolled patient will screen positive for suicidal ideation .  Zero enrolled participants 
in our two prior depression trials have exhibited suicidal ideation during their involvement in the studies.  
(b) Study Telephone Contacts  
If a participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 
2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal ideation)  during a study call  (e.g., the start or end of 
a remote BtB session, a scheduling call , or a call to the study team initiated by [CONTACT_2299]), the study 
coordinator  or a graduate student research assist ant will interview the participant to complete the Patient 
Suicidality Form (found below) .  
 If the potential participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions, the call will proceed as planned and the completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to [CONTACT_4341].   If the participant answers “yes” to any of the 
three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1031271] 10 years), the study coordinator  or 
a graduate student r esearch assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta.  Drs. Stewart and /or 
Gupta will review the case immediately to determine the appropriate course of action – e.g., interview the patient to obtain further information, immediately contact  [CONTACT_102]’s HIV provider or clinical social worker  to 
involve them in the decision- making process , consult with clinicians at the Eskenazi Health Midtown 
Community Mental Health Center  to aid in the decision- making process , escort the patient to the Esk enazi 
Health Crisis Intervention Unit, and/or contact [CONTACT_4329].  If a participant prematurely terminates a call after reporting suicidal ideation, the study 
coordinator  or a graduate s tudent research assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta.   Once 
again, Drs. Stewart and /or Gupta will review the case immediately to determine the a ppropriate course of 
action.  Either [CONTACT_4341] or [CONTACT_84137] will also call the partici pant’s HIV provider notif ying him/her of the 
situation if the provider was not involved in the decision- making process.  Regardless of the exact course of 
action, the study team will ensure that the participant is connected to the appropriate existing clin ical services.

 If the patient’s HIV provider  no longer believes that the patient is appropriate for this trial following a situation, 
the patient will be withdrawn from the trial.   
 
It should be noted that the informed consent form for this  trial contain s a section describing the steps that will 
be taken if an enrolled participant reports suicidal ideation on a questionnaire or spontaneously.

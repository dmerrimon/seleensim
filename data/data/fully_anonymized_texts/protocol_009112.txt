Background: 
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with transpapi[INVESTIGATOR_130180].  Such intervention may provide relief of jaundice and pruritus, reduce the risk of ascending 
cholangitis, and permit administration of systemic chemotherapy.   Plastic biliary stents are prone to 
stent occlusion and malf unction, with median  stent patency duration of [ADDRESS_147298] implications.  Indeed, the goal of endoscopic biliary decompression should be to provide 
durable biliary drainage —ideally ext ending for the duration of the patient’s overall survival— in a single 
intervention.  
Self-expanding metal biliary stents (SEMS) offer an internal diameter up to [ADDRESS_147299], 
however, and the choice of ideal SEMS is uncertain —uncovered SEMS (U -SEMS) consist of a bare metal  
scaffold which may be  prone to hyperplastic tissue ingrowth and stent occlusion; alternatively, covered 
SEMS (C -SEMS) feature a polyurethane coating which may prevent tissue ingrowth but which may 
increase the likelihood of inadvertent stent migration.  A prior randomized cont rolled trial of a stainless 
steel U -SEMS versus a stainless steel partially covered C -SEMS revealed no difference in time to 
recurrent biliary obstruction4; and a recent meta -analysis demonstrated no clear advantage of C -SEMS 
vs U -SEMS5. 
Due to variations in stent material, design , and manufacture, however, such data may not be 
generalizable to current generation metal stents, which feature a nickel titanium alloy scaffold and 
which, in C -SEMS version, offer a full rather than partial polyurethane coating.  
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that current generation C -SEMS offer more durable biliary drainage and will decrease 
the need for biliary reintervention compared to U -SEMS in patients with inoperable malignant distal bile 
duct obstruction.  
Objectives : 
Primary o bjective: Compare the rate of long -term stent failure, defined as need for repeat biliary 
intervention (endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical) following placement of C -SEMS vs U -SEMS for 
palliation of inoperable malignant distal bile duct obstruction.  
Seco ndary objective: Compare the rate of adverse stent -related or intervention -related outcomes 
(pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, perforation) following placement of C -SEMS vs U -SEMS for 
palliation of inoperable malignant distal bile duct obstruction.

Design : 
Single -center prospective randomized controlled trial.    
Inclusion criteria : 
• Patients with distal bile duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or 
metastatic malignancy with a confirmed tissue diagnosis referred for ERCP with intended 
palliative metal stent placement for palliation of jaundice  
• Patients 18 years of age and older  
• Serum bilirubin > 2 mg/dL  
Exclusion criteria : 
• Prior endoscopic or percutaneous biliary drainage  
• Post -surgical anatomy (ie pancreaticoduodenectomy, Billroth -type gastrectomy, Roux -en Y 
hepaticojejunostomy)  
• Primary site of biliary obstruction involving the common hepatic duct or hilum  
• Tumor involving gastric outlet, duodenum, or ampulla either precluding endoscopic access to 
the papi[INVESTIGATOR_130181]  
• Inability to provide written informed consent  
Procedure : 
• Patients will undergo ERCP under either MAC/general anesthesia or conscious sedation per 
institutional standard of care.  
• Following endoscopic biliary cannulati on and diagnostic cholangiography, performed per 
standard of care, a sealed envelope will be opened to determine patient randomization to either 
a 10 mm diameter C- SEMS (Wallflex, [LOCATION_011] Scientific)  or a 10 mm diameter U -SEMS  (Wallflex, 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific) .  Due to the nature of the intervention, the proceduralist will not be blinded to 
study allocation.   The choice of a [ADDRESS_147300].  
• Post -procedure monitoring and discharge will be performed per institutional standard of care.  
Follow -up: 
• Day [ADDRESS_147301] -assessment nurse (for outpatients) or by [CONTACT_130183]’s bedside (for inpatients), as per current institutional standard of care  
• Follow -up will occur every [ADDRESS_147302] or patient self-
report to assess for primary and secondary study outcomes

Major treatment outcomes : 
• Primary outcome: Performance of repeat ERCP, percutaneous biliary drainage, or surgical biliary 
by[CONTACT_130184].  
• Secondary outcomes: pancreatitis requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]; cholangitis requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130182]; cholecystitis requiring percutaneous, surgical, or 
endoscopic intervention; perforation.  
Sample size  and planned statistical analysis : 
Retrospective data from VUMC has identified a long -term 25% failure rate of U- SEMS and 0% failure rate 
of C-SEMS when placed for palliation of malignant distal bile duct obstruction6.  Assuming a somewhat 
more conservative estimate of durability rates, a s ample size of 96 patients (48 per treatment arm) 
would be required to detect a 20% diff erence in stent failure rates at 80% power with an alpha level of 
0.05.  Also anticipating a 20% rate of dropout/loss to follow -up, the goal would be to enroll and 
rando mize 116 total patients in the study.  
Fisher’s exact test will be used to assess the statistical significance in proportion of primary and secondary study outcomes, respectively.  Additional univariate and multiple variable logistic regression 
analysis will be used to identify potential predictors of stent failure , to be reported including odds ratio 
and 95% confidence intervals .  A two -sided P value of <0.05 will be the threshold for statistical 
significance in all cases.  
Role of industry : 
This is an inves tigator -initiated study.  The stent manufacturer ([LOCATION_011] Scientific) has no role in the 
design, conduct, data collection or data analysis, reporting, monitoring, or funding of this study.

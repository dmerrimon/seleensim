1.0 HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Hypothesis  
Use of omegaven in infants with cholestasis will be temporally related to resolution of 
cholestasis . 
 
1.2 Primary Objective(s)   
The aims of the study are to assess the effect of intravenous fish oil emulsion 
(omegaven ) in place of the currently us ed intravenous soybean oil lipid emulsion 
(Intralipid ) in subjects with short bowel syndrome and cholestasis or with PNALD 
(parenteral nutrition associated liver disease) . 
 
2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Functional short gut (or short bowel syndrome, SBS ) is defined as the inability to 
tolerate all nutritional requirements via the enteral route, and a continuing dependence 
of partial or complete parenteral nutrition.  
 
Development of SBS (short bowel syndrome) is more common in newborn infants than 
at any other age group, and may result from gastroschisis, gastrointestinal atresia, 
intestinal volvulus, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Treatment is aimed at : 
 
1. Nutritional support, through the use of parenteral nutrition . 
2. Gut rehabilitation and adaptation through  gradual introduction and advancement 
of enteral feeds . 
3. Prevention of secondary problems (e.g. bile acid deficiency or bacterial 
overgrowth) . 
4. Prevention of complications ( e.g. cholestasis) . 
 
Concerted, coordinated management, including parenteral nutrition , has greatly 
improved the survival and quality of life of subjects with SBS. However, prolonged use 
of parenteral nutrition is not without risk. Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis 
(PNAC); also know as parenteral nutrition associated liver disease  (PNALD) or intestinal 
failure associated liver disease (IFALD); is one of the leading causes of death in SBS.  
 
The causes of PNALD are unclear, but may include : 
 
1. Absence of enteral feeds . 
2. “Toxic” components in parenteral nutrition (e.g. aluminium, phytos terols, 
methionine, tryptophan) . 
3. Lack of certain beneficial nutrients in parenteral nutrition (e.g. serine, choline) . 
 
In recent years, much attention has been paid to the effect of parenteral lipid on PNAC. 
In the US, parenteral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_809413] -based . Most widely used is Intralipid  with is 
 
Version date 1/12/[ADDRESS_1119300], there are concerns about its long term use. As it is 
vegetable based is contains relatively high amounts of phytosterols (cholesterol -like 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_809414]). In adults and children with SBS and PNAC, serum levels of 
phytosterols correlate with the degree of hepatic and biliary dysfunction . 
 
Omegaven is a fish -oil derived intravenous lip id emulsion that is no t licensed in the US, 
but is widely used in Europe. I t differs in composition from intralipid in many ways, for 
example i t is much higher in omega -3 fats, lower in omega -6 fats, and contains no 
phytosterols.  
 
Composition of Different iv lipid emulsions (from Puder 2009)  
 
 
There are an increasing number of case -control studies suggesting significant clinical 
benefits to the use of omegaven in established PNALD in infants (Gura 2006, Gura 
2008, Diamond 2009, Puder 2009).  
 
The largest of  these published cohorts is that of Puder, from [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(see attached file). In that study [ADDRESS_1119301] 
intravenous lipid emulsions were given omegaven, and compared to 49 historical 
controls. Subjects were eligible for omegaven if they had cholestasis (direct bilirubin ≥ 2 
mg/dL), were likely to be on parenteral nutrition at least 30d, and had acquired or 
congenital GI disease. Subjects with cystic fibrosis, metabolic disorders or hepatitis C 
were excluded. They were compared to historical controls who had two consecutiv e 
direct bilirubin measurements ≥ 2 mg/dL. Omegaven was given at a dose of 1 g/kg/d, 
and intalipid at 1 -4 g/kg/d (depending on attending preference and lipid tolerance). The 
fish oil group were generally more sick at study entry than the historical control s, they 
had been on parenteral nutrition longer (63d vs. 40d, p=0.008) and their direct bilirubin 
was higher (5.5 vs. 3.3, p=0.0003). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_809415], the fish oil group 
had a steady and sustained fall in direct bilirubin and ALT, while these measures 
continued to increase in the historical controls.  
 
Version date 1/12/[ADDRESS_1119302] bilirubin and ALT in the fish oil group, and the historical controls (from 
Puder 2009).  
 
 
 
Cholestasis resolved in 45% (19/42) of the fish oil group while still on PN, compar ed to 
4% (2/46) of the historical cohorts.  
 
The rate of the combined outcome of death or required liver transplant was significantly 
lower in the fish oil group (9.5%) than in the historical controls (34.7 %, p=0.0005). The 
crude rate of reversal of cholest asis in subjects who did not die or require liver 
transplants was 8.6x greater in the fish oil group than in the historical controls. This 
increased to 17.4x higher rate once differences in baseline characteristics were 
accounted for.  
 
The main safety meas ures followed ( hypertriglyceridemia , and coagulopathy) 
significantly favored the fist oil group .

historical controls (from Puder 2009).  
 
 
Although there was no significan t difference in INR between the groups over the entire 
study, INR began to increase in the controls near the end of the study as they 
developed worsening end -stage liver disease. In the fish oil group, INR remained low 
during the entire study.

4.3 Study Enrollmen t Procedures  
Clinical nutrition rounds, between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_809417], occur every 1 -2wk as 
part of the routine clinical care of the infants. As part of the clinical care of the infants, 
and infant identified as having cholestasis or PNALD (direct bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL on two 
consecutive occasions ≥8d apart) have their intralipid infusion rate reduced to 1 g/kg/d 
and have the trace elements added to their parenteral nutrition reduced. The current 
protocol will not alter this.  
 
5.0 STUDY TREATMENT ( OR INTERV ENTION ) 
5.1 Regimens ( or Intervention ), Administration, and Duration  
The interv ention is the use of omegaven (an intravenous fish oil emulsion) in place of 
intralipid (the currently used soybean oil intravenous lipid emulsion, until parenteral 
nutrition is  discontinued, or until cholestasis resolves.  
 
Parents of eligible patients will be approached for consent for their infants to take part in 
the study. If they agree, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_809418] (copi[INVESTIGATOR_809419]). Omegaven will be 
ordered from the manufacturer. Once the IND number is received, the IRB will be 
informed of the subjects IND number. Once the IND number is received, and 
communicated with the IRB, and the omegave n is received, intralipid infusions will be 
 
Version date 1/12/2018  
stopped and omegaven will be infused at the rate of 1 g/kg/d. Clinically -indicated labs 
will be monitored, as for all patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition, i.e. CBC, 
electrolytes, BUN, Creatinine, ALT, AST,  Alkaline phos phatase, albumin, total bilirubin, 
direct bilirubin and serum triglycerides will be measured at least every 2 weeks. No 
additional labs will be required as part of the study.  
 
Adjustment of Omegaven Dosage  
Hypertriglyceridemia : If serum trigl ycerides are > 400, other causes will be excluded 
(e.g. renal disease, medications). If no other causes can be found, the clinical team 
caring for the baby [CONTACT_809421] 25%, depending 
on their clinical assessment of risk  and benefits.  
Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency:  If there are concerns that essential fatty acid deficiency 
may be occurring (characteristic skin rash plus unexplained thrombocytopenia), the 
clinical team caring for the baby [CONTACT_809422] -start 
infusion of intralipid at a rate of 0.5 – 1 g.kg/d . 
Other:  The clinical team caring for the baby [CONTACT_809423].  
 
Discontinuation of Omegaven  
Omegaven will be discontinued either (1) once parenteral nutrition is discontinued, 
irrespective of the direct bilirubin level, or (2) once the direct bilirubin has been below 2 
mg/dL for more than 2weeks.  In the later case, if the direct bilirubin rebounds above 2 
mg/dL at anytime the omegaven can be restarted. If omegaven is re -started, the 
discontinuation criteria will be the same as before: i.e. it will be discontinued when 
parenteral nutrition is disco ntinued or when the direct bilirubin has been below 2 mg/dL 
for more than 2 weeks . 
 
Safety Assessment  
Routine clinical labs will be used to monitor for the principal side effects of omegaven 
(thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia), and the response to tre atment (direct 
bilirubin, ALT). INR and triene:tetrene ratio will be assessed as clinically indicated if 
coagulopathy or essential fatty acid deficiency are suspected .

5.3.[ADDRESS_1119306] the FDA to receive an IND number for the 
infant (copi[INVESTIGATOR_809420]). Omegaven will be 
ordered from the manufacturer. Once the IND number is received, the IRB will be 
 
Version date 1/12/2018  
informed of the subjects IND number. Once th e IND number is received, and 
communicated with the IRB, and the omegaven is received, intralipid infusions will be 
stopped and omegaven will be infused at the rate of 1 g/kg/d . 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1119307] intravenous lipid (intralipid) will not be given. No addition laboratory 
tests will be carried out. If the  relevant private or public insurance provider refuses to 
cover the additional cost of omegaven (approx $50 -75/d) we would expect that costs will 
be absorbed by [CONTACT_809424]. In the unlikely event that this does not 
prove possible, and alterna tive coverage for omegaven can not be found (e.g. internal 
NICU funds) the parents will be asked to pay for omegaven. The IRB will be informed of 
this eventuality should it occur. The consent form will clearly state the plans regarding 
charging for omegave n, and that the family would be payers of last resort if alternative 
methods of funding the omegaven are not successful.  
 
5.4 Concomitant Medications

and infant identified as having cholestasis or PNALD (direct bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL on two  
consecutive occasions ≥8d apart) are identified . 
6.2.2  Entry Evaluations  
Clinical nutrition rounds, between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_809417], occur every 1 -2wk as 
part of the routine clinical care of the infants. As part of the clinical care of the infants, 
and infant identified as having cholestasis or PNALD (direct bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL on two 
consecutive occasions ≥8d apart) have their intralipid infusion rate reduced to 1 g/kg/d 
and have the trace elements added to their parenteral nutrition reduced. The cur rent 
protocol will not alter this . If they remain cholestatic (bilirubin > 2 mg/dL) after 4wks of 
reduced lipi[INVESTIGATOR_809416], or (2) if their direct bilirubin is > 6 mg/dL in the 
absence of suspected or proven infection they will be considered eligi ble for the study . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1119308]-Entry Evaluations  
Will continue as part of the clinical nutrition rounds  
6.2.4  Discontinuation Evaluations  
Will continue as part of the clinical nutrition rounds. Omegaven will be discontinued 
either (1) once parenteral nutrition is  discontinued, irrespective of the direct bilirubin 
level, or (2) once the direct bilirubin has been below 2 mg/dL for more than [ADDRESS_1119309] bilirubin rebounds above 2 mg/dL at anytime the omegaven 
can be restarted. If omegave n is re -started, the discontinuation criteria will be the same 
as before: i.e. it will be discontinued when parenteral nutrition is discontinued or when 
the direct bilirubin has been below 2 mg/dL for more than 2 weeks. Omegaen may also 
be discontinued at any time is desired by [CONTACT_192386], the attending physician or the study 
PI. 
7.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
7.1 Toxicity   
Routine clinical labs will be used to monitor for the principal side effects of omegaven 
(thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia), and the response to treatment (direct 
bilirubin, ALT). INR and triene:tetrene ratio will be assessed as clinically indicated if 
coagulopathy of essential fatty acid deficiency are suspected. If serum triglycerides are 
> 400, other causes will be excluded (e.g.  renal disease, medications). If no other 
causes can be found, the clinical team caring for the baby [CONTACT_809425] 25%, depending on their clinical assessment of risk and 
benefits. If there are concerns that essential fat ty acid deficiency may be occurring

  2. Protocol Synopsis  
Postmarket Study PS130044:  A Prospective, Non -Randomized,  Parallel 
Cohort, Multi -center Study of Uphold LITE vs. Native Tissue for the 
Treatment of Women with Anterior/Api[INVESTIGATOR_423503](s) The purpose of this study is to compare transvaginal mesh repair to 
traditional native tissue re pair in women surgically treated for anterior 
and/or api[INVESTIGATOR_423504].  This study is being conducted in 
partnership with the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) under 
the Pelvic Floor Disorders Outcome Registry (PFD Registry).   
Test Device  Transvaginal mesh (Uphold Lightweight Vaginal Support System)  
Control Device  Traditional native repair (sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_423505]/or colporrhaphy)  
Study Design  Non-randomized, parallel cohort, multi -center study.   
All procedures will be standardized for uniformity.  Physicians will 
have to document a minimum of 10 procedures with either the Uphold 
device (i.e., Uphold or Uphold LITE) or with native tissue repair  prior 
to participation in order to document competency and experience.  
Physician training, specialty, and site procedure location (such as 
private -practice, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], academic medical center, etc.) will be 
recorded.  
Concomitant procedures including ante rior and posterior vaginal wall 
repair, hysterectomy and sling placement for stress urinary incontinence 
may be performed, per physician discretion.  Sling placement can 
include a synthetic material; however a concomitant anterior or 
posterior repair cannot include a mesh implant.  An anterior 
colporrhaphy may be required for cystocele repair, if clinically 
necessary.  All concomitant procedures performed will be recorded .  
Subjects who undergo a medi cal intervention (surgical or non -surgical) 
to treat recurrence, persistence of pelvic organ prolapse or a mesh 
complication will be followed to 36 months from the initial study 
procedure.   
Planned 
Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 414 subjects enrolled ( 207 subjects per arm) .  Eligible 
control subjects meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria may be 
shared from the PFD Registry.

Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint(s)  The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve superiority of mesh over 
native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline.  Success will 
be based on a composite of objective and subjective measures, and 
subjects will be considered a surgical success if each of the three criteria 
is met:   
1. Objective success is achieved by [CONTACT_423538]:  
• Anterior segment:  Leading edge of anterior prolapse is at or 
above the hymen or POP -Q point Ba ≤ 0. 
• Api[INVESTIGATOR_423507]:  The vaginal apex does not descend more 
than one -half into the vaginal canal (i.e. POP -Q point C <  
-1/2 TVL) for multi- compartment prolapse or POPQ point C 
≤ 0 for single compartment api[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l prolapse.  
2. Subjective success is achieved if the patient denies symptoms of 
vaginal bulging per PFDI -20 question 3, answering “no” or “yes” 
but “Not at all” bothersome (<2).  
3. No retreatment for POP:  no additional surgical treatment for POP 
in the segment( s) of the vagina treated at the index surgery or no 
pessary use since index surgery (i.e., ‘treated segment’ refer to the 
target compartment).  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint(s)  A co -primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non -inferiority of mesh 
to native ti ssue repair for safety by [CONTACT_423539] -related complications between baseline and the 36 
month time point.  Serious injury is defined per 21 CFR 803.3, i.e., life 
threatening, results in permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure, or injury or illness that requires 
medical or surgical intervention to preclude impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.

effectiveness will be performed for the primary hypothesis.    
Statistical testing will be performed to dete rmine if composite endpoint 
of anatomic and symptomatic success rate in transvaginal mesh repair 
(treatment) group will be superior to traditional native tissue repair 
(control) group.  The null hypothesis is that the success rate in treatment

where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the success rate in the treatment group 
and control group respectively.  The rejection of null hypothesis 
indicates the superiority of the treatment group over the control group.  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the overall 
complicati on rate (i.e. serious adverse device effects and serious 
procedure -related adverse events) of treatment group is non- inferior to 
that of the control group. The null hypothesis is that the overall 
complication rate in treatment group is greater than or equa l to the rate 
in control group plus margin:

  4. Introduction  
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) of the anterior and posterior vaginal wall, and vaginal apex, are 
among the most challenging and common aspects of traditional pelvic reconstructive surgery.  
As life expectancy increases, significantly greater numbers of women will present with POP 
and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) requiring surgical intervention.  Women face an 11% 
lifetime risk of requiring major surgery for POP.9   
The main goal of POP surgery is restoration of normal anatomy to achieve proximal vaginal 
suspension, mid- vaginal lateral attachments and distal vaginal fusion to the urogenital fascia 
and perineum.  Women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery for POP hope to achieve 
relief  of symptoms, restoration of normal anatomy, maintenance of vaginal capacity for 
sexual function and improvement in the quality of life.  
The difficulties associated with repair of cystocele were cited by [CONTACT_423543] 1909, and 
reinforced nearly a cen tury later by [CONTACT_195719]. (2001) who reported recurrence rates as high 
as 70% in a widely cited randomized controlled study (RCT).11  Clark et al. estimated that up 
to 60% of surgical recurrences occur at the same anatomic site as the original repair, 
highlighting the limitations associated with plicating and/or suspending weakened connective 
tissues to one another.[ADDRESS_534895] well 
established surgical alternative to native tissue plication.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a risk of mesh 
complications (3% -  13%), vaginal mesh repair is quicker and technically  easier than trans -
abdominal placement using sacral colpopexy.10,2,6,7,8,4,3 
In an update of surgical treatment of POP, McIntyre et al . (2010)  discussed the potential 
benefits of mesh use.  In the treatment of anterior prolapse, studies indicated that pote ntial 
benefits of mesh include increased durability of repair and improved anatomic outcomes.5  In 
one study of 70 subjects using mesh, McIntyre reported three (4.28%) recurrences, mesh 
extrusion in five subjects (7.1%), and 48 (87.3%) subjects reporting c omplete subjective 
satisfaction with their surgery at a follow -up of 18- 36 months. 
Four recent single -arm studies involving use of a mesh device for treatment of prolapse and 
one to two year follow -up documented anatomica l cure rates ranging from 88.5% -94%.6,7,2,10  
Reported vaginal mesh erosion rates for anterior repair ranged from 3.2% -6.5%, with one 
study reporting 13% mesh erosion for posterior repair.[ADDRESS_534896]’s rep orted 
>50% reduction in the cystocele recurrence rate, and four of seven reported > 75% reduction 
in anatomic failures.   Crude recurrence rates were reduced, in these studies, from a range of 
28-45% (colporrhaphy) to 7- 21% (mesh).

  Uphold™ Lightweight Surgical Mesh (Uphold LITE) is an FDA 510(k) cleared mesh 
implant intended for tissue reinforcement and stabilization of fascial structures of the pelvic 
floor in vaginal wall prolapse, where surgical treatment is intended, either as mechanical 
support or br idging material for the fascial defect.  Uphold was designed as a VMR that 
would limit mesh exposures by [CONTACT_423544] a horizontal, inverted crescent vaginal 
incision near the urethrovesical junction.  The amount of mesh is approximately 75% less 
than other kits and api[INVESTIGATOR_423516] (SSLF).  
Use of synthetic mesh grafts in surgical repair of vaginal prolapse has been shown to 
significantly increase success rates and reduce recurrent prolapse.  
5. Device Descript ion 
The Uphold LITE Vaginal Support System is a sterile, single use device for transvaginal 
placement, consisting of one (1) Uphold LITE Synthetic Mesh Assembly and one (1) Capio 
™ SLIM Suture Capturing Device.  The mesh assembly is a light -weight knitted mesh that 
consists of undyed and dyed polypropylene and monofilament fiber (phthalocyanine blue, 
color index number [ZIP_CODE]) with two integrated leg assemblies.  The leg assemblies include a 
dart, lead, dilator, two leader loops and protective sleeve.  The dart at the distal end of the leg 
assembly was designed to be placed into the carrier at the distal end of the Capio SLIM 
Suture Capturing Device.  The leg assembly was designed to facilitate the passage of the 
Uphold LITE Synthetic Mesh Assembly through bodily tissues for placement through 
sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11599].   One dilator is striped to differentiate each leg assembly (left/right).  
6. Study Objectives  
The primary objective is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of transvaginal mesh repair against 
traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for anterior and/or api[INVESTIGATOR_423517].  Secondary objectives are to evaluate mesh -related complications and subject 
reported outcomes.  
7. Study Endpoints  
7.1. Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve superiority of mesh over native tissue repair 
at 36 months as compared to baseline.   
Success will be based on a composite of objective and subjective measures, and subjects will 
be considered a surgical succ ess if each of the three criteria is met:   
1. Objective success is achieved by [CONTACT_423545]:  
• Anterior segment:  Leading edge of anterior prola pse is at or above the hymen 
or POP -Q point Ba ≤ 0.

  • Api[INVESTIGATOR_423507]:  The vaginal apex does not descend more than one -half into 
the vaginal canal (i.e. POP -Q point C < - 1/2 TVL) for multi -compartment 
prolapse or POPQ point C ≤ 0 for single compartment api[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l prolapse.  
2. Subjective success is achieved if the patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per 
PFDI -20 question 3, answering “no” or “yes” but “Not at all” bothersome (<2).  
3. No retreatment for POP:  no additional surgical treatment for POP in the segment(s) 
of the vagina treated at the index surgery or no pessary use since index surgery (i.e., 
‘treated segment’ refer to the target compartment).  
Additionally, a co- primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non- inferiority of mesh to 
native tissue repair fo r safety by [CONTACT_423546] [ADDRESS_534897] 
reported outcomes:  
1. Incidence of mesh erosion  
2. Incidence of mesh exposure  
3. Incidence of de novo dyspareunia  
4. Improvement in subject -related outcomes at 36 months compared to Baseline ((pelvic 
floor symptoms (PFDI -20), QOL (PF IQ-7), sexual functioning (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12) TOMUS 
pain scale)  
5. Assessment of subject’s level of improvement, measured by [CONTACT_423547] (PGI -I for Prolapse)  
6. Absence of re- intervention and re -surgery for recurrence of POP, persistence of 
disease, or mesh exposure/erosion  
7.  Surgical success based on the following composite outcome:  
a. Subjective success:  patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per PFDI -20 
question 3, answering “no” or “yes” but “Not at all” bothersome (<2)  
b. Anatomic success (in the operated compartment):  
• Anterior Segment:  No anterior prolapse at or beyond the hymen or

vaginal shortening, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_67260], neuromuscular problems, vaginal 
scarring, de novo vaginal bleeding, fistula formation and/or de novo voiding 
dysfunction  
8. Study Design  
This study is a prospective, non- randomized, parallel cohort, multi -center study conducted in 
partnership with the AUGS PFD Registry.   
The primary endpoint will be assessed once all per protocol subjects have completed the [ADDRESS_534898] to provide documentation of a minimum of 
10 procedures (i.e., native tissue repair procedure or Uphold/Uphold LITE procedure) prior 
to participation in order to document competency and experience.  Physician training, 
specialty, and site procedure location (such as outpatient in private- practice, institutional 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], etc.) will be recorded.  
All efforts will be made to ensure all follow -up anatomic measurements (POP -Q) will be 
assessed by a healthcare provider to reduce treating surgeon bias on outcomes after the index 
procedure.  In the event the treat ing surgeon is the only qualified healthcare provider at the 
site trained in POP -Q assessments, the follow -up anatomic measurements will be performed 
by [CONTACT_176344].  
All enrolled subjects will have an anterior and/or api[INVESTIGATOR_423518].  Concomitant pr ocedures to 
treat a secondary defect can occur (including an anterior repair, posterior repair, 
hysterectomy, or sling placement for stress urinary incontinence), per physician discretion.  
Sling placement may include a synthetic material yet a concomitant  anterior repair or 
posterior repair cannot include a mesh implant.  An anterior colporrhaphy may be required, if 
clinically necessary.  All concomitant procedures performed will be recorded.  
Subjects who undergo a medical intervention (surgical or non -surgical) to treat recurrence, 
persistence of POP, or a mesh or suture complication will be followed to month 36 from the 
initial study procedure.  
8.1. Scale and Duration  
The study will be conducted at up to 40 sites at a rate of approximately 1- 2 subjects per 
month.  Sites will be encouraged to enroll a minimum of 10 subjects and up to a maximum of 
50 subjects.

  It is anticipated that approximately 414 subjects will be enrolled in total to achieve 330 
subjects (165 subjects per treatment arm) for the co -primary endpoint analysis at [ADDRESS_534899]-surgery to achieve non -inferiority of mesh to native tissue repair for safety by 
[CONTACT_423548] -related and device -related complications between 
baseline and the 36 month time point. Due to the pa rtnership with the PFD Registry, it is 
anticipated a portion of the control arm subjects will be shared from the Registry.   
The enrollment period is expected to be approximately 12 to 18 months after the final study 
center has been permitted to enroll sub jects.  A potential 20% “lost to follow -up” rate is 
anticipated.   
Once enrolled into the study, subjects will be followed to [ADDRESS_534900]’s 
participation in the study is 36 months from time of procedure.  
Subjects who undergo a medical intervention (surgical or non -surgical) to treat recurrence, 
persistence of POP, or a mesh or suture complication will be followed to [ADDRESS_534901] the study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and 
if eligible, enrolled into the study after providing Informed Consent.   
Study centers will be selected by [CONTACT_423549] a 
treatment center or a control center, depending on experience to reduce selection bias.  Some 
study centers may be selected to enroll a combination of treatment  and control subjects, 
depending on subject population and per [LOCATION_011] Scientific discretion.   
Treatment will occur after all Baseline procedures have been completed and the subject has 
been deemed eligible for the study.  Baseline procedures may be combin ed with the 
screening visit and may occur within three months prior to the study procedure, with 
confirmation of no evidence of infection prior to the procedure.  Due to the allowable 
window of up to three months between baseline and study procedure, the s tudy staff will 
confirm that subjects are still electing to undergo the study surgery with confirmation of no 
evidence of infection.  
8.2.1. Treatment and Control  
The treatment device in this study is Uphold Lightweight Vaginal Support System with 
transvaginal me sh (i.e., Uphold LITE).  Please refer to the Directions for Use document for 
device -specific information.  The surgical procedure steps will be standardized, including 
suture type (delayed absorbable or permanent sutures).  Physicians will be trained to th e 
standardized procedure steps prior to the first study procedure being performed.  Minor 
modifications to the standardization may be necessary based on a physician’s practice and 
patient care.

  The control procedure in this study is traditional native tiss ue repair, which includes 
sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_423519]/or colporrhaphy.  The 
surgical procedure will be standardized, including suture type (delayed absorbable or 
permanent sutures). Sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11592] m ay be performed if the uterosacral 
ligaments are deemed unusable due to scarring or inability to access.  
9. Subject Selection  
9.1. Study Population and Eligibility

also undergo a concomitant procedure (such as an anterior repair, posterior repair, 
hysterectomy, or sling placement for stress urinary incontinence).  If a concomitant 
proce dure were to occur, the sling placement should be a synthetic material, however the 
concomitant anterior or posterior repair cannot include a mesh implant.  An anterior 
colporrhaphy may be performed for cystocele repair, if clinically necessary.

10.1. Point of Enrollment  
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study once an incision is made in the vaginal wall. 
All enrolled subjects will have been consen ted and assigned to receive either the treatment or 
control procedure per site assignment .  All enrolled subjects with a surgery initiated (i.e. 
incision in vagina) will be considered part of the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population for the final 
study analysi s.  All ITT subjects who undergo the assigned study procedure and had no major 
protocol deviations will be considered part of the Per Protocol analysis.      
The following study timeline (see Table 10.1- 1) is based on milestones completed and the 
current follow -up visit cadence.

11.5. Re-Intervention/Re- Surgery  
It is the intention of this study to demonstrate an improvement in anterior/api[INVESTIGATOR_423522] a transvaginal prolapse repair kit .  However, it is 
recognized that during the course of the study, there is a possibility subjects may require a 
medical re- intervention for events including but not limited to failed prolapse repair, 
persistence of prolapse symptoms, or a mesh or procedure -related complication.  A re -
intervention may include surgical or non- surgical treatments and can occur for a medical 
complication or for prolapse recurrence. For the purpose of this study surgical interventions 
shall be classified as “re- surgery” and non- surgical interventions shall be classified as “re-
interventions”.  Analyses will be performed to compare the rate of office -based interventions 
and of surgical interventions for medical complications and for prolapse recurrence in both 
treatment groups. 
Non-surgical interventions (re -interventions) are defined as office- based procedures and do 
not involve an operating room procedure.  Examples of non- surgical interventions may 
include but are not limited to an office visit to trim exposed mesh or suture in the vagina, a 
pessary, or physical therapy to treat procedural complications or persistent prolapse 
symptoms.  Data on non- surgical interventions will be captured in the CRFs.  Subjects will 
continue to be followed per the regular study visit schedule.   
Surgical interventions (re -surgery) are surgical operations performed to correct recurring 
prolapse symptoms, a procedural complication, or a mesh -related complication.  These 
surgical events typi[INVESTIGATOR_423523] a

If any serious adverse event results in death  (regardless of the relatedness to the stu dy device, 
procedure , or pelvic floor) , the event is to be documented in the source documentation, Case 
Report Form, and reported to the Sponsor within the timeframe noted in Table 21.7- 1 
(Investigator Reporting Requirements ).  If an autopsy is  conducted, a copy of the final 
autopsy report should be submitted to the Sponsor or designee.  The primary objective of the 
autopsy is to determine the cause of d eath, complications and other relevant findings.  
12. Statistical Considerations  
12.1. Endpoints  
12.1.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is an assessment of improvement in pelvic organ prolapse severity at 
36 months as compared to Baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses  
Superiority testing for effectiveness will be performed for the primary hypothesis.    
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if composite endpoint of anatomic and 
symptomatic success rate in transvaginal mesh repair (treatment) group will be superior to 
traditional native tissue repair (control) group. The null hypothesis is that the success rate in 
treatment group is less than or equal to the success rate in control group:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≤ 0   
The alternative hypot hesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐> 0     
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the probability  of success in treatment group and control 
group respectively.  The rejection of null hypothesis indicates the superiority of t he treatment 
group over the control group. 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the overall complication rate (i.e. serious 
adverse device effects and serious procedure -related adverse events) of treatment group is 
non-inferior to the control group. The null hypothesis is that the complication rate in 
treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus margin:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≥∆   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  <∆

  where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the overall complication rate in treatment group and 
control group respectively, and ∆  >0 is defined as the non- inferiority margin.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Size  
The statistical power calculation is based on a superiority assumption with a binary primary 
outcome. Success, based on a composite endpoint of anatomic and symptomatic success at 
36 month is assumed to be 70.0% for the native tissue arm and 85.0% for transvaginal mesh 
arm.17-21 With 2 -sided type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.1 (power 90%), 316 subjects 
(158 subjects per arm) are needed to detect 15% difference of transvaginal mesh to native 
tissue repair.   In addition to a superiority assumption, statistical testing will be performed for 
non-inferiority using a margin of - 12%.    
To assess for safety, the overall complication rate (i.e. serious adverse device effects and 
serious procedure -related adverse events) is anticipated to be approximately 14%.22 With 
type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.20 (power 80%), 298 subjects (149 subjects per 
arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 10%.    
To assess for office- based interventions for complications, the rate is anticipated to be 
approximately 2%.22 With type I erro r of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 330 
subjects (165 subjects per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 5%.    
To assess for of surgical intervention for complications, the rate is anticipated to be 
approximately 1%.22 With type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 260 
subjects (130 subjects per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 4%.    
Non-surgical subjects will be enrolled by [CONTACT_423556].  Non -surgical subjects will not be enrolled into this clinical study.   Using the above 
calculations and assuming a 20% loss to follow -up rate, a total of 414 subjects (207 per study 
arm) will be enrolled to achieve the primary endpoint of success at 36 months.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the comparisons of mesh repair to native tissue repair will 
be based on a two- sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference (mesh minus 
native tissue repair).  If the entire confide nce interval is above zero, superiority of mesh 
repair to native tissue repair will be demonstrated.  The confidence interval will be calculated 
based on the pooling of treatment differences across propensity score strata for a binary 
endpoint, as described in  Section  12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology) . 
If any data on the primary efficacy endpoint is missing, multiple imputation will be 
performed in which the missing values will be imputed five times under a logistic 
distribution model, using a fully conditional specification that includes the treatment arm and 
the assessments of the treatment success endpoint at each of 2, 6, 12 , 18, and 24 months.  As 
a sensitivity analysis, the comparison of treatments will also be performed using the 
following methods:  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275]

  For the primary safety endpoint, the proportions  will be calculated using for the numerator 
the number of subjects with an endpoint event and for the denominator the number of 
subjects in the analysis population (ITT and per protocol group).  Non -inferiority will be 
evaluated using a two- sided 90% confi dence interval for the treatment difference (mesh 
minus native tissue repair).  If the entire confidence interval is below the margin (10%), non-
inferiority will be demonstrated. The confidence interval will be calculated based on the 
pooling of treatment differences across propensity score strata for a binary endpoint, as 
described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology).  
12.1.2. Secondary  Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be to evaluate mesh -related complications and subject reported 
outcomes as safety endpoints between baseline and 36 months:  
1. Incidence of mesh erosion  
2. Incidence of mesh exposure  
3. Incidence of de novo dyspareunia  
4. Improvement in subject specific out comes at 36 months compared to Baseline (pelvic

  Propensity score adjusted confidence intervals described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score 
Metho dology) will be used to evaluate continuous variables including QOL score 
improvements between two groups.  
12.2. General Statistical Methods 
12.2.1. Analysis Sets  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population includes all subjects who provide written 
informed consent to be enrolled into the study and have a surgery initiated (i.e. incision in 
vagina) regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of treatment and 
withdrawal/protocol deviations.  
The treated population includes all subjects who undergo a  study surgical procedure.  The 
subject is defined to have successfully completed the surgical procedure (i.e. prolapse repair 
successful) and discharged.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population includes all subjects in the ITT Population who received 
the assigne d treatment and had no major protocol deviations.  
All primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed on the ITT Population.  The primary 
safety and n on-safety endpoints will also be analyzed on the per -protocol population.  
12.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/Bi as 
To reduce selection bias in this non- randomized study, each study center will be permitted to 
enroll subjects in only one of the treatment groups.  Physicians will be selected based on 
device and clinical research experience and the decision as to which  device to implant in 
subjects prior to study initiation at each center.  Some study centers may be permitted per 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific to enroll subjects in both treatment and control groups.  All decisions will 
be documented prior to subject enrollment.  All  subjects meeting the eligibility criteria at the 
study center will be screened and enrolled as applicable.  
Propensity score stratification will be utilized to address the potential imbalance in risk 
factors between groups, described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology) .  This 
analysis will be performed blind to all clinical outcome data and prior to performing any 
analysis of endpoints.  
12.2.3. Propensity Score Methodology 
Analyses comparing the treatment groups will be adjusted for the propensity score.  The 
propensity score is the probability that the subject enrolled in the mesh arm rather than the 
native tissue (control) arm, given the characteristics of the  subject and center. The 
characteristics identified are as follows: age, race, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, post -
menopausal, prior prolapse repair, prior hysterectomy, estrogen use, POP -Q C measurement, 
POP-Q Ba measurement, POP -Q Bp measurement, co ncomitant repair for stress urinary 
incontinence, and surgeon case volume.  Logistic regression of both treatment arm s (i.e., 
(transvaginal mesh repair vs. native tissue repair)  on these characteristics will be used to 
estimate the propensity score.  The s ubjects will then be partitioned into five strata

  corresponding to quintiles of the propensity score.  If the balance between treatment arms 
within the strata is deemed adequate, the treatment difference adjusted for propensity score 
stratum will be estima ted as described in the following. 
The propensity adjusted treatment difference will be based on averaging the treatment 
differences of the propensity score strata.  For a binary outcome, the within- stratum treatment 
difference is 𝐷𝐷 𝑗𝑗=𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗−𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗, where  𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 and 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 is the proportion of treatment and control 
subjects, respectively, in stratum j . The variance of 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗 is approximately  
𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗=𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗(1−𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗)
𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗+𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗(1−𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗)
𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 
Denoting the number of subjects in stratum j  by 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗=𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗+𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , the treatment difference 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_941] (weighted) mean of the within- stratum treatment differences  
𝐷𝐷=�𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗 
where 𝑛𝑛 =∑𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the total sample size across all strata and study arms. D  is approximately 
normally distributed with variance  
𝑉𝑉=��𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗

𝑗𝑗 
from which a confidence interval for the true treatment difference will be constructed . For 
each continuous outcome , the confidence interval will be constructed similarly, with D  and V  
obtained as above with the treatment difference within each stratum replaced by 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗=𝑋𝑋�𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗−
𝑋𝑋�𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑋𝑋�𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 and 𝑋𝑋�𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , respectively, is the mean of the treatment and control subjects, and

12.3. Data Analyses  
Presentation of summary statistics for continuous variables will include N, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for non- missing data.  For catego rical 
variables, the number and percentage under each category for non- missing data will be 
presented.  
Additionally, subjects meeting this study’s eligibility criteria under the PFD Registry may be 
included in the analyses plan.  The intention is to utiliz e a shared control arm from the PFD 
Registry.

 and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the surgical intervention rates for recurrence in treatment

superiority of the treatment group over the control group. 
The propensity score adjusted analysis described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score 
Methodology) will be used for testing the null hypothesis and computing the confidence 
intervals for rate of office -based intervention for recurrence and surgical intervention for 
recurrence between treatment group and control group.  
12.3.3. Rate of Office -Based Intervention for Complications  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of office -based intervention for

12.3.4. Rate of Surgical Intervention for Comp lications  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of surgical intervention for

The rate of surgical intervention complica tion is anticipated to be approximately 1%.  With 
type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 260 subjects (130 subjects per

pelvic organ prolapse at 36 months) data.  
For each group, Cox regression will be performed, to include surgical intervention for 
recurrent prolapse as a covariate for analyzing adverse events (pelvic pain, infection, vaginal 
shortening, vaginal scarring, de novo vaginal bleeding, fistula formation and/or de novo

Adverse procedural/device event rates and QOL information will be collected for [ADDRESS_534918] has office- based intervention for recurrence.    
Event rate for each of device -relate d or procedure -related adverse events of specified AE 
type (mesh erosion, mesh exposure, dyspareunia) during the period after the intervention will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Treatment groups will be compared using Cox 
regression for the event -free survival time (starting at the time of first office based 
intervention) with treatment arm .   
For each QOL instrument, a comparison using a t-test will be performed between native 
tissue repair and mesh group on the basis of QOL score at the first schedul ed follow -up after 
office -based intervention for recurrence.  
A two sample t -test will be used to compare groups with office -based intervention for 
recurrence and without intervention within each treatment group.  QOL score change will be 
reported from the  last follow -up visit before office -based intervention for recurrence, to the 
next scheduled follow -up visit after office -based intervention for recurrence within each 
treatment group.  For those subjects without recurrence, we will use baseline as the “before” 
time point in analysis, and the QOL data at 6 month follow -up visit as the “after” time point.  
Similarly, event rate for each adverse device and procedure -related event type specified 
(mesh erosion, mesh exposure, dyspareunia)  will be compared  betwe en subjects with office -
based intervention for recurrence and those without.  This will be done using a Cox 
regression of time to the first onset of each adverse event after the starting time to compare 
groups with office -based intervention for recurrence and within each treatment group.  The 
starting time will be baseline f or those subjects without intervention, and time of office -based 
intervention for recurrence for those with intervention.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses2 
The interim analysis hypothesis is that t ransvaginal mesh repair (treatment) is non -inferior to 
traditional native tissue repair (control)  in both effectiveness and safety  at 12 months .   
Statistical testing will be performed to evaluate whether transvaginal mesh repair  (treatment) 
is non- inferior to native tissue repair with respect to the  composite  treatment success 
endpoint.  The null hypothesis is that the suc cess rate for Uphold LITE is inferior to that of 
the control at a non- inferiority margin of 12% : 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≤ −12% 
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the success rate in the treatment and control group, 
respectively.  The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐> −12%      
The rejection of null hypothesis indicates the non -inferiority  of transvaginal mesh repair.  
If non- inferiority is demonstrated , then the superiority of transvaginal mesh repair at 12 
months will be evaluated, for which the hypotheses are:

Statistical testing will b e performed to determine if the serious complication rate (i.e. serious 
adverse device effects and serious procedure -related adverse events) of the treatment group is 
non-inferior to the control group  at 12 months . The nul l hypothesis is that the serious 
complication rate in treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus 
margin  of 10 %: 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≥10%   
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the seriou s complication rate in the treatment group  and 
control group, respectively. The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  <10%    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
The comparisons of mesh repair to native tissue repair will be based on a two -sided 90 % 
confidence interval for the treatment difference.   The confidence interval will be calculated 
based on the pooling of treatment differences across propensity score strata for a binary 
endpoint, as described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology).  
Missing 12 month data for the composite efficacy endpoint will be handled by [CONTACT_423560] a logistic regression model using a fully conditional specification .  The 
imputation model  will include treatment group and primary efficacy outcome at 2 and 6 
month.  A total of 5 imputed data sets will be generated.  
The following methods will also be used as sensitivity analy ses: 
• Observed data only  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275]  
12.3.9. Justification of Pooling  
The analyses will be presented using pooled data across institutions.  For each group, an 
analysis of the poolability will be made using logistic regression for binary outcomes, or 
analysis of variance for continuous outcomes, to assess differences between study institutions 
and to justify pooling data across institutions.  Centers with less than [ADDRESS_534921] reported outcomes.  Possible predictors may include, but not 
limited to, demographic /baseline data and risk factors data.  Factors from the univariate

19.5. Anticipated Benefits  
Theoretical benefits of  transvaginally placed mesh for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse 
may include reduction in POP symptoms.  
19.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The use of transvaginally placed mesh has been shown to reduce recurrent prolapse 
following pelvic floor repair. There have been many randomized controlled trials comparing 
outcomes for pelvic floor repair procedures using mesh grafts to non- mesh repair. Of those 
studies, a reduced incidence of recurrent prolapse in the mesh -procedure group has been 
reported as compared to  non-mesh groups.   
However, the risk of mesh- related complications has been reported and can be linked to risk 
factors including body mass index ( BMI ), concomitant hysterectomy, and physician 
experience.   There is no new literature to indicate there would  be an unsatisfactory risk 
benefit profile for the use of transvaginally placed mesh for the treatment of POP.   
20. Informed Consent 
Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from 
all subjects or their legally au thorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to performing any study -required 
procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in ac cordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical

accepted by [CONTACT_423572]  (e.g., CRO), and approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s 
IRB/EC, or central IRB, if applicable.  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study.  The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of 
the investigative center’s IRB/EC.   Any modification requires approval from [LOCATION_011]

  Table 21.4- 1: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Delivery Device to Adverse 
Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  
(Not Related)  • The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of 
another device/drug and is not related to the investigational product.  
Related  
(Possible, Probable 
or Definite)  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the investigational 
product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to investigational product, or  
• There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on re -
challenge, and an other etiology is unlikely, or  
• There is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event.  
 
21.5. Relationship to Study Procedure  
The investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study procedure as unrelated, 
possibly related, probably related, or definitely related. See criteria in Table 21.5- 1.

  21.8. [LOCATION_011] Scientific Device Deficiencies 
All device deficiencies (including but not limited to complications, malfunctions, use errors, 
product nonconformities, and labeling errors) will be documented and reported to [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific .  If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for 
returning the device(s) will be provided.  If it is not possible to return the device, the 
investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the 
device.  Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical 
record.  
Device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product 
nonconformities) are not to be reported as adverse events.  However, if there is an adverse 
event that results from a device failure or malfunction, that specific event w ould be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. 
Any Device Deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action 
had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less 
fortunate is considered a repor table event.  
21.9. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators

authorities of an SAE as required by [CONTACT_5737]/regional regulations. 
22. Committees 
22.1. Safety Monitoring Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, an internal Safety Monitoring Team will provide 
evaluations of safety events.  Success of this program requires dynamic collection of 
unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported.  This is expedited through [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific’s Safety Office, which is responsible for coordinating the collection of infor mation 
for the subject dossier from the centers.  During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, 
clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of 
source document information.  
23. Suspension or Termination

Possible reasons for premature study termination include, but are not limited to, the 
following. 
• The occurrence of safety events that present a significant or unreasonable risk to 
subjects enrolled in the study.  
• An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the study.  
• A decision on the part of [LOCATION_011] Scientific to suspend or discontinue development of 
the device.  
23.2. Termination of Study Participation by [CONTACT_5717]/ EC 
Approval  
Any investigator, or IRB/ EC in the Uphold LITE Study may discontinue participation in the 
study or withdrawal approval of the study, respectively, with suitable written notice to 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific.  Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities, as 
applicable, will be notified in writing in the event of these occurrences.  
23.3. Requirements for Documentation and Subject Follow -up 
In the event of premature study termination a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participating centers by [CONTACT_5756]. 
The IRB/EC and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified.  Detailed information 
on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided.  
In the event an IRB or EC terminates participation in the study, participating investigators, 
associated IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities, a s applicable, will be notified in writing. 
Detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided 
by [CONTACT_5756].  
In the event an investigator terminates participation in the study, study responsibility will be 
transferred to a co -investigator, if possible.  In the event there are no opportunities to transfer 
investigator responsibility; detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed 
thereafter will be provided by [CONTACT_5756].  
23.4. Criteria for Suspen ding/Terminating a Study Center  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific reserves the right to stop the inclusion of subjects at a study center at any 
time after the study initiation visit if no subjects have been enrolled for a period beyond 12 
months after center initiation, or if the center has multiple or severe protocol 
violations/noncompliance without justification and/or fails to follow remedial actions.  
In the event of termination of investigator participation, all testing equipment, as applicable, 
will be returned to Bo ston Scientific unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety or 
well-being of the subjects.  The IRB/EC and regulatory authorities, as applicable, should be 
notified.  All subjects enrolled in the study at the center will continue to be followed per

1.1 Specific  Aims:  
1. To conduct a cluster RCT of the Fit 5 Kids curriculum to evaluate its 
efficacy in reducing screen time and excessive weight gain over a school year (8 
months)   
2. To examine mediators and moderators associated with reducing Latino 
preschoolers’ screen time  
1.2 Hypot heses:  
1. Fit 5 Kids will decrease children’s screen time (primary outcome), BMI z -
scores and dietary energy intake, and increase moderate to vigorous physical 
activity ( MVPA ) compared to controls  
2. Parents’ outcome expectations, self -efficacy, and screen time parenting 
practices will mediate the relationship between Fit 5 Kids and changes to 
preschoolers’ screen time  
3. Parents’ depressive symptoms, stress, and social support will moderate 
changes to child screen time  
2.0 Background  
2.1 Gaps in Current Knowledge : Childhood obesity is a major public health problem in the 
US. Childhood obesity and lack of physical activity (PA) are important risk factors for adult 
obesity, type [ADDRESS_1161271] growing minority in the US. 
Therefore, preventing childhood obesity among Latinos is a major US public heal th goal to 
reduce health inequities from obesity and risk of T2D in the US. However, a systematic Key:

review identified no successful obesity prevention interventions among Latino 
preschoolers.  
2.2 Preliminary Data : Studies by [CONTACT_836508]. Television viewing and other forms of screen time (henceforth called screen time) 
occupy a large part of children’s awake time. Intervention st udies that reduced screen time 
among older children have resulted in reductions to obesity, although there are few studies 
among preschoolers. While mechanisms linking screen time and excessive weight gain 
remain unclear it is thought that screen time lead s to excessive dietary intake and/or 
inadequate PA. Among Latino preschoolers, we reported that greater screen time was 
associated with less PA, suggesting that reducing screen time may increase PA. Because 
screen time behaviors track from preschool to ado lescence, the preschool years are a 
crucial time period to help children develop long term healthy screen time behaviors .   
Our team’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_836490] 5 Kids screen time reduction 
curriculum among Latino preschoolers in Head S tart. This short term cluster randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) is the only successful screen time reduction program for Latino 
preschoolers, which reduced screen time by >25 min/day. Fit [ADDRESS_1161272] the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids among Latino 
preschoolers in Head Start from three sites: Seattle, Houston, and the Central Valley of 
Washington State . 
2.3 Significance : Childhood obesity and lack of PA in the US are at record high levels, which 
elevates risk of multiple childhood diseases as well as the risk of adult obesity and thus 
T2D, CVD, and multiple types of cancers. Screen time is an important modifiable 
determina nt of childhood obesity and PA. This study’s scientific premise has been 
established by [CONTACT_836509], as well as the lack of 
successful screen time intervention studies among Latino preschoolers. First, Latino 
childre n in the US have both high rates of screen time and obesity. RCTs whose 
interventions solely focused on reducing screen time have reported:  
(1) reductions in BMI and other measures of obesity among older school -age children 
(school -based obesity preventio n intervention), and  
(2) significant reductions in BMI z -score among [ADDRESS_1161273] shown that higher screen time was significantly associated with less PA 
among Latino pr eschoolers in Head Start, this proposal’s target population. Moreover,

children’s PA typi[INVESTIGATOR_836491], 
few met the recommended 1 -hour of daily MVPA regardless of race/ethnicity; conversely, 
screen time  increased by [CONTACT_46431] 3 hours/day from childhood into adolescence, with Latino 
adolescents having the highest amounts of screen time.  
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
3.1 Parents of s tudents at 2 2 Head Start Centers  will be sent home with study information.  
Shou ld the decide to participate, they will be screened using a survey to check for 
eligibility criteria listed below.   
3.2 Inclusion Criteria :   
We will recruit Latino children, [ADDRESS_1161274] read and speak English or Spanish or both.  
Exclusion Criteria :  
Only one preschooler per family may be enrolled to avoid clustering of variables by 
[CONTACT_5569].  
3.3 Special Populations:  
1. Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) .  We will enroll 
children and their parent (s) in the study.  We will enroll [ADDRESS_1161275] to 
participating in this study.  Obtaining informed assent in children this young may 
possi bly be coercive, since children of this age are highly suggestible to adults.  
 
4.0 Study -Wide Number of Subjects  
4.1 We will enroll 280 parent/child dyads in the study across all sites.  
5.0 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
5.1 When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited : 
We will use recruiting strategies that have previously been highly successful for the 
investigators during studies conducted in Head Start centers over the past 10 -15 years. 
We will recruit participants from Head Start centers that serve substantial numbers of 
Latino families and use a combination of recruitment procedures including : 
• bilingual flyers sent home with the children  
• telephone calls  (contact [CONTACT_836510])  
• presentations at parent meetings  (specific presentation content under 
development) , and  
• active involvement/guidance of the Head Start manager and staff in the  recruitment 
process.

5.2 Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects : 
We will send home recruitment packets with all students in the participating Head Start 
program.  Families that wish to participate and match the inclusion criteria will return the 
consent form to the study staff  or complete an online form with their contact [CONTACT_3031] . 
5.3 Materials that will be used to recruit subjects : 
Students at the Head Start Schools will be sent home with the bilingual flyer s and consent 
forms  or they will be provided links to view the flyers , recruitment video,  and consent forms 
electronically .  Flyers and consent forms will also be handed out at parent meeting 
presentations. Extra copi[INVESTIGATOR_836492] -site Head Start

To keep families in the intervention study engaged across three assessments throughout a 
period of 8 months, parents will receive a $20 incentive at Time 1 (Sept/Oct), $25 at Time 
2 (Jan), and $35 at Time 3 (May/June). For wearing accelerom eters, participants will 
receive an additional $10 incentive at each of the three assessments. For the 40 adults 
who participate in qualitative interviews, they will receive an additional $20 incentive. At 
the beginning of the school year, we will provide head start centers $400. Then, we will 
provide $500 per center incentive n ear the end of the school year.  
6.0 Multi -Site Research  
Conference calls will be held no less than once -a-month and will include each site investigator, coordinator, 
and other relevant stakeholders depending on the phase of the study. For example, during the initial planning 
phase individuals involved in curriculum development and training are likely to be more involved, while the 
coordinators and other primary staff may be included in c alls during the intervention. In addition, we will 
designate a secure virtual site for sharing of current protocols and documents.  
6.1 In order to ensure communication and uniformity between sites : 
1. All sites will have the most current version of the protocol  and consent document.  
2. All required approvals will be  obtained at each site (including approval by [CONTACT_779]’s 
IRB of record).  
3. All modifications will be  communicated to sites, and approved (including approval by 
[CONTACT_779]’s IRB of record) before the modification is implemented.  
4. All engaged participating sites will safeguard data as required by [CONTACT_145545].  
5. All local site investigators will conduct the study appropriately.  
6. All non -compliance with the study protocol or applicable  requirements will be 
reported in accordance with local policy.  
6.2 Method s for communicating to engaged participating sites:  
1. Problems : Should any problems arise,  
2. Interim results  
3. The closure of a study

8.2 Participant safety monitoring will be complete with the end of participant involvement in 
June, 2022. 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
9.1 Study design : The implementation of the intervention will be accomplished in four 
separate waves of intervention and control centers. In year 1, [CONTACT_75929] will enroll two Head 
Start centers in the Seattle -metro area for assessments and to be randomly assigned to the 
intervention or control condition. In ea ch of years 2 -4, Drs. Mendoza, Ceballos, and O’Connor 
will each enroll two Head Start centers in their respective regions for assessments and 
randomization to the intervention or control condition.  
The intervention schools will integrate the culturally adapted Fit [ADDRESS_1161277] (consu ltant, see letter of support).  The 
interventionists may implement the curriculum at the head start center or develop videos for 
parents to share with their students.  Interventionists will undergo the teacher training program 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mendoza and Sandra Jaramillo  for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_836493]5Kids study.  Training will 
consist of:  
1. 1-week in person training led by [CONTACT_320870] J aramillo and Dr. M endoza and  
2. Ongoing supervision of the interventionists by [CONTACT_18854]. Jaramillo and [CONTACT_75929].  
The in person training will occur prior to each region’s implementation of the Fit [ADDRESS_1161278] at the beginning of y ear 1 and for the 
Central Valley and Houston -based interventionists at the beginning of year 2. The in person 
training will provide: an overview of the Fit [ADDRESS_1161279]. 
Mendoza. Key portions of these trainings will be video -recorded (staff only) and available for 
review by [CONTACT_836512]. Following the in person training, [CONTACT_836556], [CONTACT_75929], and the co -investigators, will hold joint monthly 
videoconferences/telephone meetings with the interventionists, to support their teaching efforts

will also be available to the interventionists by [CONTACT_836513].  
The culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids classroom curriculum will be taught by [CONTACT_836514]. Fit 5 Kids is taught over 7 -8 weeks and consists 
of 7 weekly themes, which are  
1. Increase reading,  
2. Increase the time families eat meals together with the screens turned off,  
3. Alternatives  to screen time,  
4. Too much screen time,  
5. Turn off the screens week,  
6. Celebrate, and  
7. No more couch potatoes.  
Each weekly theme is comprised of 5 -6 lesson plans organized around each theme. The lesson 
plans include group activities as well as activities for  home , which may be physically sent home 
with students  or digitall y sent to parents . The lessons are drawn from four educational 
disciplines:  
1. Language Arts  
2. Math  
3. Music and Movement, and  
4. Arts and Crafts.  
Fit 5 Kids also includes a substantial p arent compon ent, including:  
1. A weekly parent newsletter  to keep them informed of the lessons and to provide home 
activities for the parents to complete with their preschoolers during the 7 -8 week 
curriculum. The parent newsletter activities were adapted based on our previous work on 
parent self -efficacy and pa rent outcome expectations for limiting their preschoolers 
screen time as well as screen time parenting practices. Thus, these constructs will be 
tested as mediators of the relationship between the Fit 5 Kids intervention and changes 
to screen time. For par ents of limited Spanish or English literacy, the take home 
materials will also be summarized verbally to them when they pi[INVESTIGATOR_836494].  
2. Twice monthly intercepts of parents during child drop off/pi[INVESTIGATOR_836495] , child-
tailored goal setting around screen time reduction  strategies led by [CONTACT_464]. If parents 
are not available, we will contact [CONTACT_836515].  
3. A lending library  of age -appropriate English and Spanish books (including the 
LeapReade r Reading & Writing System), games (e.g., puzzles, Lego Duplo blocks, 
Magna -Tiles, Playmobile, Bristle Blocks, etc.), arts/crafts, and other projects that children 
can do alone or with their parents. The library resources will be available for loan

through out the entire school year and developed with input from Head Start teachers 
and parents at eac h of the three major sites.  
4. Brief text messages consisting of screen time parenting practices  from the Fit 5 Kids 
parent newsletters and/or associated with l ower child screen times.  A new text message 
will be delivered 2 -3X/week to the parents’ cell phone (or email) over the 7 -8 weeks of 
the curriculum and during the booster weeks (see below). [CONTACT_75929] has experience 
delivering brief text messages to study par ticipants in other PA/sedentary behavior 
intervention studies both ongoing ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and complet ed. 
The parent newsletters, goal setting, library resources, and text messages seek to 
increase parenting behaviors and behavioral construct s to limit their preschoolers’ 
screen time, in synergy with the classroom curriculum which focuses on empowering 
preschoolers to limit their screen time.  
5. Parents will also be invited to join an optional Facebook group that is private and only 
accessible to  other study participants and members of the study team. Group members 
will be encouraged to share ideas related to the weekly lessons and goal setting. They 
are also encouraged to share any experiences and provide support to other parents 
around making ch anges related to the study and reducing screen time in their home.  
Intervention booster weeks : Fit 5 Kids takes 7 -8 weeks to fully teach. Given that we are 
interested in producing longer term behavior changes to preschoolers’ screen time, we plan 
to add tw o “booster” weeks of the curriculum in late April/early May that will be delivered by 
[CONTACT_25733]’s staff interventionist. Similar to the main Fit [ADDRESS_1161281] a take -home parent newsletter although on a daily basis (no t weekly), goal 
setting with parents by [CONTACT_836516][INVESTIGATOR_474347]/drop offs, as well as daily 
text messages consisting of parenting tips on screen time reduction. The two booster weeks 
will mainly focus on the “Alternatives to screen time” a nd “Turn off the screens” lessons. 
Additionally, parents will be highly encouraged to borrow resources from the lending library 
that helps to achieve their children’s goals.  
Remote Intervention Delivery : In case it is not feasible to implement the Fit 5 Kids program 
as described above, which was originally designed for in person curriculum delivery , we will 
plan to implement remote intervention delivery.  
1. Curriculum Video Lessons – Each lesson in the Fit [ADDRESS_1161282] a 
corresponding video lesson, which will be posted to a Fit 5 Kids YouTube channel, 
and parents will be sent links to watch the videos. These videos will be posted as 
“unlisted” so that only people with the link may view them.  
2. Activity Material Mailings – For each week of the curriculum we will mail home 
materials for one activity from a lesson that week so that parents can guide their 
child through the activity at home.  
3. Digital Lives – These are optional, as the Facebook group is . During each week of 
the curriculum we will offer parent and child participants the option of attending a 
digital live stream where we will describe the topic of each curriculum week, discuss 
content from the parent newsletters, and demonstrate how to do the activity we mail 
home to them.  These will be organized by [CONTACT_836517] a YouTube

Live Stream, which will be set as “unlisted” so that only people with the link to the live 
stream will be able to join. Parent participants will be invited to join  the live stream, 
which will be led by [CONTACT_464].  
4. Parent Newsletters – We will have a version of the newsletter that matches more 
with remote intervention delivery. A paper copy of each week’s  newsletter will be 
mailed alongside  the activity mater ials being mailed home. A digital version of each 
week’s newsletter will also be made available.  
5. Books & Activities Catalog – In place of a Lending Library system, we will use a Book 
& Activities Catalog (similar to Lending Library Catalog), which will be  mailed home 
with the first weeks of activity materials with a return envelope that parents can use 
to mail it back to us with their selections. The catalog will also be available digitally. 
Instead of borrowing items for a short time, participants will ge t to select a few items 
that we will mail to them to keep.  
6. Text Message s for Screen Time Parenting Practices – These will generally be 
implemented in the same way, but a few text messages have been updated to make 
more sense with remote intervention delivery.  
7. Goal Setting – Similar process, except we will rely more on telephone or text 
communication to complete goal setting. We will also aim to do goal setting weekly 
vs twice monthly to gauge engagement in the remote intervention.  
8. Faceboo k – Similar process. However, we will further utilize Facebook as a platform 
to distribute video lessons to participants, post the newsletters, post pi[INVESTIGATOR_836496], share information for attending the digital lives, and 
post t he parent engagement questions from the goal setting form as another way to 
gauge their engagement in the remote intervention.  This content will also be 
available to participants outside of Facebook.  
9. Booster Weeks – If booster weeks are done remotely, we will follow similar 
procedures as outlined above. Like the in -person version of the booster weeks, 
parents will still receive a newsletter and text message tip  daily (for each lesson ). 
There will be 5 video booster lessons, and  we will mail home activities  for 4/5 of 
them.  Parents will be invited to attend an optional Digital Live. We will set goals once 
for the booster week(s) period, and will still post the same type of content on 
Facebook.   
Control condition : The control centers will not implement Fit [ADDRESS_1161283] experience with all proposed questionna ires and 
accelerometry among Latino families, ensuring high scientific rigor. All assessments and surveys 
measuring mediating, moderating and outcome variables as well as covariates will be assessed 
immediately pre -intervention (Time 1, i.e., September/Oct ober of each year), immediately after the 
classroom intervention (Time 2, i.e., January of each year), and 8 -months after starting the

intervention (Time 3, i.e., May/June of each year). The Time [ADDRESS_1161284] changes in med iators (e.g., parenting practices and parent self -efficacy) that will be 
expected to change prior to outcomes such as BMI z -score. The Time [ADDRESS_1161285] socio -demographic and anthropometric measurements on the children and parents at 
their assigned Head Start center.  
 
Table 1. Summary of study variables  
 
 10. Primary outcome: Screen time.   We will mea sure screen time using the screen time diary 
that [CONTACT_75929] previously validated among parents of Latino preschoolers in Head Start (see 
Preliminary Studies) and used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_836497] 5 Kids.40,41 The diaries will track the preschool 
children’s screen time for a 7 -day period and are divided into 15 -minute blocks between 6 am and 
12 am. For each block, the parent will be asked to indicate whether the study child had screen time, 
the type of device (television, computer, phone, tablet, etc.), the name [CONTACT_836553], the language 
of the program , and who if anyone was co -viewing with the child.  These diaries will be available in 
English and Spanish for the parents to fill out according to their language preference. For parents of 
limited written literacy, the screen time diaries will only requir e them to mark a box next to the time 
their child had screen time.  
 11. Mediating variables: Self efficacy and outcome expectations . Social Cognitive Theory118,[ADDRESS_1161286], 
social cognitive theory was chosen to inform the design and evaluation of this behavioral 
intervention at the individual -level.122 The social cognitive theory constructs of self -efficacy, i.e. 
one’s personal sense of control for a behavior, and outcome expectations, i.e. the expected 
outcomes (costs/benefits) of performing the health behav ior, have been well studied and have 
strong support for their role in children’s PA behaviors.120,121,123 We will use questionnaires that our 
team has developed and validated (see Preliminary Studies above) among Latino families on 
parent self -efficacy (14 items) and outcome expectations  (25-items) for their preschoolers’ 
screen time usage as mediators of the relationship between the intervention and changes to screen 
time.69,70 
 12. Mediating variable: Screen time (media) parenting practices . The screen time parenting 
practices scale, also called the TV Parenting Practices scale, consists of 15-items with the following 
responses: never, rarely, sometimes, or often.66 Our team has validated these questions among 
Latino families, including preschool age children. Screen time parenting practices  will be a mediator 
for the relationship between the intervention and changes to screen time.67 
 13. Anthropometric outcome: BMI z -score.   Study staff will measure height and weight per 
standard NHANES protocol.124 A portable stadiometer will be used to measure height (to nearest 
0.1 cm), and an electronic scale to measure weight (to nearest 0.1 kg). Duplicate measures will be 
taken with the mean recorded as the value. A third measurement will be taken if there i s >0.2 cm or 
0.2 kg difference; the two closest values will be used to calculate the mean value. BMI (kg/m2) will 
be calculated and BMI z -scores will be determined based on 2000 CDC growth charts99 as per the 
Expert Committee Recommendations for assessment of overweight and obesity among 2 -19 ye ar 
olds.125

14. Behavioral outcome: Dietary intake by [CONTACT_836518] .  The preschool 
children’s usual dietary intake over the past [ADDRESS_1161287] (Berkeley, CA), an international leader in die tary assessment and analysis. The 
Block Kids FFQ, available in English and Spanish, has been validated compared to 24 -hour dietary 
recalls among children, and yielded significant correlations for energy intake (r=0.43), % energy 
from fat (r=0.51), % energy  from carbohydrates (r=0.69), % energy from protein (r=0.55), dairy

Several recent reviews have summarized emerging evidence linking greater screen time/television 
viewing with lower intake o f fruits and vegetables,134,[ADDRESS_1161289] plasma concentrations  of carotenoids as reviewed,100,139 
Dietary intake of carotenoids as estimated by [CONTACT_836519] 
(beta=0.87, p=0.02) with skin carotenoids among a diverse sample of children (59.8% Latino, 
25.7% Black).102 Similarly, dietary intake of total fruit (r=0.21), total vegetables (r=0.32), and total 
caroten oids (r=0.40) estimated by [CONTACT_836520] 
(p<0.05) correlated with skin carotenoids.56 Skin carotenoids measurements are taken on the palm 
of participants’ hands, where skin  melanin is found at their lowest concentrations and do not bias 
results.101,102 We will use the commercially available instrument, “BioPhotonic Scanner” (Pharmanex 
Global Research, Provo, UT), which was used in a previous pediatric validation study.56 Two 
instruments will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_836521] (see letter of support by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steve 
Wood), along with training an d technical support. The  Seattle and Central Valley sites in 
Washington State will share one instrument while the Houston site will use the other to measure 
preschoolers’ skin carotenoids per a standard protocol at Times 1, 2, and 3. Measurements will also  
be compared to fruit and vegetable intake estimated by [CONTACT_836522] , 
as further validation of the Food Frequency Screener  among Latino preschoolers. Skin carotenoids 
will be an exploratory objective outcome  for the present study,  similar to fruit and vegetable intake 
via the Block Food Frequency Screener .

data quality standards by [CONTACT_836523],48 used by D r. Mendoza and others,104,140 -142 will be used also 
including criter ia for: non -wear and wear time (non -wear time defined as 60 consecutive minutes of 
zero accelerometer counts, except for 1 -2 minutes of counts between 0 -100, and wear time defined by 
[CONTACT_836524] -wear time from 24 hours).48  We will use the MVPA (420 counts/15 seconds) and 
sedentary cutpoints (37.5 counts/15 seconds) validated in preschoolers by [CONTACT_836525].[ADDRESS_1161292] 5 -valid days of accelerometer data with three or more hours of wear time will be used in analyses  
to estimate habitual PA, because those criteria provided >70% reliability among preschoolers.143,144 To 
maximize valid accelerometer data, participants will wear accelerometers for 24 hours/day, except for 
water -based activities,[ADDRESS_1161293] less than 5 -valid days 
of data at each measurement time point. This approach yielded 92.5% of participants from the analytic 
sample with sufficient valid accelerometer data in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_836493] [ADDRESS_1161294]. Mendoza.  
 17. Moderator: Maternal depressive symptoms . Among Head Start mothers, the prevalence of 
depressive symptoms can be as high as 48%.146,[ADDRESS_1161295] been associated with greater risk of child obesity. Maternal depressive symptoms 
assessed using the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D) have also been 
associated with greater screen t ime among US children.72,73 We will therefore measure maternal 
depressive symptoms using the validated CES -D, a 20 -item instrument,111 A systematic review, which 
examined s tudies by [CONTACT_98680]/ethnic groups, provided support among Latinos for the original four factor 
structure (depressed affect, positive affect, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal problems) by [CONTACT_63700] -
analysis of confirmatory factor analysis studies.112 [CONTACT_455872] used the CES -D in a previous study 
linking parental depressive sy mptoms and feeding styles among parents of Head Start preschoolers.71 
The total score for mothers’ CES -D scale will be a potential moderator in analyses estimating screen 
time, with the hypothesis t hat the Fit [ADDRESS_1161296] lower efficacy for reducing screen 
time among preschoolers of mothers with higher depressive symptoms.  
 18. Moderator: Maternal stress . Parental stress adversely affects parenting behaviors including 
setting limits  on children’s screen time and obesity. 74-76 Permitting their children to obtain excessive 
screen time may be a copi[INVESTIGATOR_836499].76 Among a sample 
consisting predominantly of mothers, parenting stress was significantly associated with lower odds of 
setting limits on their preschoolers’ screen time.75 Maternal stress was also associated with childhood 
obesity in cross -sectional and longitudinal studies as reviewed.74 To measure maternal stress, we will 
use Cohen’s Perceived  Stress Scale, a validated 14 -item instrument that measures the degree to which 
situations in one’s life are assessed and considered stressful on a [ADDRESS_1161297] lower efficacy for reducing screen time among 
preschoolers of mothers with higher parental stress.  
 19. Moderator: Maternal social support . While parental stress may adversely affect parenting 
behaviors and lead to greater screen time, social support is thought to moderate the impact of parental 
stress on parenting behaviors and health outcomes, i.e., Cohen’s stress -buffering hypothesis.149 For 
example in a study of low income preschoolers, social support measured by [CONTACT_836526]’ screen time.150 In a study of Head Start preschoolers, greater social support

highly restricting their preschoolers’ screen time.[ADDRESS_1161298] greater efficacy for reducing screen time among preschoolers of mothers 
with higher social support.  
 20. Covariates: Socio -demographics . Parents will complete a survey on their child’s age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, parent education, and household income. Previous studies40,[ADDRESS_1161299] reported socio -
demographics as important predictors of Latino children’s screen time, physical activity, and/or BMI z -
score.  
 21. Covariate: Perceptions of neighborhood disorder.   We will use an  8-item,114 validated 
neighborhood disorder scale to assess parents’ perceptions of the th eir neighborhood in terms of 
safety, violence, drug traffic, and child victimization.115 The scale showed acceptable internal 
consistency (Cronbach’ s alpha=0.95), reliability (generalizability coefficient=0.84), and validity 
comparing various neighborhoods (p<0.001).115 In previous work led by D r. Mendoza using this scale, 
neighborhood disorder was a significant correlate of Latino Head Start preschoolers’ PA and adiposity 
(see Preliminary Studies).41,42 Total score will be a covariate.  
 22. Covariate: Parent acculturation  will be assessed using the previously validated 24-item 
Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics. This scale consists of 3 -subscales including language 
use, linguistic proficiency, and electronic media, which are combined into Hispanic and non -Hispanic 
domains.116,117 This scale had acceptable internal consisten cy (alpha=0.90 and 0.96 for Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic domains, respectively).116 Validity coefficients for the combined scale with generation 
status and the Short Acculturation  Scale for Hispanics were high among  the Mexican American and 
Latin American US sample.116 Child acculturation  will be estimated using proxy measures, including 
country of origin, years living in the US, and preferred language(s), which have been a ssociated with 
Latino preschoolers’ risk of obesity.42 
 23. Covariate: COVID -19 Questionnaire. Derived from the World Health Organization’s 
questionnaire on behavioral insights research for COVID -19, and  supplemented by [CONTACT_836528] 2020 Household Pulse Survey (U.S. Census Bureau), and Connor 
Davidson Resilience Scale [ADDRESS_1161300] will include a measure of class 
time spent on each lesson, the number of children participating in the lesson with a particular emphasis 
on time spent on role -playing ac tivities and reinforcement by [CONTACT_144823], the number of children 
completing lesson activities, and the number of children and parents completing take -home activities. 
We will also track resources used during lessons . The process evaluation’s assessment of ro le playing 
in particular will provide several measures of the curriculum’s application of Social Learning Theory.96

Role playing will directly measure modeling of behaviors by [CONTACT_836529].97 It 
will provide a measure of the children’s rehearsal of behaviors, which facilitates retention of the 
behavior. It will also measure the number of times a teac her provides reinforcement in the form of 
positive prompts or praise during these behavior rehearsals. Finally, parent participation in the take 
home materials/lending library will be logged and also tracked by [CONTACT_836530] t and children at home.  
 
Post-Intervention Qualitative Interviews . We will conduct [ADDRESS_1161301] ore 
acceptability of the Fit 5 Kids intervention and how to improve intervention efficacy. Participants will be 
randomly selected with balanced representation from both the intervention and control groups, and 
even distribution across head start centers. I f there is a low response (less than 60%) to the initial 
invitation to complete an interview at any center, a second round of invitations will be sent to remaining 
parents until at least 80% of the target interviews for that center are completed.  
 
A standa rdized interview script will be developed and consist of general open ended questions, 
followed by [CONTACT_836531]. Interviews will be audio 
recorded, transcribed, verified, and translated (if necessary). We wil l use NVIVO, a qualitative software 
analysis program, to facilitate data coding, retrieval, and analysis. The statements in the interviews will 
be organized by [CONTACT_836532]. Using verbatim statements, each unit will be assigned a broad 
category and s pecific codes to facilitate data retrieval and analysis overall, by [CONTACT_836533] -categories, 
and participants’ characteristic groups.  
The multilevel Fit 5 Kids intervention consists of the classroom curriculum, weekly parent 
newsletters, in -person (or by t elephone) goal setting on their child’s screen time, a lending 
library of resources (books, games, arts/crafts, etc), private parent Facebook group, and text 
messages on screen time parenting practices offered over 7 -8 weeks in the Fall semester. 
There will also be two “booster” weeks of classroom activities, daily parent newsletters, goal 
setting, and daily text messages on screen time parenting practices offered during the booster 
weeks in the Spring semester. The classroom component will be taug ht by [CONTACT_276016] 
(English/Spanish) research staff interventionists. Parent newsletters, goal setting, and text 
messages will be offered in English and Spanish per parent preference. The lending library of 
resources for parents/children will be available thr oughout the entire school year.  
The elements unique to the proposed study include: 1) questionnaires, 2) physical activity (PA) 
and screen time data, 3) the Fit 5 Kids intervention, and 4) qualitative data, i.e., post -
intervention qualitative interviews.

(BMI z -score, dietary energy intake, and MVPA), two sets of analyses will be performed. The first set of 
analysis will be separate cross -sectional analysis of T2 and T3 outcomes respectively. Given the nested 
structure of the data, we will apply mixed effects regress ion models156 to examine the effects of the 
intervention on each outcome while controlling for unbalanced covariates and account for correlations due to 
clustering. In the second set of analysis we will conduct a repeated measure analysis using outcomes fr om all 
3 time points. For Hypothesis 2, we will assess the extent through which parent outcome expectations, self -
efficacy, and screen time parenting practices exert their influence on (i.e., mediate) change in screen time via 
the intervention. We will use  a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach:157,[ADDRESS_1161303] the moderation

outcomes over time. Thus, our primary analysis will focus on comparisons at Time 2 (post 1) and Time 3 (post 
2), respectively. We evaluated the statistical power a nd sample size for the proposed study using the Optimal 
Design Software.168 Parameter estimates saved from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_273022]33,40 were used for population

Data Management : 
Each study site will be responsible for managing the data collected at that site. All staff will be informed of the 
need for confidentiality. All key personnel at all sites will have completed Human Subjects training and all 
investigators and c linical trial staff will have up to date Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training. Data containing 
personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers will be maintained in a separate locked 
cabinet accessible only by [CONTACT_836535]. Security access only will be permitted 
to each file, separately, with security limited to the projects’ data manager and coordinator. Personal 
identification codes will be created for each participant, which can link quantitative or survey data back to an 
individuals’ name. Data will be stored on encrypted computers and servers that are protected with passwords. 
All data analyses will be conducted on datasets that include only the personal identification code as a linking 
variable. No names or addresses will be reported in publications. Only the PIs, co -investigators, research 
coordinator, and research administrator have keys to the offices and locked cabinets at Seattle Children’s. The 
semi -structured qualitative interview data will have no personally identifying information associated with the 
tape or the transcript, so confidentiality cannot be violated.

13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Prior to implementing the study, the protocols, informed consent forms, recruitment materials and 
evaluation procedures will be reviewed by [CONTACT_2179] (IRBs) of Seattle Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Baylor College of Medicine. All adverse 
events, breach of privacy, will be recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_079] ([CONTACT_75929], a 
board -certified ped iatrician and a licensed physician) and the co -investigators (Dr. O’Connor, a board -
certified pediatrician and a licensed physician, and Drs. Hughes, Zhou, and Ceballos). Any adverse 
event and the actions taken will be reported to the IRBs and NIH. As appr opriate, we will refer the 
participant for the appropriate medical and psycho -social evaluation with the participant’s primary care 
provider. Each adverse event will be submitted to the IRB.  
 
This study involves minimal risk and no investigational drugs or  procedures. However, the risk of an 
adverse event from reducing screen time, although recommended by [CONTACT_750828], 
warrants supervision. We have therefore appointed a Study Safety Officer, who is otherwise not 
associated with this research project but who has expertise in obesity prevention and treatment. [CONTACT_836557], MD, MPH, FAAP, a board -certified pediatrician at the University of Washington who has 
research and clinical expertise in pediatric obesity will provide oversight as follows : (1) periodically 
review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and 
(2) assess issues concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of this study. [CONTACT_836558] is not 
supervised by [CONTACT_836537], nor has financial or other conflicts of 
interest with this study or its investigators. The Safety Officer, PI, co -investigators, and the Research 
Manager(s) will report any serious unexpected adverse event (whether associat ed with the intervention 
or not) to the IRBs and NIH within 48 hours by [CONTACT_836538] 5 -working days in writing. The IRBs 
will also determine whether the adverse event is causally related, probably related, possibly related, or 
unrelated to the inte rvention. A serious unexpected adverse event is provisionally defined as any of the 
following:  
• death  
• any acute life -threatening event or injuries  
• any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836500]:  Jason Mendoza, MD, MPH

• any other event that warrants a designation o f a “serious” event in the PIs’, or Co -Is’ 
judgements, including threats to safety or “near -miss” injury events that could have led to items 
a-c above  
All other adverse events will be filed annually with the IRBs and the NIH. Routine monitoring for 
adverse  events will be performed by [CONTACT_836539], the PI, and co -investigators. 
Since there are no investigational drugs or devices, there will be no routine post -study follow -up of 
participants. The NIH will be informed of any actions taken b y the IRBs as a result of their continuing 
review of the study.  
 
 
14.[ADDRESS_1161306] involves minimal risk to the participants because it is focused on reducing 
preschool participants’ screen time, which is consistent with national health recommendations such as 
the American Academy of Pediatrics and Healthy People 2020. Data on PA and screen time, such as 
measured by [CONTACT_836540], are generally not considered sensitive and are 
similar to data on household income, education, and occupation.  Participant can withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice.   
15.1 The primary risks will be that a child could  (1) become embarrassed fr om having weight 
measured; or (2 ) become embarrassed from the potential loss of confidentiality.  
The primary ri sk for the qualitative interviews is a loss of confidentiality (privacy).  
The semi -structured qualitative interview data will have no personally identifying 
information associated with the tape or the transcript, so confidentiality cannot be violated. 
The Facebook group will be private and only accessible to other study particip ants who 
have been invited and accepted the friend request to join the group. This part of the study 
is also optional. Any paper data will be filed in locked cabinets. Data containing personal 
information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers will be  maintained in a 
separate locked cabinet accessible only by [CONTACT_836541]. 
Security access only will be permitted to each file, separately, with security limited to the 
projects’ data manager and coordinator. Personal identific ation codes will be created for 
each participant, which can link quantitative or survey data back to an individuals’ name. 
Data stored on all computers and servers will be protected with passwords. All data 
analyses will be conducted on datasets that inclu de only the personal identification code 
as a linking variable.

populations in Head Start and similar child care settings. The benefits clearly outweigh the 
risks, as seen by [CONTACT_836542]’s screen time by [CONTACT_836543] 2020.  
17.0 Vulnerable Populations  
Besides the parents of the preschool children, the primary population of the proposed study will 
include children who are ages 3 -5 years; thus, applying the NIH definition of children as ages 17 
years and under, children will be a focus of this study. For th is age group, which represents a 
developmentally important formative period towards long term screen time behaviors, 
intervening to promote reduction of screen time and decrease risk of obesity and related chronic 
diseases are national priorities. We expec t 50% of child participants to be female . As we are not 
asking about pregnancy status, it is possible that we may inadvertently enroll women who are 
pregnant or become pregnant during the study. Due to the minimal risk nature of the study 
activities, we do  not anticipate any adjustments needed for pregnant participating parents. We 
will not be enrolling wards of the state.

Houston, AVANCE, Inc. operates 13 Head Start centers that serve 920 Latino preschoolers and 
has expressed a desire to par ticipate in this study (see letter of support from [CONTACT_836561]).  
Research staff will recruit participants from these Head Start centers.  Other Head Start centers 
will also be invited to participate, including Denise Louie Education Centers (based i n 
Seattle,WA) and Educational Opportunities for Children and Families (based in Vancouver, 
WA).  Seattle Children’s  investigators will be conducting/overseeing the research procedures at 
the Head Start centers and the investigators will be acting as agents of Seattle Children’s at 
those sites.  Participants will also complete some of the study components on their own at their 
home.  
21.0 Resources Available  
The facilities and other resources at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute (SCRI) include everything that is  
needed for the successful completion of this project in a timely manner. As described below, both the facilities  
and the intellectual environment contribute to an atmosphere providing research connections, which will  
enhance completion of this project. Investigators and research staff are supported and encouraged as they  
pursue their research goals. SCRI has a history of successful grant funding, timely and novel research studies,  
and peer -reviewed publications.  
 
The Seattle C hildren’s Research Institute (SCRI) is composed of seven interdisciplinary research centers that  
address areas central to pediatric health and use an “open lab” format to foster a rich collaborative  
environment. Directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Hendricks, SCRI is spo nsored by [CONTACT_836544]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] d/b/a Seattle Children’s Research Institute as part of  
a $400 million dollar research funding initiative. Total research funding for SCRI in 2016 exceeded $100  
million, which places it among the top five pediatric research centers in the US.  
 
Drs. Mendoza (PI) and Zhou are investigators in the SCRI Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development  
(CHBD). CHBD is devoted to improving children’s well -being in thei r homes, neighborhoods, schools, clinics  
and during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836502], including physical activity promotion and obesity treatment and  
prevention. Directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dimitri Christakis, the center uses state -of-the-art research methods to ident ify 
problems and risks for children, with a special emphasis on vulnerable populations. There are currently 68

The Research Manager will provide expertise in in protocol development and implementation, hiring and 
supervision of  study staff, and collection and management of study data.  
 
The study coordinator (TBN) and other research staff will be selected based on their experience working 
directly with children and families to obtain consent, administer questionnaires, and organ ize lab study visits. 
They will also have familiarity with protocol -based assessments and experience working with a varied 
participant population.  
 
22.0 Prior Approvals  
This study has undergone peer scientific review through the NIH (funding sponsor), and is 
also supported by a number of qualified professionals as stated in the grant letters of 
support.  
23.[ADDRESS_1161310] (PSESD) is a state mandated educational 
services district in Washington State. PSESD operates [ADDRESS_1161311] 10 -15 years. We 
will recruit participants from Head Start centers that serve substantial numbe rs of Latino 
families and use a combination of recruitment procedures including 1) pi[INVESTIGATOR_836503], 2) telephone calls, 3) presentations at parent meetings, 4) active 
involvement/guidance of the Head Start manager and  staff in the recruitment process , and 5) 
the use of a recruitment video . The recruitment video will be available for viewing via the same 
link participants will use to access and complete the electronic consent form  process , and will 
also be available as a separate YouTube link, which school and study staff may share with 
potential participants in the same way the electronic consent form would be shared.  At the 
beginning of the school year, we will provide head start centers $400. Then, we will provide $[ADDRESS_1161312] t o then

A member of the study team will regularly monitor participant interactions to ensure they 
are appropriate, respectful, and related to the intervention. Participants posting 
inappropriate material will receive an initial warning and reminder of the purpose of the 
group. A second infraction will result in removal from the group. Additionally, a member 
of the study team will be in 1:[ADDRESS_1161314]-intervention analysis will be focused on overall a ctivity of the group and participant 
engagement (number of active participants, number of posts, likes, views).  
 
26.0 Local Number of Subjects  
Ten child care centers (with a minimum of 12 students in each) will be recruited in the Seattle 
area.  
27.[ADDRESS_1161315] these risks we will do the following: risks to the participants will be fully explained during 
the informed consent process and repeated as needed during subsequent study visits and contact [CONTACT_836545]; all the study personnel will undergo extensive, standardized training and certification 
with ongoing quality control monitoring; we will adhere to strict data storage and confidentiality 
procedures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. In addition, study personnel will 
follow HIPAA regulations and be trained and certified in Human Subjects Protections . In addit ion, they 
will remind participants that they can skip any questions they are uncomfortable answering on the 
questionnaire.

Protocol Template  (HRP -503) Click Template Version: February   [ADDRESS_1161317] hear about the study through their child ’s 
head start center. In addition to  receiving information about the study during  
classroom presentations, parent -teacher conferences, and home visits , the 
information packet ( cover letter, flyer, and consent form in English and Spanish) 
will be sent home with the child.  
2. The cove r letter will provide instruction s for who to contact [CONTACT_38450], 
and instructions for returning the signed consent to the school with their child or 
by [CONTACT_836546].  The cover letter will also 
serve as a cover email in the event that consent forms are emailed to 
participants.  To allow the parent sufficient time to review study materials and 
contact [CONTACT_38451], they  will be given [ADDRESS_1161318] with study staff during 
enrollment, so will not feel pressured to enroll in the study.     
4. If at any time the participant wishes to withdraw from the study for any reason, they 
may do so . 
5. We will be following “SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090)” with 
the following exceptions  as this is a minimal risk study : 
o We will seek the consent of only one parent or guar dian.   
o A formal face -to-face oral consent process will not take place.  However, 
should participants have questions, study staff will be available to meet with 
participant s to discuss the study in detail.    
The voluntary nature of the study will be emphasized at many points in the 
enrollment process including when parents receive study materials, when  the 
study is discussed in their child’s classroom or during other parent meetings, and 
again when they review  and sign the consent (on paper or online). Once the 
parents enroll in the study, the study team will contact [CONTACT_836547]. During this contact [CONTACT_146176], study staff will confirm 
with the parents /legal guardian  that th ey actually want to participate and ensure 
they understand their consent to participate in the study . Additionally, since the 
study activities occur over many weeks parents have the option of changing their 
mind at any time during the study and no longer co mpleting study activities.  
In addition to receiving the signed consent (on paper or online), parent’s 
understanding of the study activities and confirmation that the child’s actual

 Page 26 of 39 
 
parent signed the form will be informed by [CONTACT_7071]’s subsequent actions 
including completing the baseline surveys, and participating in at -home activities. 
The survey is collected from the parent before any study activities begin in the 
child’s classroom.  
Study participants  will be the parent /legal guardian  who signs the consent form 
and their child. The parent and child study participants will be the only ones that 
we collect data from during the study.  
Some of the participants in the study may need to complete the informed consent 
form electronically. PHI is needed to complete the study surveys, so an alteration 
of HIPAA is needed . Providing participants with the option of providing  consent 
electronically could allow more families from our target population to participate  
in the study . We will obtain writte n consent from every parent participant where it 
is possible, but requiring written consent for every participant may exclude some 
families from participating in the study.  For example, some parents may want to 
participate in the study, but due to lack of adequate transportation might not be 
able to attend a classroom presentation. We would like to offer them the option of 
reviewing the form and providing consent and authori zation electronically, with 
the study team available to address questions at any time.  We do not want to 
exclude families due to barriers to completing the written consent. For families 
with barriers to completing written consent, we would like to offer th e option of 
electronic consent, so we need the alteration of HIPAA for them to participate in 
the study. In these circumstances, it would be impracticable for the study team to 
conduct the research without the alteration because the research team will  have  
no in-person contact [CONTACT_836548] (not 
disclosed by [CONTACT_248067]) to be able to approach the families. The research staff 
would rely on the families receiving the recruitment packets (with approach letter, 
flyer and con sent forms) and have them review the content at their own pace. If 
they are interested in participating, they would then have the option of complete 
the consent form/authorization online. Our plan for protection of PHI is included 
in the data management an d privacy protection sections of this protocol.  
Paper signed consent forms will be kept in the Study Coordinator’s locked office 
files, and online consent forms will be sent and stored via the UW REDCap 
database.  
Waiver or Alteration of Consent/Assent/ Permission  
Reason for requesting a waiver or alteration of informed consent/assent/permission:  
o Requesting  a waiver of consent for participants who turn 18. Participants were 
enrolled as pre -schoolers in 2022, so none have yet turned 18.  
o Participants have completed all study activities and we will not be collecting any 
new information (including from their med ical records). The study has remained 
open for analysis of identifiable data and we have had no contact [CONTACT_836549] [WC1]: I’ve tracked in the waivers into the 
protocol consent section. Please remove the rationale from 
the Mod Summary. Please review to ensure I’ve captured 
everything correctly and revise as needed for accuracy.  
Commented [CT2R1]: Rationale has been removed from the 
mod summary .

participants for several years. The aims of the study require use of the home 
address to study child outcomes. Due to the length of time since the child 
participated, the brief duration of their involvement, and the non -sensitive and 
minimal risk nature of the data we are requesting a waiver of re -consent . 
Consent/Assent Waiver/Alteration Criteria Justifications:  
 
The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects because: The 
remaining study activities are limited to analysis of data with home address 
identifiers. Any data that is published from this analysis will be grouped such that it 
will not be possible to identify a given ind ividual.  
 
The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the subjects 
because: The child will have no additional risk or benefit as a result of not re -
consenting. Data provided is non -sensitive and will be grouped with data fro m other 
participants for analysis and publication. Any publication or presentation of research 
results would be done in a manner that would never reveal an individual’s identity 
either directly or indirectly.  
 
The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration 
because: The funding for the grant the data was collected under has ended and 
participants who will turn [ADDRESS_1161319] information. As contact[CONTACT_836550], this would present an incredible burden on the 
investigator to try and track down and re -consent these participants.  
 
If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifi able 
biospecimens , the research could not practicably be carried out without using such 
information or biospecimens in an identifiable format because: The primary aims of 
the study involve child health and physical activity. One factor in the analysis is t he 
location of the home and details about the surrounding neighborhood, so it is 
necessary to retain home address until the analysis are completed . 
 
Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be 
provided with additional p ertinent information after participation:  
N/A 
Non-English Speaking Subjects  
6. Participants in the study must speak either English or Spanish.  All recruitment 
documents, including the consent form, will be provided in both languages.  All 
documents will be translated and back translated from English to Spanish by a 
certified transla tor.  Bilingual research staff fluent in both Spanish and English will 
also be available should participants have questions during the consent process.   As 
this is a minimal risk study; a formal face -to-face oral consent process will not take 
place.  Howev er, should participants have questions, study staff will be available to

We will not re -consent at age 18 as no participant will reach the age of 18 during the 
study period.   
9. Planned emergency research is not applicable to this study . 
Subjects  who are not yet adults  (infants, children , teenagers ) 
10. We will enroll [ADDRESS_1161321] to participating in this study.  Obtaining 
informed assent in children this young may possibly be coercive, since children of 
this age are highly suggestible to adults .  Should the child express they do not want 
to participate in the study at any time, the process will stop.   
11. Parental permission will be obtained from:  
o One parent even if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.  
12. Permission will  NOT  be obtained from individuals other than parent s. 
13. Assent will NOT be obtained from a ny children.  We will enroll 3 -5 year old children .   
o The capability of these children (taking into account the ages, maturity, and 
psychological state of the children involved) is so limited that they cannot 
reasonably be consulted.  
14. Requested Waiver of consent at age of majority  
Cognitively Impaired Adults  
15. We will not be enrolling cognitively impaired adults.   
Adults Unable to Consent  
16. We will not be enrolling adults unable to provide consent.   
17. No assent will be obtained as all adults enrolled will be consented .

31.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
We will be following “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091).  Additionally, participants will 
be given the option to review and sign the consent online via a secure REDCap portal. This will allow the study 
team to document consent while making it easier and quicker for participants to enroll. For these participants, a 
waiver of documentation of consent is requested as the REDCap module we are using does not meet criteria 
of applicable state/international law (per WA, RCW 19.34.300). In addition to having a copy of the paper

consent to review, the full content of the a pproved consent form will be provided online for review prior to the 
section where participants indicate consent by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_692902]. The activities in the research 
study are similar to what children and parents would do in their daily life a nd would not require consent outside 
of the research context . 
 
32.0 Drugs or Devices  
We will be using the commercially available instrument, “BioPhotonic Scanner” (Pharma nex Global 
Research, Provo, UT) to provide an objective assessment of fruit and vegetable intake via skin carotenoids . 
This is an exploratory outcome; we will simply examine correlations with fruit/veg intake, as a means of quality 
control. This is not mea nt to be FDA device validation, nor will it be presented as such. Additionally, we have 
cited several pediatric studies that have also used the device without the requirement of registering it with the 
FDA

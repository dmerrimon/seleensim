BACKGROUND:  
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in the Veteran population given the risk factors of 
male gender, being overweight, and increasing age. OSA is caused by [CONTACT_899665], resulting 
in arousals from sleep and hypoxia. While continuo us positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a highly 
efficacious treatment for OSA, adherence  with treatment is suboptimal. Because research is clear that 
adherence patterns are established early in treatment, we evaluate d an mHealth intervention to 
facilitate e arly, productive interactions between patient and provider that improve the quality of care 
and ultimately improve adherence with therapy and outcomes. The mHealth intervention al approach  
can allow for improved, more timely delivery of our Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program  (SM) . 
OBJECTIVES:  
The objective of this proposal was  to evaluate an  mHealth system for patients with Obstructive Sleep 
Apnea syndrome (OSA) that facilitates patient -centered, collaborative management for patients who are 
prescribed the gold- standard treatment, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  
DESIGN & METHODS:  
The evaluative aspect of this proposal is designed as a randomized clinical trial-- Usual Care (Usual Care 
(control; UC); Self- Management Care (intervention 1; SM); and Self-Management via mHealth 
(intervention 2; SM -Mobile). The key feature of the SM -Mobile intervention is the use of a system that 
allows for receiving the SM via website at their convenience . The provider is able provide more directed 
feedback to the pati ent based on the telemedicine interaction, and the patient benefits from timely  
contact [CONTACT_446816].  Specific inclusio n and exclusion criteria includ ed: age > 18 years; confirmed 
diagnosis of moderate -severe OSA; being newly prescribed CPAP therapy;  having chronic symptoms as 
noted on screening symptom checklist; and fluency in English. Patients were  recruited from the VA San 
Diego Healthcare System Sleep Clinic . Participants were  enrolled for a 4 -month time period.  
FINDING:  
Overall Sample:  The over all sample was aged 53.1±13.6, had a body mass index  (BMI)  of 32.6±5.7, 
apnea -hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.3±18.9, and a baseline Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284] (ESS) of 11.8±5.3. 
90% of the sample were men. There were no significant differences between the groups on BMI, AHI, 
ESS, sleep apnea symptoms, insomnia symptoms or depressive symptoms.  
 
Aim 1 : To examine the effect of the Self -Management Care delivered by [CONTACT_899666] (SM -Mobile) 
intervention compared to Usual Care (UC) and Self- Management Care (SM) on level of CPAP adherence  
relative to Usual Care . The three groups were compared to see if there were differences on adherence. 
No statistically significant differences were found between UC, SM and SM -Mobile  groups at the 2 -
month timepoint ( 4.0±2.2, 3. 9±2.4, and 3. 8±2.4 hours per night, respectively; F=. 113; p=. 893). or the 4 -
month timepoint (3.6±2.2, 3.6±2.5, and 3.6±2.5 hours per night, respectively; F=.041; p=.959).  
 
In addition, we had CPAP efficacy metrics, including the residual Apnea- Hypopnea Index (AHI) and mask 
leak. At the 4 -month time point, CPAP resulted in very good con trol of sleep apnea as evidenced by [CONTACT_899667] 3.3 across the entire group. There were no group differences on residual AHI (UC, SM, and 
SM-Mobile of 3.0, 3.6 and 3.3, respectively). The same was true at the 2 -month timepoint (mean 
residual AHI = 3.4;  3.2, 3.7 and 3.5, respectively). Mask leak was also well within normal limits at both 
the 2 -month (mean = .14; .11, .15, and .16  lps) and 4 -month timepoints  (mean = 12; .12, .12, and .13  
lps).  
 
Aim 2 : To examine the effect of the SM -Mobile intervention, compared to Usual Care and Self-
Management Care, on the patient’s experience of the quality of patient- centered, collaborative care (as 
measured by [CONTACT_899668]  [PACIC] ). The PACIC results in a total score 
and five subscal e scores (Patient Activation, Delivery/support, Goal, Problem -solving, and Follow -up). 
The three intervention groups did not differ statistically (UC, SM, SM -Mobile) (3.3±1.1; 3.4±1.1; 3.4±1.1, 
respectively) on the PACIC Total Score. Higher scores indicated higher ratings of chronic illness care. The 
range of scores for the subscales was 2.6 to 3.7, with the higher overall scores on the Delivery/support 
subscale and the lowest on the Follow -up subscale. Overall, the scores were as high or higher than those 
reported in the literature for patients with similar chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, 
depression and arthritis, indicating that the interventions studied in this project resulted in higher than average chronic illness care, as rated by  [CONTACT_1962].  
 
Aim 3 : To examine the effect of SM -Mobile, compared to UC and SM, on OSA apnea outcomes (e.g., OSA 
symptoms and OSA -specific health -related quality of life [HRQOL]). The Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_899658] 2 -months by 3.4 points and to 4 -months by 4.0 points. Given that the cut -off 
for the ESS is 10 points (above which is considered sleepy; below which is considered within normal limits), all three interventions combined to reduce the sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_899659] (i.e., from mean ESS score of 11.8 to mean ESS score of 8.4 and 7.8 for 2-months and 4 -months respectively). The mean ESS scores did not differ significantly between the 
groups at either the 2 -month timepoint (8.3, 8.5, and 8.5 for the 3 groups respectively, UC, SM and SM -
Mobile) or the 4 -month timepoint (7.9 , 7.4, and 8. 2 for the 3 groups respectively, UC, SM and SM -
Mobile ). Sleep quality as measured by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_899660] 3 groups from baseline (mean 11.9) to 2 -months (2.8 points, mean 9.1) and to 4 -months (2.9 
points, mean 9.0). The mean PSQI  scores did not differ significantly between the groups at e ither the 2 -
month timepoint (8.7, 9.4, and 9 .5 for the 3 groups respectively, UC, SM and SM -Mobil e) or the 4 -month 
timepoint (8.5 , 9.0, and 9.7  for the 3 groups respectively, UC, SM and SM -Mobile).  
  
STATISTICAL ANALYSI S PLAN (SAP):  
Data Analytic Plan.  Preliminary analyses will begin with an examination of the distribution of variables 
to assess their characteristics (means, standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis), to provide 
descriptive statistics of the study popu lation, and to allow assessment of randomization. Continuous 
measures will be tested for normality and homogeneity of variance. Non -normally distributed variables 
will be transformed to meet the normal distribution assumption for linear statistical models.  
The research question in the primary aim [ADDRESS_1261353] -
intervention among the three intervention  groups (UC, SM, SM -Mobile) and secondary aims 2 and 3  will 
be addressed by [CONTACT_899669] (UC, SM, SM -Mobile) on the changes in  PACIC, 
OSA symptoms and OSA HRQOL  from pre -intervention to post- intervention. The analytic model is based 
on an analysis of variance on the post -intervention measure (primary aim) or the change measures 
(secondary aims). For the change measures, the ANOVA will be accompanied by [CONTACT_317595] (ANCOVA) on the change scores with intervention as a main effect and the corresponding 
baseline measurement (baseline PACIC, OSA symptoms and OSA HRQOL) as the covar iate. Adjustments 
will be made to correct for other baseline imbalances between groups, and to adjust for variables known to influence outcome independently of intervention. To explore this, univariate methods will be 
used. Each of the following variables will be assessed for imbalance between the three intervention groups and their association with each of the outcomes using a univariate analysis (ANOVA, Fisher’s exact test or Spearman correlation coefficient as appropriate): age, gender, education and bas eline OSA 
severity. These variables will be included as covariates in the ANCOVA model if found to be moderately 
associated (p<0.15) with the outcome under study (CPAP adherence, CAHPS, PACIC, OSA symptoms and OSA HRQOL) or unbalanced (p<0.10) among interv ention groups. The outcomes in secondary aims [ADDRESS_1261354] 
analysis among three interventions [and a c alcuation of the adherence level per intervention cost], is 
fully described in section D.7 below.  An intent -to-treat analysis will be performed and no correction will 
be made for multiple comparisons. All above analyses will be performed in R.110 Given below are 
detailed analysis plans for the primary aim and secondary aims 1 and 2.  
Aim 1 : An ANOVA will be used to assess the CPAP adherence at post- intervention among the three 
groups. Followed will be an ANCOVA by [CONTACT_899670]. Any variable that is significantly different at baseline ( p<0.10) and found to be associated with response (p<0.15) as well as any clinically 
significant variables will be included as covariates.  
Aim 2 :  An ANOVA will be used to assess the post vs. pre changes in PACIC  among the three groups. An 
ANCOVA will be p erformed with treatment as a main effect and baseline score as a covariate. Any 
variable that is significantly different at baseline (p<0.10) and found to be associated with response (p<0.15) as well as any clinically significant variables will be included  as covariates. As a secondary 
analysis, the change in PACIC  will also be evaluated using a random effects model with a group, time and 
a group -by-time interaction term.  
Aim 3:   An ANOVA will be used to assess the post vs. pre changes in OSA symptoms and OSA HRQOL  
among the three groups. An ANCOVA will be performed with treatment as a main effect and baseline score as a covariate. Any variable that is significantly different at baseline (p<0.10) and found to be associated with response (p<0.15) as well as any clinically significant variables will be included as 
covariates. As a secondary analysis, a random effects model with a group -by-visit interaction term will 
be used to assess the rate of change in PACIC  differs among three intervention groups.

1) Purpose of this research study
Carl J. Stepnowsky, Jr., PhD and associates are conducting a research study to find out more 
about improving care provided to patients with sleep apnea. You have been asked to participate 
because you have a diagnosis of sleep apnea and have been prescribed continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP). There will be approximately 400 participants at this VA site.  The 
funding source of this study is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Services 
Research & Development Service (HSR&D).
2) How long the study will take
Your participation will take approximately 30-60 minutes each time you come to the VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
and you will be expected to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 1-5 times over a 4-month period. The entire 
study will take about 4 years.
3) What will happen to you in this study 
If you agree to be in the study, the following will happen to you:
a. You will be randomized to one of three groups that are being studied using a 
random number generator.
b. The three groups will each differ on how the education and clinical support will be 
provided to you, but all three will be at or above the standard level of care. 
c. You will be asked to follow an educational program that will help you learn to
manage your sleep apnea using CPAP therapy.
d. You will be asked to complete questionnaires before you start CPAP therapy, and 
then again at two-months and at the end of the 4-month study period.
e. You will be set-up with the CPAP therapy device and fitted for a mask.  You will be 
instructed on how to use the device and you will be able to call our Respi[INVESTIGATOR_899661].
f. At a minimum, you will be called by [CONTACT_142824][INVESTIGATOR_899662] a face-to-face visit at 1-month visit.
4) Which procedure(s) or treatment(s) are done for research only
Your treatment of sleep apnea with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the 
standard of care for your condition, and it is not experimental in this study. What is experimental 
in this study is how the care is organized and delivered to you via two different communication 
methods, either by [CONTACT_899671]-to-face and telephone communication or by [CONTACT_899672] a mobile phone.  Video teleconferencing includes the transmission of 
audio/video, and will be done using the VA-approved Clinical Video Teleconferencing Into the Subject Name: [CONTACT_1782]:

   1 hkHome (CVTH) service. CVTH uses end-to-end encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard) for 
data security. You will be seen for all of your regularly scheduled clinic visits and will be treated 
at a minimum as you normally would in the Sleep Clinic – this represents the standard of care 
and is not experimental in this study.  
5) RISKS reasonably to be expected
Participation in this program may involve some risks or discomforts.  There is the possible risk of 
loss of confidentiality through participation in research because of access to your medical 
record. Safeguards will be taken to ensure that your confidentiality is not lost. A trained research 
staff member will access your medical record only to obtain data from your sleep study – the 
information the research study requires includes summary indices such as your apnea-
hypopnea index (the number of breathing disturbances per hour of sleep), oxygen desaturation 
index (the number of times your oxygen drops ≥3% per hour of sleep), and total sleep time (the 
total amount of time in minutes that you are asleep). Use of the sleep recording device might 
results in (a) minor irritation to the skin caused by [CONTACT_899673] (b) disrupted sleep 
from wearing the sleep equipment, which can result in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_899663]. 
Unforeseeable RISKS 
Because this is an investigational study there may be some unknown risks that are currently 
unforeseeable. You will be informed if the researchers learn of any change in the amount of risk 
to you.
6) BENEFITS reasonably to be expected.
There may or may not be a direct benefit to you from these procedures. The study, however, 
may learn more about how best to organize and deliver care to patients with sleep apnea on 
CPAP.  
7) Voluntary nature of participation and right to withdraw without penalty.
Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any 
time without jeopardy to the medical care you will receive at this institution or loss of benefits to 
which you are entitled.  
8) Alternatives to the research procedure or treatment 
The alternatives to participation in this study are: (a) to not participate; (b) to contact [CONTACT_899674]-related problems you may be experiencing, or (c)  
contact[CONTACT_899675] A.W.A.K.E. group, which stands for Alert, Well, And Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_899664], 
and is organized by [CONTACT_899676]. The goal of this informal group is to 
provide educational and emotional support from other sleep apnea patients – however, this 
does not replace the standard of care provided by [CONTACT_899677]/her staff.

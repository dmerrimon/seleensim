 General Study Information  Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_817080], PhD, Magnetic Resonance Technology and Use Design Lab, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster Other Study Staff:  Jacinta Browne, PhD, Norbert Campeau, MD Jared Verdoorn, MD  Study Title:    Detection of the occurrence of infiltration of gadolinium injection in brain MR scans using artificial intelligence.  Protocol version number and date:     Version 2: January 20th, 2022  Research Question and Aims  Hypothesis: Machine learning can be used to make a binary decision regarding the occurrence of infiltration of the MR contrast agent, gadolinium, through analysis of MR Brain scan images.    Aims, purpose, or objectives: The aim of this study is to develop machine-learning algorithms and infrastructure through the analysis of MR image data for training and testing, for the detection of intravenous infiltration of MR contrast agent. This aim will be achieved through the analysis of both non-infiltrated and infiltrated brain MR images.  This analysis will involve segmenting and analyzing the nasal mucosa region following contrast agent administration. The developed machine learning model will be trained to be able to differentiate between non-infiltrated (contrast-enhanced) and infiltrated MR images and thus determine if infiltration has occurred.  The training and testing data will include both prospective and retrospective MR data.

This IRB application outlines the part of the study which will involve the collection prospective data for training the machine learning model.   Background (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):    In 2015, an estimated 17 million magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed in the [LOCATION_002] using intravenous (IV) contrast agents [1], reflecting the essential role of IV contrast in the detection, characterization, and staging of disease.  On occasion, the IV line is inadequate and causes the contrast medium to infiltrate into the muscle tissue in the arm, which can cause discomfort to the patient, delays with the patient scan as well as the need for a repeat exam to be performed or patient call-back, if not detected in a timely manner.  The risk of undetected contrast medium extravasation is increased when automated mechanical injectors or higher injection rages are used for the contrast material injection [2-3].  Thus, if the occurrence of IV infiltration could be detected during the patient MR examination before the patient is removed from the scanner this would significantly improve both the patient experience and the clinical workflow.  To that end, this study aims to develop a machine learning algorithm to detect intravenous infiltration, into the muscle of MR contrast agent used for routine brain MR examinations, through the analysis of the nasal mucosa.  Study Design and Methods  Methods:  Describe in lay terms, completely detailing the research activities that will be conducted by [CONTACT_817082].  We will recruit 40 patients presenting for a clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain without and with IV contrast agent. Informed written consent will be obtained prior to the participation in the study and recorded in clinical documents. Each patient will be contact[CONTACT_88240] [INVESTIGATOR_202816]/her designees. The potential risks to participants will be minimal. The specific absorption rate (SAR) used in this study is well under the current FDA safety limits for MRI. No additional drugs or invasive procedures will be used in the study.   Medical charts will be abstracted for imaging and pathologic findings. Patients will undergo their one additional MR sequence as part of their clinical MRI brain scan. This additional sequence will be included prior to IV contrast administration as part of the standard MR brain without and with IV contrast examination.  Commercially available MRI scanners (General Electric (GE) Medical Systems, Wauwatosa, WI, [LOCATION_003] at both 1.5T and 3T and Siemens, Siemens Healthcare, [LOCATION_013]) will be used.   Study Procedure Commercially available MRI scanners (General Electric (GE) Medical Systems, Wauwatosa, WI, [LOCATION_003] at both 1.5T and 3T and Siemens, Siemens Healthcare, [LOCATION_013] at both 1.5T and 3T) will be used. A total of [ADDRESS_1131404] examination on the Siemens 1.5T and 3T, and GE 1.5T and 3T MR scanners within the clinic.  The additional sequence will be a sagittal T1 CUBE FS for the GE scanners and a sagittal T1 SPACE FS for the Siemens scanners.

The training and testing data will include both prospective and retrospective MR data. We require additional data which simulates the occurrence of IV infiltration during a routine brain without and with IV contrast exam as currently there is a low number of previous studies (n= 50) with associated MR images demonstrating IV infiltration. The data collected as part of this innovation study will be used to augment the retrospective data already collected for the training and testing of the developed AI algorithm.   The machine learning training and testing process is described below and illustrated in Figure 1. i. Training Phase - Predictive machine learning models for detection of infiltration will be developed and the performance optimized. Machine Learning Tasks will be to (a) differentiate nasal mucosa with Gd contrast agent uptake vs. nasal mucosa or eye fat ratio without Gd contrast agent uptake. ii. Test Phase - Evaluate the machine learning model and then compare them with the assessment by [CONTACT_817083]’s test and Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis with specificity threshold equivalent to clinical reporting.

Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if not including all of the information.   Power Statement:  Not applicable – pi[INVESTIGATOR_817081]:  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be generated for radiologist diagnosis and the machine learning models decisions and compared using the Delong test. Cut-off values for the machine learning models will be selected to match the sensitivity of radiologist clinical assessment in the training cohort, in order to construct working points of the models that maintain clinically achieved detection rates for the specific clinical exams. The sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning models will be compared based on the reduction of false-positive (FP) decisions compared with the clinical reference. The performance of the machine learning models will be compared to that of the radiologist performance using the McNemar test.   Endpoints Primary: Area-under-curve performance for each machine learning model and the performance measure “net benefit”. Net benefit is defined as:   The weighting factor, w, corresponds to the odds (i.e. the harm-to-benefit ratio) of the chosen risk threshold.  Retest-repeatability of the model determined from intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).  Secondary: Sensitivity and specificity of each machine learning model and comparison with radiologist performance using the McNemar test.  References 1. OECD Health Statistics.

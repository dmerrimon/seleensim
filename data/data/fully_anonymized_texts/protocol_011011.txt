Gabapentin Regimens and Their Effects on Opi[INVESTIGATOR_17010]  
 
A randomized controlled trial  
 
Version Date: 3/20/[ADDRESS_16171] remains uncertain [1], but 
gabapentin has been found to reduce acute pain on its own [2 –3], to limit cravings and symptoms 
of withdrawal in people addicted to substances [4 –6], and to decreas e nausea [7 –8]. 
Perhaps gabapentin’s greatest benefit is to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_17011].  Patients who take gabapentin in  conjunctio n with opi[INVESTIGATOR_17012],  or even in the 
two-hour window beforehand [9 –18], take fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_17013]-effects du ring the recovery process [19 –24]. 
We wanted to determine the best strategy of administering gabapentin in connection with our 
current approach to perioperative pain management.   We wanted to ba lance gabapentin’s  
obvious usefulness with its own side effects; gabapentin can cause drowsiness and unsteady 
bearing [11, 15 –18] and poses its own small  risk of addiction and abuse [24 ].  We therefore 
propose a two-armed trial to  evaluate different adjunct gabapentin regimens given in the 
perioperative period,  and to identify which manage s patient pain  most effectively and safely.  In 
this evaluation, we will identify the quantity of patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], the quality of th eir 
pain management, and the frequency and severity of any side effects they might experience.  
 
Specific Aims  
 
With this project, we intend  to determine whether administering a regimen of gabapentin  after 
surgery can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_17014], which is a 
singl e preoperative dose of 600 mg, followed by a dose of 600 mg each morning during 
postoperative admission .  The experimental  regimen would add one week  of standing gabapentin  
followed by a month of night ly doses .  Furthermore, we would like to know more about 
gabapentin’s potential to cause drowsiness in patients  and whether it has any effect  on their 
ability to sleep after surgery.   Finally, we  want to know how long patients remain on gabapentin  
after surgery . 
 
 
Subject Selection  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
- At least  18 years of age  
- Receiving surgery for total knee replacement (TKR)  
- Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve  
- Agrees to use tracking diary to monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_17015]:  
- Over 75 years of age  on the date of surgery  
- If female, pregnant  
- Has received investigational articles < 30 days prior to enrollment or is currently 
receiving investigational products or devices  
- Chronic pain syndrome  
- Taking chronic narcotics and/or taking more than [ADDRESS_16172] Enro llment  
 
Patients who schedule total knee replacement (TKR) with [CONTACT_17039] at Brigham and 
Women’s Faulkner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17016] .  Specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_17017] -maintained diary to document narcotic medications, and the PI’ s use of gabapentin 
for his surgical patients.   All patients will be offered the chance to discuss with both the RA and 
the Principal Investigator (PI) and ask questions.  
  
Each  qualifying patient will be sent a letter describing the  study and asking the patient to 
consider participating.  After a reasonable elapse of time, the RA will call the patient by [CONTACT_17032].  The patient’s response to this request will be 
recorded in research recor ds.  During this phone call, the RA will confirm that the patient meets 
the inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criterion.  If, later in the study, a patient 
meets any one of the exclusion criteria, he or she will be removed from the study.   
 
Patients’ informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_17033](s) when they come to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17018] -op testing.  If this is somehow impossible, written informed consent may be 
obtained in preoperative holding before surgery.  Upon giving con sent, the patient will be 
randomly assig ned to a treatment group using  computer -generated randomization.  
 
The study will have two treatment arms:  
 
Patients in Group [ADDRESS_16173] of care, plus an additional home regimen: 
they will take [ADDRESS_16174] the amo unt of pain medications they consume and answer 
enclosed VAS s cales every day in a tracking diary . 
 
 
Study Procedures  
 
Every patient being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17019] — the latter of whic h will be either printed or in electronic form — about 
narcotic medications.  The instructions will explain when to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_17020].  Following discharge, patients will take gabapentin as directed by 
[CONTACT_17034], and in the process track their opi[INVESTIGATOR_17021].  They will also document t heir pain, nausea and satisfaction levels according to the 
visual analogue scale (VAS).   
 
At the first post -operative appointment , approximately 9 –10 days following  surgery,  patients’ 
levels of opi[INVESTIGATOR_17022] ; the 
actual number of t ablets  consumed will be compared with  the documented  amount s and with the  
prescription s they received.  Patients receiving  a new prescription will  also receive a matching 
diary for the total length of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512], including further directions on how to wean 
themselves off the ir opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] s.  
 
Our primary outcome measures will be the amount of  patients’  opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] , calculate d in 
total doses of  morphine equivalent , and the total number of days  the patients took  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Our 
secondary outcome measure s will be VA S scores for surgical site pain (both at rest and during 
physical activity),  nausea , sleep quality,  and satisfaction with pain management — all of which 
are reported on a daily basis within the tracking diary .  Tertiary  outcome measures will be the 
number of patients who are taking gabapentin  beyond the length of time prescribed by [CONTACT_1758], 
measured at the second posto perative visit 2 –3 months after surgery.  
 
Additional data including length of stay, postoperative complications including infection and 
readmission, ED visits and routinely collected postoperative functional outcome measures 
(PROMS) will be recorded.   
 
 
Biostatistical Analysis  
 
We will be comparing the two arms of the trial to see whether there exists a statistically 
significant difference between them.  Variables i n which we are interested include total opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023],  the amou nt of days spent using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , and  the amount of days spent taking 
gabapentin .  We will also record the other outcome measures detailed in the previous section.  
When comparing the branches, a ll analyses will be run at a type I error rate of 5% . 
 
The study will end once we have  enrolled the requisite number of patients in the study and taken 
the diary -based  data from them.   According to previous literature on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing effects of 
gabapentin, experimental groups tend to consume anywhere between 20% and 50% fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_17024] , with the average approximately 35% , and standard deviation 
approximately half the mean  [9, 22, 23, 25].  Powering the study to detect this approximate 
difference, t he total number of patients will be 68, with [ADDRESS_16175] risk for TKR  patients for long -lasting opi[INVESTIGATOR_17025], which can be about  8%.  Patients who attempt taper off their 
medications too quickly are at risk of experiencing acute post -operative pain.  Pat ients in the 
intervention group , who will be administered gabapentin  for a greater length  of time, may be at 
greater risk for gabapentin dependence  than members of the control group.  
 
 
Potential Benefits  
 
While w e do not guarantee benefits to participation, it is possible that the members of our 
intervention group may taper off their narcotic medications more quickly and more successfully 
than those who receive our standard of care, thus lessening their risk of lo ng-term dependence on 
the medications.  This could result in increased health and satisfaction.  
 
We hope that finding an optimal gabapentin regimen can help patients reduce their narcotic 
consumption after total knee replacements, which will reduce their risk of becoming dependent 
on narcotics for pain management.   Results of the study thus may help improve medication 
regimens for future patients.  
 
 
Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17026]’s progress and 
any concerns regarding subject safety.  Study progress including data completion and entry will 
be discussed at protocol meetings to be held as needed during the duration of the protocol 
activity.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l report adverse events or other unanticipated problems to 
PHRC as described in the PHRC policy on Adverse Event Reporting and Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others.  
 
Adverse events will be reported immediately to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17028] I RB in accordance with the IRB 
adverse event reporting guidelines.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17029].  The 
research coordinator will be responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all forms, entrie s, 
and informed consent.  As an added quality assurance measure, study staff will hold monthly 
meetings to ensure that adherence to protocol is maintained by [CONTACT_17035].  Subject data wi ll be kept on a protocol -specific, 
password -protected, Partners Healthcare System -maintained computer that is kept in a locked 
office.  PHS computers maintain the latest anti -virus software and firewall protections.  
 
Patients will be identified only by [CONTACT_1209], and not by [CONTACT_12928], SSN, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17030].  Research staff will maintain a separate confidential enrollment log 
which matches identifying codes with the patients’ names and addresses available only to IRB -
approved s tudy staff.  
 
All study forms, reports, and other records that are part of the study data collection materials will 
be identified by [CONTACT_17036].  All paper records will be kept 
in locked file cabinets.  All electronic records of study data will be identified by [CONTACT_17037].

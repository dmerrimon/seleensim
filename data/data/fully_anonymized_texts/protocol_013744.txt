Title of study:  Characteristics and Treatment Patterns of Patients with Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Initiating Tiotro pi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]+Olodaterol or Other 
Maintenance Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_783464]: A Retrospective Claims 
Database Study  
Rationale and 
background:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_783496][INVESTIGATOR_038], often including 
small airway obstruction and emphysema.  
For patients who are diagnosed with COPD, maintenance treatmen ts often 
include bronchodilators, primarily long -acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMA), long -acting beta agonists (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) alone or in combination with each other and corticosteroids. 
Sp(t)iolto ® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862] ®, a LAMA+LABA combi nation, was approved in May 
21, 2015 in the US and July 1, 2015 in the EU (marketed as Stiolto in the US 
and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_195387], referred  to here as Tio+Olo ).  
Selective prescribing according to patient characteristics, known as 
channeling, can lead to bias  in comparative studies where drugs with similar 
therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic 
differences. Claimed advantages of a new drug may be distorted if they are 
channeled  to patients with special pre -existing morbidi ty, with the 
consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the 
drug. Therefore, it is important to identify clinical and socio -demographic 
characteristics of patients who initiate each treatment as opposed to other 
available maint enance treatments in COPD patients.  
Research question 
and objectives:  The primary objectives of the study are to use US and [LOCATION_006] data to describe the 
characteristics of COPD patients according to various demographic, lifestyle, 
clinical, and medication use at the following times:  
● Date of COPD claim confirming diagnosis  (at any time) . 
● Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_783467]  (after date of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_783468]) . 
● Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_783469]  (after date of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_783468]) .

 RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease characterized by [CONTACT_783504][INVESTIGATOR_038], often including small airway obstruction and 
emphysema (Barnes 2015). Patients may experience exacerbations, defined as acute onset, 
short but sustained worsening of patient’s condition beyond normal levels. Exacerbations 
often lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or change in medication, as they negatively impact long -
term health outcomes (Pavord 2016). As thma COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) is another 
complication that consists of concurrent COPD and asthma. Most studies have reported that 
patients with ACOS have worse prognosis than patients with only COPD in terms of more 
frequent and severe exacerbations, worsened symptoms, and decreased quality of life (Barnes 
2016). Scant information exists on appropriate therapy for ACOS, because these patients are 
often excluded from clinical trials of asthma or COPD (Barnes 2016).  
No known medications can reverse COPD,  but use of rescue medications in the form of short 
acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), short acting beta agonists (SABA), and also regular 
maintenance treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. The Global 
Initiative for Chronic Obs tructive Disease (GOLD 2017) recommends classifying patients for 
treatment based on assessment of existing symptoms and history of exacerbations. For 
patients who are diagnosed with COPD, maintenance treatments often include 
bronchodilators, primarily long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long -acting beta 
agonists (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or in combination with each other 
and corticosteroids. Sp(t)iolto ® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862] ®, a LAMA+LABA combination, was approved in

coun tries. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_783474] a device that aerates the Tio+Olo  drug into a mist that may be more 
effective in reaching the lungs. Compared with LAMA or LABA alone, LAMA+LABA has 
demonstrated improved lung function, patient -reported outcomes, and quality of life 
meas ures in clinical trials (Calzetta 2017). Furthermore, the classic side effects of weight 
gain, osteoporosis, and community -acquired pneumonia associated with ICS use do not 
appear to be as severe for LAMA+LABA use (Tariq 2017).  
Selective prescribing accord ing to patient characteristics, known as channeling , can lead to  
allocation bias  in comparative studies , where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are 
prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences (Petri 1991). Claimed advantages 
of a new drug may be distorted if they are channeled  to patients with special pre -existing 
morbidity, with the consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the 
drug. Therefore, it is important to identify clinical and socio -demograph ic characteristics of 
patients who initiate each treatment as opposed to other available maintenance treatments in 
COPD patients.  
This study will allow us to evaluate patient characteristics by [CONTACT_783505] p otentially driving prescriptions to different patient 
populations in the US and [LOCATION_006].

 RESEARCH METHODS  
 STUDY DESIGN  
Market Scan: 
The proposed study is a non -interventional retrospective study based on existing data from 
the Truven Health Market Scan, a US claims database. Data from Jan 1, 2008  (earliest data 
available) to March 31, 2017 (latest data available)  will be used to characterize COPD 
patients who initiated first and/or second maintenance treatment in three different cross 
sections: at COPD claim confirming diagnosis date, at date of first maintenance therapy, and 
at date of second maintenance therapy.  Details of the study design are provided below.  
 
CPRD:  
The proposed study is a non -interventional retrospective study based on existing data from 
the CPRD, a [LOCATION_006] -based administrative database. Data from November 21, 1987  (earliest data 
available) to June 30, 2018  (latest data available) will be used to characte rize COPD patients 
who initiated first and/or second maintenance treatment in three different cross sections: at 
COPD claim confirming diagnosis date, at date of first maintenance therapy, and at date of 
second maintenance therapy. Details of the study des ign are provided below.

A child (i.e. nested) cohort wi ll be created consisted solely of individuals who ever initiated 
first maintenance therapy. The parent cohort is the population of COPD patients described 
above. The date of initiation of first maintenance therapy will be set as the index date, and the 
365-day period before index will be used to provide descriptive analyses and number of 
COPD exacerbations.  Importantly, the date of initiation of first maintenance therapy 
must occur on or after May 21, 2015 (MarketScan) or July  1, 2015 (CPRD), the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_783476]. 
 
For entry into this child cohort, patients will be required to have 365 days  of continuous 
insurance enrolment  with both medical and pharmacy coverage  prior to initiation of the

• ICS 
Dual Therapy  
• Tio+Olo (LAMA + LABA)

Triple Therapy  
• Tio+Olo + ICS  
• LAMA + LABA + ICS  
 
The two medication -related outcomes in this non -interventional study are as follows:  
1. First maintenance therapy is defined as first occurrence of any of the categories listed 
above after cohort entry date.  
2. Second maintenance therapy is defined as any subsequent maintenance therapy 
category that differs from the first maintenance therapy category. The earliest date of 
initiation of second maintenance therapy is [ADDRESS_1077363] 
maintenance therapy.  
 
Classification of individuals to different therapy categories will be based on the continuous 
use of a single drug  (defined by [CONTACT_783508] ) for 
at least 30 days (monotherapy), a combination therapy for at least 30 days (dual therapy), an 
overlap of two different mono -formulations (e.g. LAMA overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_783477]) for at least 
30 days (dual therapy), or different combination formulations and mono -formulations 
together for at leas t 30 days (triple therapy). We will employ a 14 -day allowable gap for 
continuous drug use to account for possible under -dosing of maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(analogous to splitting pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) and skippi[INVESTIGATOR_783478]. The specific definitions 
for th erapy classification are detailed below.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary outcomes  
We will also examine two clinical outcomes over follow -up among individuals among 
individuals who had first and/or second maintenance therapy:  
• Exacerbations in the year prior to the start of first maintenance therapy.  
• Exacerbations in the year prior to the start of second maintenance therapy (if 
available).  
 
For Market Scan, there are specific ICD -10 codes to identify e xacerbations, but no ICD -9 
code. COPD exacerbation s will be defined as any of the following:  
• An acute COPD exacerbation diagnosis (ICD -10 J44.0, J44.1);  
• A claim for an antibiotic or a corticosteroids on the same day or within 7 days 
following an outpatient COPD diagnosis;  
• An inpatient diagnosis of COPD in any position;  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783480];  
• An emergency department visit with a COPD diagnosis in any position ; 
• Lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_783481] (ICD -9 466, ICD -10 J20.9, J21.0, J21.8,

a COPD diagnosis (Chalmers 2018).  
 
Exacerbations occurring within 14 days of one another will be  consi dered a single event.  
 
The mean (SD) and median (IQR) number of COPD exacerbations will be reported. 
Categories of COPD exacerbations will also be reported as: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ exacerbations.

 DATA SOURCES  
The proposed study will utilize data from two separate data sources: the Truven Market Scan 
data (US) and The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) ([LOCATION_006]).  
 
MarketScan  
The Truven MarketScan databases capture longitudinal, individual -level administrative  
claims data from the [LOCATION_002]. The data available for study included three components of 
MarketScan: the Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) Database, the Medicare 
Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database (MDCR), and the Medicaid Databa se. 
Patients in the databases are  active employees, dependents, retirees, COBRA recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and 
Medicare or Medicaid enrollees . Data were drawn from large employers, health plans, and 
public organizations in the [LOCATION_002]. The following tables of the M arketScan databases 
were available for analysis: Enrolment Detail, Inpatient Admissions, Inpatient Services, 
Outpatient Services, Outpatient Pharmaceutical Claims, and Long Term Care. These tables 
provide information on plan enrolment, healthcare utilizati on and expenditures, 
demographics, and integrated records for inpatient events, outpatient events, and pharmacy 
dispensings. Data were available from January 1, [ADDRESS_1077366]  
Clinical Prac tice Research Datalink (CPRD) is based on standardized electronic medical 
records (EMR) systems in primary care practices in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]). This database 
represents over 700 contributing general practices in the [LOCATION_006], and includes approximately 
17.8 million patients. The geographical distribution of the practices has been shown to be 
representative of the [LOCATION_006] population, and age and sex distributions of patients in the databases 
are similar to those reported by [CONTACT_783511] (Walley 1997). Participating 
general practitioners have been trained to record medical information, including demographic

data, medical diagnoses, procedures, and deaths using a standardized form (Garcia Rodriguez 
1998). The EMR system records conditions, interven tions and diagnostics using READ codes 
and medication prescribing is recorded using the British National Formulary (BNF). The 
EMR system records the prescribing of medications, including over -the-counter medications, 
but it does not verify whether patients  fill the medications at the pharmacy. The system 
records laboratory test results and lifestyle measures like smoking, alcohol use, and body 
mass index with varying degrees of completeness. The database is limited to recordings by 
[CONTACT_783512] n including the transferred notes from specialists and some 
information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Linkage to other datasets is possible, including the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783483] (HES), which is a data warehouse containing records of all patients 
admitted to NH S hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783484] (Walley 1997). In the current study, event dates 
spanned from November 21, [ADDRESS_1077367] 1 claim for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_783485]-up.  
 DATA MANAGEMENT  
MarketScan  
The Truven Health MarketScan database is comprised of fully adjudicated and paid claims 
records of integrated longitudinal enrolment, inpatient, outpatient and drug data from 
multiple payers, that has been standardized and de -identified prior to use for the analysis. The 
statistical analysis will be conducted using the Aetion Evidence Platform.  
 
Drug Duration  
For MarketScan, unless otherwise noted, drug event duration was calculated from the “Days 
Supply” fi eld, and in cases where this field was 0, the duration was assumed to be 1 day.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data that occurs in covariates or descriptive variables will be classified as own 
category . In addition, a feasibility assessment before begi nning the analyses will be done, and 
variables with >75 % missing values will be excluded from all analyses, other than baseline 
characteristics. If a variable is left with only one category  other than missing, the variable 
will be excluded completely from  all analyses.  The percentage of patients with missing data 
for both categorical and continuous variables will be reported .

Protocol for non-interventional studies based on existing data  
BI Study Number 1237.91  <document number>  
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_1077368], drug events' duration was calculated from the provided number of days field. In 
the case where this field was zero and a dosage identifier was present in the text field, the 
days supplied was determined from the quantity field and the numeric dai ly dose from the 
associated dosage metadata. In the case where this field was zero and no numeric daily dose 
could be determined, the default duration will be set to thirty days.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data that occurs in covariates or descripti ve variables will be classified as its own 
level. In addition, a feasibility assessment before beginning the analyses will be done, and 
variables with >75 % missing values will be excluded from all analyses, other than baseline 
characteristics. If a variab le is left with only one level other than missing, the variable will be 
excluded completely from all analyses.  
 
For clinical variables (FEV 1/FVC, BMI ), distributions of observed values will be evaluated 
and clinically feasible ranges will be applied. Follo wing implementation of reasonable 
ranges, a final assessment of outliers will be tested visually using histograms to understand 
the distribution of these variables. Any potential effects of skewed distributions will be 
presented in results and revised appr oaches will be considered where necessary.  
 DATA ANALYSIS  
 Main analysis  
For all analyses, variables will be reported as follows:  
• Continuous variables (e.g., age) will be presented as means (with standard deviation , 
SD) and /or medians (with interquartile range , IQR ). 
• Categorical variables (e.g., sex) will be presented as absolute and relative frequencies.  
• All results will have two digits following the decimal point.

• Treatment Patterns at First vs. Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
The grandchi ld cohort described in section [ADDRESS_1077372] maintenance vs. a specific medication class at second maintenance. 
We will present two proportions, a conditional and a marginal proportion: 1) For the 
conditional proportion, the numerator will be the number of patients who used that specific 
combination, and the denominator will include all patients who used the first maintenance 
drug for that combination. Using arbitrary values as an example, if the number of patients 
who swi tched from LABA → LAMA was [ADDRESS_1077373] maintenance therapy was 1000, then the condit ional proportion would be: 400  / 1000 
= 0.4; 2) For the marginal proportion, the numerator will be the number of patients who used  
the specific combination, and the denominator will include all patients in the grandchild 
cohort. Using arbitrary values as an example, if the number of patients who switched from 
LABA → LAMA was 400 and all patients who used any second maintenance therap y was 
5,000, then the marginal proportion would be: 400 / 5000 = 0.08.  
Sankey plots will also be generated to visually illustrate the flow of patients from first to 
second maintenance therapy according to therapy category.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time to Initiation of Therapy  
• Time Between  Cohort Entry Date  and First Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with first maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time (days) 
between index date and first maintenance therapy will be reported in tabular form .  
 
• Time Betwee n Cohort Entry Date  and Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with second maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time 
(days) between cohort entry date and second maintenance therapy will be reported in tabular 
form.  
 
• Time Between First and Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with second maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time 
(days) between date of initiation of first to the date  of initiation of second maintenance 
therapy will be reported in tabular form.

practices and transparency, thereby [CONTACT_195423].  The 
study will be registered to the ENCePP’s E -register and the results will also be published on 
the same site.  
 
The study protocol also follows the key elements of the Guideline for Good 
Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_61272] (GPP) by [CONTACT_783514][INVESTIGATOR_623] 
[R11 -4318], and the recent draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff “Best Practices for 
Conducting and Reporting Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_783487]” [R15 -4859].  
 
Quality controls include checks for the validity and logical content of codes and checks for 
missing values and variables. In order to control for potential inconsistencies and errors, all 
variables will be tabulated. In addition, the distribution of each variable will be examined. 
Extre me observations with values larger than ± [ADDRESS_1077376] deviations (SD) will be examined 
as potential outliers and consequently excluded from the dataset.  
 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS  
MarketScan  
This study will be conducted using data from insurance claims and is subject to certain 
limitations. One limitation is that these are based on a large, non -random convenience 
sample, which may contain biases or lack generalizability to other populations. D ata also 
come mostly from large employers, and although the database also includes a large amount of 
data from health plans, data from medium and small firms may be underrepresented.

Additionally, the MarketScan database also poses some limitations inheren t to administrative 
claims data. Electronic outpatient pharmacy dispensing records are considered accurate 
because pharmacists fill prescriptions with little room for interpretation and  are reimbursed 
by [CONTACT_195424], complete, and acc urate claims submitted electronically 
(Stergachi 1988, Levy 2003). Pharmacy dispensing information is usually seen as the gold 
standard of drug exposure information compared to self -reported information (West 1995) or 
prescribing records in outpatient medi cal records (West 1994). However, drugs used during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783488]. Finally, while the EMR system records the 
prescribing of medications, including over -the-counter medications, it does not verify 
whether patients fill the medications at the pharmacy, and up to 50% of prescriptions are 
never filled (Fischer 2010). Further, these prescriptions do not ensure that medications were 
taken as prescribed, and any medications filled over -the-counter or provided as samples by 
[CONTACT_783515]. Finally, patients are required not to 
have used any maintenance medications in the year before COPD claim confirming 
diagnosis, but use of these medications may have occurred beyond one year.  
 
CPRD  
This study will be conducted using data from electronic medical records, which is subject to 
certain limitations. While the electronic medical records from CPRD strive for high quality 
data, this relies upon correct entry of the data by [CONTACT_783516] s. Therefore, it is possible 
that there may be missing values where data has not been recorded, or values which have 
been recorded incorrectly. This may affect the data we have on patient demographics and 
comorbidities, and the factors we are interested in  investigating which may influence the 
choice of therapy.  
Finally, prescription data is likely to be entered correctly as the electronic system requires 
that the data is input in order to generate a patient prescription. These prescriptions do not 
ensure t hat medications were taken as prescribed, and any medications filled over -the-counter 
or provided as samples by [CONTACT_783515]. Finally, 
patients are required not to have used any maintenance medications in the year b efore COPD  
claim confirming  diagnosis, but use of these medications may have occurred beyond one 
year.  
 OTHER ASPECTS

BI Study Number 1237.91  <document number>  
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_1077377] carries out a series of ongoing  checks 
to ensure quality of the data; this comprises assessment of both patient data (age, gender, 
registration details and event dates) and the completeness, continuity and plausibility of 
electronic data recording in key areas at the practice level (for  example, ensuring a minimum 
specified percentage of deaths have cause of death recorded, a minimum referral rate per 100 
patients, and a minimum number of prescriptions per patient per month) (Herrett 2015). 
Prescription data in the CPRD are known to be w ell documented as the prescriptions are 
automatically recorded in the database. The therapy file is therefore considered complete, 
except for prescriptions issued in secondary care and for drugs that are purchased over the 
counter (Herrett 2015). Validity of the diagnoses has been assessed in numerous validation 
studies.  However, because this database is limited to general practice, specialist care and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783489].  
In principle, in the US when a patient goes to a pharmacy and gets a drug dispensed, the 
pharmacy bills the insurance carr ier for the cost of that drug. Electronic outpatient pharmacy 
dispensing records are considered accurate because pharmacists fill prescriptions with little 
room for interpretation, and are reimbur sed by [CONTACT_195424], complete, and 
accurate claims submitted electronically (Levy 2013, Stergachis 1988). Pharmacy dispensing 
information is usually seen as the gold standard of drug exposure information compared to 
self-reported infor mation or prescribing records in outpatient medical records. Yet, the 
obvious limitation in these data is that drugs purchased  out of pocket will not result in a 
pharmacy claim.  
To minimize misclassification of the recorded patient characteristics, previou sly validated 
algorithms or code lists will be used whenever available. Code lists will be reviewed by [CONTACT_783517]. Basic plausibility checks will be 
implemented for continuous variables (e.g. BMI, patient age et c.). 
 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
The final study CPRD protocol will be submitted for approval to the Independent Scientific 
Advisory Committee (ISAC) (http://www.cprd.com/ISAC).  
 The CPRD has obtained ethical approval from a Multicentre Research Ethics Co mmittee 
(MREC) for all observational research using CPRD data without patient involvement; 
however, ISAC may recommend that the MREC review the study documentation if any 
ethical issues arise.

 MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS/ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Data is anonymized and extracted, analyzed, validated and reported in aggregate.  
There is no potential that any employee of BI or agent working on behalf of BI will access 
individual patient data in which the patient may be identified during data compi[INVESTIGATOR_666977], data 
reporting or data analysis.  
Based on current guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_623] [R11 
4318] and the EMA [R13 -1970], non -interventional studies such as the one described in this 
protocol, conducted using health care r ecords, do not require expedited reporting of suspected 
adverse events/reactions. Specifically, as stated in section VI.C.1.2.1 of Guideline on Good 
Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP), Module VI – Management and Reporting of Adverse 
Reactions to Medicinal P roducts, for non -interventional study designs, which are based on 
use of secondary data, reporting of adverse reactions is not required.  
 
 PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING 
STUDY RESULTS  
The results of the study will primarily serve internal decisio n making for future studies on 
comparative effectiveness. These baseline results will be published as an abstract and/or 
manuscript. Conference and Journal to be decided.

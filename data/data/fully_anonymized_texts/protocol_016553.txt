 4 extrinsic and intrinsic AD, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1, there is significantly 
higher mRNA expression of IL- 17 and IL-22 cytokines in intrinsic compared with 
extrinsic skin lesions (~8 fold), with corresponding increases in CCL20, Elafin/PI3 
and S100A proteins (these products are induced in keratinocytes by [CONTACT_8668]-17). Higher 
expression of IL-23p40 mRNA was also detected in intrinsic AD lesions.  
The Th17 immune skewing in intrinsic AD has important therapeutic implications, 
suggesting that targeting this axis might preferentially benefit intrinsic AD patients. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_199202], similar expression levels of Th2-related 
products were observed in both extrinsic and intrinsic AD, suggesting that these 
phenotypes might have similar responses to Th2 antagonism, as recently shown in 
the NEJM paper with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL- 4 
and IL-13.(3)  
Therefore, we hypothesize that blocking IL-17 would be able to clinically and 
mechanistically reverse atopic dermatitis effectively in AD patients. 
 
HYPOTHESIS: 
 
Primary Hypothesis: 
 
1. It is hypothesized that IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic 
dermatitis (AD). 
 
Secondary Hypothesi s: 
 
1. Secukinumab is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate 
to severe AD. 
 
 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of 
intrinsic and extrinsic atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_199220][INVESTIGATOR_199203] 16.  
Secondary objectives:  
1. To evaluate reduction in K16 expression at Week 16 compared to Baseline. 
2. To evaluate the efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of intrinsic and 
extrinsic atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_199221] (SCORAD, 
EASI, and IGA, see appendix) for AD. 
3. To determine response biomarkers to secukinumab in treated patients with AD, 
which can be followed in future trials. 
4. To define the cellular and molecular immune profiles of patients with AD as 
compared with non-lesional skin (from AD patients), and normal skin.  
 
 5 ENDPOINTS:  
 
Primary endpoint: Change in epi[INVESTIGATOR_199204] 16 weeks of 
treatment.  
Secondary endpoints:  
1. Change in K16 expression of lesional skin after 16 weeks of treatment. 
 
2. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline objective SCORAD at Week 16 of secukinumab treatment. 
3. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline EASI score at Week 16 of secukinumab treatment. 
4. The proportion of patients who achieve a score of “clear-0” or “almost clear-1” 
in the static IGA score at Week 16 as compared to Baseline. 
5. Percentage decrease in SCORAD/EASI scores at Week 16. 
6. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline objective SCORAD at Week 32 of secukinumab treatment. 
7. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline EASI score at Week 32 of secukinumab treatment. 
8. The proportion of patients who achieve a score of “clear-0” or “almost clear-1” 
in the static IGA score at Week 32 as compared to Baseline. 
9. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline objective SCORAD at Week 52 of secukinumab treatment. 
10. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater 
from their Baseline objective EASI score at Week 52 of secukinumab 
treatment. 
11. The proportion of patients who achieve a score of “clear-0” or “almost clear-1” 
in the static IGA score at Week 52 as compared to Baseline. 
12. To determine the safety of secukinumab in the treatment of intrinsic and 
extrinsic AD. 
 
Secondary (Translational) Endpoints 
1. Change of IL-17 regulated keratinocyte products (elafin/Pi3, CCL20, CXCL1, 
S100A7, A8, A9, A12) at Week 16 of treatment (as compared with Baseline). 
This will be assessed by a reduction of the mRNA gene expression levels of 
elafin/Pi3, CCL20, CXCL1, S100A7, A8, A9, A12 after [ADDRESS_237559] of secukinumab therapy on suppression of immune 
driven inflammation, and related inflammatory cells (T-cells, dendritic cells 
(DCs), eosinophils), cytokines, and chemokines in lesional and non-lesional 
skin biopsies. Skin infiltration by T-cells (CD3, CD8), DCs (myeloid/CD11c, 
 6 IDECs/fcEpsilonRI, CD206, Langerhans cells/CD1a) will be assessed in pre- 
and post lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies after 16-weeks post first 
treatment with secukinumab by [CONTACT_9064].  
2. To determine what immune pathways are suppressed during treatment with 
secukinumab. Suppression of Th2, and Th22 immune pathways will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_199222]2 inflammatory cytokines (including IL-13, IL-31, IL-
10), and Th22/IL-22 cytokine and downstream response genes of IL-22 
(including S100A7, and A8 that are co regulated by [CONTACT_8668]-17 and IL-22). We will 
also assess for gene modulation during treatment of Th1 and Th17 
inflammatory cell markers (such as IFN-gamma, CXCL9, CXCL10/Th1, and IL-
17A, IL-17F, IL-23p19 IL-23p40, CCL20, CXCL1, Elafin/PI3/Th17). RT-PCR 
will be used to determine these markers. 
3. To determine the effect of treatment on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_199205]/terminal differentiation abnormalities.  
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_199206], K16, and 
Ki67 {by [CONTACT_4658], RT PCR (K16) and arrays}. Major differentiation genes such as 
loricrin, filaggrin, and periplakin will be measured before and after 16-week 
treatment with secukinumab on lesional and non-lesional AD skin by [CONTACT_4658] 
(filaggrin), RT-PCR (filaggrin, loricrin and periplakin), and gene array. 
4. In the group of patients that will respond to treatment by a reduction of at least 
50% in SCORAD (“responders”), as well as in the non-responders, we will 
evaluate the correlation between clinical response to therapy with 
secukinumab (as measured by [CONTACT_199223]) with suppression of the 
pathologic epi[INVESTIGATOR_199207]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_199208] K16. The immune phenotype will be measured by [CONTACT_199224]17/IL-17A, IL-23p40, IL-23p19, elafin/PI3, CXCL1, CXCL2), Th2/IL4 
and/IL-13, and “T22”/IL-22, S100A7, and S100A8. We will also correlate the 
reduction in epi[INVESTIGATOR_199209] a multivariate analysis.  
 
 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN 
This is a randomized, double-blind, pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a total of 44 subjects with AD (22 
with intrinsic and 22 with extrinsic AD) consisting of 2 phases. Subjects will be 
randomized (2:1) to either receive secukinumab [ADDRESS_237560] consultation 
for participation in this study.  
 
 7 Phase 1: 
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the 
Screening visit (day -28 to day -1). At the Screening visit the following procedures will 
be performed by [CONTACT_73486]:  
1. medical history and concomitant as well as prior medications/treatments will 
be reviewed 
2. physical examination will be performed (including vital signs) 
3. skin examination will be performed (including assessment of SCORAD, EASI, 
and IGA)  
4. electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed 
5. approximately 9 cc (approximately 2 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn for a 
chemistry panel (including renal function tests, electrolytes, liver function tests) 
and complete blood count (including MCV). 
6. approximately 6 cc (approximately 1 ¼ teaspoons) of blood will be drawn for a 
QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) assay; or subjects will undergo tuberculin 
purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) testing. 
7. HIV , hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C (HCV) 
antibody testing will be done in subjects deemed at risk. These include 
subjects with a history of injection drug use, homosexual subjects, and 
subjects with known sexual contact [CONTACT_199225].  
8. females of child bearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test performed. 
This test must be negative in order to qualify for the study.   
 
Subjects will be deemed eligible as per inclusion/exclusion criteria. Qualified subjects 
meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized at Day 0 by [CONTACT_199226] (designated drug dispenser) to either the 
secukinumab group or placebo group (within 28 days of signing the consent form). 
Female subjects of child-bearing potential will have [ADDRESS_237561] prior to randomization (only if the Screening visit was more than 7 
days prior to randomization).  
Assessments at this Baseline visit include skin examination, assessment of 
SCORAD, EASI and IGA scores, clinical photographs, bloods tests for chemistry and 
hematology (6 cc  - approximately 1 ¼ teaspoons), as well as for mechanistic 
studies , and two punch biopsies (4.5 mm in size) will be obtained from involved and 
uninvolved skin. 
Subjects with intrinsic AD (22 subjects) will be randomized (2:1) to either receive 
secukinumab (300 mg) or placebo via subcutaneous injection using 2 prefilled 
syringes at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter through and including 
Week 12. Subjects with extrinsic AD (22 subjects) will be randomized separately (2:1) 
to either receive secukinumab (300 mg) or placebo via subcutaneous injection using 
[ADDRESS_237562] administration, assessment of 
concomitant medications and adverse events. 
 
At Week 2, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events. 
 
At Week 3, subjects will return for study product administration, assessment of 
concomitant medications and adverse events. 
 
At Week 4, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, a urine pregnancy test (if applicable), laboratory tests for 
mechanistic studies, and one biopsy from involved skin only, close to the area that 
was biopsied at Baseline. 
 
At Week 8, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, a urine pregnancy test (if applicable), and clinical photography. 
 
At Week 12, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, and a urine pregnancy test (if applicable). 
 
Concomitant treatments prohibited prior to randomization and during the study are 
listed below. Subjects will be allowed to drop out of the study if they complete all 
required assessments and visits through and including Week 4. At Week 16, the 
primary endpoint will be assessed.  
 
 
Phase 2: 
At Week 16, all subjects will be eligible to enter into the second phase of the study, in 
which all subjects will receive secukinumab (300 mg). In order to maintain the initial 
blind, subjects who had been randomized to secukinumab in Phase 1 will continue to 
receive secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg SQ every 4 weeks  starting Week 16 until 
Week 52 (Weeks 16, 20 , 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48), however, they will also 
receive two saline injections at Weeks 17, 18, and 19, so that neither the subject nor 
the assessor knows if the subject had received secukinumab or placebo in phase 1. 
Subjects, who had been randomized to placebo in Phase 1, will receive secukinumab 
at a dose of 300 mg SQ at weeks 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 4 weeks 
until Week 48 (Weeks 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48). The final study visit will be at 
Week 52. 
 
At Week 16, subjects will undergo vital signs, skin assessment (including SCORAD, 
EASI, and IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant 
medications, adverse events, pregnancy test (if applicable), clinical photography, 
 [ADDRESS_237563] administration, assessment of 
concomitant medications and adverse events. 
At Week 18 , subjects will return for skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events. 
At Week [ADDRESS_237564] administration, assessment of 
concomitant medications and adverse events. 
 
At Week 20, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, and pregnancy test (if applicable). 
 
At Week 24 , subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, pregnancy test (if applicable), clinical photography, and bloods tests 
for chemistry and hematology. 
 
At Week 28 , subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, pregnancy test (if applicable ). 
 
At Week 32 , subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, pregnancy test (if applicable), and clinical photography. 
 
At Weeks  36, 40, and 44, subjects will undergo skin assessment (including 
SCORAD, EASI, and IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant 
medications and adverse events, and pregnancy test (if applicable). 
 
At Week 48 , subjects will undergo skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), study product administration, assessment of concomitant medications and 
adverse events, pregnancy test (if applicable), and laboratory tests for chemistry and 
hematology. 
 
At Week 52 , subjects will return for  skin assessment (including SCORAD, EASI, and 
IGA), assessment of concomitant medications and adverse events, clinical 
photography, blood tests for mechanistic studies, and one optional biopsy will be 
performed (in the vicinity of the involved areas biopsied at Baseline ). 
 
Adverse events and changes in concomitant medications will be assessed at each 
visit (through and including Week 52). 
 
We will recruit patients at the Dermatology department at MSSM.  Patients will be 
informed of the study when attending the Dermatology department, if they qualify for 
 [ADDRESS_237565] requested to be contact[CONTACT_7678], and they will be referred by 
[INVESTIGATOR_2993]-house residents and affiliated attendings 
In order to identify the molecular and cellular immune profile of AD at Baseline and 
identify treatment response biomarkers, we include blood analyses at Baseline, 
Week 4, 16 and Week 52, in addition to punch biopsies (4.5 – 5.0 mm in size) at 
Baseline (one from involved skin and one from uninvolved skin), at Week 4 (one 
biopsy from involved skin only, close to the area that was biopsied at Baseline ), at 
Week 16 (two biopsies, in the vicinity of the involved and uninvolved areas biopsied 
at baseline), and at Week 52, one optional biopsy will be performed (in the vicinity of 
the involved areas biopsied at Baseline) .  
Blood analyses of IL-17, IL-22 and IL-13 cytokines (by [CONTACT_85857]) and chemokines (by 
[CONTACT_19487]-a Th1, Th2 panel) will be performed at baseline, Week 4, Week 16, and Week 
52 or Early Termination visit. Gene expression studies (RT-PCR and gene arrays) 
and immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples will be conducted. The expression 
levels of markers in different immune pathways, including: Th1 (IFN-gamma, CXCL9, 
CXCL10, MX-1, STAT1), Th17 (IL-17, IL23p19, IL23p40, CCL20, CXCL1), Th2 (IL-
13, IL-5, IL-10, CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, CCL5), T22/IL-22 cytokine and IL-17/IL- 22 
regulated S100s genes (S100A7, A8), Th9/IL-9, and Treg/FOXP3 will be evaluated 
using RT-PCR. We will also assess for modulation of IL-17 regulated antimicrobial 
peptides (i.e LL-37, elafin, lipocalin 2, hBD2), inflammatory markers (i.e MMP12, 
S100A12), and innate immune genes (IL1b) by [CONTACT_937]-PCR. Additionally, skin infiltration 
by T-cells, DCs, eosinophils, mast cells, and neutrophils will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_9064]. The following markers will be used: CD3 and CD8 for T cells, 
Langerin for Langherans cells, CD11c for myeloid DCs, TRAIL for inflammatory DCs, 
CD83/DC-LAMP as markers of mature activated DCs, MBP to identify eosinophils, 
and neutrophil elastase to identify neutrophils. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_199210]. Finally, gene arrays, particularly the Affymetrix 
U133A Plus 2 gene array platform, will also be performed. This same platform is 
being used in our other studies involving lesional/affected and non-lesional/normal 
skin of AD patients.

12. Use of any investigational drug within four weeks or five PK or PD half lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to Baseline/Randomization (Visit 2).  
13. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_199212], topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726], or 
other topi[INVESTIGATOR_199213] 2 weeks 
prior to Baseline/Randomization (Visit 2).  
14. Serious concomitant illness that could require the use of systemic 
corticosteroids or otherwise interfere with the patient’s participation in the trial. 
 
15.  Clinically important deviation as judged by [CONTACT_093] (such as >3 times 
the norm for LFTs, or, WBC< 3) from normal limits in physical examination, 
vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), or clinical 
laboratory tests results, not associated with a chronic, well-controlled medical 
conditio n.  
 
 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
Determination of Sample Size 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and therefore the sample size has been kept relatively low. No 
formal analysis of statistical power for the primary endpoint of the trial lies behind this 
decision; however the consequence on precision of the parameter of interest is 
described in the following paragraph assuming the use of a 1-sided alpha of 0.05 in 
the Fisher’s exact test: 
The sample size estimation is driven by [CONTACT_53229], namely the epi[INVESTIGATOR_199214] 16. Prior studies with Cyclosporine [4, 5] show a 
reduction of [ADDRESS_237569] deviation will be considered for both 
groups. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 30:14 (Treatment/Placebo) will 
allow testing the hypothesis that the change in the Treatment group is different than 
the change in the Placebo group. This sample size will be able to detect an effect 
size equal to 1.35 with 96% power. For the subgroup analysis, based on IgE status, a 
 13 sample size of 15:7 in each subgroup (Intrinsic/Extrinsic) will allow to detect the same 
effect size with 80% power. 
 
Definition of Trial Analysis Sets 
All subjects enrolled in the trial (i.e. subjects for whom informed consent has been 
obtained and who have been registered in a clinical trial) will be accounted for in the 
clinical trial report. 
The inclusion/exclusion of subjects and/or subject data from the trial analysis sets will 
be documented in the statistical analysis plan before breaking the randomization 
code. 
 
Analysis Populations 
‘MODIFIED INTENTION- TO-TREAT’ ANALYSIS SET. The primary analysis 
population will be based on a modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population, which is 
defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the randomized 
treatment. Because the loading dose is given at baseline, this should effectively 
include all the randomized patients. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Random Allocation of Subjects 
A randomized block design will be perform ed to guarantee a 15:7 Treatment/Plac ebo 
proportion within the Intrinsic/Extrinsic AD subgroups. The IgE status will be 
considered as a blocking factor. This means that subjects will be random ly allocated 
to each treatment (Secukinumab/Placebo) with a proportion 15:[ADDRESS_237570] (LOCF) will be considered by [CONTACT_199227]. 
Demographics and other Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics will be 
presented for all subjects. Demographics include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and skin 
type. Other baseline characteristics include height, weight, and vital signs, duration of 
atopic dermatitis, concurrent diagnoses (from medical history and indications for 
concomitant medication), concomitant medication, previous atopic dermatitis 
treatments and IgE. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary objective is to study the efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of 
intrinsic atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_199228][INVESTIGATOR_199215] [ADDRESS_237571] model will be used to estimate the means for outcomes at Phase 1 
(Weeks 0-16). Observed measure at Week 4 will be considered in the model. Under 
the assumption of LOCF, a sensitivity analysis will be performed. A secondary 
analysis will be done, also including the outcomes at Phase 2 (Weeks 16- 32) for 
subjects randomized as Placebo at Phase 1. For this cohort, observed measure at 
Week 20 will be considered in the model. 
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
For K16, the same analysis as for epi[INVESTIGATOR_199216] . 
To compare secukinumab versus placebo according to the proportion of patients who 
achieve an improvement of 50% or greater from their baseline for SCORAD, EASI 
and IGA (“cl ear-0” or “almost clear-1”) at Week 16 a Fisher´s exact test for 
contingency tables analysis will be used. Additionally to Phase 1 data, the group who 
started with treatment at Week 16 in Phase 2 will be already included.  
For long term efficacy analysis of secukinumab, Phase 1 and Phase 2 data will be 
used to calculate Confidence Intervals at 95% significance level for to the proportion 
of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater from their baseline for 
SCORAD, EASI and IGA (“clear-0” or “almost clear-1”). 
Differences in change over time on SCORAD/EASI between treatment and placebo 
will be assess ed using a Mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) to detect 
any overall differences in the treatment effect as compared to placebo. Outcomes for 
Weeks [ADDRESS_237572] square means of the model above. For patients 
who prematurely discontinued the trial missing values will be considered. Sensitive 
analysis will be performed treating them as: (a) LOCF, (b) data as observed. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_199229]. The statistical evaluations 
will be organized by [CONTACT_199230] (Weeks 0-16 and 16- 32), and Post-Treatment 
Phase (long-term follow-up), as appropriate. AEs will be coded using the CTCAE, 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V 4.0. The number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by [CONTACT_70244], or a preferred term, and severity of the adverse event, and recorded and 
tabulated overall by [CONTACT_199231]-strata.  Each subject will be counted only once within a 
system organ class or a preferred term using the adverse events with the highest 
severity within each category. All information pertaining to adverse events noted 
during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim given by [CONTACT_093], 
preferred term, system organ class, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, and 
relationship to treatment. A tabulation of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), will be 
 [ADDRESS_237573] within treatment groups. The proportion of subjects in each 
treatment group reporting adverse events that occur in ~ 5% in either treatment 
group will be compared using the Fisher’s exact test. The specific system organ 
classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are reported by [CONTACT_199232]. 
 
Analysis of Secondary (Translational) Endpoints 
Outcomes for Weeks [ADDRESS_237574] for paired samples at 95% significance.  
 
Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Mixed-effect model will be used to assess the change on cell counts and RT-PCR-
derived expression levels after [ADDRESS_237575] 1 year. 
Side effects seen in studies with secukinumab that occurred in greater than 1% of 
subjects (greater than 1 in 100 patients) include nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], rhinitis, oral herpes, pharyngitis, urticaria, and rhinorrhea. 
Side effects seen in studies with secukinumab that occurred in less than 1% of 
subjects (less than 1 in 100 patients) include hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, 
sinusitis, tinea pedis, conjunctivitis, tonsillitis, skin or oral candidiasis, impetigo, otitis 
media, otitis externa, inflammatory bowel disease, increased liver transaminases and 
neutropenia, various infections, worsening of Crohn’s disease. Live vaccines should 
be avoided during treatment with secukinumab.

SAFETY MONITORING 
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with our department’s Standard Operating 
Procedures, which are based on US FDA Title [ADDRESS_237576]’s safety is compromised, the investigator will discontinue the subject 
immediately.   
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_199217] [ADDRESS_237577] certified 
de
rmatologists who are not directly related to this study. The DSMB will review the 
data and provide a report of their findings to the Principal Investigator.  
 
  
Pharmacovigilance requirements: 
 
Definition of an AE:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational medicinal product. 
=Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) includes the drug under evaluation and the 
comparator drug(s) if specified as part of the research objective, given at any time 
during the study. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the drug of 
interest are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the drug of 
interest. 
The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when 
they are volunteered by [CONTACT_121966], laboratory test, or other assessments. All adverse events will be 
recorded in the study database including the following information: 
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
2. its relationship to the drug(s) of interest (suspected/not suspected) 
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
- results in death, 
- is life-threatening, 
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
- is otherwise a significant medical event. 
 17 This includes any SAEs likely to arise from the trial indication or progression of 
underlying/concomitant illness (es) (e.g. progression of cancer in oncology trials), 
unless specified in the protocol as study specific exemptions. 
Any SAE, irrespective of causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed 
consent and until four weeks after the subject has stopped study participation must 
be reported unless otherwise stated in the protocol. SAEs occurring after four weeks 
from ending study participation should only be reported if considered by [CONTACT_199233](s) during the trial 
period. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the 
standard medical treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet 
started (e.g. withdrawal of previous treatment during washout period, change in 
treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication). 
 
Timelines: All serious adverse events (SAEs) from interventional clinical trials must 
be reported by [CONTACT_199234] [ADDRESS_237578] 
Party Study/Investigator Initiated Trial Agreement.   
 
 
Follow-up reports :  
SAEs will be followed until resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and an 
assessment will be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the drug of interest, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
The Sponsor shall support [COMPANY_001] in the following-up of all SAEs so that complete 
information is available to maintain patient safety and also as part of any 
commitments by [CONTACT_24482]-
up requests for the product under investigation. 
 
Pregnancies:  Any occurrences of a pregnancy in a patient (or a patients partner) 
during study participation will be collected. All pregnancies will be followed up to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or 
maternal and/or newborn complications. 
 
All other AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_199218].  
Should a temporary or permanent suspension occur, we would report the occurrence 
to all appropriate authorities. 
 
 
EARLY TERMINATION 
 
Any individual whose health or well being may be threatened by [CONTACT_199235].  
 
 [ADDRESS_237579] some or all of the 
following procedures: a blood test ; pregnancy test; skin photography; skin evaluation 
including SCORAD, EASI, and IGA; and biopsy.  
 
 
INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG SUPPLY 
 
In this double-blind study, the investigator will supply secukinumab 300 mg (two 
injections of 150 mg each) for up to 44 subjects and placebo (comprised of silica and/or 
cellulose) for up to 15 subjects. The secukinumab and placebo will be provided by 
[CONTACT_199236] 150 mg secukinumab (and matching placebo) pre-filled syringes. Both the 
150 mg secukinumab and the matching placebo pre-filled syringes will be of the same 
quality and identical in size and shape.  
All study medication will be stored in a secure cool area between 2-80C (under 
refrigeration).  Study drug will be administered to subjects at each visit, and any unused 
study drug will be kept at the study site. The number of missed doses will be 
documented for each subject.  The investigative site will account for all study drug 
dispensed and stored during the study.

 20 APPENDIX 2: 
  
SCORAD Index (6): The most widely accepted clinical assessment tool for AD 
disease severity index is known as SCORAD (SCORing for Atopic Dermatitis). This 
tool combines clinical features of AD such as erythema, dryness, lichenification, 
percent body surface area, as well as quality of life issues such as pruritus and loss 
of sleep due to disease.  
To measure the extent of AD, the rule of nines is applied on a front⁄back drawing of 
the patient’s inflammatory lesions. The extent can be graded 0–100. The intensity 
part of the SCORAD index consists of six items: erythema, edema⁄papulation, 
excoriations, lichenification, oozing⁄crusts and dryness. Each item can be graded on 
a scale 0–3. The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness. Both 
subjective items can be graded on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. The maximum 
subjective score is 20. All items should be filled out in the SCORAD evaluation form. 
The SCORAD index formula is: A ⁄5 + 7B ⁄2 + C. In this formula A is defined as the 
extent (0–100), B is defined as the intensity (0–18) and C is defined as the subjective 
symptoms (0–20). The maximum SCORAD score is 103.  
EASI score(7): The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a validated tool to 
objectively assess dermatitis severity incorporating surface area involvement. It was 
designed by [CONTACT_199237] (psoriasis area and 
severity index) scoring system, which has been utilized effectively in the assessment 
of psoriasis. The EASI index assigns proportionate values to 4 body regions (head 
and neck, 10%; trunk, 30%; upper limbs, 20%; lower limbs, 40%. Each region is 
assessed separately for erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation, and 
lichenification. The average clinical severity of each sign in each of the 4 body 
regions is assigned a score of 0 to 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, and severe 
expression. This percentage of area involved for each of the four body regions is 
assigned a proportional score from 0 to 6 during the analysis: 0=no eruption; 1=10%; 
2=10%–29%; 3=30%–49%; 4=50%–69%; 5=70%–89%; and 6=90%–100%. The 
buttocks and feet are counted as part of the lower extremities; the internal axillae and 
groin are counted as part of the trunk; and 3) the external axillae and hands are 
counted as part of the upper extremities. The total body score for each body region is 
obtained by [CONTACT_199238], then multiplying the result by [CONTACT_199239]. The sum of these scores gives the EASI total, which ranges from 0 
to a maximum 72.  
IGA index (8): a static IGA (Investigator’s Global Assessment) score is widely used as 
a primary efficacy point of treatment success in many studies of dermatological 
diseases including AD. The static IGA score represents an overall static evaluation of 
dermatitis, performed by [CONTACT_192675]. It utilizes a scale of 6-points, 
ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease), with 0-clear, 1-almost clear, 2- mild 
disease, 3-moderate disease, 4-severe disease, and 5-very severe disease. IGA 
scores measure disease severity based on morphology, without referring back to the 
baseline state.

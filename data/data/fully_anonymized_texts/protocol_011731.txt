Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
phase 3 trial to investigate the safety  and efficacy  of mesalamine 4 g extended release granules 
(sachet) for the induction of clinical and endoscopic remission in subjects with active, mild to 
moderate active UC . Following completion of Visit 0/ screening, the subjects will be randomized to 
a treatment group during Visit
1/baseline . Each subject will receive a total of 8 weeks of double-
blind treatment w ith either:
one mesalamine 4 g extended release granules (sachet) QD (4 g/day ) OR
one 4 g placebo sachet to match mesalamine extended release granules (sachet)
Dose will be administered QD at least [ADDRESS_958571] 8 ounces (240 mL )of water. Following randomization, the first dose of investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) will be administered at the site during Visit 1.
Subjects will visit the 
trial site 4 times during the double -blind part of trial for safet y and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 8. On a daily  basis, subjects will record clinical 
symptoms (stool frequency and rectal ble eding) in an electronic diary . The Clinical and Endoscopic 
Response Score assessments and PGA will be performed at screening/ baseline and Week 8. After [ADDRESS_958572] s who discontinue during the double
-blind treatment before Week 8 will complete the 
double -blind end-of- treatment assessments and will be treated via investigator’s decision with local 
standard of care , see Section 6.2.4.
Subjects who are found to be worse 
defined by  [CONTACT_705433] [BM], 
blood in the stool , abdominal pain and distention, or clinically relevant changes in laboratory 
chemistry  and/or hematology on or after Week [ADDRESS_958573] of care. Subjects who complete Week 8 but fail to 
meet the defined criteria for remission will be given an option to receive open- label treatment with 
mesalamine 4 g extended release granules (sachet) for [ADDRESS_958574]’s eligibility  for entry  into 
the maintenance trial.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMEDICINAL PRODUCTS
The IMP for the trial will be mesalamine 4 g extended release granules (sachet) and placebo, which 
will be identical in appearance.
DURATION OF TREATMENT
The duration of treatment for each subject will be 8 weeks . Subjects who complete Week 8 but fail 
to meet the defined criteria for remission will be given the option of an additional 8 weeks of 
treatment with open -label mesalamine (4 g/day ).
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample size : The true remission rates at Week 8 for mesalamine 4 g extended release granules 
(sachet) and placebo regimens were assume d as 36% and 18%, respectively , based on Kamm 
(2007), (3)Lichtenstein (2007), (4)and Marteau (2005) .(5) Under these assumptions, a sample size 
of [ADDRESS_958577] 85% power to detect a statisticall y 
significant treatment group difference in the remission rate at a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_958578]. 
Efficacy: The primary  efficacy  anal ysis will be based on all randomized subjects (ITT; intent -to-
treat). The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieved remission, 
defined as rectal bleeding score of [ADDRESS_958579] 1 point 
decrease from baseline, with an endoscopic score of 0 or 1 ,in Clinical andEndoscopic Response 
Score at Week 8.
The treatment group difference in the proportion of subjects with 
remission at Week 8 will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_219181] -square testat a two-sided 0.05 significance level. Subjects who discontinue the 
double -
blind regimen before Week 8, as well as subjects with missing remission assessment at 
Week 8, will be considered not having achieved remission . The odds rati o will be estimated and its 
95% confidence interval will be provided.
The key  secondary  endpoints will be analy zed by a fixed -sequence procedure according to the 
pre-specified order to maintain the overall Ty pe 1 error rate to a two -sided 5%.  
If the primary  efficacy  analy sis demonstrates a statistically  significant difference between the 
treatment groups, the proportion of subjects with remission in the primary  endpoint and the PGA 
score of <1 (Modified May o) will be compared using the same sta tistical method used for the 
primary  efficacy  anal ysis. If the analysis for the first key secondary  endpoint is statistically  
significant, time to cessation of rectal bleeding, defined as time in day s from randomization to the 
first day of 3 consecutive da ys with a rectal bleeding score of 0 (i.e., the second key  secondary  
endpoint), will be compared b y thelog-rank test at a two-sided 0.05 significance level. 
Other secondary  endpoints will be analy zed individually at a two -sided 0.05 significance level.  
The efficacy  data captured during the 8 -week open -label 
mesalamine 4 g/day  treatment will be used 
for exploratory  purposes only .

Safety : The safet y anal yses will be based on all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_958580] current 
version of the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA). A treatment-emergent 
adverse event will be defined as an y adverse event occurring af ter the start of IMP or pre -existing 
medical condition that worsens in intensity  after the start of IMP.
Clinical laboratory  variables will be presented in [ADDRESS_958581] dose of IMP. Second, the number and percentage of subjects with 
treatment -emergent potentially  clinically significant laboratory values on or before the end of the 
double -blind treatm ent visit will be tabulated. 
Other safety  assessments will also be summarized descriptivel y. 
Similar safety  data summaries will be made for the open-label treatment period data.

1.1 Background
Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory  bowel disease, is a chronic condition of unknown origin. 
Ulcerative colitis is a relapsing and remitting disease characterized by  [CONTACT_705436] -infectious 
inflammation of the colorectal mucosa. (6)In the [LOCATION_002] ( US), about 1 million people are 
affected with UC. (7,8)The annual incidence of UC per 100,000 people is 10.4 to 12cases in the 
US and 8 cases in Europe . The prevalence rate per 100,000 people is 35 to 100 cases in the US and 
21 to 243 in Europe. UC is slightly  more common in women than in men. Although the disease can 
occur at an y age, the a ge of onset follows a bimodal pattern, with a peak at 15 to 25 years and a

frequentl y accompanied by  [CONTACT_705437] s. (10)In the most severe forms, sy stemic signs 
comprising fever, anorexia, and weight loss may  occur. 
Approximately  60% of patients have a mild 
form, 25% a moderate form, and 15% a severe disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], it is estimated that 
approximately  1 of every 2 patients with UC will experience a relapse within 1 y ear;the cumulative 
probability  of relapse is 80% within 2 y ears and 95% within 10 y ears. (11)
Involvement of the rectal mucosa is a constant feature while the inflammation spreads to higher 
lev
els in continuous and retrograde fashion, with no sparing of mucosa from the anorectal junction. 
Hence, UC may  be divided in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left -sided colitis (the proximal limit 
being below the splenic flexure), extensive colitis (involving the transverse colon), andpancolitis
(involving the entire colon) .
The aim of the treatment of active mild- to-moderate UC is theinduc tion of remission and 
maintenance of remission , and the prevention of complication of long -term UC . 
Several therapeutic drug classes are used in UC: 5- aminosalicy lic acid ( 5-ASA )derivatives, 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants , and anti -tumor necrosis factor -αagents. At present, 
aminosalicy late derivatives are the main and first-line therapy  for mild to moderate epi[INVESTIGATOR_705423].( 12)Rectal administration of salicy late-type drugs constitutes the 
treatment of choice in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and left
-sided UC.( 13,14,15) The extended
release mesalamine granules are purposed to treat all forms of active mild -to-moderate UC in all 
segments of the colon.
Ferring recently  developed a prolonged release granule formulation with a high drug load (95% 
load) to provide a better alternative for patients that have difficulty  swallowing the tablet or capsule 
forms, and thereb y may 
help increase treatment compliance.  The safet y and tolerability of various 
mesalamine dosing regimens have been demonstrated
. (5,16)The optimum dose of oral 
mesalamine for inductio n therapy  in order to achieve remission is between 2 and 4 g/day . (17)

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
The mesalamine 4 g extended release granules ( sachet) isapproved in 19 countries worldwide for 
treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. The granules are packaged in a foil laminate 
pouch (sachet) . The 4 g once -daily (QD) dosing regimen was first approved in The Netherlands in 
2012.
This dosage form was developed as a true QD regimen to provide an alternative for patient s who 
have difficult y swallowing the tablets or large capsules forms. There are no sachet granular forms 
available for both induction and maintenance of remission. The availability  of this easier -to-take 
formulation might potentially  help increase compliance, and would be an overall useful tool in the 
care of these suffering patients.
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects
The 95% granules allow for a true once a day  convenient dosing with the highest unit dosage form 
available for induction and maintenance of UC . In add
ition the granules are easier to swallow than 
the tablets and capsules currentl y available in the US .
The most common adverse events ( AEs) considered related to treatment with mesalamine 
formulations up to [ADDRESS_958595] of care. Notably , all previous 5- ASA registration trials leading to an approval in the 
US utilized a placebo -controlled design.

3.1 Overall Trial Design
3.1.1 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
phase 3 trial to investi gate the safety  and efficacy  ofmesalamine 4 g extended release granules 
(sachet) for the induction of clinical and endoscopic remission in subjects with active, mild to 
moderate UC. Following completion of Visit 0/screening, the subjects will be randomized to 1 of
2
treatment group sduring Visit 1/baseline. Each subject will receive a total of 8 weeks of double-
blind treatment with either:
one mesalamine 4 g extended release granules (sachet) QD (4 g/day ) OR
one 4 g placebo sachet to match mesalamine extended relea se granules (sachet)
Doses will be administered QD at least [ADDRESS_958599] 8 ounces (240 mL ) of water. Following randomization, the first dose of investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) will be administered at the site during Visit 1.
Subjects will visit the trial site 4 times during the double -blind part of trial for safet y and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline and We eks 2, 4, and 8. On a daily  basis, subjects will record clinical 
symptoms (stool frequency  and rectal bleeding) in an electronic diary . The Clinical and Endoscopic 
Response Score assessments and PGA will be performed at screening/ baseline and Week 8. After [ADDRESS_958600] only 
a Clinical Response Score assessment at Weeks 2 and4.
If subjects discontinue the double
-blind treatment before Week 8, the subjects will complete the 
double -blind end-of- treatment assessments and will be treated via investigator’s decision with local 
standard of care. 
Subjects who are found to be worse ,defined by  [CONTACT_705433] 
(BM), 
blood in the stool, abdominal pain and distention, or clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  
chemistry  and/or hematology  on or after Week [ADDRESS_958601] of care. Subjects who complete Week 8 but fail to 
meet the defined criteria for remission will be given an option to receive open -label treatment with 
mesalamine 4 g extended release granules (sachet) for [ADDRESS_958602] of care. If subjects opt to receive the additional 8 -week open -label mesalamine
treatment, they  will continue with daily  diary  entries and visit the trial site at 10 and 16 weeks, with 
only a Clinical Response Score assessment at Week 10, and a Clinical and Endoscopic Response

As the emergency  permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed upon by  [CONTACT_2183] . It should be recorded in the eCRF that the code is broken and why , when, and by  [CONTACT_20898]. 
The investigator must record the event of unblinding in the subject’s medical record, including the 
reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation, if this can be avoided. 
In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency  unblinding must be 
obtained, and the event must also be recorded in the subject’s medical record.
It may  be necessary  to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for t he purposes of expedited 
reporting to the authorities and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) ( IEC) (s)/Institutional Review 
Board(s) ( IRB) (s). In that situation, every  effort will be made to maintain blinding of sponsor 
personnel involved in data anal ysisand interpretation. Other personnel may be unblinded for

7.1 Assessments Related to Endpoints
7.1.1 Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score and Physician’s Global Assessment
The Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score will be determined, as shown in Table 2.
The Modified May o score will be calculated as the sum of the Clinical and Endoscopic Response 
Scores (Table 2)and the PGA score (Table 3). 
The Endoscopic R esponse S core will be determined by  [CONTACT_705444] y/colonoscop yas scored 
by [CONTACT_64741] c entral reader ( Section 7.1.2).
The scores on stool frequency  and rectal bleeding will be obtained from the subject 
electronic daily  
diary , with the exception of screening which will be based on subject recall (Section 7.1.3). 
The Modified May o score will be calculated by  [CONTACT_45010]/randomization, and at

7.1.2 Flexible Sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy
In order to obtain the endoscopic response score (Table 2), the objective evidence of inflammation in 
thistrial, flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy will be performed accord ing to a standardized manner 
during screening (no more than [ADDRESS_958628] 4 day s prior to randomization to allow sufficient 
time for the central reading ), the end of double -blind treatment (Week 8 or early withdrawal), and at 
the end of open -label treatment. Flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy will be video recorded and 
transferred to the independent central reader. The details of the tools, recording, data transfer, and 
assessment will be documented in an imaging charter. Findings will be graded on a 4 -point scale 
(Table 2
), with 0 = normal or inactive disease, 1 = mild disease (ery thema, decreased vascular pattern, 
granularit y), 2 = moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, an y friabilit y, erosions), 
and 3 = severe disease ( spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). Theflexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscop y
recording during screening will be sent to the 
independent central reader for final determination of 
eligibility , regardless of the local site’s score. A flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy will also be 
performed at Weeks 8 and 16 as applicable. These recordings will also 
be sent to the independent 
central reader for endoscopic endpoint scoring. A colonoscopy  will be required to establish the extent 
of disease i f the flexible sigmoidoscopy  is not conclusive in establishing the upper border of UC 
involvement .Extent of colitis will be documented as proctosigmoiditis, left -sided colitis, or extended 
colitis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Central Endoscopy Laboratory
All flexible sigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_705424] (if required), will be performed ina standardized 
manner . The endoscop y completed during screening ( no more than [ADDRESS_958629] 4 days prior to 
randomization to allow sufficient time for the central reading ), at Week 8 ( end of double -blind 
treatment/earl y withdrawal ), and Week 16 (end of open- label treatment/early  withdrawal ) will be sent 
to the independent central reader selected b y the sponsor . The screening result will be used to qualify 
the image for use in randomization. I mage handling and instructions will be provided to all sites 
directly  from the independent central laboratory . 
The endoscopic qualify ing score will be automatically  uploaded to the eCRF. 
Trial sites will be provided with endoscopic lab oratory recording equipment, supplies ,and manuals.

of the double -blind treatment period and at Visit 8 (Week 16) of the open -label treatment period.
7.1.5 Health -Related Quality of Life /Collection Pad
The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality  of life in adult patients with inflammatory  bowel 
disease , UC , or Crohn’s disease and has demonstrated reliability  and validity  in discriminating between 
patients in clinical remission or relapse . (18) Subjects will be asked to recall symptoms and quality  of 
life from the last 2 weeks and to rate each item on a 7
-point L ikert scale (higher scores equate to higher 
quality  of life). Subjects will complete the IBDQ questionnaire (see Appendix 1 ) via a validated 
collection pad, prior to all other trial-related procedures at the site atVisit 2 ( Week 2 ), Visit 3 ( Week 
4), and Visit 5 ( Week 8)(or early  withdraw al)during the double- blind treatment period ,and at Visit s 6 
(Week 10) and 8 (Week 16) during the open -label treatment period (after randomization but before 
IMP administration) .  At Visit 1, subjects must first be randomized before completion of the IBDQ.
7.1.6 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected as described in Section 8of this protocol.
Laboratory  abnormalities may  be reported as AEs based on the discretion of the investigator, i.e., 
laboratory  abnormalities that the investigator assesses as a clinicall y significant . 
Physical examination and vital sign abnormalities will be reported as AEs if the investigator considers 
any abnormalit yclinically  significant.

Each of the items in the AElog is described in detail in the following se ctions.
Adverse Event s
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AEmore than once and the subject r ecovers between the events, the 
AEs should be recorded separately . If an AEchanges in intensit y, a worst -case approach should be 
used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity  and the longest duration of the event.a
A procedure is not an AE; the reason for conducting the procedure is. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705425]; the 
reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270588]. Death is not an AE, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death 
of unknown cause, which is an AE).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted. If the AEis an 
abnormal clinicall y significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the date 
the sample was taken or the examination was perfor med.

this must be recorded as 2 separate events. The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not yet recovered” 
and the date and time of outcom e are when the intensity changed. The second AE should be recorded w ith date and 
time of onset when the intensity changed.

Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the 
AEmust be classified as 1of the following:
Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship be tween 
the IMP and the AE . The AEmay occur as part of the pharmacological 
action of the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strong ly associated with 
IMP exposure
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the 
event occurs in association with other factors strongl y suggesting 
causation, such as a strong temporal association or the event recurs 
on rechallenge
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
known consequences of the underl ying disease o r condition under 
investigation
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to 
occur with some frequency  during the course of the trial, regardless 
of IMP exposure
Action Taken with IMP

Serious AE s are defined as follows:
An event is defined a serious adverse 
event if it:Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_958640] always be exercised and ,when 
in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. ,if case fulfils the criterion for 
a medically important event). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705426] s. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations 
planned before trial inclusion are not considered AEs, if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject w as enrolled in the trial, provided that the condition did 
not deteriorate during the trial.

disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical 
judgm entby [CONTACT_093].

conceived during treatment with the IMP.
is an important m edical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705427] 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of important medical events include AEs that suggest a significant 
hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of malignancy ,or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment
should be exercised in deciding whether even ts qualify as medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious 
agent via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g. ,
prion protein transmitting transm issible spongiform encephalopat hy), pathogenic 
or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an 
infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings 
indicating an infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal product.

9.3 Protocol Deviations
The following protocol deviations will be identified as major protocol deviations:
Overall IMP compliance of less than 80%
Not taking the randomized I MP
Taking prohibited medication s
The final definition of major and minor protocol violations will be determined prior to breaking the

requirements, maintenance of trial- related source records, completeness, accuracy  and verifiability  of 
eCRF entries compared to source data, verification of drug accountability ,and compliance with safety  
reporting instructions. 
The investigator will permit the monitor direct access to all source data, including electronic medical 
records, and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification. The investigator will cooperate with 
the monitor to ensure t hat any  discrepancies that may  be identified are resolved. The investigator is 
expected to meet the monitor during these visits. 
When the first subject is randomized at the trial site, a monitoring visit will take place shortly  
thereafter . For this trial, the frequency  of the interim monitoring visits will be determined by  [CONTACT_705451] .
11.2 Audit and Inspection
The investigator will make all the trial -related source data and records available at any time to qu ality 
assurance auditor(s) mandated b y Ferring or to domestic/foreign regulatory inspectors or 
representatives from IEC (s)/IRB(s)who may  audit/inspect the trial. The main purposes of an audit or 
inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the principles of ICH -GCP ,including 
the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations.
The subjects must be informed by  [CONTACT_705452] m regulatory  authorities and IEC(s) /IRB(s)
may wish to inspect their medical records. During audits/inspections , the auditors/inspectors may  copy  
relevant parts of the medical records. No personal identification other than the screening/ randomization

 1.0     PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
This is a two arm phase  II trial to assess  the progression -free and overall  survival  as well as the 
safety  and efficacy  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  using  a  preparative  
regimen  with busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine,  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  (ATG),  and a T cell 
depleted  stem  cell transplant  from a histocompatible  related  or unrelated  donor  in patients  with 
relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  The administration  of calculated  doses  of donor  
lymphocyte  infusions  post transplantation  is designed  to decrease  the rate of relapse  or to induce  
complete  remissions  in patients  with residual  disease  following  the allogeneic  transplant.  
Candidates  for this trial will include  patients  with multiple  myeloma  with relapsed  disease  following  
autologous  stem  cell transplantation  who achieved  at least a partial  response  (PR) following  prior 
chemotherapy  (cohort  1) and patients  with high-risk cytogenetics  at diagnosis  achieving  at least a 
very good  partial  response  (VGPR)  following  prior autologous  stem  cell transplantation  (cohort  2). 
Patients  with plasma  cell leukemia  or patients  achieving  less than PR/VGPR  are not eligible  for 
this trial. Hematopoietic  stem  cell donors  for this trial will include  individuals  who are 10/10  HLA 
matched  or one antigen  or allele  mismatched  at the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1  or DQB1  locus,  as 
defined  by [CONTACT_120139].  Donors  who are 8/10 HLA matched  with an antigen  or allele  
mismatched  at HLA-DQB1  and at one other  locus  will also be eligible  for the trial. All patients  will 
be conditioned  for transplantation  with busulfan  (Busulfex®) (0.8 mg/Kg/dose  Q6H x 10 doses),  
melphalan  (70 mg/m2/day x 2 doses)  and fludarabine  (25mg/m2/day x 5 doses).   Doses   of 
busulfan  and melphalan  will be adjusted  according  to ideal body weight,  busulfan  will be adjusted  
according  to first dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  and doses  of fludarabine  will be adjusted  
according  to measured  creatinine  clearance.  Patients  will also receive  ATG (Thymoglobulin®) 
prior to transplant  to promote  engraftment  and to prevent  graft-versus  host disease  post 
transplantation.  The preferred  source  of stem  cells will be peripheral  blood  stem  cells (PBSC)  
mobilized  by [CONTACT_120140] G-CSF for 5-6 days.  PBSC  will be isolated,  and T-cells 
depleted  by [CONTACT_120141]34+  progenitor  cells,  using  the CliniMACS  Cell Selection  
System.  The CD34+ T-cell depleted  peripheral  blood  progenitors  will then be administered  to the 
patients  after they have completed  cytoreduction.  If the use of CD34+ PBSC  is not possible,  the 
alternative  graft will consist  of bone  marrow  derived  stem  cells T-cell depleted  by [CONTACT_398]34  selection  
of bone  marrow  using  the Milteni  CliniMACS  device.  This system  has recently  been  validated  and 
implemented  for T-cell depletion  of bone  marrow,  and will replace  the Lectin/SRBC  T-cell 
depletion  procedure.  No drug prophylaxis  against  GvHD  will be administered  post transplant.  All 
patients  will also receive  G-CSF post-transplant  to foster  engraftment.  Patients  will also receive  
donor  lymphocyte  infusions  following  transplantation  derived  from the same  hematopoietic  stem  
cell donor.  Donor  lymphocytes  will be administered  prophylactically  at calculated  doses  of 5x105 
CD3+  cells/kg  4-6 months  and a second  dose  5x105  CD3+ cells/kg  3-[ADDRESS_134162] infusion  of 1x106 CD3+ cells/kg  can be administered  2-[ADDRESS_134163] disease.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]-mismatched  allografts  will be infused  
with donor  lymphocytes  preemptively  at disease  relapse  or progression  of disease,  if no complete  
remission  was obtained  following  the transplant.  These  patients  will then receive  1x105 CD3+ 
cells/kg  at diagnosis  of relapse  or progression,  but no sooner  than 4-[ADDRESS_134164] 
transplantation.  A second  infusion  of 5x105 CD3+ cells/kg  will be administered   1-[ADDRESS_134165]

2. To assess  the incidence  of and severity  of acute  and chronic  GvHD.  
3. To compute  the current  multiple  myeloma  free survival  curve  in order  to account  for 
patients  who relapse  and are restored  to remission  through  DLI. 
4.  To explore  the associations  between  progression  free survival  and the CT antigens  - 
CT7, CT10, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1. 
 
3.0     BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1. Advanced  Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Multiple  Myeloma  (MM)  is a malignant  disease  of plasma  cells that accumulate  in bone  marrow,  
leading  to bone  destruction  and bone  marrow  failure  1-2. The disease  accounts  for approximately  
10% of all hematologic  malignancies,  with an estimated  20,000  new MM diagnoses  in 2007,  and 
about  11,000  projected  to die of the disease  this year.  The median  survival  of patients  with high-

risk myeloma  is <2–3 years  compared  with a median  survival  of 6–[ADDRESS_134169] -risk and high-risk myeloma  patients  in order  to estimate  median  survival  and justify  
treatment  approaches.  High-risk prognostic  factors  can be determined  by [CONTACT_120142]  13, deletion  17p, and immunoglobulin -heavy  chain  translocations  t (4; 14) or t (14; 
16). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120106],  bortezomib,  and 
lenalidomide,  patients  with high-risk myeloma  continue  to do poorly,  even with tandem  autologous  
bone  marrow  transplantation.2-[ADDRESS_134170] demonstrated  a median  
progression -free survival  of only 7-8 months  in patients  with high-risk cytogenetics  after high-dose  
therapy  and autologous  stem  cell transplantation.4-6 This translates  into progression -free survival  of 
35% at one year of this patient  cohort.  
 
3.2. Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Conventional  treatments  with chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy  for patients  with 
multiple  myeloma  (MM)  are non-curative  but improve  quality  of life and duration  of survival.  High- 
dose  chemotherapy  with autologous   transplantation   is  safe and has  low TRM  (< 5%),  but  is 
associated  with a continuing  and nearly  universal  risk of disease  progression  and relapse.  Even  
so, autologous  transplantation  is superior  to continued  conventional  chemotherapy.7 Although  
recent  data indicate  that tandem  autologous  transplants  are superior  to a single  procedure,8 even 
with this approach,  patients  remain  at risk of relapse  and additional  approaches  are needed.  
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is currently  the only curative  
treatment  available  for patients  with multiple  myeloma.  However,  at this time,  allogeneic  
hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantations  are not standard  of care for multiple  myeloma  patients  as 
the success  rate in these  patients  has been  compromised  by a high incidence  of transplant - 
related  mortality  and high incidence  of acute  and/or  chronic  graft-versus - host disease  (GvHD).9-[ADDRESS_134171] disease.  
 
3.2.1.  Autologous  Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Barlogie  et al11- 13 demonstrated  that the toxicity  of high-dose  melphalan  could  be 
decreased  by [CONTACT_120143]-dose  therapy  using  autologous  stem  cell 
support.  With autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell support  following  high-dose  melphalan,   the 
toxic death  rate was less than 3% in most  studies14-15. At a dose  of 200 mg/m2, high response  
rates  in both untreated  and previously  treated  patients  are reported.16-21 In addition,  recent  data 
indicate  melphalan  200 mg/m2 is less toxic but equally  effective  as  melphalan   with  TBI.22- 23 
Barlogie  et al also demonstrated  the feasibility  of tandem  autologous  PBSC  transplants  using  
melphalan  200 mg/m2 for the first transplant  and melphalan  200 mg/m2 (79 patients)  or melphalan  
140 mg/m2 plus TBI (1,125  cGy) (10 patients)  for the second  transplant.  Of 123 patients,  87% 
completed  one autologous  transplant  and 76% completed  a tandem  second  autologous  
transplantation  by 7.5 and 13 months,  respectively,  with a median  interval  between  autologous  
transplantations  of 4.5 months.  The group  reported  40% CR to tandem  transplants  and a median  
event -free survival  of 49 months,  based  on intent  to treat analysis  in this single  center  experience.  
For responding  patients,  high-dose  therapy  followed  by [CONTACT_120144],  leading   to  the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_134172]-transplantation  for the group  that 
received  tandem  autologous  transplants  compared  to those  receiving  single  transplants.   Overall  
the median  event  free survival  was 31 versus  37 months,  6-year event  free survival  was 19% 
versus  28% and 6-year overall  survival  26% versus  46% for single  versus  tandem  transplants,  
respectively.  While  TRM  rates  observed  in these  studies  are low, patients  continued  to remain  at 
risk for disease  relapse  and progression,  with only a minority  of patients  remaining  disease  free at 
six years.  Importantly,  when  Rajkumar  et al assessed  progression -free and overall  survival  based  
on risk category  of standard  versus  high-risk patients,  progression -free and overall  survival  were  
only [ADDRESS_134173]  had a progression -free and overall  survival  of 
only 12 months  and 23 months,  respectively.2, 7 
 
3.2.2.  Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is currently  the only curative  treatment  
available  for patients  with multiple  myeloma.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120107]-versus - 
tumor  immune  responses  and a tumor  free source  of stem  cells,  conventional  high-dose  
conditioning  with allogeneic  bone  marrow  or PBSC  transplantation,  the success  rate in these  
patients  has been  compromised  by a high incidence  of transplant -related  mortality  and high 
incidence    of   acute    and/or    chronic    graft-versus -   host   disease    (GvHD)    and   associated  
complications  with transplant -related  mortalities  (TRM)  exceeding  40%.9-[ADDRESS_134174]  group  of myeloma  patients  treated   with  allogeneic   bone   marrow  
transplantation,  reported  by [CONTACT_120145], 9-10 included  162 patients  treated  in  35  different  
European  centers  from 1983  to 1993.  Early  toxicity  was high with an approximate  40% mortality  
within  the first six months.  Bensinger  et al7 reported  on [ADDRESS_134175]  refractory  disease  at the 
time of transplant.  TRM was high, with 42% deaths  within  the first [ADDRESS_134176]  
to the advanced  age profile  of MM patients  at diagnosis.  In the experience  at Fred Hutchinson  
Cancer  Research  Center  (FHCRC),  Day 100 TRM  after conventional  allografting  exceeded  50% 
in patients  ≥ [ADDRESS_134177],  a Phase  II study  using  a two-step approach  where  high-dose  melphalan  
and autologous  stem  cell transplantation  was followed  by a non-myeloablative  alloge neic 
transplant  showed  that donor  engraftment  can be established  with a conditioning  regiment  of low 
dose  total body  irradiation  (TBI)  (200 cGy),  cyclosporine  (CSA)  and mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  
combined  with peripheral  blood  stem  cell (PBSC)  allografting.  This study  demonstrated  that 
allografting  can be safely  and effectively  performed  if the high-dose  regimen  is administered  
separate   from  the  allografting   procedure.     In  this  study,   approximately   60%  of  the  patients

achieved  complete  remission  (CR)  with an overall -survival  of approximately  85% at one year.  26 
One of the objectives  of the study  to reduce  TRM  at three  months  to < 20%,  was achieved,  as 
only 13% of patients  experienced  treatment -related  mortality.26-27 Overall,  the introduction  of non- 
myeloablative  for conditioning  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120108] -related  mortality.13-1 6, 20 However,  results  from transplants  with non- 
myeloablative  regimens  were  poor if the patient  had failed  prior autologous bone  marrow  
transplantations  or had developed  chemotherapy -resistant  disease.17, 20 
To extend  the potential  benefits  of allogeneic   transplants  to the full range  of patients  
developi[INVESTIGATOR_120109]  a transplant  is indicated,  particularly  older  patients  (> 50 years  of 
age),  who constitute  the majority  of patients  with MM, as well as patients  lacking  HLA-matched  
sibling  donors,  major  emphasis  has been  focused  on the development  of approaches  which  could  
circumvent  severe  acute  and chronic  GvHD  so as to reduce  its morbidity  and mortality  in both 
HLA-matched  and HLA-non-identical  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  While  no combination  of 
immunosuppressive  drugs  administered  to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]-matched  related  or unrelated  
unmodified  hematopoietic  stem  cells grafts  has prevented  the development  of acute  and chronic  
GvHD,  this serious  transplant  related  complication  can be prevented  by [CONTACT_120146] T 
lymphocytes  from the allograft  prior to administration  in HLA matched  related  and unrelated  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_120110]-disparate  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].28-35 In our own series,  among  232 consecutive  
adult leukemic  patients  (median  age 41) engrafted  with marrow  transplants  from HLA-matched  
siblings  depleted  of T-cells by [CONTACT_120147] E rosette  depletion,  the incidence  of grade  
II-III GvHD  was 3% and the incidence  of chronic  graft vs. host disease  was 5%.36     Similarly,  in 
over 100 unrelated  marrow  grafts  transplanted  using  this T-cell depletion  technique,  the incidence

matched  grafts.38-39 Based  on these  findings,  our group  conducted  a sequence  of trials combining  
myeloablative  doses  of either  total body irradiation,  thiotepa  and fludarabine  or busulfan,  
melphalan  and fludarabine  with antithymocyte  globulin  (ATG)  which  reduced  the incidence  of graft 
failures  following  HLA-matched  T cell depleted  transplants  to less than 2% and the incidence  of 
graft failure  following  unrelated  and 1-2 allele  disparate  marrow  grafts  to less than 8%.36-37, 40 
These  rates  of graft failure  are comparable  to those  observed  following  unmodified  transplants  
from such donors.41 Additionally,  Aversa  et al42- 44 demonstrated  that when  G-CSF mobilized  
peripheral  blood  stem  cells are utilized  as the source  of hematopoietic  stem cells for  T-cell 
depleted  graft,  the doses  of stem  cells provided  are 5-10 fold higher  than those  that can be 
achieved  in a marrow  transplant  and allow  a  durable   engraftment   and  hematopoietic  
reconstitution  even in HLA-haplotype  disparate  leukemic  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].42 Based   upon   this 
observation,  G-CSF mobilized  peripheral  blood  stem  cells are currently  the preferred  source  of 
hematopoietic  cells for T cell depleted  transplants.

transplantation  as molecular  remissions  were  rarely  (7%) achieved  after autografting  (n=15)  
compared  to a 50% molecular  remission  rate seen  after allografting  (n=14).[ADDRESS_134181]  has been  more  directly  confirmed  by

prior to the DLI and some  received  multiple  escalating  doses  of DLI. Overall,  7 of 15 achieved  a 
CR and 3, a partial  response  (PR).  Lokhorst53 reported  on [ADDRESS_134182] 1x108 mononuclear   cells/kg.  All responding  patients  developed  graft-versus -host disease

3.3. Rationale  for Study  
 
This study  aims  at improving  progression -free survival  while  reducing  the transplantation -related  
complications  in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  To achieve  these  goals,  we 
propose  to perform  T-cell depleted  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  from related  
or unrelated  matched  or one HLA-antigen/allele  mismatched  donors  with chemotherapy  only 
conditioning  and prophylactic/preemptive  administrations  of calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocyte  
infusions,  derived  from the same  hematopoietic  stem cell donor.  Our initial  experience  with T-cell 
depleted  transplants  has been  in patients  with myelodysplastic  syndrome  and acute  leukemia.  
Our results  summarized  below  showed  that patients  with advanced  MDS  have better  transplant  
outcomes  if they are transplanted  in remission  after chemotherapy.  Because  MDS  patients  are 
mostly  older  patients  (>age  40), as are patients  with multiple  myeloma,  and some of them  are not 
eligible  to receive  total body irradiation,  our institution  developed  a chemotherapy  only preparative  
regimen  including  busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  for these  patients  
who could  also benefit  from T-cell depleted  SCT from HLA matched  or HLA disparate  related  and 
unrelated  donors.  The results  of our experience  of T-cell depleted  SCT in patients  with advanced  
MDS  with the chemotherapy  only preparative  regimen  are summarized  in the next paragraph.  
 
A phase  II trial with a chemotherapy  only conditioning  was performed  from August  2001  – 
June 2007  (Boulad  et al ASH 2007).  This trial demonstrated  that the use of busulfan,  melphalan  
and fludarabine  followed  by T-cell depleted  transplants  from matched  related,   mismatched  
related,  matched  unrelated  or mismatched  unrelated  donors  in patients  with advanced  MDS  is 
safe and has a significant  efficacy  as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_120153].  This trial included  63 
patients;  7 children  and 56 adults.  The median  age was 55.4 years  with a range  of 0.6 to 71.3;  
forty pts were  50 with 12 pts older  than 60 years.  The diagnoses  included:  primary  MDS  (33 
patients)  and AML evolved  from MDS  (20 patients),  de novo AML in CR1 (9 patients)  or CR 2 (1 
patient).  The donors  were  HLA matched  (A, B, C, DR, DQ by [CONTACT_120154])  related  (13), 
mismatched  related  (4), matched  unrelated  (46). Except  in two patients,  the source  of stem  cells 
was peripheral  blood.  Sixty  two patients  were  evaluable  for outcomes  and had at least [ADDRESS_134185] transplant  followup.  Results  of this trial demonstrated  that this preparative  regimen  was 
safe as determined  by [CONTACT_120155],  and GvHD.  All but 2 patients  achieved  
durable  engraftment.  One recipi[INVESTIGATOR_120112].  Acute  
GvHD  II- IV developed  in 7 patients  (18%)  and chronic  GvHD  in 4 patients  (7%) (3 extensive),  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_120113].  Moreover,  oral mucositis  was less severe  as compared  to 
the mucositis  seen  after myeloablative  doses  of TBI-containing  regimens.  Thus,  the objectives  of 
securing  consistent  engraftment  with graft failure  <10%  and grade  II-IV acute  GvHD  in [ADDRESS_134186] been  met in this trial. 
 
The prophylactic/preemptive  administration  of calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocyte  
infusions   has  been   integrated  to  reduce  potential   relapses   of the disease.   Historically,  donor

lymphocyte  infusion  were  performed  at time of relapsed  disease,  requiring  doses   of 1x107  - 
1x108/kg CD3+ cells to induce  a remission.  As detailed  above  under  3.2.3.  Donor  Lymphocyte  
Infusions,  these  doses  have also been  associated  with development  of acute  and chronic  graft- 
versus -host disease.  As proposed  in this trial, doses  of donor -derived  CD3+ T-cells will be given  in 
the range  of 5x105/kg CD3+ cells from matched  donors  and 1x105/kg CD3+ cells from one 
allele/antigen  mismatched  donors  with a first dose  administered  5-[ADDRESS_134187] transplantation.  
Finally,  the addition  of ATG to the chemotherapy  only conditioning  regim  en with busulfan,  
melphalan  and fludarabine  in our previous  trial has shown  to reduce  the incidence  of graft failures  
following  HLA-matched  T-cell depleted  transplants  to less than 2% and the incidence  of graft 
failure  following  unrelated  with 1-2 allele  disparate  marrow  grafts  to less than 8%. 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_120114],  
melphalan,  fludarabine  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  could  be safely  administered  to patients  with 
relapsed  high-risk multiple  myeloma  and whether  these  patients  who could  benefit  from T-cell 
depleted  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  from HLA matched  related  or 
unrelated  donor,  we performed  an initial  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Five patients  with high-risk MM, all of which  
relapsed  following  multiple  chemotherapy  regimen  and after one or two preceding  autologous  
stem  cell transplantations  underwent  T-cell depleted  transplants  from HLA-matched   siblings  
(3pts),  matched  unrelated  (1pt) or mismatched  unrelated  (1pt) donors.  Details  of the individual  
patients  and their outcomes  are described  in the paragraph  below,   but  in  summary,   all  five 
patients  durably  engrafted  with 100%  donor  chimerism  with patients  being  22, 16, 14, [ADDRESS_134188] disease  or graft failure  at this time.  Three  of these  patients  achieved  a 
complete  remission,  one patient  remains  in near complete  remission  and one patient  had stable  
disease  with M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_120115] 0.2g/dl  for 20 months  following  the transplant.  
 
UPN #1 is a 40+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM. He was treated  with 
Thalidomide  and Dexamethasone  followed  by [CONTACT_5657] 1st autologous  SCT with Mel [ADDRESS_134189]  from 9/[ADDRESS_134190].  The patient  had 7% Plasma  cells 
in his marrow  at admission.  The patient  tolerated  the transplantation  very well, engrafted  promptly  
without  requiring  readmission  following  discharge  from this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  The patient  received  
infusion  of low doses  of donor  lymphocytes  (5x104/kg) at [ADDRESS_134191] transplant  
and remained  at very stable  disease  with low levels  of M-protein  ranging  between  0.2 and 0.3 
mg/d  x 20 months.  This patient  has recently  developed  signs  of progression  of disease  and 
received  1x106 /kg CD3+ donor  T cell infusion  two months  ago and it is currently  too early  to 
assess  the response,  but he has not developed  signs  of GvHD.  
 
UPN #2 is a 30+ y/o male,  who was diagnosed  with stage  III IgA lambda  with high-risk 
cytogenetics,  (del 13, t (4; 14). He was treated  with Velcade  and Dexamethasone  x [ADDRESS_134192]  from his 10/10  identical  sister  in

without  complaints.  The patient  received  two doses  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at [ADDRESS_134194] disease.  
 
UPN #3 is a 30+ y/o male  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM diagnosed  with deletion  13. He 
was initially  treated  with Lenalidomide  and Dexamethasone  x 5 cycles  without  a response.  He 
was then treated  with VAD x 5 cycles  with only limited  response  (28%  plasma  cells in marrow),  
and continued  with autologous  SCT with minimal  response.  He  was  given  
Velcade/Dexamethasone  and Thalidomide  x [ADDRESS_134195]  from his 10/[ADDRESS_134196].  The patient  
tolerated  the transplantation  without  complications,  stably  engrafted  with 100%  donor  chimerism  
and is back to work fulltime.  He is currently  [ADDRESS_134197] transplant  in near complete  remission.  
The patient  received  two doses  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at [ADDRESS_134198] disease.  
 
UPN #4 is 50+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG lambda  MM with high-risk 
cytogenetics  (del 17p, del 13q, t11; 14). He was treated  with Thalidomide  and Dexamethasone  x 
4 months  with progression  of disease  + renal  failure,  followed  by [CONTACT_120156],  interrupted  by 
[CONTACT_120157],  EF 35%.  
Afterwards  he was continued  on Velcade  x 1 cycle  followed  by [CONTACT_120158]-16 + Cytoxan  with PR. He 
underwent  autologous  SCT with Melphalan  200 and relapsed  after one year.  He was given  VAD 
with PD and VP-16/Cytoxan  x [ADDRESS_134199] from 
10/[ADDRESS_134200] dose  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at [ADDRESS_134201] disease.  
 
UPN #5 is a 60+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM. He was initially treated  
with Revlimid,  Dexamethasone  and /Biaxin  (BIRD)  with PR. Autologous  SCT was performed  with 
good  response,  but the patient  relapsed  after one year.  He was started  on Revlimid,  Velcade  and 
Dexamethasone  x [ADDRESS_134202] from 10/[ADDRESS_134203] with respi[INVESTIGATOR_120116] a consequence  of pneumonia.  The cause  of the pneumonia  was likely  viral, but the 
patient  had refused  to be intubated  and a bronchoscopy  could  not be performed.  
 
These  results  can be compared  to the outcome  of patients  enrolled  by [CONTACT_120159] #04-024. On this protocol,  all patients  with multiple  myeloma,  
independently  of risk category  of cytogenetics  of their disease,  who had an HLA-identical  sibling,  
were  treated  with an autologous  stem  cell transplant  with Melphalan  200mg/m2  conditioning  
followed  by a non-myeloablative  allogeneic  transplant  from the sibling  with 200cGy  Total  Body  
Irradiation  as conditioning  regimen.  The complete  and official  analyses  of this national  trial are still 
pending,  but there  were  9 patients  enrolled  onto the auto/allo  arm of this trial by [CONTACT_27156].  Seven

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a two arm phase  II trial to assess  overall  survival,  progression -free survival,  efficacy  
(decrease  the transplant  related  mortality)  and safety  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation  using  a preparative  regimen  with busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine,  and anti- 
thymocyte  globulin  (ATG),  and T-cell depleted  stem  cell transplant  from a histocompatible  related  
or unrelated  donor  in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  The prophylactic  or 
preemptive  administration  of donor  lymphocyte  infusions  is performed  to decrease  the rate of 
relapse  and thus to prolong  event -free and overall  survival.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  will be cytoreduced  with IV busulfan,  melphalan  and fludarabine.  Busulfan  will be 
administered  at a dose  of 0.8mg/Kg  q6hrs  for 10 doses  on days -9, -8, -7. Doses  for busulfan  
should  be adjusted  according  to pharmacokinetic  studies.  Melphalan  will be administered  at a 
dose  of 70 mg/m2/day for 2 days on days -7, -6. Fludarabine  will be administered  at a dose  of 25 
mg/m2/day for 5 days on days -6, -5, -4, -3, -2. Patients  will also receive  rabbit  anti-thymocyte  
globulin  (ATG)  to prevent  immune  mediated  graft rejection.  The ATG will be administered  at a 
dose  of 2.5 mg/Kg/day  IV on days -3 and -2. Doses  for busulfan,  melphalan  and ATG should  be 
adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  ideal body  weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body  
weight . Doses  of fludarabine  should  be reduced  to 80% of dose  for measured  creatinine  
clearance  of 40-70ml/min.  Day -[ADDRESS_134207]-transplant  G-CSF starting  on day +7.

Historically,  under  the multicenter  BMTCTN trial 0303  (IRB 06-005 ) which  employed  the 
CliniMACS  device,  GCSF  mobilized  PBSC,  after washing,  were  suspended  in buffered  
saline  only and then incubated  with antiCD34  coated  paramagnetic  beads  prior to 
separation  of the CD34+ cells bound  to the beads  by [CONTACT_120160].  A provision  recommended  as an adjunct  but not required  or 
known  to be necessary  was that the diluent  in which  the washed  GCSF -mobilized  PBMC  
were  incubated  with the antiCD34  coated  beads  also include  30% autologous  plasma  or 
intravenous  gamma  globulin  at a concentration  of 1.5 mg/ml.  This provision  was not  
used  by [CONTACT_120161], including  our own. That trial 
recorded  an incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  of 20.5%  and a 7.6%  incidence  of 
extensive  GVHD.  While  these  findings  were  significantly  better  than any results  recorded  
with drug prophylaxis  or methods  of T-cell depletion  developed  at other  centers,  the 
incidence  of acute  GVHD  was higher  than what we had published  using  SBA-E-  T-cell 
depleted  marrow  or CD34+ (ISOLEX)  E- T-cell depleted  PBSC.  Since  we did not see 
significant  GVHD  in the small  number  of patients  that we contributed  to the trial, we 
ascribed  the higher  incidence  to limited  experiences  with the CliniMACS  device  and to 
recent  changes  in the grading  system  used  for acute  GVHD.  Accordingly,  no changes  in 
procedures  were  made  to protocol  10-051. 
 
However,  as accrual  to 10-[ADDRESS_134208]  of 
these  centers,  Perugia  U., did incorporate  IVIG in the incubation  step.  
 
Considering  the possibility  that in the absence  of plasma  or IVIG,  cells can non- 
specifically  adsorb  to paramagnetic  beads,  the cytotherapy  laboratory  validated  
separation  of CD34+ cells on the CliniMACS  in the presence  or absence  of IVIG in the 
incubation  period,  demonstrating  comparable  yields  of CD34+ cells and similar  levels  of 
T-cell depletion.  Thereafter,  on 7/25/12,  the procedure  was modified  to include  the IVIG.  
In February  2013,  we evaluated  the incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  and chronic  
GVHD  in patients  treated  since  then.  The incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  has been  
significantly  lower  approximating  5%. 
 
In order  to be able to meaningfully  compare  the incidence  of acute  GVHD  in patients  
receiving  transplants  fractionated  in the presence  or absence  of IVIG and therefore  
obtain  a better  overall  understanding  of the actual  rate of acute  GvHD,  we wish to 
continue  to enroll  patients  on the relapsed  arm and increase  the number  of pts by 17 pts 
to a total of 47 pts. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS

a. Source  and pharmacology:  Supplier:  Otsuka  Pharmaceutical;  Busulfan  is a bifunctional  
alkylating  agent  known  chemically  as 1, 4-butanediol,  dimethanesulfonate.  BUSULFEX®  
(busulfan).  This is an agent  in which  two labile  methanesulfonate  groups  are attached  to 
opposite  ends of a four carbon  alkyl chain.  In aqueous  media,  busulfan  hydrolyzes  to 
release  the methanesulfonate  groups.  This produces  reactive  carbonium  ions that can 
alkylate  DNA.  DNA  damage  is thought  to be responsible  for much  of the cytotoxicity  of 
busulfan.  
 
b. Formulation  and stability:  It is supplied  as a clear,  colorless,  sterile,  solution  in 10 mL 
single  use ampoules.  Each  ampoule  of BUSULFEX  contains  60 mg (6 mg/mL)  of 
busulfan,  the active  ingredient,  a white  crystalline  powder  with a molecular  formula  of 
CH 3SO 2O (CH 2)4OSO 2CH 3 and a molecular  weight  of 246 g/mole.  Busulfan  is dissolved  in 
N, N-dimethylacetamide  (DMA)  33% wt/wt  and polyethylene  glycol  400, 67% wt/wt.  
Busulfan‟s solubility  in water  is 0.1 g/L and the pH of a >0.5%  solution  in 0.9%  Sodium  
Chloride  Injection,  USP or 5% Dextrose  Injection,  USP as recommended   for  infusion  
reflects  the pH of the diluent  used  and ranges  from 3.4 to 3.9. 
 
c. Solution  preparation:  BUSULFEX  is supplied  as a sterile  solution  in 10 mL single -use 
clear  glass  ampoules  each  containing  60 mg of busulfan  at a concentration  of 6 mg/mL  for 
intravenous  use. BUSULFEX  must  be diluted  prior to use with either   0.9%   Sodium  
Chloride  Injection,  USP (normal  saline)  or 5% Dextrose  Injection,  USP (D5W).  The diluent  
quantity  should  be 10 times   the volume  of BUSULFEX,  ensuring  that the final 
concentration  of busulfan  is approximately  0.5 mg/mL  
 
d. Storage  and stability:  Unopened  ampules  of BUSULFEX  must  be stored  under  
refrigerated  conditions  between  2° -8° C (36° -46° F). 
 
e. Administration:  Intravenou s, over 2 hours. 
 
5.2. Melphalan  (Alkeran®)  
 
a. Source  and pharmacology:  Supplier:  Glaxo  Wellcome.  A derivative  of nitrogen  mustard,  
an analog  of mustard  gas. It is a polyfunctional  alkylating  agent  that causes  miscoding,  
cross -linkage  of DNA,  and single -strand  breakage  of DNA.  It inhibits  cellular  glycolysis,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516],  and protein  synthesis.   It is cell cycle -phase  non-specific.  
 
b. Formulation  and stability:  A lyophilized  powder  of [ADDRESS_134209]  and a 0.45 micron  filter. The special  diluent  has the following  composition:  
Sodium  citrate  0.2 g, Propylene  glycol  6.0 ml, Ethanol  (95%)  0.5 ml, and sterile  water  10 
ml. 
 
c. Solution  preparation:  Vial/50  mg: Reconstitute  by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_120117]  10 ml of the supplied  
diluent  into the vial to yield a final concentration  of 5 mg/ml.  Shake  vigorously  until the 
solution  is clear.   Immediately  dilute  the dose  to be administered  in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride,  
USP,  to a concentration  no greater  than 0.45 mg/ml  
 
d. Storage  and stability:  The intact  packages  should  be stored  at room  temperature  (15- 
30°C)  protected  from light. Shelf -life surveillance  of the intact  dosage  form is ongoing.  
Constitution  with the special  diluent  as directed  results  in a solution  that retains  at least 
90% potency  for about  three  hours  at 30°C.   Storage  at 5°C results  in precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].

Anti-seizure  prophylaxis  with Keppra  will be administered  to all patients  starting  day –10 or 24 
hours  prior to starting  busulfan  for the prevention  of busulfan -associated  seizures.  
 
9.2. Peri-transplant  treatment  to promote  engraftment  
 
a. Rabbit  anti-thymocyte  globulin*  (Thymoglobulin®) and methylprednisolone  
(MPD)  will be administered  in the pre-transplant  period  for all patients.  Patients  will receive  
rabbit  ATG (Thymoglobulin®)  at 2.5 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days on days -3 and -2. 
Methylprednisolone  will be given  at 2 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days with the ATG administration  and 
will be discontinued  thereafter.  ATG dose  should  be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  ideal 
body weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body  weight  and will be 
administered  as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
 
Side-effects  of ATG may occur  (see section  11.0 "Toxicities/Side  Effects").  If a reaction  
consisting  of fever  and chills  occurs,  then the infusion  will be slowed down,  meperidine  
could  be given  for the relief of the chills,  and when  the reaction  improves  the infusion  rate 
could  be slowly  escalated  again.  Should  a severe  significant  systemic  reaction  to the 
rabbit  ATG occur,  then the alternative  equine  ATG will be administered  at doses  of 15 
mg/Kg/day  x 2 days.  
 
b. All patients  will be treated  with G-CSF (filgrastim)  at 300 g SC QD for patients  
<60kg or 480 g SC QD for patients  >60Kg.  G-CSF administration  will begin  on day +7 
and will continue  until the ANC is >2000.

Donor  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells:  stimulation,  harvesting,  isolation  and T-cell depletion . 
 
For related  donors , beginning  5-6 days before  the day of transplant,  the normal  donor  will receive  
10 mcg/kg  of GCSF,  administered  subcutaneously  daily for at least 5 days.  On the fifth and sixth 
days of this course  of G-CSF,  the donor  will undergo  daily leukapheresis  designed  to provide  a 
minimum  of 109 mononuclear  cells/kg  of the transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s  weight.  For unrelated  donors , 
the G-CSF will be administered  and the leukapheresis  obtained  according  to the National  Marrow  
Donor  Program  protocol  and IND.

CliniMACS  CD34  reagent  (antibody -coated  paramagnetic   particles).   Prior  to  and  during  
incubation  of the antiCD34  beads  with the mobilized  PBSC,  intravenous  gammaglobulin  is added  
to the incubation  fluid at a concentration  of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml.  After magnetic  labeling  and washing,  
the cells are passed  through  a high-gradient  magnetic  separation   column   in  the  CliniMACS  
clinical  cell selection  device.  Magnetically  labeled  CD34+  cells are retained  in the magnetized  
column,  and CD34-negativ  e cells flow through  as the effluent  fraction  and will be discarded.  The 
CD34+positiv  e cells  retained  in the column  are eluted  by [CONTACT_120170],  then washing  the cells through  the column  and collecting  them.  The final CD34+  cell 
enriched  product  is concentrated  by [CONTACT_120171].  
 
Before  infusion,  the CD34+  cells will be washed  in normal  saline  for intravenous  infusion  
containing  1% human  serum  albumin,  and suspended  in a volume  of 25-[ADDRESS_134229]  testing  will be 
performed  as per SOPs  from the Cytotherapy  Lab Manual.  
 
This study  (protocol)  will be conducted  under  BB-IND #[ZIP_CODE].  BB-IND #[ADDRESS_134230]. 
 
9.4.2.  BMT  (if PBCST  not possible)  
 
Twenty \ four to forty-eight  hours  after the patient  has completed  treatment  with fludarabine,  bone  
marrow  will be harvested  from the donor  in the operating  room  according  to standard  procedure.  
The procedure  for T cell depletion  with soybean  agglutinin  (SBA)  and sheep  red blood  cells (E) 
has been  previously  described36, 40  as per the SOP  from the MSKCC  Cytotherapy  Laboratory.  
 
The amount  of marrow  harvested  will be such  to provide  a minimum  of 1 x 107  SBA-E- 
mononuclear  cells/kg  of the transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s  weight.  In very rare instances,  the amount  of 
marrow  cells harvested  from the donor  may be inadequate  to provide  a high enough  cell yield 
after the complete  T-cell depletion  procedure  outlined  above,  to ensure  engraftment.  This can be 
predicted  at any of the initial  steps  before  the final RBC  rosetting.  In such   a  situation,   the 
physician  in charge  of the study  and/or  the attending  physician  of the BMT service,  in consultation  
with the laboratory  investigators  performing  the T-cell depletion,  may elect to administer  either  an 
unmodified  or a partially  T-cell depleted  (SBA -) marrow  transplant.  The patient  would  then receive  
drug prophylaxis  against  GvHD.  These  patients  will be statistically  evaluated  as recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93059] T- 
cell depleted  marrow,  but will be analyzed  separately  in evaluation  of the efficacy  of the SBA-E- 
marrow  grafts.

11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Patients  recruited  to this transplantation  trial are individuals  who are either  referred  by [CONTACT_120173]-referred  for marrow  transplantation  as a potentially  curative  treatment  for their malignancy.  Prior 
to consideration  for transplant,  all patients  undergo  a series  of 1-[ADDRESS_134235]  these  risks,  leukophoreses  are 
conducted  in the Blood  Bank  Donor  Room  with full medical  and nursing  supervision  and support  
systems  to address  adverse  events.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_134236],  i.e. posterior  and/or  anterior  superior  iliac crests,  as well as minimal  risks of bleeding  at 
the site. There  have been  no problems  with localized  infections  at the sites in the extensive  
experience  of our service  with marrow  harvests  over the last [ADDRESS_134237]-transplant,  e.g. Pneumocystis  carinii,  cytomegalovirus  and 
Epstein  Barr virus.  
 
Likely:  
 
Busulfan:  Myelosuppression,  fatigue,  not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_120123], anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection.  
 
Melphalan:  Myelosuppression,  fatigue,  not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_120123], anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection,  transient  liver dysfunction.  
 
Fludarabine:  Myelosuppression,  tiredness,  not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_120123], anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection,  jaundice  and elevations  of 
liver enzymes.  
 
Reproductive  risks: Sterility.  Male patients  may be offered  sperm  banking  before  admission  for the 
transplant.  Possibilities  of preserving  the ability  to have children  for female  patients  can be 
discussed  with the doctor.  Patients  should  not become  pregnant  or father  a baby  [CONTACT_120174].  Women  should  not breast  feed a baby  
[CONTACT_120175].  A pregnancy  test is required  of all females  of childbearing  age before  starting  the 
transplant.  
ATG: is a rabbit  protein  that may induce  an immune  response  in humans.  Fever,  chills,  changes  in 
blood  pressure,  rash.  Pre-medications  (Benadryl,  Tylenol  and steroids  before   ATG)   have   been  
shown  to be effective  therapy.  Side effects  are usually  only severe  after the first dose.  
 
Growth  factor  (G-CSF):  bone  pain, headache,  body  ache,  feeling  tired,  swelling  of hands/feet,  
nausea.  These  are generally  mild and will go away  when  the growth  factor  is stopped.  
 
Less  Likely:  
 
Busulfan,   melphalan,   fludarabine:   Late  effects   of  these  three   chemotherapy   agents   include:  
cataracts  and under -activity  of the thyroid  gland.  Both of these  side effects  can be easily  treated.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  29 of 46  
  
 
 
 
Busulfan:  Seizures  that are generally  preventable  by [CONTACT_120176]  [ADDRESS_134238] busulfan.  Abnormal  liver function,  pulmonary  fibrosis  
 
Melphalan: Renal  or bladder  dysfunction  (increased  BUN,  creatinine,  necrosis)  may be seen.  
 
Fludarabine:  confusion,  numbness,  loss of vision,  loss of balance,  difficulty  walking  
 
ATG: Prior exposure  to rabbit  proteins  may predispose  subjects  to serious  allergic  reactions  such  as 
a drop in blood  pressure,  hives,  bronchospasm,  or serum  sickness.  Such  reactions  will be treated  
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_120124]-histamines.  Serum  sickness  is an immune  disease  usually  appearing  3-10 
days after injection  of a foreign  serum  or serum  protein,  with reactions  such  as hives,  fever,  swollen  
lymph  nodes,  edema,  arthritis,  protein  in the urine,  or severe  inflammation  of the kidney.  In the event  
of a severe  systemic  allergic  reaction,  a trial of an alternative  horse  ATG will be administered.  If a 
similar  reaction  occurs  with the equine  ATG,  no further  ATG will be administered.  
 
Rare  but serious:  
 
Busulfan:  high doses  of Busulfan  can cause  Veno -Occlusive  Disease  (VOD).  Symptoms  include  
jaundice,  liver enlargement  with pain, fluid retention  and increase  risk of bleeding.  This complication  
is managed  by [CONTACT_120177].  Veno -Occlusive  Disease  in its severe  form can be life 
threatening.  There  is also a medication,  Defibrotide,  which  has shown  to be helpful  in treating  VOD.  
 
Melphalan:  pulmonary  fibrosis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_120125].  Serious  
hypersensitivity  reactions:  Edema,  rash,  anaphylaxis  
 
ATG: renal  toxicity,  managed  by [CONTACT_120178].  Drop  in white  blood  cells;  drop in platelet  count  will be 
managed  by [CONTACT_120179].  
 
Transplant  related  risks:  
 
Blood  transfusions:  Transfusions  may induce  allergic  reactions.  Small,  subclinical   pulmonary  
emboli  may occur,  but these  rarely  if ever require  any intervention.  Standard  pre-medications  for 
blood  products  may  be used  before  administration  of the marrow  graft.  Fluid overload  can be 
managed  with diuretics.  Allergic  reactions  of variable  severity  can be prevented  or mitigated  by 
[CONTACT_120180],  antihistamines,  and narcotics.  These  products  may also serve  as 
vectors  of serious  infection  (e.g.,  CMV,  hepatitis,  AIDS).  To circumvent  this, prospective  blood  and 
marrow  donors  will be screened  per AABB  and FAHCT  guidelines.  CMV  antibody  (-) blood  products  
will be used  in CMV( -) individuals,  whenever  possible,  regardless  of the antibody  status of the 
marrow  donor.  All blood  products  are irradiated  (3000r,  137Cs) to  circumvent   the  risk  of  GvHD  
caused  by [CONTACT_120181].  
 
Receiving  peripheral  blood  stem  cells:  The volume  of the T-cell depleted  peripheral  blood  stem  
cells infused  is approximately  30-50 cc. Possible  side effects  include:  changes  in blood  pressure,  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  30 of 46  
  
 
fever,  headache,  shortness  of breath,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  bad taste  in the mouth.  Pre- 
medications  are given  to reduce  these  side effects.  
 
Receiving  donor  lymphocyte  infusions:  The volume  of the donor  lymphocyte  infusions  infused  is 
approximately  10-30 cc. Possible  side effects  include:  changes  in blood  pressure,  fever,  headache,  
shortness  of breath,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  bad taste  in the mouth.  Pre-medications  are 
given  to reduce  these  side effects.  
 
Graft -versus -host-disease  (known  as GvHD):  This condition  happens   when   the  transplanted  
donor  cells recognizes  the patient‟s body as foreign  and attacks  it. At least 1-2 out of 10 patients  
receiving  a T cell depleted  transplant  will get mild to moderate  GvHD.  GvHD  can be treated  with 
medications  (either  IV or tablets).  A biopsy  may be necessary  to make  the diagnosis  of GvHD.  
 
Acute  GvHD  usually  occurs  in the first 3 months  and may cause:  skin rashes,  nausea,  vomiting,  
diarrhea,  hepatitis,  increased  risk of infection,  ulceration  of the surfaces  of the oral cavity,  
esophagus,  and intestines,  and suppressed  or delayed  recovery  of the hematopoietic  and immune  
system.  In patients  transplanted  and engrafted  with SBA-E- T-cell depleted  marrow  from HLA 1-3 
allele  disparate  related  donors,  this complication  has been  observed  in fewer  than 20% of patients  
and has rarely  been  severe.  It may be fatal in at least 20-50% of cases  and may also predispose  to 
lethal  infections  which  contribute  to an additional  mortality  of 10-25%.  
 
Chronic  GvHD  can occur  any time after the first 3 months.  Approximately  50% of patients  with 
acute  GvHD  may also develop  chronic  GvHD,  manifested  to varying  degrees  by [CONTACT_120182]-like 
changes  of the skin, cirrhosis  of the liver, sclerosis  of lacrimal  and salivary  ducts,  chronic  
inflammation  and scarring  of the gastrointestinal  tract with consequent  malabsorption  and diarrhea,  
chronic  bronchitis,  and suppression  of the immune  system.  This can be treated  with standard  or 
protocol -based  experimental  immunosuppression,  but may be refractory.  
 
Severe  graft -versus -host disease:  Rarely,  GvHD  can be severe  or deadly.  Severe  acute  GvHD  
could  involve  a severe  skin rash like a burn,  severe  vomiting  and/or  diarrhea,  liver failure  and 
infections  or bleeding.  Severe  acute  GvHD  will be treated  with intense  immunosuppressive  therapy  
according  to standard  clinical  practice  or other  experimental  protocol.  Severe  chronic  GvHD  could  
involve  similar  symptoms  but may produce  other  symptoms  such as severe  skin changes,  severe  
dry eyes and weight  loss. 
 
Steroids , as treatment  for GvHD:  inability  to sleep,  high blood  sugar,  puffiness  of the face,  changes  
in the skin, high blood  pressure,  increased  risk of infection,  weight  gain, reduced  growth  in children,  
thinning  of the bones  
 
Infections  or bleeding:  Full recovery  of blood  counts  may take months.  Full recovery  of  the 
immune  system  may take months  to a few years.  For this reason  patients  will be at increased  risk of 
infections  and bleeding.  Medications  are given  to reduce  the chance  of those  infections.  Patients  
will receive  treatment  if they do get an infection  and most  infections  can be treated  successfully  with 
antibiotics.  Patients  will stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120126].  
Patients  are watched  closely  for bleeding  and given  platelet  transfusions  to prevent   serious  
bleeding,  but minor  bleeding  may occur.

Serious  infections  or bleeding:  Some  infections  are very difficult  to treat,  even with strong  
antibiotics.  Rarely,  serious  infections  can be passed  on by [CONTACT_120183].  Serious  
bleeding  can happen  in spi[INVESTIGATOR_120127].  Rarely  infections  or bleeding  are lethal.  
 
Potential  sensitization  to murine  proteins:  Mouse  protein  (the anti CD34  antibody  used  in this 
device  is of murine  derivation)  is used  in the CliniMACS  processing  procedure.  Marrow  cells are also 
separated  on bovine  serum  albumin  gradients  and exposed  to sheep  red cells to remove  rosetting  
populations.  It is possible  that patients  may have pre-existing  immunity  to these  proteins  and may be 
at risk for allergic  reactions  during  infusion  of the processed  marrow  and/or  peripheral  blood.  No 
allergic  reactions  have been  noted  with infusions  of cells processed  by [CONTACT_120184] -rosette -positive  cells.  
Precautions  for an allergic  event  will be taken  during  the infusion  of the processed  cells.  
 
Pneumocystis  jiroveci  prophylaxis:  The risk of trimethoprim  and sulfamethoxazole  in the doses  
given  are primarily  hypersensitivity  reactions  and signs  of folate  deficiency.  Any patient  with known  
hypersensitivity  to these  compounds  will not receive  these  drugs.  The risks of parenteral  
pentamidine  are primarily  hypotension  and hypoglycemia  both of which  will be monitored  during  and 
following  administration  of the drug.  Hypokalemia  or hypomagnesemia  associated  with prolonged  
QT syndrome  or Torsade  de pointe  necessitates  strict  electrolyte  monitoring.  The risks of 
aerosolized  pentamidine  are mild bronchospasm  primarily  observed  in (prior)  tobacco  abusers  and 
easily  managed  with bronchodilator  therapy.  
 
Risk of a secondary  cancer  different  from multiple  myeloma  may happen  after chemotherapy.  The 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a secondary  cancer  of the skin, cervix,  etc., which  has been  seen  in other  studies  
of similar  transplants,  is less than 5%. There  is a special  concern  in patients  who receive  a T cell 
depleted  transplants  because  there  is a risk of having  a cancer  of the lymph  nodes  (lymphoma)  
caused  by [CONTACT_120185] (EBV).  This virus causes   mononucleosis  in healthy   people.  
Treatment  of EBV lymphoma  includes  Donor  Leukocyte  Infusion  (DLI)  and Rituximab.  
 
Graft  Failure:  Bone  marrow  graft may fail to grow.  Past experience  suggests  that this may occur  in 
about  10% of patients.  If graft failure  occurs,  it is unlikely  that bone  marrow  will recover  and a 
second  transplant  with stem  cells from the same  donor  or a different  donor  will be needed.  
 
Progression  of Disease  and Relapse  of Multiple  Myeloma  is a risk even  if the transplant  is 
initially  successful.  Patients  on the relapsed  cohort  may be treated  prophylactically  with Revlimid  
maintenance  therapy  post transplant.  
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
DEFINITIONS  OF DISEASE  STATUS  
 
Patients  at each  data collection  period  are classified  into one of the following  states.  
 
1. Complete  Response  (CR) 
CR requires  all of the following:  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  32 of 46  
  
 
- Absence  of the original  M-protein  in serum  and urine  by [CONTACT_120186] a minimum  of six weeks.  The presence  of new monoclonal  bands  
consistent  with oligoclonal  immune  reconstitution  does not exclude  CR. 
- Less  than 5% plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_120128],  if biopsy  
is performed.  Confirmation  with repeat  bone  marrow  studies  is not needed  if the last bone  marrow  
assessment  was negative.  
- No increase  in size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response).  
 
Patients  in whom  some,  but not all, the criteria  for CR are fulfilled  are classified  as very good  partial  
response  or partial  response  (see below),  providing  the remaining  criteria  satisfy  the requirement  for 
partial  response.  This includes  patients  in whom  routine  electrophoresis  is negative  but in whom  
immunofixation  has not been  performed.  
 
2. Very Good  Partial  Response  (VGPR)  
- Reduction   of  serum   M-protein   on  electrophoresis   by  [CONTACT_120187]  90%  with  a  urine   M-protein  
<100mg/24hours,  but detectable  immunofixation.  
 
3. Partial  Response  (PR) 
PR requires  the following:  
- Greater  than or equal  to 50% reduction  in the level of the serum  M-protein,  maintained  for a 
minimum  of six weeks.  
OR 
- Reduction  of urine  M-protein  to less than 200 mg/24  hours,  maintained  for a minimum  of six weeks  
- No increase  in size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response).  
 
For patients  with nonsecretory  myeloma,  free light chain  (FLC)  levels  can be used to determine  a 
partial  response.  A 50% decrease  in the difference  between  kappa  and lambda  FLC levels  denotes  
a PR. If the FLC levels  were  unmeasurable  at baseline,  a 50% reduction  in bone  marrow  plasma  
cells is acceptable  as long as the original  bone  marrow  contained  at least 30% plasma  cells.  All PR 
require  a 50% reduction  in size of any soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
 
Patients  in whom  some,  but not all, the criteria  for PR are fulfilled  are classified  as minimal  response  
(see below),  providing  the remaining  criteria  satisfy  the requirements  for minimal  response.  
 
4. Minimal  Response  (MR)  
Minimal  response  requires  the following:  
- 25-49% reduction  in the level of the serum  M-protein.  
OR 
- Urine  M-protein  which  still exceeds  200 mg/24  hours  
- 25-49% reduction  in the size of soft tissue  plasmacytomas  (by [CONTACT_120188]).  
- No increase  in the size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response)

5. Stable  Disease  (SD) 
Stable  values  (within  25% above  or below  value  at time response  is assessed)  maintained  for at 
least three  months.  
 
6. Relapse 
Relapse  from CR requires  one or more  of the following:  
• Reappearance  of serum  or urine  paraprotein  on immunofixation  or routine  electrophoresis,  
confirmed  by [CONTACT_120189] 2-4 weeks  and excluding  
oligoclonal  immune  reconstitution  
• Greater  than or equal  to 5% plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_120129]  
• Development  of new lytic bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  or definite  increase  in the 
size of residual  bone  lesions.  Development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  
continued  response  and may not indicate  progression  
• Development   of  hypercalcemia   (corrected   serum   Ca  >  11.5  mg/dL   or  >  2.8  mmol/L)   not 
attributable  to any other  cause  
 
7. Progressive  Disease  (PD) 
For patients  not in CR, progressive  disease  requires  one or more  of the following:  
• > 25% increase  in the level of the serum  M-protein,  which  must  also be an absolute  increase  of 
at least 0.5 g/dL and confirmed  by [CONTACT_120190]  
• An absolute  increase  in urine  M-protein  of at least 200 mg/[ADDRESS_134239] 
one repeated  investigation  
• > 25% increase  in plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_120130],  which  must  
also be an absolute  increase  of at least 10% 
• Definite  increase  in the size of existing  bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
• Development  of new bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
• Development   of  hypercalcemia   (corrected   serum   Ca  >  11.5  mg/dL   or  >  2.8  mmol/L)   not 
attributable  to any other  cause  
• Development  of  a compression  fracture  does  not  exclude   continued   response  and may  not 
indicated  progression  
 
Definition  of events  in the post-transplant  course  important  for analysis  and treatment  
 
12.1.  Regimen -related  and transplant -related  mortality  
 
Regimen  related  toxicity  (RRT)  refers  to those  toxicities  that can be attributed  directly  to the 
preparative  regimen  (including  chemotherapeutic  agents,  ATG,  and donor  lymphocyte  infusion).  
 
Transplant -related  mortality  (TRM)  includes  the RRT and other  fatal complications  resulting  from 
the allogenic  transplant  such  as graft failure,  GvHD,  hemorrhages,  and infections.  One year post 
TRM  is the primary  endpoint  of this study.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  34 of 46  
  
 
The grading  for monitoring  the morbidity  and mortality  will be based  on the NCI/CTEP  common  
toxicity  criteria  version  4.0. This will include  assessment  of severity  and duration  of oral mucositis  
and sequelae  specifically  parenteral  opi[INVESTIGATOR_120131], TPN use, febrile  neutropenia,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120132].  
 
12.2.  Immunologic  Reconstitution  
 
Our previously  reported  analyses  have identified  time points  at which  the various   immunologic  
functions  can be expected  to return.  Patients  receiving  T-cell depleted  transplants   from  HLA- 
identical  related  donors  can be monitored  at fewer  time points  without  compromising  our ability  to 
obtain  critical  information.  However,  patients  receiving  transplants  from partially   HLA-matched  
related  donors  will be evaluated  more  frequently,  as graft rej ection,  late graft failures,  more  
pronounced  immune  dysfunction,  and more  patient  to patient  variability  have  been  observed.  
 
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_120133] T-cells,  B-cells,  and NK cells,  will be performed  at approximately  3, and 
every  3-[ADDRESS_134240]-transplant  
and every  3-6 months  thereafter  until normal  values  are reached.   These  tests  are not required  when  
a patient‟s absolute  lymphocyte  count  is less than 0.5 K/mcL.  
 
Immunoglobulin  levels  will be tested  at 6 months,  9 months  (if clinically  indicated),  [ADDRESS_134241]-transplant  and thereafter  as clinically  indicated.  Patients  with normal  total IgG levels  
and PHA response  within  the 25th percentile  of normal  may be re-immunized  with diphtheria  and 
tetanus  toxoid,  killed  polio vaccine,  hepatitis  B vaccine,  as well as the Haemophilus  influenzae  type 
B conjugate  vaccine.  Specific  antibody  production  to tetanus  and Hepatitis  B is then measured.  
 
Antigen -specific   T-cell  immune   reconstitution   will  be  performed   as  described   in  detail   under  
„correlative  studies‟. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_134242]  cytogenetic  studies  at 1 month,  100 days,  6 months,  9 months  (if clinically  indicated),  and 
12 months,  18 months,  24 months  (if clinically  indicated)  post transplant  or as needed  thereafter.  T- 
cell chimerism  analysis  is not required  when  a patient‟s absolute  lymphocyte  count  is less than 0.5

12.4 Graft  failure  or rejection  
 
Primary  non-engraftment  is diagnosed  when  the patient  fails to achieve  an ANC 500/ l at any time 
in the first [ADDRESS_134243]-transplant.  If the patient's  myeloma  recurs  during  this interval,  the patient  is 
scored  as having  refractory  myeloma.  In such  a situation,  the absence  of donor  hematopoiesis  is not 
evaluable  for graft failure  or rejection.  If host T-cells capable  of specifically  inhibiting  donor  
hematopoietic  progenitor  growth  in vitro are concurrently  detected  during  graft failure,  a presumptive  
diagnosis  of immune  mediated  rejection  is made.  If (1) after achievement  of an ANC 500/mm3, the

ANC declines  to <500/mm3 for more  than 3 consecutive  days in the absence  of relapse,  or, (2) there  
is absence  of donor  cells in the marrow  and/or  blood  as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_120191],  a diagnosis  of secondary  graft failure  is made.  If, however,  recurrence  of host 
myeloma  is detected  concurrently,  the patient  is not evaluable  for graft failure  or rejection.  
 
Patients  with evidence  of graft failure  without  evidence  of recurrence  of host myeloma  will have  
additional studies drawn to ascertain cause and define relevant histoincompatibilities. These 
analyses  may include  (1) Evaluation  of bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_120134],  when  indicated,  (2) Culture  and/or  molecular  analyses  of marrow  and blood  for viral 
pathogen s potentially causing graft failure including CMV, HHV6 and parvovirus B 19, (3) 
Immunophenotypic  and genetic  analysis  of circulating  T-cells and NK cells to ascertain  their origin  
and potential  function,  (4) Analysis  of the functional  activity  of residual  circulating  lymphocytes  to 
determine  whether  and to what degree  they exhibit  cytotoxic  or cyto-inhibitory  activity  against  donor  
host or third party  PHA-stimulated  blasts  or clonogenic  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells.  If donor - 
specific  reactivity  is identified,  attempts  will be made  to identify  targeted  specificities  (HLA  or minor  
alloantigens)  whenever  possible.  
 
Patients  who suffer  graft failure  will be considered  for a secondary  transplant.  The need   for 
additional  immunosuppression  or treatment  for viral infection  prior to the secondary  transplant  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_120192].  
12.5.     Graft -versus -host disease  
Standard  BMT-CTN and IBMTR  systems  clinical  criteria  as defined  by [CONTACT_93128],  et al68 will be used  
to establish  and grade  acute  GvHD.  
 
To determine  the severity  of acute  GvHD,  data will be collected  approximately  weekly  to 
characterize  the severity  of symptoms  and signs  caused  by [CONTACT_120193].  Real time data collection  will include  descriptive  characteristics  of rash and 
estimated  body surface  area involved,  extent  of dermal/epi[INVESTIGATOR_93037],  identification  of 
concomitant  causes  of increased  bilirubin  other  than GvHD,  presence  or absence  of  nausea,  
vomiting  or anorexia  persistent  after engraftment,  peak  diarrhea  volume  with annotations  concerning  
the presence  after engraftment,  peak diarrhea  volume  with annotations  concerning  the presence  or 
absence  of urinary  mixing  and estimates  of true diarrhea  volume,  presence  or absence  of abdominal  
cramps,  presence  or absence  of frank  stool blood  or melena,  concomitant  causes  of GI symptoms  
other  than GvHD,  biopsy  results,  identification  of any agents  used  for treatment  and autopsy  results.  
 
Patients  will be observed  for acute  and/or  chronic  GvHD.  Graft -versus -host disease  occurring  after 
DLI infusions  will be analyzed  separately.  
 
Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GvHD  (grade  II-IV) will be treated  in standard  fashion  with 
high-dose  I.V. methylprednisolone  (1-2mg/kg/day)  or in combination  with other  immunosuppressants  
as per ongoing  trials on GvHD.  Patients  failing  to respond  to steroids  will be  considered   for 
treatment  with experimental  treatments  available  at the time of diagnosis  of GvHD.  
 
 
Chronic  GvHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to the criteria  of Sullivan69 treated  with 
standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  therapy.  Treatment  will consist  of corticosteroids,

cyclosporin  A or azathioprine,  or combinations  of these  agents.  Other  novel  treatments  could  be 
used  if available,  i.e. thalidomide  and psoralen/ultraviolet  A phototherapy  (PUVA).  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section  on 
Criteria  for patient/subject  eligibility  (e.g. a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be removed  from the 
study.  Also patients  may be removed  from the study  if requested  by [CONTACT_102].  Management  will 
depend  on where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  patients  will receive  appropriate   
supportive  care.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_120135].  
14.[ADDRESS_134244] 13/30  patients  were  recorded  progression -free at 1 year,  then the treatment  will be 
declared  a success.  The probability  of declaring  the treatment  a success  is  0.10 when  the one- 
year PFS in the population  is 0.30 and increases  to  0.90 when  the one-year progression -free 
survival  is 0.54.  
 
Recent  data at MSKCC  suggests  that the addition  of immune  gammaglobulin  (IVIG)  added  to the 
incubation  fluid at a concentration  of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml  during  incubation  of the antiCD34  beads  with 
the mobilized  PBSC  results  in a reduction  in the rate of grade  2-[ADDRESS_134245] disease  
(GVHD).   A total of 17 out of the 30 patients  in the relapsed  cohort  were  treated  without  the IVIG 
addition.  
Since  DLI and the lack of IVIG may both increase  a patient‟s risk of GVHD,  it is imperative  to 
understand  the risk that is attributable  to the TCD+DLI  treatment  strategy  and not the change  in 
CD34+  preparation.  Therefore  this cohort  will be expanded  so that the outcomes  can be evaluated  
on patients  who all receive  the IVIG addition.  The outcomes  for the N=[ADDRESS_134246] 18/30  patients  were  recorded  progression -free at 1 year,  then the treatment  will be 
declared  a success.  The probability  of declaring  the treatment  a success is  0.10 when  the one - 
year PFS in the population  is 0.45 and increases  to 0.89  when   the  one-year  progression -free 
survival  is 0.69.

Finally,  to account  for patients  that relapse  and are put back into remission  through  DLI, the current

Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
15.3 Randomization  
 
This research  study  does not require  a randomization.  
 
16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA  will 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  and problem  resolutions,  and coordination  of the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.  Source  documentation  will 
be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the 
study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Full sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  at a 
minimum  of two times  per year,  and more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  (DSM)  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  
set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and 
Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at: 
Http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/r  esearchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm . 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.   The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center‟s 
Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.

During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Consent  Process:  Participation  in this study  is  voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a 
statement  of informed  consent  which  must  conform  to MSKCC  IRB guidelines  and explain  the risks 
and potential  benefits  of the transplant  procedure.  
 
Alternatives:  Enrollment  in this study  is voluntary.  Alternative  treatment  options  will be presented  to 
the patient  prior to taking  part in this study.  Alternative  treatment  options  may include  getting  a 
transplant  from a volunteer  unrelated  donor,  if one is available;  getting  treatment  for the cancer  with 
either  chemotherapy  or a transplant  without  being  on a study;  taking  part in another  study;  or getting  
no treatment.  
 
Costs:  The patient‟s health  plan/insurance  company  will need  to pay for all of the costs  of treatment  
in this study.  The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care,  all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120136].  Pre-authorization  for the transplant  will be cleared  
with the health  plan/insurance  company  prior to admission.  Patients  will not be paid for taking  part in 
this study.  Research  tests will be done  at no cost to the patient.  
Confidentiality:  Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93051].  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant  
to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A 
Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_93052]  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part of transplant  therapy.  Grade  4 toxicities  will be 
recorded  and reported  as part of the analysis  of study  outcome.  In addition,  the reportable  serious  
adverse  events  (SAEs)  will be defined  according  to current  MSKCC  BMT program  guidelines  which  
is included  as an appendix.  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120137]: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  41 of 46  
  
 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigati onal treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:

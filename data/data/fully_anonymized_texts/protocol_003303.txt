5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
Cervical dilators are commonly  used for preparation prior to second trimester abortion . Women have 
described the pain of osmotic dilator insertion as moderate to severe yet there have been few studies aimed 
at addressing pain during and after osmotic dilator insertion. One strategy to decrease pain with other 
gynecologic procedures is a parac ervical block, or injection of anesthetic medication  into the tissue 
surrounding the cervix. A r andomized trial found that use of a paracervical block  with 1% buffered lidocaine 
decreased pain with osmotic dilator insertion compared to a sham block. In add ition, there are adjunct 
treatments to optimize analgesia with local anesthetics at a variety of other anatomic locations . 
Buprenorphine, a partial mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_297976], has been found to increase the quality of the anesthetic 
at the time of administ ration and increase the duration of nerve block analgesia at several anatomic sites, 
though has never been studied as an adjunct in a paracervical block. This has been used extensively in 
orthopedic surgery with significant prolongation of the local anesth etic effect by [CONTACT_433362].  
 
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Primary aim:  
To compare the mean pain score at the time of osmotic dilator insertion  among women randomized to a 1% 
lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block alone.  
 
We hypothesize that in patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in preparation for dilation and 
evacuation, the addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with 
lower mean pain scores at time of osmotic dilator insertion compar ed to women who receive a 1% lidocaine 
paracervical block alone.

1. To compare the mean pain score 2 hours after osmotic dilator insertion among women randomized to 
a lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a lidocaine par acervical block alone.  
2. To assess overall narcotic and ibuprofen use after osmotic dilator placement and before dilation and 
evacuation procedure.  
3. To assess opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277].  
4. To determine patient satisfaction with pain control during and after o smotic dilator insertion.  
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is the most common method of second trimester abortion in the United 
States1. Cervical preparation prior to the procedure is essential in order to allow passage of operative 
instruments and pregnancy tissue safely through the cervix and to decrease the risk of complications.1–[ADDRESS_549179] 
been few studies aimed at addressing pain during and after osmotic dilator insertion.5–8 A lidocaine 
paracervical block is commonly used for pain control during other gynecologic procedures including 
procedures involving cervical dilation like dilation and curettage.6,7 One randomized controlled trial found that 
use of a paracervical block with 1% lidocaine decreased pain with osmotic dilator insertion compared to a 
sham block .[ADDRESS_549180] treatments to optimize the duration of local analgesia from a peripheral nerve 
block.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_433339].12–[ADDRESS_549181] provided e vidence that opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], specifically mu -receptors, 
are found in the peripheral nervous system.18–[ADDRESS_549182] duration of action of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. When administered perineurally in combination with a local 
anesthetic, buprenorphine has been found to drastically increase the duration of analgesia at sev eral 
anatomic sites, including axillary and subclavian brachial plexus blocks and infragluteal sciatic nerve blocks.22–
30 With the addition of buprenorphine at doses of 0.15 – 0.3mg, there is significant prolongation of the 
anesthetic sensory blockade up to three times the duration of the local anesthetic alone.[ADDRESS_549183] for local pain control is found in the 
anesthesia literature. With the addition of buprenorphine at doses of 0.15 – 0.3mg, there is significant 
prolongation of the anesthetic sensory blockade up to three times the duration of the local anesthetic 
alone.22,[ADDRESS_549184] to a paracervical block has never been 
studied .22–[ADDRESS_549185] peripheral nerve blocks are per formed using ultrasound guidance to avoid large vessels, 
especially with brachial plexus and sciatic nerve blocks. Although visualization is used to avoid large vessels, 
there is still likely a small amount that is absorbed systemicall y. Because a paracerv ical block is performed 
blindly (though clinicians draw back before injection to ensure no entrance into a vessel) and there is a higher 
concentration of vessels around the cervix, we will be studying the lower 0.15mg dose of buprenorphine. This 
dose has s till been shown to significantly prolong post -procedure analgesia, thus we anticipate that it will be 
effective in prolonging analgesia in our study.22,33,[ADDRESS_549186] to assess the efficacy of adding buprenorphine to a  paracervical block 
for pain during osmotic d ilator insertion .  
 
 In terms of potential risks to the fetus, a  study by [CONTACT_138188]. (2019) reported that less than 1% of 
women who present for second -trimester abortions and received osmotic dilators for cervical preparation had 
their dilators removed wi th the intent to continue the pregnancy.[ADDRESS_549187] been published 
with this clinical situation.37 Women are counseled that the placement of osmotic dilators is the start of her 
two-day procedure. If a participant chooses to continue her pregnancy a fter osmotic dilators are placed and 
after study medication is administered (which as indicated, is extremely rare), a single dose of non -
systemically administered buprenorphine  in the second trimester is unlikely to affect the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. 
Studies in  rats and rabbits have not found buprenorphine exposure to increase congenital malformations.[ADDRESS_549188] demonstrated  that about 10 % of buprenorphine crosses the placenta and about 
5% is metabolized to the active metabolite .39 In this study, we are administering a single local dose of 
buprenorphine in a nerve block formulation. Very little of this medication (if any) would be systemically 
absorbed, and as such, almost none would cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulatio n. 
 There are no well controlled studies investigating the effects of buprenorphine in pregnant women . 
Overall, there  is limited data about the rate of major congenital malformations with the use of 
buprenorphine, but the available data  do not show an incr eased risk when compared to other opi[INVESTIGATOR_433340] .40–[ADDRESS_549189] on a fetus. 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 5 From the available literature, there is no clear evidence of risk of major congenital malfo rmations with use of 
buprenorphine in pregnancy.35,36,37 If a woman changes her mind after insertion of osmotic dilators and 
desires to continue the pregnancy, she will be referred to perinatology (high risk pregnancy specialists) for 
follow up and monitor ing of her pregnancy. The risks are described further in section 15.

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
This is a randomized , 2-arm (1:1), double blinded clinical trial comparing pain scores at the time of osmotic 
dilator insertion and at specific points after insertion with a buprenorphine plus 1% lidocaine paracervical 
block compared to a paracervical block alone  in women  who  have osmotic cervical dilators placed .  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  
In patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in preparation for dilation and evacuation, the 
addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with lower 
mean pain scores at time of osmotic dilator insertion compa red to women who receive a 1% lidocaine 
paracervical block alone.  
Secondary hypotheses:  
In patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in preparation for dilation and evacuation, the 
addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with lower 
mean pain scores 2 hours after osmotic dilator insertion compared to women who receive a 1% 
lidocaine paracervical block alone.  
 
In order to investigate this hypothesis , the fol lowing study design is proposed:   
 We plan to re cruit at two study sites – the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD) and Planned 
Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest (PPPSW).  The UCSD study team will be responsible for all study 
procedures conducted at Planned Parenthood. Members of the UCSD study t eam will be determining 
eligibility, consenting patients, administering patient questionnaires, collecting data, and performing data 
analysis. Planned Parenthood clinicians will be administering the study medication during the procedure and 
will not be inv olved in any other research procedures.   
 Included in the study are women who present to the UCSD or PPPSW clinics seeking dilation and 
evacuation for any indication and who will require cervical preparation with osmotic dilators as determined by 
[CONTACT_337681]. Patients between [ADDRESS_549190] a history of chronic liver disease. Stratified 
randomization with be performed among participants based on vaginal parity (nulliparous and m ultiparous).  
Participants will be randomized to one of two study groups allocated one to one: (1) paracervical block with 
20mL of 1% buffered lidocaine or (2) paracervical block with 20mL of 1% buffered lidocaine plus 0.15mg of 
buprenorphine.   
 During th e procedure, t he study team member will present the numeric rating scale (NRS) to the 
participant and ask her to mark her level of pain at each time point during the procedure (paracervical block 
placement, osmotic dilator insertion, [ADDRESS_549191] procedu re) and will remain blinded to the study arm. 
These NRS scores will be recorded into REDCap utilizing an electronic tablet. The participant will be asked 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_549192] used the numeric rating scale (NRS)8-11. We plan to capture pain using the NRS (an 11 -
point scale from 0 -10) as we are evaluating pain at multiple different timepoints, both during and after dilator 
insertion.   
 Our secondary outcome is pain at [ADDRESS_549193] 
anywhere from 2 -6 hours using 1% lidocaine and provide pain relief as the dilators are expanding. Patients will 
be receiving text messages with links to questionnaires at three different time points ([ADDRESS_549194] -insertion) in order to assess their level of pain, analgesic use, as well as any other symptoms. These 
text messages will be time stamped depending on time of dilator insertion and will be sent out at the intervals 
we specify in the text messaging software.  
 
Schedule of Assessments  
The table below indicates the time point at which the various assessments will be performed.  Assessments 
will be performed over one to two days: on the day of osmotic dilator insertion and on the day of D&E. If 
same day dilators are used, the final assessm ent will be performed immediately prior to D&E. Overall, the 
process of clinician evaluation, procedural consent, study recruitment, study consent, performance of 
procedure, and immediate post -procedure questionnaire should take about 30 minutes. The follo w up 
questionnaires and questionnaire prior to D&E will take about [ADDRESS_549195] -procedure. This questionnaire  Before

pain and to recall their maximum pain score over the preceding day and th eir overall satisfaction with their 
pain control. The need for follow up will be determine d per usual clinician practice and preference.  
 
 
Randomization :  
Block randomization will be performed in alternating blocks of 4 and 6 stratified by [CONTACT_433363] (vaginally 
nulliparous versus vaginally multiparous). The study team member will open the designated sealed 
sequentially numbered opaque randomization envelope containing computer generated randomization code 
of the type of paracervical block and ha nd it to the clinician performing the procedure. A clinician who will not 
be administering the paracervical block will then open the envelope and prepare the designated paracervical 
block into two [ADDRESS_549197] the 
paracervical block, Dennison dilators to dilate the cervix if that is the clinician’s practice, and insertion of 
laminar ia and/or Dilapan -S. The amount of time it takes to inject the paracervical block will be recorded.   
 
Intervention : A paracervical block with 20mL of 1% buffered lidocaine plus 0.15mg of buprenorphine  will be 
injected prior to osmotic dilator insertion . A paracervical block with 20mL of 1% buffered lidocaine will be 
used in the control group. The patient will not be charged for the study drug. All drug costs will be covered by 
[CONTACT_1758] (this is also stated in the consent form).  
 
Outcomes:  
1) Sociodemographic and clinical data : age, race, ethnicity, level of education, marital status, height, 
weight , obstetric history , history of cervical procedures  (e.g. LEEP procedure or Conization) , chronic 
baseline pain  
2) Primary outcome : Level of pain as rated on an 11 -point (0 -10) numeric rating scale during osmotic 
dilator insertion.

Power Calculation :  
             It is suggested that a 2 -point reduction in pain on the numeric rating scale (NRS) is clinically 
meaningful .24-27 No existing study parallels the outcomes of our proposed research (pain at time of osmotic 
dilator insertion using the numeric ra ting scale). One previous study used the Visual Analog Scale (a 0 -100mm 
linear scale) to compare  pain at the time of osmotic dilator insertion between a 1% lidocaine paracervical 
block and vaginal lidocaine gel.[ADDRESS_549199] 
correlation .42 The median pain score during osmotic dilator insertion in the 1% lidocaine paracervical block 
group was 61 (which correlates to 6 on the numeric rating scale) with a range from [ADDRESS_549200] a 2 -point difference on the NRS at the time of osmotic dilator insertion with 80% 
power and a two -sided alpha of 0.05, we will need a total of 5 2 patients in each study arm (2 6 per arm). We 
plan to stratify the groups by [CONTACT_433364] y (nulliparous versus multiparous) as vaginal parity may affect pain 
at the time of osmotic dilator insertion. In order to stratify by [CONTACT_433363], we will need a total of 10 4 
women  (52 in each strata)  to see a difference between strata per group. We pl an to enroll an additional 10% 
to account for protocol deviation and participant dropout for a total of 114 participants. With a one to one 
randomization allocation, approximately half will be randomized to receive a paracervical block with 
buprenorphine a nd 1% lidocaine and half will receive a paracervical block with 1% lidocaine alone. 
Additionally, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_433363] (vaginally nulliparous versus vaginally 
multiparous).   
 
Data Analysis  
 The baseline participant survey, NRS scores, side effects, and post -procedure participant and provider 
surveys will be performed by [CONTACT_433365]. This data 
will be transferred to a spreadsheet in SPSS . Bivariate comparisons will be analyzed using chi squared test or 
Fisher’s Exact test for categorical variables and t -test or Mann -Whitney for continuous variables depending on 
the distribution of the data as appropriate.  The primary outcomes will be eva luated per intent -to-treat 
analysis.

11. RECRUITMENT  
 The study will take place at UCSD and Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest. Patients either 
self-refer to these clinics or are referred by [CONTACT_213989]. At UCSD, appointments are coordinated by a 
Family Planning Manager. During the time of the study, when a participant presents to clinical care for a D&E 
for any indication, she will be counseled on options including induction termination and D&E.  If the patient 
desires a D&E and is at PPPSW, she will be assessed for ability to perform this proc edure in the outpatient 
surgical center. If the patient has medical co -morbidities that increase the risk of the procedure, she may be 
referred to UCSD or another tertiary care center.  
 If the patient is a good candidate for D&E and the procedure is sched uled to occur the next day, the 
clinician will assess the need for osmotic dilator placement for cervical preparation; this is usually known 
based on gestational age, however patients between [ADDRESS_549202] udy team member will then assess if the patient is interested in 
participating in the study, ensure that the patient is willing to be randomized to the study medication, and 
assess whether or not she has already taken ibuprofen that day in preparation for osmotic dilator placement. 
Eligibility criteria will be verified by [CONTACT_433366] . The study team member 
will obtain written informed consent to participate and perform the baseline survey.  The participant will 
receive 800mg  of oral ibuprofen if she has not already taken this medication prior to the appointment.  
 
We will use the below recruitment script:  
 
“We are conducting a study on pain control during osmotic dilator insertion.  You are eligible to participate 
because yo ur clinician has determined that is necessary to place dilators before your procedure . We are 
studyi ng the addition of a medication called buprenorphine to cervical anesthesia. We would like to know if 
this medica tion helps to decrease pain during and after the procedure.  We are looking for volunteers to 
participate in this study. This study will require that you participate in a pre -screening interview in which you 
will be asked questions about your basic health h istory. ” 
We are requesting a Waiver of Documented Consent before beginning the recruitment process. We are 
requesting approval to obtain a verbal consent before administering the pre -participation questionnaire. This 
questionnaire is a pre -screening tool a sking only inclusion/exclusion questions. It is necessary to carry out the 
research as we need to determine if they qualify for the study.  It is justified because the only record linking 
the subject and the research would be the consent document and the pr incipal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked whether the subject wants 
documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern.  It is minimal risk

authorization will be signed and scanned into the participant’s electr onic medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_433342].  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
If the patient choose s not to participate in the study,  they would receive  the standard of care  which is a 1% 
lidocaine paracervical block.   
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
1) Loss of confidentiality  
2) Pain w ith paracervical block  injection  or insertion of osmotic dilators  
3) Side effects of the study medication includ e feeling sleepy , vertigo, dizziness, headache, fatigue, 
itching, sweating, nausea, constipation, vomiting, temporary elevation of liver enzymes  
4) Rare side effects of the study medication includ e swelling, bruising or redness at the injection site;  low 
blood pressure ; constricted pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]; fainting ; or slow breathing . 
5) Unknown risks  
6) Risk of randomization: one assigned study group might prove to be less effective or have more side 
effects than the other study group  
 
 We will be purchasing intramuscular naloxone in the rare event of respi[INVESTIGATOR_433343]. This is an extremely rare anticipated side effect as the partial mu -
agonist properties of this drug typi[INVESTIGATOR_433344] a ceiling effect and prevents respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. However, 
we will have this medication on hand in clinic in case of this extre mely rare event.  
 Each clinic site is equipped with basic emergency equipment in the rare event that a medical 
emergency should happen during the study procedures. In the rare event of serious side effects (such as 
slowed breathing), naloxone would rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y reverse all side effects. Given the low dose of buprenorphine being 
administered, only one dose of naloxone would be necessary to reverse the effects of the medication.  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
1) Ensuring confidentiality by [CONTACT_20526] a patient study number and avoiding the use of patient 
identifiers . 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 11 2) The clinic is equ ipped with medical supplies if a participant  has dizziness or vasovagal symptoms. 
These symptoms are usually transient.  
3) If a woman decides to continue her pregnancy after administration of the study medication, there is 
unlikely to be any  additional increased  risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_433345] . There 
are far greater risks to pregnancy continuation due to osmotic dilator placement and resulting cervical 
dilation , and the buprenorphine does not mitigate or increase this risk . If a woman does decide to 
continue her pregnancy after she receives the study medication, she will be referred to perinatology 
for evaluation and for prenatal care.  
4) Data will not be shared between UCSD and Planned Parenthood. All study instruments and data 
collection forms will be on a UCSD tablet and administered by [CONTACT_433367]. There will be no 
exchange of data between the two study sites.  
5) All adverse events will be reported to the UCSD  IRB in a timely fashion. The management of 
information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol 
violations/deviations, interim results and protocol mo difications will be the responsibility of the PI ([CONTACT_433373] ).  
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Consent will be obtained in the patient’s private exam room, in the private clinical space where 
participant can ask questions without feelings of embarrassment or discomfort. The physical exam will be 
conducted in the private examination room. Data will b e reviewed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_433346]. Data will be monitored  quarterly  to ensure that data 
collection, co ding, and management procedures are being conducted according to protocol and ethical 
guidelines.  
There is a need for medical record access to assess patient demographics, history, and clinical 
outcomes. The baseline patient survey, NRS scores, side effects, and post -procedure participant a nd clinician 
surveys will be performed by [CONTACT_433368]. REDCap 
is a secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an 
intuitive interface for valida ted data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export 
procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; 
and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.  Study data will be  stored in the  HIPPA -secure de -
identified online REDCap data base housed at UCSD. Any printed study data will be secured in a locked 
cabinet/filebox , and only those directly involved in the study will have access to this including the 
investigators who will process it. Only de -identified data will be stored. Data entry and analysis will be 
performed on password -protected, institutionally secured compu ters. The research database will be banked 
indefinitely for the purpose of future research questions and will contain only de -identified information as 
above.   
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_433369] t ime 
points. The questionnaires will be sent over text via a hyperlink that connects to a secure platform that will 
input the data directly into a REDCap database. The application’s template function will be used to ensure all 
outgoing text messages are uni form. Any incoming text messages are returned to the secure application 
platform. A key linking the participant’s contact [CONTACT_433370] a locked 
cabinet in the study office separate from any data or patient information . 
 There will also be a need to collect participant email address es to send compensation via  Amazon e -
gift card s.  The research coordinator at UCSD, Marisa Hildebrand, is the only member of the study team who 
will have access to the email addresses from both sites; she will need email addresses in order to send e -gift 
cards.

Page [ADDRESS_549204] benefit from participation in this study. Ho wever, we hope that  this 
study will help us determine if the addition of buprenorphine to a lidocaine paracervical block is effective in 
reducing pain with and after osmotic dilator pla cement.  We hope that this study may change the practice of 
pain relief with osmotic dilator placement for women in the future.

The benefit of possibly decreased pain during and after osmotic dilator placement  outweighs  the small chance 
of any unknown risk in the buprenorphine group .

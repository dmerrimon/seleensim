Protocol Number  AXS -05-MDD -201 
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Active -Controlled Trial of AXS -05 Administered Orally to 
Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder  
Indication  Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)  
Development Phase  2 
Objective  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXS -05 and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871602] a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, Phase 2 trial, consisting of a screening 
period of up to 4 weeks, and a 6-week treatment p eriod.  
Screening Period  
Prior to randomization, all subjects will enter an up to four -week screening peri od (Screening) to 
determine eligibility. Eligible subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria for MDD without psychotic features, based on the 
Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition, Clinical Trials Version (SCID -5-CT), with a current major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_153864] 
[ADDRESS_1217473] meet all other inclusion and no exclusion  criteria.  
Treatment Peri od 
Randomization  
Subjects  who successfully  complete  Screening  will be randomly assigned at the baseline visit 
(Baseline)  to receive either AXS -05 or  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871603]  (SR)  in a 1:1 ratio  for 6 weeks. 
The randomization schedule will be computer -generated using a permuted  block algorithm that 
will randomly allocate the study drug to randomization numbers.  
Treatments  
Doses will be titrated as follows:  
 Days 1 - 3 
o AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 45 mg dextromethorphan QD  
o Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871604]: 105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871605]  
 Days 4 - 42  
o AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 45 mg dextromethorphan BID  
o Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871604]: 105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871606], orally on an empty stomach  (at least [ADDRESS_1217474]-prandial)  with water . All BID doses will be taken  at least 8 hours apart, orally  on an 
empty stomach (at least [ADDRESS_1217475]-prandial) with water. All study drug  is of 
identical appearance and similar weight in order to maintain the integrity of the blind.

Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 17 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder  characterized by 
[CONTACT_871654] a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a  
two-week period, and which impairs social, occupational, educational, or other important 
functioning. MDD is highly prevalent and difficult to treat. In 2016, 6.7 percent of adults aged 18 
or older (16.2 million adults) had at least one Major Depressive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_28948] e (MDE ) in the past year, 
and 4.3 percent of adults (10.3 million adults) had an MDE with severe impairm ent in the past 
year. Adults in 2016 who had an MDE with severe impairment represented nearly two -thirds (64.0 
percent) of adults who had a past year MD E. [1]. Results of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives 
to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial indicate that nearly two -thirds of treated patients with MDD 
do not experience adequate treatment response with first -line therapy, an d that the majority of 
these initial failures al so fail second -line treatment  [2], suggesting that there are significant 
limitations to current treatments. There is therefore an urgent need for new, mechanistically novel 
treatments for MDD . 
4.2 Rationale for the Evaluation  of AXS -05 for Major Depressive Disorder  
AXS -05 is being evaluated in the current study in subjects with MDD. AXS -05 is a fixed -dose 
combination of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871621] (DM). The bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871622]2D6. The rationale for the study of AXS -05 in depressive disorders is based on 
the neuropharmacology of  DM and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871623], clinical 
observations with these individual agents in depressed subjects,  and the positive pharmacokinetic 
interaction of DM and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871624]. Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871625] o f norepi[INVESTIGATOR_57174] [3]. DM 
is a noncompetitive N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, sigma -[ADDRESS_1217497] 
and inhibitor of the se rotonin transporter (SERT) and nor epi[INVESTIGATOR_29906] (NET) [4]. 
Combining the distinct and independent mechanisms of action of these two compounds may be 
additive or synergistic.  
The clinical utility of  DM has however been limited by [CONTACT_871655]2D6 in 
the majority of humans yielding low plasma levels even at high and repeated doses [5]. AXS -05 
addresses this limitation by [CONTACT_871656][INVESTIGATOR_2394].  As bupro pi[INVESTIGATOR_871626]2D6, co -administration of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871627]. In three  Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trials of AXS -05, administration of  
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871628] a significant increase in DM exposure (C max and 
AUC) at all doses tested (Axsome data on file).  Administration of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871629] C max and AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1217498] the pharmacokinetics of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. There was no significant difference in  the rates or  
types of adverse events in the combination groups as compared to a group receiving bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871630].  The positive pharmacokinetic interaction between bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871631]’s clinical utility in treating depression by [CONTACT_871657]’s plasma levels into a potentially 
therapeutic range.

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXS -05 and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_871632].  
6. STU DY DESIGN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, Phase 2 trial, consisting of a screening 
period and a 6 -week treatment period. The trial is being conducted in subjects experiencing a 
current depressive e pi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Informed consent will be obtained before any subsequent screening 
related procedures are performed. Assessments will include safety parameters, MADRS, QIDS -
SR-16, CGI -S and CGI -I. Subjects will be provided a Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) and 
asked to complete it daily.  
The study will be divided into 3 segments: an up to four -week screening period (Screening); a 6 -
week treatment period; and a 1 -week follow -up period. A sufficient number of subjects will be 
screened and randomized to achieve the goa l of having approximately 60 compliant subjects  who 
complete the double -blind treatment period . 
The study design is depi[INVESTIGATOR_90850] 6.1.

Investigators must attempt to contact [CONTACT_871661]. Should this be the 
cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section  10.2. 
Axsome  reserves the righ t to request the withdrawal of a subject because of  protocol violations or 
other reasons.  
The Investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study  or discontinue study drug 
treatment  at any time for any reason. Examples of reasons for discon tinuation may include:  
intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, 
administrative reasons, or in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], to protect the subject’s best interest.    
If a subject is withdrawn or discontinues  treatment before completing  the study, the reason and the 
date of discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Whenever 
possible and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion of the study 
should  be performed at the time a subject  withdraws from the study .   
Subject s who discontinue treatment should be encouraged to continue completing study visits and 
procedures so long as the subject  does not withdraw consent.

8.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly assigned  in a 1:[ADDRESS_1217524]’s treatment assignment . Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical 
monitor if possible. For emergency unblinding, the site will access the randomization code . If the 
Investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblind ing in advance, then he  or she must notify the 
medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s 
treatment assignment. To unblind the treatment group, the Investigator will open the envelope in 
which the rand omization code was received. The Investigator or designee must record the date and 
reason for study  drug discontinuation on the appropriate CRF for that subject. In all no nemergenc y 
cases, the Investigator must discuss the event with the medical monitor before  unblinding the 
subject’s treatment assignment.  
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding th ose of the remaining subjects in the 
study. T hus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s treatment assignment 
is unblinded, he  or she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The Investigator will 
make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.

[IP_ADDRESS].3.1  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS [14] is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severity of both su icidal ideation 
and beha vior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5 -item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspec ific 
active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to 
act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal 
ideation with specific plan and intent). The  C-SSRS also captures information about the intensity 
of ideation, specifically the frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the 
most severe types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5 -item scale: 0 (no suicidal 
behav ior), 1 (preparatory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 
(actual attempt). More than [ADDRESS_1217547] recent attempts.  
The C-SSRS will be completed at Visit s 1, 2, and 4  – 9. At Visit 1 (Screening ) the C-SSRS will 
be completed for the subject’s lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior, along w ith a recent 
recall period. At all other visits the C -SSRS will be completed for ideation and behavior with a 
recall period since the last visit.  
The C-SSRS will be administered  by [CONTACT_737] .

10.[ADDRESS_1217548]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether or not related to the product.  
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered A Es unless  there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition. (Worsening of a 
pre-existing condition is considered an AE.)  
Events that occur in s ubjects treated with active comparator or during treatment -free periods of the 
study are also considered A Es. 
Clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_85333] (e.g., cold,  
seasonal allergies, instead of “runny nose”).  
Please note medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occur ring during the study 
should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre -existing 
condition.

AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 37 The phrase “responses to a  study drug ” means that a causal relationship between a study drug  and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. All A Es judged 
by [CONTACT_871670] S ponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to a 
study drug  qualify as ADRs.  
All A Es for which the judgment of relationship to the study drug is “possible” or higher will be 
considered ADRs. If a relationship to the study drug is not  given, then the AE must be treated as 
if the relationsh ip to the study drug were “possible.”   
10.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
An expected AE or ADR  is an event  for which the nature or severity is consistent with the known 
AE profile of the product. For a  study drug , the known information is contained in the IB  and in 
the current package inserts for marketed drugs that contain the same active moiety . For a market ed 
product, the known information is contained in the current package insert for the product.  
An unexpected adverse event (UAE) or unexpected adverse drug reaction  (UADR) is an event  for 
which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current IB. For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater 
specificity) if the IB only listed  cerebral vascular accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples would be a) acute renal 
failure as an expected adverse rea ction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial nephritis 
(interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminant 
hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected.)  
10.1.4  Serious Adverse Events /Drug Reaction  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death . 
 Is life -threatening . 
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject  was at risk of death at the tim e of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
NOTE: Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31560] 24  hours in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103865].  
An elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88909] a condition present before exposure to the study  
drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not  qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE.  Further, an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871642], organization, or accommodation problems and without medical 
background does not need to be considered an SAE.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 Is a congenital anomaly . 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the study 
drug  during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject who 
has received a study drug  is not considered an SAE unless it is  suspected that the study 
drug (s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.

AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 38  Is an important medical event . 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events  that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871643] [ADDRESS_1217549] visit or evaluation. The Investigator will then 
monitor and/or ask about or evaluate A Es using nonleading questions, such as : 
 “How are you feeling?”  
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visi t?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered A Es. 
10.2.2  Evaluation  of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Adverse Events  
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as : 
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic interv ention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
It is important to distinguish between severe A Es and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity 
whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section  10.1.4 . 
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 39 [IP_ADDRESS]  Seriousness  
The Investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section  10.1.4 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Action(s) Taken  
Action(s) taken may consist of : 
Dose increased  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267]; either 
by [CONTACT_60268], strength , or amount.  
Dose  not changed  An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
Dose reduced  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_58413], 
either by [CONTACT_60268], strength , or amount.  
Drug interrupted  An indication that a medicati on schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60269] a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Drug withdrawn  An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination 
of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Not applicable  Determination of a valu e is not relevant in the current context.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome , including Fatal,  at the time of last observation will be classified  per CRF completion 
instructions.  Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than [ADDRESS_1217550]’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. 
Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death 
should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Relationship  to the Study Drug  
The Investigator will also assess the relationship (if any) between the AE and the study treatment 
(not related, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely ). 
The Investigator will use the following definitions to classify the relationshi p of an AE to study 
drug: 
Not related:  AEs which, after careful consideration, are clearly and undeniably unrelated 
because of extraneous causes (e.g. disease, environment);  
Unlikely:  This category can generally be considered applicable to those A Es which,  after 
careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be 
unrelated to the test drug. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related if or 
when at least two of the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event does not follow a  reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the test drug;  
2) The event could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject ; 
3) The event does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug;  
4) The event does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 40 Possibly :  This category applies to those A Es for which, after careful medical consideration at 
the time they are evaluated, a c onnection with the test drug administration appears 
unlikely, but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly 
related if or when at least two of the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal seque nce from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject ; 
3) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
Probably : This category applies to those A Es which, after careful medical consideration at the 
time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the 
test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if o r when least three of the 
following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456] ’s clinical state, en vironmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
3) The event disappears or decreases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_871644]. There are 
important exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of 
the drug, but d rug-relatedness clearly exists, e.g. bone marrow depression, fixed 
drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia;  
4) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
Definitely : This category applies to those A Es, which the Investigator feels are undeniably 
related to the test drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related 
if or when all the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not  be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
3) The event disappears or decreases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_871645] s 
with re -exposure to study drug  (Note: this does not mean that the subject  is to be 
re-exposed to study drug , however, a category of definitely related can only be 
used when recurrence is observed);  
4) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.

with the following information, where appropriate. (The period of observation for the study is 
described in Section  10.2.) 
 AE name [CONTACT_81620] . 
 When the AE first occurred (start date and time) . 
 When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”) .

 Seriousness ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_718509]) . 
 Actions taken . 
 Outcome . 
 Investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_871646] (s). 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1217552] may continue in the 
study  at the discretion of Axsome  after consultation with the Investigator and/or medical monitor.  
Any time a subject  reports an AE that is considered to be serious, he or she  should be encouraged 
to return to the site to be evaluated, which will include having blood and urine samples taken for 
drug concentrations. Recent dietary information will be collected.  
If AEs occ ur in a subject that are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of the study 
drug is not reasonable in view of the potential benefit to the subject, the Investigator must decide 
whether to stop the study and/or treat the subject . Special proc edures may be recommended for the 
specific study drug , such as the collection of a blood  sample for plasma  concentrations of the study 
drug, specific tapering procedures, or treatment regimens, as appropriate.  
For double -blinded studies, it is not necessar y to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment in most 
circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see Section  8.6 for a 
description of the unblinding procedures.  
10.2.5  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be 
explained by [CONTACT_17648](s) (i .e., concurrent condition or medication) an d clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject’s medical record and recorded on the appropriate 
CRF.

The Investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. 
Findings must be repo rted on the Pregnancy and Lactation Exposure Form /other designated form 
and forwarded to the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results 
in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital anomaly.  If the pregnancy is associated wi th an SAE 
(e.g., if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a separate SAE Form must be filed with the 
appropriate serious criterion (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated in addition to the aforementioned 
designated form.  
10.3.3  Overdose  
The dose of study drug  specified in the protocol  should not be exceeded during the study.  
Overdose that occurs during the study will be treated and documented as an AE/ UAE /SAE if it 
fulfills the criteria. If the overdose does not result in an AE, it should be reported in written f orm 
to the designated individual(s) who receive SAE notification. The information contained therein 
should include study site identification, reporter identification, subject identification, study drug , 
dose, action taken (e .g., administration of antidote [if available] or supportive measures or 
therapy), and any comments.

guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorities  (Section 15.1 and Appendix  B). While delegation 
of certain  aspects of the study to S ub-Investigators and study coordinators is appropriate, the 
Investigator will remain personally accountable for closely overseeing the study and for ensuring 
compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelin es. The Investigator is 
responsible for maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated study -related 
responsibilities (e .g., Sub-Investigators and study coordinators) and their specific study -related 
duties.  
Investigators should ensure that all  persons who have been delegated study -related responsibilities 
are adequately qualified and informed about the protocol, study drug s, and their specific duties 
within the context of the study. Investigators are responsible for providing Axsome  with 
docume ntation of the qualifications, GCP training, and research experience for themselves and 
their staff as required by [CONTACT_871679].  
To ensure compliance with the guidelines, the study will be audited by [CONTACT_81595]. The

13.3.2  Case Report Forms  
By [CONTACT_81593]’s Agreement (Section  17.1), the Investigat or agrees to maintain 
accurate CRF s and source documentation as part of the case histories for all participating subjects.  
Case report forms are considered confidential docume nts and should be handled and stored 
accordingly. Axsome  or its designee will provide the necessary train ing on the use of the specific 
CRF s used during the study to ensure that the study information is captured accurately and 
appropriately.  
To ensure data  accuracy, CRF data for individual subject visits should be completed as soon as 
possible after the visit. All requested information must be entered on the CRFs according to the 
completion guidelines provided by [CONTACT_871674].  
The Investigator wil l sign off each subject casebook . These signatures serve to attest that th e 
information contained in the CRF s is accurate and true.  
13.3.[ADDRESS_1217563] CRF data may be  used as original data collection tools as long as a 
description of this documentation process is maintained in the Investigator’s study files. Before 
the study starts, a list identifying any data to be recorded directly on the CRFs ( i.e., no prior written 
or electronic record of data) and considered to be source data will be provided.

to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
separated into two categories: Investigator’s study file and subject  clinical source documents.  
 The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments (if 
applicable), CRF guidelines, CRF query forms, I RB/I EC and governmental approval with 
correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization 
forms and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
 Subject  clinical source documents (which are usually defined by [CONTACT_871684]) may include subject  and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871649], physician’s and nurse’s notes, appoi ntment book, original laboratory reports, X -
ray, pathology and special assessment reports, consultant’s letters, screening and 
enrollment log, etc.  
The subject ’s involvement in the study should be clearly documented in the study site’s clinical 
records. De tails should include the study protocol number, the subject ’s screening and 
randomization number, the subject ’s consent to take part in the study (including the date of 
consent), the dates of all study visits, details of any treatments withdrawn because of  study 
participation, the dates of dispensing study drug , details of any A Es (including any SAEs), and

GCP (including archiving of essential study documents), the [ADDRESS_1217569] review and approve the protocol, the Investigator’s 
informed consent document, and related subject information and recruitment materials before the 
start of the study . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that written informed consent is obtained from 
the subject before any activity or procedure is undertaken that is not part of routine care.  
According to the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP, subje cts must provide their written 
informed consent before  enrollment in a clinical study and before any protocol -specified 
procedures are performed.  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject  (if the subject  is 
capable in the judgment of the I nvestig ator to provide informed consent)  or the subject’s 
authorized representative.  For subjects  that are not capable of providing informed consent,  but are 
capable of providing assent, the subject  will be asked to provide assent. If the subject  is not ca pable 
of providing assent, the I nvestigator will document the reasons why and maintain that  
documentation with the other informed consent documents. The written ICF will embody the 
elements of informed consent as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and will also comply 
with local regulations.  
Each subject should be made aware by [CONTACT_871688] ( i.e., objectives, 
methods, and potential hazards and benefits)  and the procedures involved, using the information 
on the ICF. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. Subjects  (and if necessary, legal representatives ) must be 
given ample opport unity to inquire about details of the study.  
Subject information and the ICF must be in a language fully comprehen sible to the prospective 
subject . The written information must be provided to the subject  and to give them  sufficient time 
to understand the i nformation and to prepare questions before being asked for their consent. The 
Investigator must confirm that the text was understood by [CONTACT_120937]’s authorized 
representative . Subjects capable of signing consent, or the subject’s authorized  representative, will 
then sign and date the IRB/IEC -approved consent form indicating that they have given their 
consent to participate in the study. The signature s confirm the consent s are based on information 
that has been understood. The form s will also  be signed by [CONTACT_737] , or designee,  obtaining 
the consent s and annotated with the study subject number. Each subject’s signed ICF s must be 
kept on file by [CONTACT_871689], Axsome,  and/or 
designate d personnel. Collection of informed consent has to be documented on the CRF.  
Furthermore, the subject will be informed that if they wish to dropout or withdraw (see  Section  7.3) 
at any time during the study, this will not have any negative consequences. Subjects may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_871690]. Subjects will be  asked to agree to a final assessment in the event of an 
early termination of the study.

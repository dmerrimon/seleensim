Protocol Title:
A Two Part, Randomized, Open- label, Cross over Study  in Healthy  Elderl y Participants
to Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability  of Hy drobromide Salt Tablet Formulations of 
Danirixin in the Fed and Fasted States, and to Evaluate the Effect of Food and Gastric 
Acid Secretion Suppression on Danir ixin Pharmacokinetics Following Administration of 
Hydrobromide Salt Tablets.
Short Title:
[COMPANY_004]1325756 Relative Bioavailability  Study  in Healthy  Elderl y Participants
Rationale:
Part A of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK of [ADDRESS_923377] tablet fo rmulations 
of the HBr salt of danirixin in healthy  elderl y participants in fed and fasted conditions in 
comparison to the current HBr salt tablet formulation. The current formulation is a 
hemihy drate salt tablet formulation manufactured using roller compac tion (RC). The test 
formulations are manufactured b y direct compression (DC) and will investigate the 
performance of these DC tablets, as well as the inclusion of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_681953] (HPMC) . Formulation selection for Part B will occ ur following review of 
the PK data collected in Part A.
Part B of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK using the selected 
formulation from Part A in the fed and fasted state; during gastric acid suppression and in 
the monohy drate state under fed conditions 
in a population of healthy  elderly  
participants. Danirixin is currentl y administered with food, therefore the investigation of 
food effect for the selected formulation could potentially  enable dosing without food. 
Additionally , omeprazole ( OMP)is being administered with the selected formulation to 
investigate a potential PK interaction as gastric pH has been shown to alter PK exposure 
and this study  will further enable us to investigate OMPs influence in the presence and 
absence of food. Fin ally, the monohy drate tablet simulates a hemihy drate to monohy drate 
tablet in stressed conditions.
The outcome of this study will contribute to the selection of the most appropriate 
formulation/dosing regimen for future studies. 2018N378719_00

Overall Design:
This is a Phase I, two part (Part A and Part B each part contains 2 Group s), randomized, 
open -label, single dose, cross -over stud y conducted with healthy elderl y participants. Part 
A will support the selection of the formulation and Part B will address the Proton Pump 
Inhibitor (PPI)effect, food effect and PK of the monohydrate.
Part A
In Part A, approximately  16 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  13 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments for all planned 
treatment periods. The 16 par ticipants will be randomized and designated to go into one 
of two (2) groups, Group 1 and Group 2 . Group 1 will be administered danirixin in the 
fedstate in all treatment periods. Group 2 will be administered danirixin in the f asted
state in a lltreatment periods. Participant s will undergo a screening period ~[ADDRESS_923378] d ose of danirixin . 
Eligible participant s will be admitted to the clinical facilities on Day  -1 of each treatment 
period. 
On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or auth orized study  unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s wi ll be discharged from the unit 
approximately  24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923379] dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten days following the last dose of 
danirixin, participant s will return to the clinic for the final follow-up visit. Refer to 
Secti on 2 for study  assessments and timepoints. 
A minimum washout period of 5 day s is required between dosing in 
each treatment 
period. A study  design schematic for Part A is presented in Table 1. 2018N378719_00

Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential 
strategy  for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman
, 2009].  A reduction in tissue 
and airway  neutrophilia is expected to result in downstream effects on mucus 
hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruct ion that are h ypothesized to 
underlie the development and worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s ymptoms and decline in lung 
function that occurs in COPD.
Molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity  have been shown to reduce the influx of 
neutrophils into the lungs in hea lthy participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) 
and to reduce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, 
neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis in association with improvements in 
measures of disease activity  in some, but not all, studies [O'By [CONTACT_7943], 2016; Holz , 2010;
Watz , 2016, Lazaar 2011; Nair, 2012; Rennard , 2015 ]. Overall, the results of the reported 
clinical studies with CXCR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target 
patient population is important to achieving clinical benefit.
Danirixin is a selective CXCR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti -
inflammatory  agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory
 diseases and 
influenza.  Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity  both in 
vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number , 
YM2010/[ZIP_CODE]/07]. 
3.1. Stud y Rationale
Part A of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK of [ADDRESS_923400] tablet formulations 
of the HBr salt of danirixin in healthy  elderl y subjects in fed and fasted conditions in 
comparison to the current HBr salt tablet f ormulation. The current formulation is a 
hemihy drate salt tablet formulation manufactured using roller compaction (RC). The test 
formulations are manufactured b y direct compression (DC) and will investigate the 
performance of these smaller DC tablets, as w ell as the inclusion of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_681954] (HPMC) . Formulation selection for Part B will occur 
following review of the PK data collected in Part A.
Part B of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK using the selected 
formulation from Part A in the fed and fasted state; during gastric acid suppression and in 
the monohy drate state under fed conditions in a population of healthy  elderly  subjects. 
Danirixin is currently  administered with food, therefore the investigation of f ood effect  2018N378719_00

3.2. Background
COPD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of 
deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly  to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006;
Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016 ].  The morbidity  and mortality  of 
COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by  [CONTACT_2892] 2020, COPD is 
expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability
[Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016].  The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD 
is primarily  due to small ai rway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an 
excessive inflammatory  response in the lung, mainly  caused b y cigarette smoking [Celli , 
2004].  COPD is characterized by  [CONTACT_681975], in many  patients, 
progressi ve breathlessness (or dy spnea), cough and sputum production.  Many  COPD 
patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_681955] [ Hurst , 2010].  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_681956] s ymptoms 
(COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of COPD
-related and total 
health care costs.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_681957], many  COPD patients continue to 
experience a high burden of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s ymptoms and COPD exacerbations resulting in a 
continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016].  Additionally , there is growing 
recognition that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well 
as smokers with preserved lung function suffer from a high burden of s ymptoms and 
COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [Woodruff , 2016].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85668] y further reduce COPD exa cerbations and improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_681958] a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly  
result in an improvement in COPD patients’ quality  of life.
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideli
nes for the 
treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the management of 
current respi[INVESTIGATOR_681959] s ymptoms resulting in COPD 
exacerbations should be an important component of COPD patient management [ GOL D, 
2016].  
Danirixin is being evaluated as an addition to standard of care inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. long 
acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) and is targeting those COPD patients tha t continue to have a burden of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_681960] y

Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale fo r Risk Mitigation Strategy
Testicular effects and male fertility Clinical exposure limits will be based on the 
NOAELs for testicular toxicity ; other 
findings described above occurred at non -
tolerated doses and/or at sy stemic exposures 
well in excess of th e maximum oral or 
maximum predicted intravenous exposure in 
human subjects or were considered non -
adverse and monitorable. Exposure margins 
derived from the 26 and 39 week toxicology  
studies in rats and dogs, respectivel y, with 
DNX are considered sufficien t to support 
oral and intravenous infusion administration 
of DNX in single and repeat -dose clinical 
studies under the proposed dosing regimens.
Clear NOAELs for testicular effects were 
established in the rat at 50 mg/kg/day  and at 
10 mg/kg/day  in the dog a fter oral 
administration of DNX. These doses 
resulted in sy stemic exposures which are 7.7 
and 23.5- fold respectively  the exposure for 
an oral clinical dose of 75 mg BID (AUC0-
24 of 8.734 µg.h/mL) and [ADDRESS_923403] (IP) [Danirixin, [COMPANY_004]1325756]

intravenous infusion clinical dose of 50 mg 
BID (AUC0 -24 of 21.94 µg.h/mL).
Impairment of host defense . Host defense has not been studied directly  
in nonclinical studies. However, data in 
nonclinical species have not identified an 
increased risk of infection with danirixin.  
Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with 
two CXCR2 antagonists in the same 
chemical class as danirixin have not shown 
an increase in infections in challenge 
models (e.g., influenza viral load).  
Secondary  bacterial infections after viral 
infection have not been directly  evaluated in 
nonclinical studies.
The data from clinical studies including 
healthy  participants, COPD and influenza 
patients thus far show no evidence that 
participants taking danirixin have an 
increased infection rate compared with 
partici pants taking placebo.
Neutropenia has been reported in clinical 
trials of other CXCR2 antagonists.  No 
instances of neutropenia have been reported 
in nonclinical studies with danirixin.  I n Monitoring of neutrophil count.

), decreased neutrophil

receiving either placebo or danirixin; no 
instances of danirixin -related neutropenia 
have been reported in clinical studies to 
date. In healthy  participants , the data are 
confounded b y the observation of low 
neutrophil counts before dosing or at 
follow -up, and were not dose -related, while 
in patients with influenza, neutrophil counts 
recovered 
while receiving danirixin, 
coincident with resolution of the viral 
infection. There have been no reports of 
neutrophil count decreases below the lower

These data support the conclusion that a

5. STUDY DESIGN
5.1. Overall Design
This is a Phase I, two part (Part A and Part B each part contains 2 Groups ), random ized, 
open -label, single dose, cross -over stud y conducted with healthy elderl y participants. Part 
A will support the selection of the formulation and Part B will address the PPI  [CONTACT_177209], 
food effect and PK of the monohy drate.
Part A
In Part A, approximately 16 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  13 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments for all planned 
treatment periods. The 16 participants will be randomized and designated to go into one 
of two (2) groups, Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 will be administered danirixin in the 
fed state in all treatment periods. Group 2 will be administered danirixin in the fasted  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
32state in all treatment periods. Participant s will undergo a screening period ~[ADDRESS_923407] dose of danirixin . 
Eligible participant s will be admitted to the clinical facilities on Day  -1 of each treatment 
period. 
On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or authorized study  unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin toeach participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s will be discharged from the unit 
approximat ely 24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923408] dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten day s following the last dose of 
danirixin , participant s will return to the clinic for the final follow - up visit. Refer to 
Section 2 for study  assessments and timepoints. 
A minimum w ashout period of 5 day s is required between dosing in 
each treatment 
period. A study  design schematic for Part A is presented in Table 1.
Part B
In Part B, approximately  24 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  20 subjects (10 subjects per group) complete dosing and critical 
assessments for all planned treatment periods in Group 1 and 2. 
In Part B Group 2 eligible participants will take omeprazole (OMP), [ADDRESS_923409] dosing of danirixin through all periods and 
washouts until the final treatment period 3 PK assessment (48hr). Participant s
will be 
provided with a participant diary  to document daily  recordings of OMP dosing occurring 
outside of the u nit.
For Part B Group 2, once screened , eligible participants will be instructed to return to the 
clinic on Day  -[ADDRESS_923410] dose 48h PK assessment. 
ForGroup 1 and 2 e ligible participants will be admitted to the clinical facilities on Day  -1 
of each treatment period.  2018N378719_00

207573
33On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the inve stigator or authorized study  unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s will be discharged from the unit 
approximately  24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923411] dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten day s following the last dose of 
danirixin participant s will return to the clinic for the final follow -up visit. Refer to 
Section [ADDRESS_923412] two (2) groups of participants, 
Group 1 and Group 2. There will be approximately 8 participants in each group. 
In Part B, approximately 24 participants ( 12 participants per group)will be randomized 
such that approximately  [ADDRESS_923413] completed the study  if he/she has completed all 
phases of the stud y including the final follow -up visit for the part for which they  were 
enrolled.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last p articipant in the 
study .
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study  Design
This study  will use a single dose , open label, cross -over design. This is a well -established 
design to evaluate the relative bioavailability  of new formulations of an investigational 
drug. 
5.5. Dos
e Justification
Theoral dose strength of 50 mg d anirixin HBr will be administered as a single dose in all 
thetreatment period s inthe present study . This is a clinically  relevant danirixin dose level  2018N378719_00

207573
34and was also the dose used in Clinical Study  201037 [ GlaxoSmithKline Document 
Number ,2015N248339_00].
In Group 2 of Part B, subjects will take an oral dose of 40 mg OMP QD in the morning 
for four day s prior to the initial danirixin dosing day  until 48 hrs after the final danirixin 
dosing day .On the danirixin dosing days, the OMP will be taken in the morning with the 
dose of danirixin.  This omeprazole dose strength and regimen is the same as that 
administered during Clinical Study  201037 [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number , 
2015N248339_00
].The co -administration of [ADDRESS_923414] of OMP on acid secretion increases, reaching a plateau after four days [Sachs ,

207573
39demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility  criteria, and an y serious adverse events 
(SAEs ).
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) 
may be rescreened if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the reason for screen failure is 
temporary  and it can be reasonabl y expected to resolve. Any rescreens must take place 
within the planned screening period so as to not c ause an y undue prolongation of the 
planned study  completion.
Any re-screened participant must meet all the protocol specific inclusion/exclusion 
requirements at the re -screen visit. All screening procedures must be repeated for subjects 
that are re -screen ed.If a subject screen fails prior to randomization, he/she can be re -
screened once if the site staff feels the subject meets eligibility  criteria.
Rescreened participants willbe assigned a unique screening number for each time they  
are screened and wi ll receive a participant number when enrolled.

458.1.2. QTc Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
The same QT correction formula must be used for each indi vidual participant to 
determine eligibility  for and discontinuation from the study .  This formula may  not 
be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled.
For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then 
QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this 
individual participant as well.
Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , 
the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data 
being collected for dat a analysis .  Safety  ECGs and other non -protocol specified 
ECGs are an exception.  
The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate 
electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period.  
A subject that meets 
either bulleted criterion based on the average of triplicate ECG 
readings will be withdrawn from study  treatment.   
QTc orQTcB or QTcF > 500 msec,
Change from baseline: QTc >60 msec
See the Section 2 for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and 
follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
8.1.3. Neutrophil Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
A participant with a peripheral blood neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on 
repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing.  The neutrophil count should be 
monitored daily  until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 7.
8.2. Withdrawal from the Study
A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time a t his/her own request, 
or may  be withdrawn at any  time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , 
behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the 
sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such a 
withdrawal of consent.
If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of any  
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site 
study  records.
Refer tothe 
Section [ADDRESS_923428] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required stud y visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_941] p articipant and reschedule the missed visit 
as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study .
Before a par ticipant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee 
must make every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or loc al equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_19425]’s medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study  with a primary  reason of lost to follow -up. 
9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed 
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to d etermine if the participant should continue or 
discontinue study  treatment.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study
 conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and revie wed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening 
log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may  be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and was 
performed within the time frame defined in the Section 2. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_923429] be noted: 
If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should 
occur in the following order:
1. 12- lead ECG
2.vital signs
3.blood dra ws.  
Note: The timing of the assessments should allow the blood draw to occur at the 
exact nominal time.
The timing and number of planned study  assessments, including PK and safety  
assessments, may  be altered during the course of the study  based on newl y 
available data (e.g., to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma 
concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
The change in timing or addition of time points for any  planned stud y 
assessments must be documented in a Note to File which is approv ed by [CONTACT_681979] y team members (e.g. medical monitor and GCSP) and then 
archived in the stud y sponsor and site study files, but this will not constitute a 
protocol amendment. 
The I RB will be informed of any  safet y issues that require alteration of the 
safet y monitoring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form. 
No more than 
500 mL of blood will be collected over the duration of the study .
9.1. Efficacy
This study  is a single dose PK study  and therefore there is no efficacy  endpoint.
9.2. Adverse Ev ents
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 .
The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for
following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study  treatment or the study ,
or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Appendix 4 ). 
9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting A E and SA E 
Information
AllSAE swill be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow
-up visit
at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2).
All AEs will be collected from thestart of treatment until the follow- up visit at 
the time poin ts specified in the SoA (Section 2). 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
48Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study  treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section.
All SAE swill be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 
hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any  updated 
SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study  
participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, 
at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she
considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  
participation, the investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs
and the procedures for completing a nd transmitting SAE reports are provided in
Appendix 4 .
9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrence. 
9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is 
resol ved, stabilized, otherwise
explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as 
defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in 
Appendix 4 .
9.2.4. Regulatory  Rep orting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of 
participants and the safety  of a study  treatment under clinical investiga tion are 
met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  
authority  and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment 
under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific 
regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, 
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and 
investigators.
Investigator safety
 reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory  requirements and 
sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
49An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or 
other specific safet y information eg, summary  or listing of SA E) from the 
sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and 
will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
9.2.5. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the sta rt of 
study  treatment and until [ADDRESS_923430] dose of study  treatment .
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform GS Kwithin 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE s
.
9.3. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of study  treatment 4 tablets in a day  will be conside red an 
overdose.
[COMPANY_004] does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should :
1.Contact [CONTACT_27465] .
2.Closely  monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory  abnormal ities until 
danirixin can no longer be detected systemically  (at least 3 days).
3.Obtain a sample for PK analy sis within [ADDRESS_923431] dose of study  
treatment if requested b y the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis).
4.Docume nt the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in 
the CRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  [CONTACT_681980] t he 
participant.
9.4. Safet y Assessments
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the Section 2.
9.4.1. Physical Examinations
A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
Cardiovascula r, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , Gastrointestinal and Neurological s ystems. Height 
and weight will also be measured and recorded. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
50A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (auscultation and p alpation of 
the abdomen including examination of the liver and spleen) .
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous 
serious illnesses.
9.4.2. Vital Signs
Oral temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], and blood pressure will be 
assessed. Heart Rate and Blood Pressure will be assessed at [ADDRESS_923432] dose and at the early termination/final follow -up visit only . 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completel y 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only  if an automated device 
is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded b y at least [ADDRESS_923433] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, 
television, cell phones).
Vital signs (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory  tests) will consist 
of 1 pulse and 3 blood pressure measurements (3consecutive blood pressure 
readings will be recorded at intervals of at least 1 minute) at time points 
specified in Section 2. The average of the 3 blood pressure readings will be 
recorded on the CRF.
Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] [ADDRESS_923434] and 
will include temperature, sy
stolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842].
9.4.3. Electrocardiograms
Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA ( Section 2)using an 
ECG machine that automatically  calculates the heart rate and measures PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section [8.1.2] for QTc withdrawal 
criteria and additional QTc readings that may  be necessary .
9.4.4. Clinical Safety  Laboratory  Assessments
Refer to 
Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and 
to the SoA for the timing and frequency . 
The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and 
record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE 
section of the CRF. The laboratory  reports must be filed with the source 
documents. Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings are those which 
are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator 
to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.
All laborator y tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal 
during participation in the study  or within 3daysafter the last dose of study   2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L

51treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are 
no longer considered signific antly  abnormal by  [CONTACT_43210]. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified.
All protocol -required laborat ory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the Section 2.
If laboratory  values from non
-protocol specified laboratory  assessments 
performed a t the institution’s local laboratory  require a change in participant 
management or are considered clinically  significant by  [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE 
or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.
9.5. Pharmacokinetics
Whole blood samples of approximately  2 mL  will be collected for measurement 
of whole blood concentrations of danirixin (performed under the control of [COMPANY_004] 
Platform Technology  and Science Department of In Vitro I n Vivo Translation 
Third Party  Resourcing (PTS -IVIVT/TPR) as specified in the Section 2.
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided 
by [CONTACT_681981] . The actual date and time (24
-hour clock time) of each 
sample will be recorded.
Sample s will be used to evaluate the PK of danirixin . Each whole blood sample
will be used to prepare 4 dried blood spots which will be anal ysed for danirixin 
concentrations.  Samples collected for anal yses of danirixin whole blood 
may also 
be used to evaluate s afety  or efficacy  aspects related to concerns arising during or 
after the stud y.

10.1. Sample Size Determination
The sample size is primarily  based on feasibility .Approximately  60 participants will be 
enrolled in the study to obtain approximately 8 randomized participants (6 completers) in
each group in Part A and approximately 12 randomized subjects (10 completers) in each 
group inPart B.  
The within
-subject variability  for AUC(0- inf), AUC(0- t) and Cmax of danirixin [[COMPANY_004]
Study  201037, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00 ] was estimated to 
be 37.3%, 39.3% and 44.7%, respectively . Based upon the largest within -subject 
coefficient of variation (44.7% for Cmax of danirixin) and a sample size of 6subjects 
completing each group in part A of the study, it is estimated that the half -width of the 
90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means for the comparison of interest 
should be no more than 42 % of the point estimates. Assuming an observed ratio of one, 
the corresponding 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means would be 
0.[ADDRESS_923436] the formulation for 
evaluation in Part B .
10.1.1. Sample Size Sensiti vity
The figure below shows the half width of the 90% CI  for a range of within -subject 
coefficient of variations for various sample sizes.

10.1.2. Sample Size Re -estimation or A djustment
No sample size re -estimation will be performed.
10.2. Populations for A nalyses
For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_923437] one dose of study  
medication. This population will be used for the study  
population and safet y analyses.
PKAll participants for whom a pharmacokinetic sample was 
obtained and analy zed. This will be the population used for 
all the pharmacokinetic display s.
10.3. Statistical A nalyses
Final anal yses will be performed after the completion of the study and final dataset 
authorization. 
Data will be listed and summarized separatel y for each part of the stud y according to 
GlaxoSmithKline reporting standards where applicable. 
Complete details will be documented in the Reporting and Analy sis Plan (RAP).
10.3.1. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated b y standard non- compartme ntal anal ysis 
according to GlaxoSmithKline current working practices. . Calculations will be based on 
the actual sampling times recorded during the study. From the blood concentration -time 
data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined, as data permit: 
maximum observed blood concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), area under the 
blood concentration -time curve [AUC(0- t), AUC(0 -inf), AUC(0 -24)], lag time before 
observation of first blood concentration (tlag), time of last observed blood concentration 
(tlast), and apparent terminal phase half -life (t1/2).
Pharmacokinetic data will be listed and presented in graphical form and will be 
summarized descriptively. Complete details will be documented in the Reporting and 
Analy sis Plan (RAP).
Thepoint estimates of the geometric least squares (GL S) mean ratio for the PK 
parameters (AUC and Cmax) and the associated 90% CI s will be provided for treatment 
comparisons (test:reference). The PK parameters will be log -transformed prior to anal ysis 
and tr eatment comparisons will be expressed as ratios on the original scale. 2018N378719_00

Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of A E
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  participant, temporally  
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the 
study  treatment.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, ra diological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of 
underly ing disease).
Exacerbation of a c hronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" constitutes anAE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
66Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease).
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence tha t, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall ymight have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay ) atthe hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19950]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217610], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen fr om 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is acongenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
67reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268678]. These events should usually  
be considered serious.
Examples of such even ts include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Recording A Eand SA E
AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
The investigator will then record all re levant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004] /AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_681966] b y [COMPANY_004] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_31785] .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensit y for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that ca uses sufficiently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for rating 
the intensity  of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
68Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable possibility " of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather th an a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the ev ent to study  treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] .Howeve r, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] .
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_31859]/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopatho logical examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a cop y of an y post-mortem 
findings including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information. 2018N378719_00

207573
69Reporting of SA Esto [COMPANY_004]
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Electr onic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data 
collection tool (e.g., InForm).
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section).
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within 
the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the 
relationship of each SAE to I P/study  participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE 
entry  into the eCRF.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entr y of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to the medical monitor or SAE coordinator by  [CONTACT_756].
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the study  procedures manual . 2018N378719_00

[PHONE_14170].5. Appendix 5: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of 
Pregnancy  Info rmation
Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below)
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2. P remenopausal female with ONE of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examinatio n, or medical history  interview.
3. P ostmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in 
the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  
(HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraceptio n Guidance
Female participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to 
use a highly effective method of contraception consistently  and correctly  as described in 
Table 8. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L

transdermal 
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb
injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
Implantable progestog en-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner 
(A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception metho d provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. )
Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a hi ghly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the p referred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)
NOTES: 
a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants inclinical studies. 
b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_923447] dose of study treatment 
Pregnancy  Testing
WOCBP should only  be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative 
highl y sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test 
Pregnancy  testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when 
pregnancy  is otherwise suspected  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
72Pregnancy testing, with a sensitivity  of 5 mI U/mL will be performed using the test 
kit provided by  [CONTACT_497614] i n accordance with instructions provided in 
its pa ckage insert .  
Collection of Pregnancy  Information
Male participants with partners who become pregnant
Investigator will not routinely  attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male 
participant’s female partner(s) who becomes pregnant while the male participant is 
participating in this study; however, voluntary  reports of such incidents will be 
captured through the [COMPANY_004] standard reporting mechanism. This applies only to male 
participants who receive double
-blind study  treatment.
If pregnancy  informati on for a male participant’s female partner(s) is voluntarily  
reported, after obtaining the necessary  signed informed consent from the pregnant 
female partner directl y, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy .
Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004]
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery  date. An y termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure
Female Participants who become pregnant
Investigator will coll ect pregnancy  information on any  female participant, who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to [COMPANY_004] within 
24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy . 
Participant w ill be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The 
investigator will collect follow up information on participant and neonate, which will 
be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] Generall y, follow- up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks bey ond the esti mated delivery  date.  
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or ele ctive termination of a pregnancy  will be reported as an AE or 
SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  which is considered 
reasonabl y related to t he study  treatment by  [CONTACT_093], will be reported to [COMPANY_004] 2018N378719_00

A Two Part, Randomized, Open- label, Cross over Study  in Healthy Elderl y Participants
to Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability  of Hy drobromide Salt Tablet Formulations of 
Danirixin in the Fed and Fasted States, and to Evaluate the Effect of Food and Gastric 
Acid Secretion Suppression on Danirixin Pharmacokinetics Follo
wing Administration of 
Hydrobromide Salt Tablets.
Short Title:
[COMPANY_004]1325756 Relative Bioavailability  Study  in Healthy  Elderl y Participants
Rationale:
Part A of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK of [ADDRESS_923454] tablet formulations 
of the HBr salt of danirixin in healthy  elderl y participants in fed conditions in comparison 
to the current HBr salt tablet formulation. The current formulation is a hemihy drate salt 
tablet formulation manufactured using roller compaction (RC). The test formulations are 
manufactured b y direct compression (DC) and will investigate the performance of these 
DC tablets, as well as the inclusion of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_681968] 
(HPMC) . Formulation selection for Part B will occur following review of the PK data 
collected in Part A.
Part B of this study  will provide an understanding of the PK using the selected 
formulation from Part A in the fed and fasted state; during gastric acid suppression and in 
the monohy drate state under fed conditions in a population of heal thy elderly  
participants
. Danirixin is currentl y administered with food, therefore the investigation of 
food effect for the selected formulation could potentially  enable dosing without food. 
Additionally , omeprazole ( OMP )is being administered with the sel ected formulation to 
investigate a potential PK interaction as gastric pH has been shown to alter PK exposure 
and this study  will further enable us to investigate OMPs influence in the presence and 
absence of food. Finally , the monohy drate tablet simulates a hemihy drate to monohy drate 
tablet in stressed conditions.
The outcome of this study will contribute to the selection of the most appropriate 
formulation/dosing regimen for future studies. 2018N378719_00

Overall Design:
This is a Phase I, two part (Part A and Part B wh ich contains 2 Strata), randomized, open -
label, single dose, cross -over study  conducted with healthy  elderl y participants. Part A 
will support the selection of the formulation and Part B will address the PPI [CONTACT_177209], food 
effect and PK of the monohy drate.
Part A
In Part A, approximately  16 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  13 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments for all planned 
treatment periods. Participant s will undergo a screening period ~[ADDRESS_923455] 
dose of danirixin . 
Eligible participant s will be admitted to the clinical f acilities on Day  -1 of each treatment 
period. 
On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or authorized study  unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s wi ll be discharged from the unit 
approximately  24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923456] dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are co mplete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten days following the [ADDRESS_923457] 
dose of 
DNX 
 
Part B 
 
In Part B, approximately 24 healthy elderly participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately 20 subjects (10 subjects pe r strata) complete dosing and critical 
assessments for all planned treatment periods in Strata 1 and 2.  
In Part B Stratum 2 eligible participants w ill take omeprazole (OMP), 40 mg from Day -4 
to day of final PK assessment (48hr) for treatment period 3. Participants will be provided 
with a participant diary to document daily r ecordings of OMP dosi ng occurring outside of 
the unit. 
Eligible participants will be admitted to the c linical facilities on Day -1 of each treatment 
period.  On Day 1 of each treatment period, followi ng completion of the required pre-dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or author ized study unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg daniri xin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participants will undergo clinical safety  assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participants will be discharged from the unit 
approximately 24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion.  Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately [ADDRESS_923458] dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discre tion. Three to ten days following the [ADDRESS_923459] dose 
of DNX
OMP taken daily ending with final assessments for Treatment period 3
Number of Participant s:
In Part A, 16 participants will be randomized such that approximately  13evaluable 
participants complete the study . 
In Part B, a total of 24 participants ( 12 participants per strata) will be randomized per 
stratum such that approximately  10 evaluable participants complete each strata .  2018N378719_00

characteristic of COPD.    
Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential 
strategy  for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman, 2009].  A reduction in tissue 
and airway  neutrophilia is expect ed to result in downstream effects on mucus 
hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruction that are h ypothesized to 
underlie the development and worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s ymptoms and decline in lung 
function that occurs in COPD.
Molecules with C XCR2 antagonist activity  have been shown to reduce the influx of 
neutrophils into the lungs in healthy  participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) 
and to reduce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, 
neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis in association with improvements in 
measures of disease activity  in some, but not all, studies [O'By [CONTACT_7943], 2016; Holz , 2010;
Watz , 2016, Lazaar 2011;Nair, 2012; Rennard , 2015 ]. Overall, the results of the reported 
clinical studies with CXCR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target 
patient population is important to achieving clinical ben efit.
Danirixin is a selective CXCR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti -
inflammatory  agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory  diseases and 
influenza.  Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity  both in 
vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number , 
YM2010/[ZIP_CODE]/07
].

3.2. Background
COPD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of 
deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly  to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006;
Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016 ].  The morbidity  and mortality  of 
COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by  [CONTACT_2892] 2020, COPD is 
expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability
[Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016].  The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD 
is primarily  due to small airway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an 
excessive inflammatory  response in the lung, mainly  caused b y cigarette smoking [Celli , 
2004].  COPD is characterized by  [CONTACT_681975], in many  patients, 
progressive breathlessness (or d yspnea), cough and sputum production.  Many  COPD 
patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] d ay to day  variation [ Hurst , 2010].  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_681956] s ymptoms 
(COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of CO
PD-related and total 
health care costs.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_681957], many  COPD patients continue to 
experience a high burden of respi[INVESTIGATOR_681970] a 
continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016].  Additionally , there is growing 
recognition that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well 
as smokers with preserved lung function suffer from a high burden of s ymptoms and 
COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [Woodruff , 2016].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85668] y further reduce COPD exacerbations and improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_681971] a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly  
result in an improvement in COPD patients’ qu
ality of life.
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for the 
treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the management of 
current respi[INVESTIGATOR_681959] s ymptoms resulting in COPD 
exacerbations should be an important component of COPD patient management [ GOL D, 
2016].  
Danirixin is being evaluated as an addition to standard of care inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. long 
acting bronchodilators and long acting bronc hodilator/corticosteroid combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) and is targeting those COPD patients that continue to have a burden of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_681960] y 
available COPD treatments. 2018N378719_00

Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Testicular effects and male fertility Clinical exposure limits will be based on the 
NOAELs for testicular toxicity ; other 
findings described above occurred at non-
tolerated doses and/or at sy stemic exposures 
well in excess of the maximum oral or 
maximum predicted intravenous exposure in 
human subjects or were considered non -
adverse and monitorable. Exposure margins 
derived from the 26 and 39 w eek toxicology  
studies in rats and dogs, respectivel y, with 
DNX are considered sufficient to support 
oral and intravenous infusion administration 
of DNX in single and repeat -dose clinical 
studies under the proposed dosing regimens.
Clear NOAELs for testicular effects were 
established in the rat at 50 mg/kg/day  and at 
10 mg/kg/day  in the dog after oral 
administration of DNX. These doses 
resulted in sy stemic exposures which are 7.7 
and 23.5
-fold respectively  the exposure for 
an oral clinical dose of 75 mg BID (AUC0 -
24 of 8.734 µg.h/mL) and [ADDRESS_923476] (IP) [Dani rixin, [COMPANY_004]1325756]

intravenous infusion clinical dose of 50 mg 
BID (AUC0 -24 of 21.94 µg.h/mL).
Impairment of host defense . Host defense has not been studied directly  
in nonclinical studies. However, data in 
nonclinical species have not identified an 
increased risk of infection with danirixin.  
Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with 
two CXCR2 antagonists in the same 
chemical class as danirixin have not shown 
an increase in infections in challenge 
models (e.
g., influenza viral load).  
Secondary  bacterial infections after viral 
infection have not been directly  evaluated in 
nonclinical studies.
The data from clinical studies including 
healthy  participants, COPD and influenza 
patients thus far show no evidence t hat 
participants taking danirixin have an 
increased infection rate compared with 
participants taking placebo.
Neutropenia has been reported in clinical 
trials of other CXCR2 antagonists.  No 
instances of neutropenia have been reported 
in nonclinical studie s with danirixin.  I n Monitoring of neutrophil count.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: in participants with a 
confirmed absolute neutrophil count 0.5 x

neutrophil count will be monitored until 
return to normal. Participants may  be 
restarted on stud y treatment as detailed in
Appendix 7.
Ongoing assessment of AE/SAEs related to 
infection.
Closely  monitor, collect information on and 
characterize infection events such as

Appropriate measures have been taken to minimize the risk to subjects in this study  
through eligibility  criteria and consideration of burden relative to study  procedures.  It is 
acceptable to conduct this study  in health y elderly participant s, beca use whilst they  will 
receive no direct medical benefit, the risks from the study  treatment and procedures are 
minimal.  The study  will be conducted in a fully equipped clinical research facility with

5. STUDY DESIGN
5.1. Overall Design
This is a Phase I, two part (Part A and Part B which contains 2 Strata), randomized, open -
label, single dose, cross -over study  conducted with healthy  elderl y participants. Part A 
will support the selection of the formulation and Part B will add ress the PPI [CONTACT_177209], food 
effect and PK of the monohy drate.
Part A
In Part A, approximately  16 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  13 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments for all planned 
treatment periods. Participant s will undergo a screening period ~[ADDRESS_923480] 
dose of danir ixin. 
Eligible participant s will be admitted to the clinical facilities on Day  -1 of each treatment 
period. 
On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or authorized study unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s will be discharged from the unit 
approximately  24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923481]
dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten day s following the 48 hour 
clinic visit for the final treatment period, participants will return to the clinic for the 
follow -up visit. Ref er to Section 2 for study  assessments and timepoints. 
A minimum washout period of 5 day s is required between dosing in 
each treatment 
period. A study  design schematic for Part A is presented in Table 1.
Part B
In Part B, approximately  24 healthy  elderl y participants will be enrolled such that 
approximately  20 subjects (10 subjects per strata) complete dosing and critical 
assessments for all planned treatment periods in Strata 1 and 2 . 
In Part B Strat um 2 eligible participants will take omeprazole (OMP), 40 mg from Day  -4 
to day  of final PK assessment (48hr) for treatment period 3. 
Participant swill be provided 
with a participant diary  to document daily  recordings of OMP dosing occurring outside of 
theunit.
Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical facilities on Day  -1 of each treatment 
period. 
On Day  1 of each treatment period, following completion of the required pre -dose 
measurements and procedures, the investigator or authorized study unit personnel will 
administer a single oral dose of 50 mg danirixin to each participant in the unit. Following 
dosing, participant swill undergo clinical safet y assessments and serial PK assessments at 
timepoints specified in the Section 2. Participant s will be discharged from the unit 
approximately  24 hours following dosing at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Participants will return back to the unit on an outpatient basis approximately  [ADDRESS_923482]
dose assessments and be discharged once the assessments 
are complete at the investigator’s discretion. Three to ten day s following the 48 hour 
clinic visit for the final treatment period, participants will return to the clinic for the 
follow -up visit. Ref er to Section 2 for study  assessments and timepoints. 2018N378719_00

period. S tudy design schematic s are presented in Table 2 and Table 3for Part B Strata 1 
and 2 , respectivel y.
5.2. Number of Participants
In Part A, 16 participants will be randomized such that approximately  13evaluable 
participants complete the study . 
In Part B, a total of 24 participants ( 12 part icipants per strata) will be randomized per 
stratum such that approximately  [ADDRESS_923483] completed the study  if he/she has completed all 
phases of the s tudy including follow -up visit for the part for which they  were enrolled.
The end 
of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the 
study .
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study  Design
This study  will use a single dose , open labe l, cross -over design. This is a well -established 
design to evaluate the relative bioavailability  of new formulations of an investigational 
drug. 
5.5. Dose Justification
Theoral dose strength of 50 mg d anirixin HBr will be administered as a single dose in all 
thetreatment period s inthe present study . This is a clinically  relevant danirixin dose level 
and was also the dose used in Clinical Study  201037 [ GlaxoSmithKline Document 
Number ,2015N248339_00
].
In stratum 2 of Part B, subj ects will take an oral dose of 40 mg OMP QD in the morning 
for four day s prior to the initial danirixin dosing day  until 48 hrs after the final danirixin 
dosing day .On the danirixin dosing days, the OMP will be taken in the morning with the 
dose of daniri xin.  This omeprazole dose strength and regimen is the same as that 
administered during Clinical Study  201037 [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number , 
2015N248339_00
].The co -administration of [ADDRESS_923484] of OMP on acid secretion increases, reaching a plateau after four days [Sachs ,

408.1.2. QTc Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to 
determine eligibility  for and discontinuation from the study .  This formula may  not 
be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled.
For example, if aparticipant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then 
QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well.
Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , 
the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data 
being collected for data analysis.  Safety  ECGs and other non -protocol specified 
ECGs are an exception.  
The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate 
electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5- 10 minute) recording period.  
A subject that meets either bulleted criterion based on the average of triplicate ECG 
readings will be withdrawn from study  treatment.   
QTc, QTcB, QTcF > 500 msec,
Change from baseline: QTc >60 msec
See the S ection 2for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and 
follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
8.1.3. Neutrophil Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
A participant with a peripheral blood neutrophil c ount 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on 
repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing.  The neutrophil count should be 
monitored daily  until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 7.
8.2. Withdrawal from the Stud y
A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at his/her own request, 
or may  be withdrawn at any  time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , 
behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons.
If the participant withdraws consent fo r disclosure of future information, the 
sponsor may
 retain and continue to use any  data collected before such a 
withdrawal of consent.
If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of any  
samples taken and not tested, and the in vestigator must document this in the site 
study  records.
Refer to the Section [ADDRESS_923498] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required stud y visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_681986]/or should continue in the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee 
must make every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_19425]’s medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study  with a primary  reason of lost to follow -up. 
9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed 
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or 
discontinue study  treatment.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study  conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening 
log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may  be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the pro cedure met the protocol
-specified criteria and was 
performed within the time frame defined in the Section 2.
The following points must be noted:  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
42If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should 
occur in the following order:
1.
12-lead ECG
2.vital signs
3.blood draws.  
Note: The timing of the assessments should allow the blood draw to occur at the 
exact nominal time.
The timing and number of planned study  assessments, including PK and safety  
assessments, may be altered during the course of the study  based on newl y 
available data (e.g., to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma 
concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
The change in timing or addition of time points for any  planned stud y 
assessments must be documented in a Note to File which is approved b y the 
relevant [COMPANY_004] stud y team members (e.g. medical monitor and GCSP) and then 
archived in the stud y sponsor and site study files, but this will not constitute a 
protocol amendment. 
The I RBwill be informed of any  safet y issues that require alteration of the 
safet y monitoring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form. 
No more than 
500 mL of blood will be collected over the duration of the study .
9.1. Efficacy
This study  is a single dose PK study  and therefore there is no efficacy  endpoint.
9.2. Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 .
The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study  treatment or the study ,
or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Appendix 4 ). 
9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting A E and SA E 
Information
All SAE swill be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow
-up visit
at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2).
All AE
swill be collected from thestart of treatment until the follow- up visit at 
the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2).
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study  treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
43All SAE swill be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 
hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any  updated 
SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study  
participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, 
at an y time afte r a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  
participation, the investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs
and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in
Appendix 4 .
9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended a nd 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrence. 
9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visi
ts/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is 
resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as 
defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow - up procedur es is given in 
Appendix 4 .
9.2.4. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of 
participan ts and the safety  of a study  treatment under clinical investigation are 
met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  
authority  and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment 
under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific 
regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, 
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and 
investigators.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory  requirements and 
sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or
other specific safet y information eg, summary  or listing of SAE) from the 
sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and 
will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L

449.2.5. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study  treatment and until [ADDRESS_923499] dose of study  treatment .
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform GS Kwithin 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE s
.
9.3. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any dose of study treatment  4 tablets in a day  will be considered an 
overdose.
[COMPANY_004] does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should :
1.Contact [CONTACT_27465] .
2.Closely  monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory  abnormalities until 
danirixin can no longer be detected systemically  (at least 3 days).
3.Obtain a sample for PK analy sis within [ADDRESS_923500] dose of study  
treatment if requested b y the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis).
4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in 
the CRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  [CONTACT_616700] n with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the 
participant.
9.4. Safet y Assessments
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the Section 2.
9.4.1. Physical Examinations
A complete ph ysical examinat
ion will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
Cardiovascular , Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , Gastrointestinal and Neurological s ystems. Height 
and weight will also be measured and recorded.
A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (auscultation and palpation of 
the abdomen including examination of the liver and spleen) .
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous 
serious illnesses. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
459.4.2. Vital Signs
Oral tem perature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], and blood pressure will be 
assessed.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completel y 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only  if an automated device 
is not available.
Blood press ure and pulse measurements should be preceded by  [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_923501] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, 
television, cell phones).
Vital signs (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory  tests) will consist 
of 1 pulse and 3 blood pressure measurements (3consecutive blood pressure 
readings will be recorded at intervals of at least 1 minute). The average of the 3 
blood pressure readings will be recorded on the CRF.
Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_681973] [ADDRESS_923502] and 
will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842].
9.4.3. Electrocardiograms
Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA ( Section 2)using an
ECG machine that automatically  calculates the heart rate and measures PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section [ 8.1.2 ] for QTc withdrawal 
criteria and additional QTc readings that may  be necessary .
9.4.4. Clinical Safety  Laboratory  Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and 
to the SoA for the timing and frequency . 
The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and 
record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE 
section of the CRF. The laboratory  reports must be filed with the source 
documents. Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings are those which 
are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator 
to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.
All laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal 
during participation in the study  or within 3daysafter the last dose of study  
treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are 
no longer considered significantly  abnormal by  [CONTACT_43210]. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable b
y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
46All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the Section 2.
If laboratory  values from non
-protocol specified laboratory  assessments 
performed at the institution’s local laboratory  require a change in participant 
management or are considered clinically  significant by  [CONTACT_31691] (eg, SAE 
or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.
9.5. Pharmacokinetics
Whole blood samples of approximately  2 mL  will be collected for measurement 
of whole blood concentrations of danirixin (performed under the control o f [COMPANY_004] 
Platform Technology  and Science Department of In Vitro I n Vivo Translation 
Third Party  Resourcing (PTS -IVIVT/TPR) as specified in the Section 2.
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samp
les will be p rovided 
by [CONTACT_681981] . The actual date and time (24- hour clock time) of each 
sample will be recorded.
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of danirixin . Each whole blood sample
will be used to prepare 4 dried blood spots which will be anal ysed for danirixin 
concentrations.  Samples collected for anal yses of danirixin whole blood 
may also 
be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or 
after the stud y.

10.1. Sample Size Determination
The sample size is primarily  based on feasibility .Approxima tely 60 subjects will be 
enrolled in the study  to obtain approximately  16 randomized subjects (13 completers) in 
Part A and 12 randomized subjects (10 completers) in each strata of Part B.  
The within- subject variability  for AUC(0- inf), AUC(0- t) and Cmax of danirixin [[COMPANY_004] 
Study  201037, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00 ] was estimated to 
be 37.3%, 39.3% and 44.7%, respectively . Based upon the largest within -subject 
coefficient of variation (44.7% for Cmax of daniri xin) and a sample size of 13 subjects 
completing part A of the study , it is estimated that the half-width of the 90% confidence 
interval for the ratio of geometric means for the comparison of interest should be no more 
than 23% of the point estimates. Assuming an observed ratio of one, the corresponding 
90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means would be 0.[ADDRESS_923503] the formulation for

No sample size re -estimation will be performed.
10.2. Populations for A nalyses
For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined:
Population Description
All Participants All participants who receive at least o ne dose of study  
medication. This population will be used for the study  
population and safet y analyses.
PKAll participants for whom a pharmacokinetic sample was 
obtained and analy zed. This will be the population used for 
all the pharmacokinetic display s.

authorization.  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
49Data will be listed and summarized separatel y for each part of the stud y according to 
GlaxoSmithKline reporting standards where app licable. 
Complete details will be documented in the Reporting and Analy sis Plan (RAP).
10.3.1. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated b y standard non- compartmental anal ysis 
according to GlaxoSmithKline current working practices. . Calculations will be based on 
the actual sampling times recorded during the study. From the blood concentration -time 
data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined, as data permit: 
maximum observed blood concentration (Cmax), time to Cm ax (tmax), area under the 
blood concentration -time curve [AUC(0- t), AUC(0 -inf), AUC(0 -24)], lag time before 
observation of first blood concentration (tlag), time of last observed blood concentration 
(tlast), and apparent terminal phase half -life (t1/2).
Pharmacokinetic data will be listed and presented in graphical form and will be 
summarized descriptively. Complete details will be documented in the Reporting and 
Analy sis Plan (RAP).
The point estimates of the geometric least squares (GL S) mean ratio for the PK 
parameters (AUC and Cmax) and the associated 90% CI s will be provided for treatment 
comparisons (test:reference). The PK parameters will be log -transformed prior to anal ysis 
and treatment comparisons will be expressed as ratios on the original scale. 2018N378719_00

[PHONE_14168].4. Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of A E
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered relat ed to the 
study  treatment.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment.
Events Meeting the A E Definition 
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y signif icant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of 
underly ing disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the cond ition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the cli nical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action " constitutes anAE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
62Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations o f pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Definition of SA E
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, 
death due to progression of disease).
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' re fers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216472], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19950]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or wa s necessary , the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability  means a substan tial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental tr auma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding wh ether SAE  2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
63reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217611]. These events should usually  
be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospa sm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Recording A E and SA E
AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
docu mentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory , and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_681974] t’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004] /AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_19952] b y [COMPANY_004] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant num ber, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_31785] .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal ev eryday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for rating 
the intensity  of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at lea st 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
64Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "rea sonable possibility " of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] .However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initi al transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] .
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_681988] e nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during participatio n in the study  or during a recognized follow -
up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a cop y of an y post-mortem 
findings including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information. 2018N378719_00
2017N316476_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207573
65Reporting of SA Esto [COMPANY_004]
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data 
collection tool (e.g., InForm).
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section).
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within 
the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the 
relationship of each SAE to I P/study  participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE 
entry  into the eCRF.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or recei
ves updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to the medical monitor or SAE coordinator by  [CONTACT_756].
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the study  procedures manual . 2018N378719_00

Pregnancy  Information
Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post- menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below)
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2. P remenopausal female with ONE of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3. P ostmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in 
the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  
(HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Guidance
Female participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agre e to 
use a highly effective method of contraception consistently  and correctly  as described in

Vasectomized partner 
(A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed . If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. )
Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk a ssociated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)
NOTES: 
a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants inclinical studies. 
b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce t he efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_923514] dose of study treatment 
Pregnancy  Testing
WOCBP should only  be in cluded after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative 
highl y sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test 
Additional pregnancy testing should be performed at monthly  intervals during the 
treatment period and at [ADDRESS_923515] dose of study treatment and as required 
locally   2018N378719_00

pregnancy  is otherwise suspected 
Pregnancy  testing, with a sensitivity  of 5 mIU/mL will be performed using the test 
kit provided by  [CONTACT_681989] .  
Collection of Pregnancy  Information
Male participants with partners who become pregnant
Investigator will not routinely  attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male 
participant’s female partner(s) who becomes pregnant while the male participant is 
participating in this study; however, voluntary  reports of such incidents will be 
captured through the [COMPANY_004] standard reporting mechanism. This applies only to male 
participants wh o receive double -blind study  treatment.
If pregnancy  information for a male participant’s female partner(s) is voluntarily  
reported, after obtaining the necessary  signed informed consent from the pregnant 
female partner directl y, the investigator will reco rd pregnancy  information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy .
Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004]
Generally , follow -
up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery  date. An y termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure
Female Participants who become pregnant
Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female participant, who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to [COMPANY_004] within

be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_004] Generall y, follow-up wil l not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks bey ond the estimated delivery  date.  
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
While pregnancy  itself is not co
nsidered to be an AE or SAE, an y pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as

Required Actions and Follow up Assessments 
Actions Follow Up Assessments
Report the event to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours
Complete the liver event CRF, and complete 
an SAE data collection tool if the event also 
meets the criteria for an SAE2
Perform liver event follow up assessments 
Monitor the subject until liver chemistries 
resolve, stabilise, or return to within baseline 
(see MONITORING below)
MONITORING:
If ALT ≥3xULN AND bilirubin 2xULN  or INR 
>1.5
Repeat liver chemistries (include ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) and perform 
liver event follow up assessments within  24 
hrs
Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabili se or return to 
within baseline
A specialist or hepatology consultation is 
recommended
If ALT ≥3xULN AND bilirubin < 2xULN  and 
INR ≤1.5:
Repeat liver chemistries (include ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) and perform 
liver event follow up assessme nts within 24-
72 hrsViral hepatitis serology3
Obtain INR and recheck with each liver 
chemistry assessment until the 
transaminases values show downward 
trend
Obtain blood sample for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis, obtained up to [ADDRESS_923516] dose4 
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Fractionate bilirubin, if total 
bilirubin 2xULN
Obtain complete blood count with 
differential to assess eosinophilia
Record the appearance or worsening of 
clinical symptoms of liver injury, or 
hypersensitivity, on the AE report form
Record use of concomitant medications on 
the concomitant medications report form 
including acetaminophen, herbal rem edies, 
other over the counter medications.
Record alcohol use on the liver event 
alcohol intake case report form
If ALT ≥3xULN AND bilirubin 2xULN  or 
INR >1.5 :

China .
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic 
resonance, or computerised tomography) 
and /or liver biopsy to evaluate liver 
disease; complete Liver Imaging and/or 
Liver Biopsy CRF forms.
1. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available . If serum bilirubin fractionation is not 
immediately available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN. 
Additionally, if serum bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on 
dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2. All events of ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR 
measured, which may indicate severe liver injury (possib le ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding 
studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis); INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will 
not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants
3. Includes: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepati tis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); Hepatitis C 
RNA; Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;  Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain 
heterophile antibody or monospot testing);  Hepatitis E IgM antibody

pregnant women’s intention to practice and actual practice of skin to skin contact ( SSC) [ADDRESS_891431] that will make them consider participating in skin to skin 8 
immediately after birth. Therefore our end point for this study is intention to participate in 9 
SCC measured by a single questionnaire it em “Do you plan on participating in skin to skin 10 
(or kangaroo care) immediately after birth?”  Our secondary end -point will measure whether 11 
or not the patient was able to participate in skin to skin within five minutes of delivery . 12 
Background and Significance  13 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_660978] 14 
Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American 15 
Academy of Family Physicians, the rate of breastfeeding initiation at the time of delivery and 16 
continuation at 6 months postpartum is below the Center of Disease Prevention’s Healthy 17 
People 2010 goals (1).  UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) have estimated [ADDRESS_891432] six months of their lives, the rate of 19 
morbidity and malnutrition would significantly decrease all over the world (2).  The benefits [ADDRESS_891433], 23 
ovarian, and endometrial cancers (3).  As a result of this information, in 1991 WHO and 24 
UNICEF launched the Baby -Friendly Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660979] (BFHI) to encourage proper infant [ADDRESS_891434] meet 26 
and maintain to obtain certification.  In support of Step Four of the BFHI to “help mothers 27 
initiat e breastfeeding within one hour of birth,” the skin -to-skin variation of Kangaroo Mother 28 
Care was initiated (4).  [ADDRESS_891435] (SSC) on a mother’s chest, provides 31 
thermoregulation, physiological stability, appropriate stimulat ion, and encourages bonding 32 
and breastfeeding (5).  In fact, early SSC was significantly associated with type of feeding at 33 
discharge through 3 months postpartum (6). Regrettably, according to the American 34 
Academy of Pediatrics, some obstacles to SSC and b reastfeeding include insufficient 35 
prenatal education, disruptive obstetrical practices, and a lack of family and societal support 36 
(7).  Delivery room and postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660980] 37 
maternal -infant interactions (8).  These barriers to breastfeeding and SSC are more [ADDRESS_891436] vulnerable groups, which includes low income, low educational level, and 39 
black populations.  While effective initiatives such as BFHI are present in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], 40 
guidelines for primary  care based interventions originating in a clinician's office currently do [ADDRESS_891437] (3).  Through encouraging education regarding SSC in a before the time of 42 
delivery, patients can actively participate in SSC during delivery and advocate for early SSC 43 
(9).   44

Education can easily influence behavior habits and does not need to require special 46 
difficulties on behalf of providers (9).  In fact, educational programs have the single greatest [ADDRESS_891438] of any single intervention on both initiation and short term du ration for breastfeeding 48 
(3).  Women who attended breastfeeding classes with lactation consultants - with or without 49 
video supplementation - had significantly increased breastfeeding at six months when 50 
compared to controls (1).  Currently, common office pr actices include provision of written [ADDRESS_891439] been shown to 53 
reduce the rates of breastfeeding (3).  Ideally, breastfeeding education would use both 54 
individual or group sessions where both benefits of breastfeeding and SSC would be 55 
discussed (10).  However, in a busy clinic setting filled with a vulnerable patient population, 56 
having the ability to get to extr a educational classes is not always an option.  57 
 58 
Regardless of amount of prenatal education provided, Southview Medical Center will study 59 
participating patients at the time of admission for delivery who watch an 8 minutes 52 60 
second patient education DVD tit led “Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_660981]” by [CONTACT_660987] [ADDRESS_891440] to intervention timing (7).  In an analysis regarding video modeling, 63 
patients who vie wed videotapes regarding treatment options had a greater understanding of 64 
the risks and benefits of those choices and were more apt to be active participants in 65 
decision making (11).  Audio -visual material can also be entertaining and can be used by [ADDRESS_891441] limited literacy.  Moreover, the information provided to patients on video has 67 
the advantage of being repeatable and consistent, which would allow us to provide the same 68 
information to all of our patients (12).  By [CONTACT_660988] a vide o format at the [ADDRESS_891442] time to formulate questions and 70

Pregnant women may be considered vulnerable subjects.  Teach back method during the 138 
consent process will be used to ensure understanding regarding participation.   This study 139 
poses no medical risks to pregnan t women, fetuses, or neonates.  Any pregnant woman 140 
appearing to be in a cognitive or emotional state that would prevent informed consent would 141 
be excluded.  142 
Research  Design and Methods  143 
If participating in the study in the experimental group the patient would watch the video prior to 144 
delivery.   145 
 146 
A sample size of 240 (120+120) will participate in this randomized control trial.  Alternate 147 
patients will be randomized at the time of admissio n into no video (Group A) and video groups 148 
(Group B).  [ADDRESS_891448] patient enrolled 153 
would be  in Group A and  asked a pre -survey regarding : 154 
• their intention to practice skin t o skin at the time of delivery  155 
• if they participated in skin to skin in a previous pregnancy  156 
• if they had any formal education about skin to skin 157

The video the patients will watch is titled “Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_660981]” by [CONTACT_660987] 166 
of Health.  The video is 8 min utes and 52 seconds in length.  The video discusses the benefits 167 
and logistics of Kangaroo Care from professional’s perspectives and from new mother’s 168 
perspectives.  By [CONTACT_660991], we can see if 169 
patients in tend to participate in skin to skin, regardless of their previous education.   170 
 171 
In this study, we will examine patient’s medical record number, age, gestational age, any 172 
pregnancy complications, race, type of insurance, and the number of times the patient has been 173 
pregnant .  We will also examine data that is already collected by [CONTACT_42933][INVESTIGATOR_660984] 174 
regarding skin to skin.  This includes  gestational age in weeks at the time of delivery, 5 minute 175 
APGAR, delivery date/time, skin to skin initiation tim e, skin to skin end time, delivery to skin to 176 
skin duration (minutes), and skin to skin duration (minutes).   We will also examine if skin to skin 177 
is not initated for patient acuity, maternal acuity, or if the patient refused.  178 
 179 
If a patient has a baby [CONTACT_4490] a 5 minute APGAR less than 7 at the time of delivery or needs to 180 
proceed to the operating room for cesarean delivery, the patient would not be included in data 181 
collection regarding skin to skin at the time of delivery.  For this group, only intention would  be 182 
measured  183 
Surveys / Interviews / Questionnaires  184 
Ob/gyn residents at Southview Medical Center will ask the survey questions.  The survey will be 185 
asked in the patient’s labor room at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660985].  The survey will be 186 
administered one-on-one.  A copy of the survey has been attached.  They will then watch 187

Data Analysis   215 
Preliminary data on both primiparous and multiparous women from our records indicate that 216 
compliance with skin -to-skin is about 50%. We hypothesize that a 30% improvement in intention [ADDRESS_891450] the ability to 218 
recruit 120 eligible women per group (240 in total) into the study. Using z test for two 219 
proportions, 90% power with alpha of 0.05, two -tailed, we will need about 53 patients per arm 220 
(106 in total) based on assumption that 50% of no formal education group an d 80% of video [ADDRESS_891451] intervention.  223 
 224 
We will employ interim analysis, based on potentially recruiting 240 patients, and adopt “two 225 
looks”; one at the time when 12 0 (60 per group) women would be recruited and the other when 226 
240 (120 per group) women would be recruited.  We will use cut -off points of z=3.[ADDRESS_891452] look 227 
and z=2.0 for second look, as suggested by O’Brien -Fleming (1979), as decision rules to stop or [ADDRESS_891453] the null during final analysis onl y when calculated z -statistics is greater 231 
than 2.0.  232 
 233 
Assuming 50% and 80% intention levels (30% difference in proportion) during first interim 234 
analysis, 50% interim sample size (120 patients) would result in absolute z - statistics of 4.89 to 235 
stop data coll ection.  236 
 237 
If data collection continues due to proportion difference less than 30%, sample size of [ADDRESS_891454] the null hypothesis 239 
based on assumption of 10% difference in end -point.  240 
 241

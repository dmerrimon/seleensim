 1. Background 
1.1 Overview of Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by a 
relatively indolent rate of growth and a propensity to produce and secrete a variety of hormones, biogenic amines and other vasoactive peptides. Although they may arise in a variety of organs, 
NETs predominate within the pancreas (pNETs) a nd the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (carcinoids), 
where they originate from the islets of Langerhans and endocrine (enterochromaffin) cells, respectively
1. 
Carcinoid tumors have distinct clinical f eatures depending on their site of origin. In fact, based 
on their embryologic derivation, NETs are often subclassified as foregut (bronchial, stomach, 
duodenal), midgut (jejunal, ileal, cecal, appendi ceal) and hindgut (distal colon and rectal) 
tumors2. While hindgut carcinoid tumors are rarely associated with a hormonal syndrome, 
metastatic midgut carcinoid tumors usually produce serotonin and other vasoactive substances which give rise to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_461995]
3. This syndrome primarily manifests as 
diarrhea and flushing, a vasomotor phenomenon which causes redness and warmth in the face and upper torso.  Carcinoid heart disease, characterized by [CONTACT_462001], can also occur in patients with severe and prolonged elevation of circulating 
serotonin.
 Tumor growth rates also correlate with site of origin. In the metastatic setting, midgut 
carcinoid tumors tend to behave in the most indolent fashion, whereas NETs originating in the 
foregut or hindgut regions tend to behave more aggressively once they have metastasized. 
pNETs can secrete peptide hormones including insulin, gastrin, glucagon and vasoactive 
intestinal peptide (VIP). However, most pNETs are unassociated with a hormonal syndrome and 
are therefore termed “nonfunctioning”3. 
Recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_461996] a rising inci dence of NETs and increased survival durations 
over time, but the long-term outcome of patients  with advanced-stage disease still remains poor4-
7. Although historically perceived as similar enti ties, it is increasingly clear that low- and 
intermediate-grade pNETs and carcinoid tumors have different biology and respond differently to therapeutic agents. Carcinoid tumors are re latively insensitive to conventional chemotherapy 
and have no established treatment other than somatostatin analogs (SSAs)
8. Initially developed to 
palliate hormonal symptoms, SSAs such as octreotide and lanreotide have been also shown to slow tumor progression in patients with adva nced carcinoid tumors. In fact, the randomized 
phase III PROMID trial evaluated octreotide l ong-acting repeatable (LAR) versus placebo in 
patients with metastatic midgut NETs and dem onstrated a significant improvement in time-to-
progression
9. More recently, the CLARINET trial randomized patients with hormonally 
nonfunctioning gastroenteropancreatic NETs to receive depot-lanreotide versus placebo, also 
demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS)10. 
pNETs appear to be more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy11, however there are no placebo-
controlled chemotherapy trials and the role of cytotoxic drugs remains controversial. Approved 
treatment agents for pNETs include everolimus and sunitinib. The mTOR inihibitor everolimus 
was recently found to significantly prolong PFS in patients with advanced pNETs12. A 
randomized phase III trial of sunitinib, a multita rgeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in pNETs 
demonstrated significant improvement in PFS from 5.[ADDRESS_591535] demonstrated that 
expansion and maintenance of macroscopic tumors is highly dependent on the actions of inflammatory cells. Recently, chronic activatio n of Myc in a mouse model of pancreatic β–cell 
tumorigenesis has been reported to be suffic ient to initiate and orchestrate a complex 
inflammatory and angiogenic response, characterized by a rapid influx of mast cells into the tumor and its adjacent mesenchyma. Furthermore, mast cell recruitment has been described as 
essential for tumor angiogenesis and macroscopic expansion
16. Thus, inflammation has been 
proposed as an “oncogene’s weapon” crucial for the development of insulinomas. Mast cells, in particular, have emerged as putative targets for NET therapy. 
Reportedly
16, systemic treatment of mice harboring islet–cell tumors with the mast cell inhibitor 
sodium chromoglycate induces rapid onset of hypoxia and extensive death of tumor and 
endothelial cells, leading to tumor regression. However in humans, sodium chromoglycate has 
poor systemic bioavailability. Thus, more systemical ly effective and tolerable inhibitors of mast 
cell function should be tested in clinical trials.  
1.[ADDRESS_591536]-in-class, orally administered, covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (Btk). Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 1-[(3R)-3-[4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-
d]pyrimidin-1-yl]-1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]]-2-propen-1-one and the molecular weight is 440.50 g/mole. 
Ibrutinib is currently approved for patients with mantle cell lymphoma or chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy and in patients with CLL with 17p deletion. 
1.3.1 Ibrutinib preclinical experience 
In preclinical models, ibrutinib has been shown to  covalently bind to a cysteine residue (Cys-
481) in the Btk active site, thus resulting in a sustained inhibition of the target17. Btk is required 
for B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling18 but is also critical for mast cell degranulation, acting 
downstream of the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc εRI19. Based on preclinical data, blockade of the 
BCR signaling pathway by [CONTACT_462002]: 1) direct induction of apoptosis and 
9 
 2) inhibition of cell homing and migration to inflammatory chemokines and subsequent adhesion 
to cellular substrates20,21. Since the Btk protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the 
exception of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells18, a wide range of immunomodulatory effects 
are expected following ibrutinib administration. Recently, ibrutinib has been found to block the 
expansion of Myc-driven insulinomas by [CONTACT_462003]. In particular, 
ibrutinib was shown to trigger co llapse of tumor vasculature, thus leading to a dramatic tumor 
regression22. This is consistent with the idea that is let–cell tumorigenesis is causally linked, and 
continuously dependent on, infiltration of mast cells16 and that signals from the 
microenvironment are drivers of disease progression in solid cancers23. In addition, ibrutinib has 
been found to apparently inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic islet-cell, although the 
mechanisms underlying this unexpected  therapeutic benefit remain unclear22. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic assays have been used to demonstrate the on-target effect of ibrutinib. Preclinical, in vitro models have shown the select ivity of the drug in the inhibition of Btk, as 
compared to other members of the closely related Tec and Src1/Ab1 family kinase (Table 1-3-1-1).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
 
After oral administration, ibrutinib exhibite d rapid absorption and high plasma clearance in 
preclinical species. In both rats and dogs, the or al bioavailability was less than 25%. Ibrutinib 
exposure increased with increasing doses and at dose  ≥30 mg/kg was higher in female than in 
male rats. Gender had no apparent effect on oral exposure in dogs.  The mean terminal half-life of 
ibrutinib after oral administration was less than  5 hours in rodents and 3 to 6 hours in dogs.  In 
vitro  binding of ibrutinib to plasma protein was high and comparable in mice, rats, dogs, and 
humans.  Ibrutinib was preferentially bound to human serum albumin and less to human α1-acid 
glycoprotein.  The drug is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and biliary excretion is its major route of 
elimination in rats. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology  
The nonclinical safety profile of ibrutinib has been well characterized through the conduct of 
single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in duration, and safety 
pharmacology, genetic toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity and 
phototoxicity studies.  The primary target organ toxicities were observed in the lymphoid, 
gastrointestinal and skeletal systems. Ibrutinib was not identified as a mutagen or clastogen. In reproductive studies ibrutinib at 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the AUC of ibrutinib compared to patients at the dose of 560 mg daily) was associated with increased post-implantation loss, increased visceral malforma tions (heart and major vessels) and skeletal 
variations. After immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_99932], absolute total B-cell counts were found to be decreased following ibrutinib administration in rats. Minimal phototoxicity potential was identified after evaluation of UV spectrum, ph otostability, and whole rat distribution data. 
1.3.2 Ibrutinib clinical experience 
As of 13 December 2013, 24 studies evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib have been completed or are ongoing.  These include 3 dose-finding Phase 1 studies, 5 
studies in healthy volunteers, 7 Phase 2 studies using fixed continuous doses of ibrutinib, 1 Phase 1b study and 1 Phase 2 study combining ibrutinib with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, 5 randomized Phase 3 studies with 3 studies testi ng single-agent ibrutinib and 2 studies testing 
ibrutinib in combination, 1 exte nsion study, and 1 extended-treatment rollover safety study for 
subjects who had participated in previous studies with ibrutinib. Across all studies, malignancies under investigation include chronic lymphocy tic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, 
mantle-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, 
and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib has ne ver been tested in clinical trials evaluating 
patients with solid tumors. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib has been assessed in subjects with B-cell malignancies 
as well as in healthy subjects. Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 
1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day as well as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to 
[ADDRESS_591539] variability. The mean half life 
(t1/2) of ibrutinib across 3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours, with a median time to 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of [ADDRESS_591540] in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) approximately doubled 
the mean systemic exposure compared to intake  after overnight fasting with median time to 
Tmax delayed from [ADDRESS_591541] is practically complete, as 
minimal fecal excretion of unchanged ibrutinib in combination with high levels of oxidative 
metabolites (liver and gut metabolism) and a lack of reduction products (gut microflora 
metabolism) was observed. The plasma protein bi nding of ibrutinib in human plasma is 97.3% 
and distribution to peripheral tissues is extensive.  Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 to the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-[ZIP_CODE], a reversible inhibitor of Btk, with 
approximately [ADDRESS_591542] dose exposure. 
The results of human mass balance study of [14C]-ibrutinib conducted in six healthy male 
subjects demonstrated that less than 10% of the to tal dose of [14C]-ibrutinib  is renally excreted, 
whereas approximately 80% is recovered in feces. Subjects with mild and moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min) were eligible to enroll in Study PCYC-1102-
CA in which pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were included. No dose adjustment is needed 
for mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). There is no data in patients with severe renal impairment or  patients on dialysis. The study of ibrutinib in 
hepatic impaired subjects is  currently in progress. 
Significant PK interactions were observed in drug -drug interaction studies in healthy subjects 
with ketoconazole and rifampin as strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_591543] 
of ibrutinib or its metabolites on the metabolism of concomitant medications. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ibrutinib in healthy volunteers 
In healthy subjects ibrutinib up  to [ADDRESS_591544] common 
treatment-emergent adverse events were of grade 1 in severity, with the exception of reported 
grade 2 headache and rash. Recovery from toxicities was rapid. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ibrutinib in mantle-cell lymphoma 
A phase 2 study25 investigated oral ibrutinib, at a dail y dose of 560 mg, in 111 patients with 
relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients were enrolled into two groups: those who 
had previously received at least 2 cycles of bortezomib therapy and those who had received less 
than 2 complete cycles of bortezomib or had received no prior bortezomib therapy.  The 86% of 
patients had intermediate-risk or high-risk mantle-cell lymphoma according to clinical prognostic 
factors. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Grade 3 or higher hematologic events were infrequent and included 
12 
 neutropenia (in 16% of patients), thrombocytopenia (in 11%), and anemia (in 10%). A response 
rate of 68% (75 patients) was observed, with a complete response rate of 21% and a partial 
response rate of 47%; prior treatment with bort ezomib had no effect on the response rate. With 
an estimated median follow-up of 15.3 months, the estimated median response duration was 17.5 months (95% CI, 15.8 to not reached), the estim ated median PFS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 7.0 
to not reached), and the median OS was not reached. The estimated rate of overall survival was 
58% at [ADDRESS_591545] relapse in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma
26. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ibrutinib in chr onic lymphocytic leukemia 
Ibrutinib has been tested in a phase 1b-[ADDRESS_591546]  high-risk disease, received the drug orally once 
daily; [ADDRESS_591547] infection. The overall 
response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response 
with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present 
before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated PFS rate was 75% and the rate of OS was 83%. 
More recently, a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study
28 has randomized 391 patients with 
relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive 
daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 
ibrutinib significantly improved PFS; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of PFS of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group. At 12 months, the OS rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosi s. Similar effects were observed regardless of 
whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.[ADDRESS_591548] frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group. Consistent with  these results, FDA has granted a pproval for ibrutinib in patients 
with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ibrutinib in other hematological malignancies 
Phase III trials are underway worldwide to evalua te ibrutinib in the treatment of patients with 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and the agent is in  phase II development for use in follicular 
lymphoma, multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia29. Ibrutinib has been 
investigating as monother apy or in combination with R-CHOP  regimen in patients with diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma. Preliminary safety data suggest fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia as most commonly occurring treatment-emergent adverse events. In myeloma

[IP_ADDRESS] Cytopenias 
Treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea 
Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy. Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. These events are rarely severe. Should symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modifica tion guidelines (see Section 5.2). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bleeding-Related Events 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], Comment [AT1]: RESPONSE REQUIRED:  
 
Please update  Ibrutinib safety language  to the 
following  per IB v.9.

 and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other 
anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platel et function may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. See Section  5.3 for guidance 
on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements. See Section  5.5 
for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Atrial Fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been  reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial 
fibrillation. For atrial fibrillation which persists , consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib 
treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 5.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rash 
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects tr eated with either single agent ibrutinib or in 
combination with chemotherapy. In a randomized Phase 3 study (PCYC-1112-CA), rash 
occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in th e control arm. Most rashes were mild to 
moderate in severity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Second Primary Malignancies 
Second primary malignancies, most frequently skin cancers, have occurred in subjects treated 
with ibrutinib. Second primary malignancies in cluding non-skin carcinomas have occurred in 
patients treated with ibrutinib. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection 
Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with ibrutinib therapy. At least 25% of subjects with 
MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Grad e 3 or greater infections per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ). The most commonly reported infections 
include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infecti on and sepsis. Although causality has not been 
established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in 
patients treated with ibrutinib.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjects treated with single-
agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemothe rapy. Subjects at risk of tumor lysis syndrome 
are those with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, 
increased uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bulky disease at 
baseline, and pre‐ existing kidney abnormalities.

degranulation, acting downstream the high affinity IgE receptor Fc εRI19. Given its favorable 
risk/benefit ratio for inve stigation in NETs, we plan to test the hypothesis whether ibrutinib can 
cause tumor regression in both carcinoid tumors and pNETs. 
2. Study objectives 
The primary purpose of the study is to determine the objective response rate to ibrutinib therapy 
in patients with advanced (unresectable or meta static) low to intermediate grade carcinoid tumors 
or pNETs. 
Secondary objectives are: 
 to investigate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) associated 
with ibrutinib in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors or pNETs; 
 to evaluate the duration of response of carcinoid or pNET patients receiving ibrutinib; 
 to assess changes in tumor markers and changes in quality of life (QOL) in NET patients administered with ibrutinib; 
 to determine the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in this patient population.

5. Study Medication 
5.1 Study drug: ibrutinib 
The investigational drug used in this study is  ibrutinib, available as 140 mg capsules. The 
inactive ingredients of ibrutinib include:  microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, 
sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate. Comment [AT2]: RESPONSE REQUIRED:  
 
Please include  the following  exclusion  criteria 
regarding hepatotoxicity.  
19 
 Pharmacyclics will supply ibrutinib as long as the patient remains on study, shows continuous 
benefit from treatment, and there are no safety concerns.  Ibrutinib  should be stored  at room 
temperature (20°C to 25°C, equivalent to 68°F to 77°F). Excursions are permitted between 15°C 
and 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
The starting dose is 560 mg (four 140 mg capsules) taken once daily orally. Doses should be 
taken approximately the same time each day, without scheduled breaks. Patients who vomit 
anytime after taking a dose should not “make it up” with extra doses, but instead resume 
subsequent doses as planned.  Any missed dose may be taken as soon as possible on the same 
day with a return to the normal schedule the following day.  If doses are missed or vomited, this 
must be indicated in the source documents and CRFs.  A treatment cycle will be defined as [ADDRESS_591562] self-administration of ibrutinib, enrolled patients will be 
provided with a diary. 
Study treatment should begin within 14 days following enrollment onto the study. Patients 
should be requested to bring their unused medication to the clinic each visit.  Compliance should 
be verified by [CONTACT_093]'s staff through counting the number of capsules consumed 
between visits.  The investigator (or his/her de signee) will document dosage administration and 
all dose changes during the study in the CRF.  The dose, amount dispensed, amount received, 
and amount remaining unused must be recorded. 
Patients will be assessed for resp onse after every 3 cycles (12 weeks) of therapy. Patients with 
evidence of stable disease or response to ther apy as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_591563] ed for toxicity as outlined below. Patients 
with unacceptable toxicity or progressive di sease will discontinue protocol therapy. 
5.2 Dose Modification 
Ibrutinib should be held or reduced in dose for toxicity or for concomitant use of CYP3A 
inhibitors (see Appendix A), as described in the sections below. Ibrutinib dosing adjustments are 
to be made according to the greatest degree of toxicity observed. Doses of ibrutinib which have 
been reduced for toxicity may not be re-escalat ed. All interruptions or changes to study drug 
administration must be recorded. If any patien t discontinues study treatment or post-treatment 
observation, then the reason will be recorded. 
Patients experiencing drug-related toxicities that are grade 1 or 2 according to CTCAE criteria 
should continue ibrutinib without dose modification. However the investigator may reduce the 
dose by [CONTACT_462006] a grade 2 toxicity persists and significantly affects patient quality of life. If a 
patient experiences a CTCAE grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity, a grade 3 or higher 
neutropenia with infection or fever, or a grade 4 hematological event that is considered drug-related, ibrutinib should be held  until resolution of toxicity to ≤ grade 1. Then the drug should be 
reinitiated at the starting dose. If the toxicity re occurs, the dose should be reduced by [CONTACT_89953] 
(140 mg per day). A second reduction of dose by 140 mg may be considered as needed as per 
Table 5-2. If a patient experiences these drug- related toxicities despi[INVESTIGATOR_461997], 
ibrutinib should be discontinued and the patient should be taken off the study. Patients should also be removed from study if off treatment for >3 weeks.  
Recommended dose modifications for thes e toxicities are described below: 
Table 5-2:  Recommended dose modifications for ibrutinib 
[ADDRESS_591564] Restart at 280 mg daily 
Fourth Discontinue Ibrutinib 
 
5.2.1 Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects 
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and theref ore subjects with clinically significant hepatic 
impairment at the time of screening (Child-Pugh class B or C) are excluded from study 
participation. For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child-Pugh class 
A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg daily (two capsules). 
For subjects who develop moderate to severe liver impairment while on study (Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule). Subjects who 
develop severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must hold study drug until resolved to 
moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B) or better. Subjects will be monitored for signs of 
toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (Refer to Appendix D). 
5.3 Concomitant therapy 
 All patients should be maintained on the same medications throughout the study period, 
as medically feasible; 
 The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study staff about any new 
medications he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications (other than 
study drug) and significant non-drug therap ies (including physical therapy and blood 
transfusions) administered after the patient starts treatment with study drug must be 
recorded; 
 Administration of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim fo llowing initiation of protocol therapy is at 
invesigator’s discretion for all patients; 
 Administration of erythropoietin or darbopoietin is allowed; 
 Other concurrent investigational drugs of any type are not allowed in the trial; 
 Other concurrent anticancer agents (with the exception of somatostatin analogs) are not 
allowed in the trial; 
 Patients must be instructed not to take an y additional medications (including herbal 
supplements and over-the-counter products) dur ing the trial without prior consultation 
with the investigator. All medications taken within [ADDRESS_591565] be added or changed, the reason and name [CONTACT_214842]/therapy should be recorded; 
 In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432638], including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. antiemetics or steroids), with the following exceptions: 
 CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers 
 
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A.  Avoid co-administration with strong or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition. Comment [AT3]: RESPONSE REQUIRED:  
 
Please include  the following  required dose 
modification  language on hepatic impairment.  
21 
 Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazadone, or cobicistat) should be avoided  
 If a strong CYP3A inhibitor (see Appendix A) must be used, ibrutinib will be 
reduced to 140 mg or withheldfor the duration of inhibitor use.. Subjects will be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib toxicity (at the investigator’s 
discretion). If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (see Appendix A) must be used, 
ibrutinib will be reduced to 140 mg (for 840 mg/day dose, reduce to 280mg) for 
the duration of the inhibitor use. No dose adjustment is required in combination 
with mild inhibitors. 
 Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be  avoided during ibrutinib treatment, as 
these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Appendix A) 
 Co-administration of ibrutinib with strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin, in healthy 
subjects decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 10-fold. 
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort). Consider  alternative agents with less CYP3A 
induction. 
  
 A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix A.  A comprehensive list of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ma in-table/ This website is continually 
revised and should be checked frequently for updates. 
 Anti-platelet Agents and Anticoagulants:  
 Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with 
ibrutinib. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or 
medications that inhibit platelet function. Subjects with congenital bleeding 
diathesis have not been studied. For guidance on ibrutinib and the use of 
anticoagulants during procedures/surgeries see Section 5.5. 
 Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy during treatment with ibrutinib 
should be treated with low molecular weight heparin as the preferred therapy. 
Patients who are on full dose anticoagul ation therapy while being treated with 
ibrutinib and who experience concurrent grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia/bleeding despi[INVESTIGATOR_461998]. 
 Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial 
fibrillation), consider the risks and benef its of continuing ibrutinib treatment. If 
therapeutic anticoagulation is clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should 
be held and not be restarted until the subj ect is clinically stable and has no signs 
of bleeding. Subjects should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding. No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_591566] Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by 
[CONTACT_183939] 
22 
 In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but is a mild 
inhibitor (with an IC50 of 2.15 μg/mL). Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug-drug 
interactions with P-gp substrates. However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit 
intestinal P-gp after a therapeutic dose. There is no clinical data available; therefore, co-
administration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates (eg, digoxin) with ibrutinib may 
increase their blood concentration and should be used with caution and monitored closely for 
toxicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] QT Prolonging Agents  
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic ECG 
and electrolyte monitoring should be considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Antiplatel et Agents and Anticoagulants  
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or  medications that inhibit platelet function. 
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. Ibrutinib should be held at 
least [ADDRESS_591567]-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of 
bleeding (see Section 5.5).  
 
5.4 Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment 
Patients may be removed from study for the following reasons: 
 Documented disease progression or symptomatic tumor progression. In the case of 
symptomatic tumor progression, all efforts s hould be made to document disease status 
radiologically prior to removal from study; 
 Occurrence of unacceptable toxicity (see table 5-2 regarding dose modifications for toxicity). Patients removed from treatment  for intolerable toxicity should still be 
followed with regular tumor assessments until disease progression or start of a new 
treatment; 
 Patient has been off treatment for >3 weeks; 
 The patient chooses to terminate participation in the study; 
 At the discretion of the investigator; 
 If, at any time, the constraints of this prot ocol are detrimental to the patient’s health 
and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event the study chairs should be notified, the reasons for 
discontinuation should be documented, and the patient should be followed as appropriate 
per study. 
5.5 Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management with Surgeries or Procedure  
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery. The following 
guidance should be applied to the use of ibrutinib  in the perioperative period for patients who 
require surgical intervention or an invasi ve procedure while receiving ibrutinib:  
23 
 5.5.1. Minor Surgical Procedures  
For minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or 
paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least [ADDRESS_591568] 7 days  after the urgent surgical procedure.  
6. Visit schedule and assessments 
6.1 Pretreatment Evaluation 
Baseline tumor and patient characteristics including:

Tests to be performed within 28 ±2 days prior to initiation of therapy (if day 28 falls on a 
weekend or holiday the deadline may be extended to the next working day): 
 
 Radiologic assessment of tumor burden by [CONTACT_5711]; In all cases, imaging studies should encompass the abdomen and any other known sites of measurable disease. For 
small bowel NETs, imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended. For pancreatic 
NETs, abdominal imaging is sufficient if there are no known extra abdominal sites.  For 
lung NETs, imaging of the thorax and abdomen is recommended.    
 Assessment of secretor y proteins. All patients will und ergo an initial assessment of 
chromogranin A. Patients with suspected serotonin-producing tumors (and all patients with midgut carcinoid tumors) will have a 24 hour urine 5-HIAA measured at baseline.  
Other possible neuroendocrine tumor markers/hormones (e.g. pancreatic polypeptide, 
24 
 gastrin, glucagon, etc.) may be collected at the discretion of the investigator based on 
clinical symptoms and tumor location. 
 
Tests to be performed within 14 ±2 days prior to initiation of therapy (if day 14 falls on a 
weekend or holiday the deadline may be extended to the next working day): 
 
 History and physical evaluation including height, weight, vital signs and performance status; 
 Baseline hematological and biochemical profiles including CBC with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel (fasting glucos e, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,  albumin, SGOT (AST) SGPT (ALT) total 
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase); 
 Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential; 
 Correlative laboratory studies with the pote ntial to correlate with response to the 
treatment (measurement of serum Tryptase- β2). 
6.2 Evaluations During Treatment 
  
Beginning of every cycle (defined as 28 ±2 days): 
 Physical examination; 
 Toxicity assessment; 
 Vital signs; 
 Weight; 
 ECOG performance status;

 Fasting comprehensive metabolic panel; 
 Assessment of adverse events. 
 
Data to be obtained every 3 cycles ±1 week of  treatment until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or withdrawal of consent: 
 Radiologic assessment of tumo r burden by [CONTACT_5711]; 
 Assessment of chromogranin A and/or other tumor markers or hormones if elevated at 
baseline (see section 6.1); 
 EORTC QLQ C-30 and EORTC QLQ GI-NET21 questionnaires; 
 Correlative laboratory studies (see section 6.1). 
 Patients who have an ongoing grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time of discontinuation 
from study drug treatment will continue to be followed at no less than monthly intervals, until 
resolution of toxicity to less than grade 2. 
6.3 Instructions for processing correlative laboratory studies 
 Correlative laboratory studies will include the assessment of blood- and tissue-based biomarkers 
with the potential to correlate with response to treatment. 
25 
 6.3.1 Blood-based biomarkers 
Blood will be collected every three months. Serum measurement of Tryptase- β2 will be 
performed by [CONTACT_462007]. 
6.3.2 Tissue-based biomarkers: 
If available, archival tissue containing a tumor block (preferred) or 10 unstained slides (3-5 
micron thick) from patient’s primary or metastatic neuroendocrine tumor should be sent to 
Moffitt Cancer Center for correlative immunohist ochemical studies. Specimens should be placed 
in a secure, airtight container, labeled with the patient name [CONTACT_20565]. 
Site should contact [CONTACT_462008] ([PHONE_9671] with expected delivery date.

Tampa, FL [ZIP_CODE]  
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be used to eval uate the expression of c-kit, tryptase and 
chymase as markers for mast cell presence and activation, respectively. Sections of 3-4 microns 
in thickness will be cut from the selected formal in-fixed paraffin embedded tissue and subjected 
to IHC staining protocol using the Dakocytomat ion Autostainer (DakoCytomation, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_461999], 
Calif). Microwave antigen retrieval with IHC Sel ect EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, will be utilized.  
Primary antibodies with cross-reactivity against the human subtypes of the above mentioned 
targets will be diluted and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Using a 
semiquantitative scoring system, the intensity of IHC staining for c-kit, chymase and tryptase will be scored as either 0 (negative), 1+ (mild positive staining), 2+ (moderate positive) and 3+ 
(strong positive staining). The correlation between staining patterns and clinical outcomes 
(response rate or PFS) will be analyzed in a descriptive fashion.

syndrome (e.g. urine 5-HIAA, gastrin, glucagon, in sulin, etc.) should be measured at baseline, at 
each restaging cycle and at the end of study treatment. 
 
h Baseline radiologic tests (CT or MRI with iv contrast) should include all known sites of 
metastatic disease. For most midgut carcinoid tumors, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated. For pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen 
may be sufficient. Radiological scans documenting target lesions should be repeated every 3 
cycles (12 weeks). The same type of scan should be used at each evaluation.  
i See section 9.[ADDRESS_591572] Criteria for response 
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) guidelines30 will be employed 
in this study. For the purposes of this study, measurable disease is defined as the presence of at 
least one measurable lesion. Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of meas urement is to be recorded) with a minimum size 
of: 
 [ADDRESS_591573] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm; when CT scans have 
slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness). 
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable). 
 [ADDRESS_591574] be =[ADDRESS_591575] scan (CT scan slice thickness is recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow- up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurab ility described above. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable if they meet the definition of measurability described above. Ho wever, if non-cystic lesions are present in the 
same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
28 
  
Non-measurable lesions:  all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breas t disease, lymphangitic i nvolvement of skin or 
lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_201782].  Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
Lesions with prior local treatment, such as those situated in a previously irradiated area or in an 
area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) in the lesion.  
 Target lesions: all measurable lesions up to a ma ximum of two lesions per organ and  five lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, s hould be identified as ta rget lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesion s should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements 
(either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target  lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  The baseline sum diam eters will be used as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis will contribute.  
Non-target lesions: All lesions (or sites of disease) not identified as target lesions, including 
pathological lymph nodes and all non-measurable lesions, should be identified as non-target 
lesions and be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required and they 
should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, ‘unequivocal progression’. 
 
 
 
7.1.1  Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed by [CONTACT_89422] [ADDRESS_591576] met. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm 
 
Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum longest diameter. This must be confirmed by [CONTACT_89423] [ADDRESS_591577] met.  
Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
 
Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient decrease to qualify for partial response nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for progressive disease. 
7.1.2 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions 
• Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. When lymph nodes are included as 
29 
 target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met 
since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10 mm. 
 
• Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their act ual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small. However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes become so faint on a CT scan that the radiologist may not feel  comfortable assigning an exact measure and may 
report them as being ‘too small to measure’, in which case a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. 
 
• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be ad ded together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane betwee n them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
 
7.1.3 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker levels. All lymph nodes must be non-p athological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 
Non-CR / Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker levels above normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
 
• When patient has measurable disease. To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the 
non-target disease, there must be an overall leve l of substantial worsening in nontarget disease 
such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more 
non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
 • When patient has only non-measurable disease. There is no measurable disease assessment to 
factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. Because 
worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified, a useful test that can be applied is to 
consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable 
disease. Examples include an increase in a pleura l effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’ or an increase 
in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.  
7.1.4 New lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. 
 • The finding of a new lesion should be unequivo cal (i.e., not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor, especially when the patient’s baselin e lesions show partial or complete response). 
30 
  
• If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should  be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
 
• A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and disease progression.  Cytology and Histology: if the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic 
nature should ideally be confirmed by [CONTACT_89424]. These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases. 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has me t criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response, stable disease, and progressive disease.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_591578] Overall Response: the best overall response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (tak ing as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the patient’s best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.

Note:  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progres sion at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to di stinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.

Inevaluable designation: When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, 
the patient is not evaluable at that time point. If  only a subset of lesion measurements are made at 
an assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contri bution of the individual missing lesion(s) would 
not change the assigned time point response. This would most likely happen in the case of PD.

and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans but not for lung). Lesions on a chest X-ray 
may be considered measurable lesions if they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. 
However, CT is preferable.  Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥[ADDRESS_591582] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  Cytology and 
histology can be used in rare cases (e.g., for evaluation of residual masses to differentiate 
between Partial Response and Comp lete Response or evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to 
differentiate between Progressive Di sease and Response/Stable Disease).  Use of endoscopy and 
laparoscopy is not advised. However, they can be used to confirm complete pathological 
response. 
. 
7.3 Confirmation Measurement/Duration of Response 
Confirmation: To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_89425] [ADDRESS_591583] 1.1. 
 Duration of Overall Response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR/PR (whichever  is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
 
Duration of Stable Disease: Stable disease is me asured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 
Progression Free Survival (PFS): PFS is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment 
to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has 
not progressed or died at the date of the analysis cut-off or when he/she receives any further anti-
cancer therapy, PFS is censored at the time of the last tumor assessment be fore the cut-off or the 
anti-cancer therapy date. 
 
Time to Treatment Failure: Time from administra tion of the initial dose of ibrutinib until study 
discontinuation for any reason (e.g. disease progres sion, toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent). 
 
Biochemical marker response will be defined as  50% reduction in tumor marker from baseline.

 8.2 Endpoints to be followed  
 
Efficacy Endpoints 
 Tumor response rate using RECIST (Primary endpoint); 
 OS, determined from the time of drug administration to death from any cause (Secondary 
endpoint); 
 PFS, determined as the time from administra tion of the initial dose of ibrutinib until 
objective tumor progression using RECIST, or death (Secondary endpoint); 
 Duration of response, defined as time from first observation of an objective response 
which is subsequently confirmed, to first disease progression or death due to any cause 
(Secondary endpoint); 
 Changes in health-related quality of life, as assessed by [CONTACT_462009]-C30 and QLQ GI.NET21 (see section 11). 
 
Safety Endpoint  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious 
adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters and 
regular physical examinations. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the 
study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed  according to the NIH/NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4) available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelop ment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  All adverse events 
will be documented on the adverse event CRF. 
 
Exploratory Analyses (refer to Section 6.3) 
As part of this study, we will explore the co rrelation between early biochemical response and 
response rates or PFS. Early biochemical responders will be defined as patients with elevated 
chromogranin A (CgA) who experience a major reduction (>50%) or normalization of their CgA 
between their baseline (pretreatment) measurement and their follow-up assessment [ADDRESS_591584] 
cells in the tumor tissue samples. Archival pathology specimens will be reviewed at the study institution (M offitt Cancer Center) 
for determination of mitotic rate (number of mitoses per 10 high-powered fields) and Ki-67 
index. 
This study is not sufficiently powered to es tablish definitive outcome for the correlative 
endpoints. These results will be considered hypothesis generating and any comparison with a 
significant alpha <0.[ADDRESS_591585], phase II study, in which two cohorts of patients (carcinoid and pNET) 
consisting of [ADDRESS_591586] the null hypothesis that ibrutinib has a response rate of 5% or 
less in this disease. The sample size calculation has been based on the assumption that a true 
response of greater than 18% (com parable with that seen with agents such as sunitinib in pNET13 
or bevacizumab in carcinoid tumors31) would generate interest in a larger randomized study. 
Taking into account both study feasibility given these relatively rare tumor and the relatively 
small difference in H1 and H0, with [ADDRESS_591587] the 
hypothesis that the true response is 18% versus 5% with a power of 80% and a type 1 error of 6%, while with [ADDRESS_591588] the hypothesis that the true 
response is 20% versus 5% with a power of 80% and a type 1 error of 8%. Patients will be 
accrued to the protocol according to a Simon’s two-stage minimax design. In the carcinoid cohort, 15 subjects will be enrolled into stage-1. If 1 or more response is observed, then another 
15 subjects will be enrolled into stage-2. At the completion of the study, if 4 or more responses out of N=30 are observed, significance at 6% is reached. Under this design, and if the true response rate is ≥18%, then the probability of observing ≥1 response in stage-1 is ≥95%. In the 
pNET cohort, [ADDRESS_591589] age-1. If 1 or more response is observed, 
another 9 subjects will be enrolled into stage-2. At the completion of the study, if 3 or more 
responses out of N=21 are observed, significance at 8% is reached. Under this model, and if the true response rate is ≥20%, the probability of observing ≥1 response in stage-1 is 93%. In both 
cohorts, at least [ADDRESS_591590] scheduled follow-up 
scan (e.g. completion of the first four cycles of  therapy) will be replaced, unless patients drop out

or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is 
the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring 
35 
 after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse 
events if they worsen after starting study drug.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. Clinically sign ificant laboratory results are those requiring a 
change in the patient’s treatment, further diagnos tic testing or specific clinical intervention (i.e., 
treatment delays or dose modifications, etc). The occurrence of adverse events should be sought 
by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also 
may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_349132], laboratory test, or othe r assessments. As far as possible, each adverse 
event should be evaluated to determine: 
 the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade 1-4) 
 its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
 its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
 action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
 whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study 
drug treatment including possible interrupti on or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89392], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to tr eat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure or will be communicated between Investigator Brochure 
updates in the form of Investigator Notifications . This information will be included in the patient 
informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
9.1.1  Attribution 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows: 
 Definite: The AE is clearly re lated to the study treatment; 
 Probable: The AE is likely related to the study treatment; 
 Possible: The AE may be related to the study treatment; 
 Unlikely: The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment; 
 Unrelated: The AE is clearly not related to the study treatment.

Drug Safety per the SAE reporting timelines.  
9.2.1  Major Hemorrhage  
Major hemorrhage is defined as any of the following: 
 Any treatment-emergent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher*. Any 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade 
 Any treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade 
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of re d blood cells should be reported as grade [ADDRESS_591595] according to Section 11.4.6 above.

Data safety monitoring plan  
Data including adverse events w ill be entered into Oncore. The participating investigator will 
report all adverse events to the protocol chair and to the IRB according to the local IRB’s 
policies and procedures in reporting adverse events. The protocol chair has the obligation to 
report all SAE to the FDA and IRB. SAE and AESI  will be also reported to Pharmacyclics Drug 
Safety per the SAE reporting timelines. 
10. Data collection 
Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a protocol case number. This number is uni que to the participant on this trial and must 
be used for case report form (CRF) completion in Oncore . 
Investigators must enter the information required by [CONTACT_462011]. 
11. Quality of Life Assessment 
Patient quality of life will be measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3) and the EORTC 
QLQ GI.NET21 questionnaires (appendices B and C).  The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is 
designed to assess the health-rela ted quality of life of cancer pati ents participating in clinical 
trials.  It is composed of [ADDRESS_591599]. 
Both questionnaires will be scored and handled as recommended in the user manual.  Missing 
items will be imputed with the m ean of the non-missing items sc ored at that assessment time 
point.  Ambiguous items will be considered as missing items.  At each assessment time point, 
summary statistics of the raw score and linear tr ansformation score (on a 0-100 scale) will be 
provided.

 12. Publication of trial results  
Publications resulting from this trial may be developed by [CONTACT_462012] (within 30 days before submission or other public disclosure) to 
prospectively review any proposed publication, abst ract or other type of disclosure that reports 
the results of the study.  
13. Regulatory considerations 
13.1 Protocol review and amendments 
This protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to 
the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit participants) and any other necessary documents 
must be submitted, reviewed and approved by a properly constituted IRB governing the study 
location. 
Any change or addition (excluding administrative ) to the study protocol or informed consent 
form protocol must be submitted as amendments and must be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_462013] d the investigator before implementation.  
Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require addition al approval by [CONTACT_1201]. Any changes in study 
conduct must be reported to the IRB. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_462000]. 
All decisions of the IRB con cerning the conduct of the stud y must be made in writing.

the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time 
and that withdrawal of consent will not aff ect his/her subsequent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician. 
This informed consent should be  given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non-
technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating 
it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the 
documents, oral presentation may be made or signature [CONTACT_89447] [CONTACT_423]’s legally appointed 
representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient 
could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. 
The informed consent form is considered to be pa rt of the protocol, and must be submitted by [CONTACT_462014]. The original signed copy of the consent document must be 
retained in the medical record or research file. 
39 
 13.3 Committees 
13.3.1 Scientific Review Committee (SRC) 
Each SRC conducts a formal internal peer review of all clinical protocols and general scientific 
oversight of interventional clinical research. Protoc ols are reviewed for scientific merit, adequate 
study design, safety, availability of targeted  study population, and feasibility of timely 
completion of all proposed research projects to be conducted by [CONTACT_462015]. Each SRC is responsible for evaluation the risk/benefit assessment and 
corresponding data and safety monitoring plan as part of the scientific review and approval process. 
13.3.2 Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) 
The DSMC will meet on a monthly basis and will continually assess for subject safety and recommend changes to protocol and study as required to preserve subject safety and prevent any 
untoward toxicity. 
13.3.3 Protocol monitoring Committee (PMC) 
This study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_462016]. The PMC monitors its 
assigned ongoing research protocol for: adverse event reporting, data and safety monitoring, and internal audit findings. The PMC, upon review of any agenda item, may approve the study for 
continuation, require revisions, suspend or close a protocol. 
13.4 Internal monitoring 
The trial will be monitored per Moffitt Cancer Center policy MRI-P.PSO.03, Monitoring of 
Investigator Initiated Clinical Research.  Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt’s Clinical 
Trials Database, Regulatory documents and cas e report forms will be monitored internally 
according to Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring Policies. Monitoring will be performed regularly 
to verify data is accurate, complete and verifiab le from source documents; and the conduct of the 
trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendments, Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
13.5 Ethics and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., 
advertisements, if applicable, fr om the IRB/IEC.  The trial will be performed in accordance with 
the protocol, International Conference on Harmon ization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and 
applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 
It is understood that deviations from the protocol should be avoided, except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to a research part icipant. In such case, the deviation must be 
reported to the IRB according to the local reporting policy.

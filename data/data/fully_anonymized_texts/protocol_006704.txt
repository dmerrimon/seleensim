Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   2 Introduction  
Three -dimensional (3D) visualization technology for laparoscopy has been proposed, 
since the early 1990’s, as a method  to facilitate laparoscopic perf ormance. However, early 3D 
laparoscopic technology was limited in terms of image quality, so that its use had not been 
implemented [1]. The latest technical developments ensure high -definition 3D visualization 
with the same quality that current two -dimensi onal (2D) systems provide.  
The anticipated advantages of 3D laparoscopic visualization for the surgeon are 
greater accuracy and speed in manual skills, translating to decreased operative time, reduced 
learning curve, and superior  safety [2]. It was report ed that, 3D laparoscopic visualization 
offers significant advantages in enhanc ing laparoscopic performance, even in novice 
surgeons, comparing to the 2D systems  [3-5]. We hypothesize that 3D visualization may 
allow surgeons to reduce the overall operating time with a rate of 10% with comparable 
perioperative and postoperative outcomes.   The p rimary en dpoint of this study is  to determine 
the feasibility  of the laparoscopic approach  using 3D visualization in the surgical treatment of 
ulcerative colitis . Secon dary endpoints are to determine whether 3D visualization confers 
benefits such as reduced  operating time and intra -operative complications  with comparable 
postoperative outcomes.  
Device Description  
 
The EXERA III Universal Platform will be used in this stu dy, in conjunction with the 
ENDOEYE FLEX 3D. The ENDOEYE FLEX 3D can also be used in 2D mode, by [CONTACT_14662] a 
programmed button on the handle of the scope, or by [CONTACT_10540] 2D/3D button on the 3D 
Visualization Unit. The articulating tip of the ENDOEYE FLEX a llows for the scope to be 
used in both single -site and multi -port procedures, providing critical views and allowing a 
bird's eye view so that the scope is out of the way of other instruments (while still capturing 
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   3 the image at the surgical site).  All equi pment used in this trial has been cleared under 510(k) 
approval by [CONTACT_1622], and has been on the market in the US since April 2013.

Materials a nd Methods  
Study Size: 
Mean operating time for laparoscopic subtotal colectomy for medically refractory UC 
was reported longer with a comparison to open surgery in the recently published studies  [6, 
7]. 
Therefore the effort to decrease operating time in laparoscopic  colectomy has gained 
importance.  We assumed that, in order to be able to determine a 10% reduction in mean 
operating time, each group should include 27 patients (80% power and 5% significance).  
Patients who will undergo laparoscopic total abdomi nal colectomy (TAC) for UC will 
be included in the study. All subjects will be randomized into two groups: 3D laparoscopy, 
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   4 and 2D laparoscopy. Three staff surgeon s (EG, HK, SS) at the department of colorectal 
surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio  will perform the procedures with 2D and 3D laparoscopy. . In 
total, 54 patients will be included ( 27 patients for each group). There will be a demonstration 
period in order to increase the surgeon’s  familiarity with the new 3D laparoscopy system, and 
each surgeon will perf orm at least one colectomy procedure before operating on study 
patients. One surgeon (EG) will perform all of his colectomies using a single port approach.  
Two surgeons (HK, SS) will perform all of their colectomies with a multiport approach.  
Inclusion Cr iteria:  
 Indication for surgery must be Ulcerative Colitis  
 Patient age >18 years of age Elective procedure  
 BMI between ≥ 17 and ≤ 40  
 Total colectomy with end ileostomy, without proctectomy  
Exclusion Criteria : 
 Any preoperative diagnosis other than UC  
 Patient age  < 18 years old  
 Emergency surgery  
  (will be adjusted with adhesion scoring.) Pregnancy  
 Presence of any gastrointes tinal tract malignancy  
 Segmenta l colon resections , completion proctectomy, total proctocolectomy, 
pouch procedures  
Baseline data:  
Patient demographics  (age, gender , BMI),  ASA score, co-morbidities, details of the 
current status of UC (time f rom diagnosis, medications, presence of dysplasia or malignancy) 
will be documented.  
 
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   5 Adhesion scoring system : 
With the aim of comparability of the groups, a ten-point adhesion scoring system will 
be adopted , modeled from Dowson et al [8] . The extent of adhesions to the incision sites and 
abdominal wall and severity of adhesions will be assessed. Severity of adhesions is classified 
as: grade 0, no adhesions; grade 1, flimsy thickness, avascular; grade 2, moderate thickness, 
limited vascularity; and grade 3, dense thicknes s, vascularized. The extent of adhesions is 
quantified as: 0, no adhesions; 1, mild (up to 25 per cent of total area and length of incision); 
2, moderate (26 –50 per cent of total area and length of incision); and 3, severe (more than 50 
per cent of total a rea and length of incision).  
Procedural data :  
The procedural data that will be recorded are: name [CONTACT_551021], date of surgery, 
operating time, estimated blood loss, number of scope cleaning, number of scope in and out of 
trocar, number of scope fogging, need of conversion, reason for conversion . With the aim of 
underlin ing the technical impact of using the 3D system, intraoperative inadverten t 
complications such as burns, pu nctures, and misapplications of the energy device will be 
documented. Total operat ing time will be defined as period of time from insertion of Veress 
needle to last  closure of the skin.  Laparoscopic TAC will be evaluated in 5  stages:  
1- Take -down of ileocolic pedicle:  Following laparoscopic visualization of the liver 
and the rest of the ab domen to rule out metastatic or other unsuspected disease, the 
colonic dissection will  begin with identification and takedown of the ileocolic 
vascular pedicle, which facilitates the exposure and preservation of the underlying 
second and third portions of the duodenum.  This stage will start with the incision 
of the peritoneum covering ileocolic pedicle, and end with the completion of the 
ligation of ileocolic artery and vein.  
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   6 2- Mobilization of the right colon:  Attachments of the terminal ileum and ascending 
colon will be taken, and hepatic flexure will be mobilized. This stage will start 
after completion of the ileocolic pedicle takedown, and end with full mobilization 
of the hepatic flexure.  
3- Mobilization of the tranverse colon, takedown of the omentum and mid dle 
colic vessels:  Following  complete mobilization of the right colon, this stage will 
be started right after taking the right edge of the omentum  down in order to 
mobilization of transvers colon.  The first three portions of the duodenum, the head 
of the pancreas, and the right edge of the transverse mesocolon will be identified. 
At this stage, it will be possible to take down the right and left branches of the 
middle colic artery using an energy device or, if necessary, identify and similarly 
take down mo re proximally the short trunk of the middle colic artery near the 
pancreas. Preservation of the omentum will be left to the discretion of the 
operating surgeon. The takedown of the omentum and transverse mesocolon will 
be continued using a tissue -sealing d evice from right to left until the splenic 
flexure is reached.  
4- Mobilization of the sigmoid and left colon, and splenic flexure  takedown:  
Taking down the splenic flexure by [CONTACT_551016].  Since t here will be  no oncologic concerns, 
the superior rectal artery  will be preserved . The sigmoid colon will be mobilized 
and the sigmoidal arteries will be taken down .  This stage will be completed after 
full mobilization of descending colon and splen ic flexure.  
5- Transection of the rectum or rectosigmoid:  This stage will start with insertion of 
the stapler through the trocar, and end with rectal or rectosigmoid stump totally 
transected from the colon.  
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/2017   7 6- Identification of the ureters:   Time required for id entification of the ureters.  
Time for each stage of the procedure will be documented separately. P ostoperative 
complications  and length of total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_551009].  
All surgeons invol ved the study will have a standard  eye exam containing  visual 
acuity, color vision, stereopsis and accommodation in order to ensure standardization of 
evaluation of surgeon’ s visual satisfaction .   To evaluate  surgeon ’s subjective satisfaction  with 
the visualization system , each surgeon will take a survey aft er completion of surgery. Side 
effects such as color rendition, visual sharpness, contrast, ghosting, eye strain, headache, 
dizziness, disorientation, physical discomfort, and poor visualization will be queried in the 
questionnaire . 
Clinical data obtained from patients  will be retained and entered into case report  
form s. These form s  will be maintained on the Department of Colorectal Surgery server. 
Access will be restricted, and accessible  by [CONTACT_978] , co-investigators  and study coordinator 
approved by [CONTACT_3181].

presentation and explanation. Printed materials regarding the study, including the Study 
Consent and a written explanation o f the two surgical methods, will be provided to the subject 
at that time.  
 It will be made clear to prospective subjects that the purpose of an IRB approved 
study in this setting is to make sure the subjects rights are protected, that the new methods are 
being fairly described and presented, that the potential risks and alternatives are discussed, 
and to gather objective information regarding the two methods, as well as results and 
outcomes.  
Protocol ve rsion date: 11/6/[ADDRESS_723940] in the study, the Study RN/Coordinator or 
physician will meet/speak with the patient and thoroughly explain both the study and its 
consent form. All subjects will also have the opportunity to further discuss the study with 
their surgeon if they so desire.  After all questions are  answered, interested subjects will be 
asked to sign the IRB-approved consent  form , at which time they will be enrolled.  It will be 
made clear that in o rder to enter this study, subjects must be willing to receive either of the 
following procedures:  1) 3 D laparoscopic total colectomy 2) 2D laparoscopic total 
colectomy.  
Statistical Analysis  
After obtaining informed consent for each cohort patient enrolled in the study, 2D and 3D 
groups will be constructed by [CONTACT_551017] . 
Results will be reported in descriptive statistics and expressed as mean ± SD for continuous 
values. Categorical variables will be analyzed with Chi-square or Fisher exact test, whereas 
Wilcoxon rank sum test  will be used for continuous variables.  P value < 0.05 will be 
considered significant.

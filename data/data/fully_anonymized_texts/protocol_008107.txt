Description  of Change   
Rationale for Change  Section(s)  
Affected  
Upon evaluating the pharmacodynamics  
(hemoglobin) responses after 4 weeks of therapy 
with the starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg in initial 20 
patients, it has been determined to increase the 
starting  dose for newly  enrolled patients  by [CONTACT_12691]  
i.e. from 2.0 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg level as majority of 
the initial 20 patients required a dose increase at 
Week  5, per dose adjustment rule. To achieve optimal Hb  
response  with  the starting  dose Synopsis  
3.3.1; 5.1; 
7.1.1  
Exclusion  #17 was  updated  from:  
“Known, active or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding” 
to “Known, active or chronic gastrointestinal 
bleeding”  The criterion has been revised  
to exclude all types of 
active/chronic bleeding Synopsis;  
6.2 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Chemotherapy Treatments has been  
updated to the following (changed text  is italicized):  
 
“If Paclitaxel (e.g.  Taxol® or Abraxane®) is given as 
part of a chemotherapy regimen, roxadustat dosing 
should be held for 24 hours before and after 
treatment (time 0 = start of infusion) with this drug. Roxadustat dosing frequency may be adjusted, as needed.” The current suggested [ADDRESS_694317] drug- drug interaction with  
several  different drugs. 
However, upon further in-house 
review of paclitaxel PK,  
FibroGen considers the 
potential for DDI with  
roxadustat relatively insignificant if the interval 
between  roxadustat and  
paclitaxel is reduced to 24 
hours. FibroGen is reducing the  
48 hour interval to 24 hours and clarifying the window start time 
as the start  of infusion. [IP_ADDRESS]  
 
Paclitaxel PK sub -study has been added under 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] to evaluate the effect of  
roxadustat timing of administration on the 
pharmacokinetics  of paclitaxel.  This PK sub study will help us  
to determine the impact  
roxadustat timing of  
administration on paclitaxel PK 
(drug- drug-interaction) and  
whether there is a need  for an 
interval  between  roxadustat  and [IP_ADDRESS]

STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 2 Open Label Study Investigating the Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat (FG-4592) 
for Treatment of Anemia in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Treatment for Non-Myeloid Malignancies.  Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled. 
STUDY PERIODS  
Screening  Period: 
All screening procedures are to be completed within 28 days prior to Study Day 1. Patients will be  
evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine eligibility for participation in this  
trial. Protocol assessments will  be completed during screening visits in accordance with Schedule of 
Assessments (SOA) to establish a baseline profile, including; demographics, medical history, clinical 
status and disease stage for each patient.  Patients determined to be eligible for participation will be  
enrolled in the trial and will receive roxadustat in an open-label manner. The starting dose for the initial 20 patients will be 2.0 mg/kg.  After the initial 20 patients are enrolled, starting dose(s) for 
additional patients will be sele cted by [CONTACT_456], informed by [CONTACT_534607]. The selected starting dose level will not exceed the highest dose level received by [CONTACT_534608]. Additionally, the sponsor will review clinical efficacy and safety response 
on an ongoing basis and take into account potential impact of certain baseline patient characteristics 
or chemotherapy regimens (such  as from  patients  on a platinum vs non-platinum containing regimen)  
on treatment response in the selection of patients of baseline characteristics and starting dose(s) of  
subsequent patients. Lastly, if there is more than one starting dose cohort open for enrollment at the  
same time for a certain subgroup, such as platinum (or non- platinum) treatment group, patients will 
be randomized to receive a starting dose. A comprehensive table of potential doses is contained in 
the protocol body and in Appendix 2. 
Upon evaluating the pharmacodynamics (hemoglobin) responses after 4 weeks of therapy with the starting 
dose of 2.0 mg/kg in initial 20 patients, it has been determined to increase the starting dose for newly enrolled 
patients by [CONTACT_12691]  i.e. from  2.0 mg/kg  to 2.5 mg/kg level to achieve optimal hemoglobin response.  
 
 
Treatment  Period: 
Patients will undergo 16 weeks of study treatment with roxadustat. Study visits are scheduled every 2 
weeks. Patients’ clinical status and safety will be regularly evaluated.  Efficacy assessments will be  
performed routinely to evaluate patients’ quality of life and disease state. If disease progression  
occurs  during the treatment period, patients  will be discontinued from  study tre atment  and continue 
in the follow-up period. 
Follow-up Period: 
All patients  who  complete  16 weeks (of  treatment with study medication)  will undergo a 4- week  
follow-up period after the last dose of study medication.

Principal Investigator (PI) and/or treating physician will determine when to transfuse a patient based  
on clinical judgement.  
Evaluation for dose modification/adjustment will occur  every  4 weeks. Any  potential dose 
escalation/dose reduction will be at pre- defined  dose step increments.  
After  the initial 20 patients  are enrolled, starting  dose(s)  for additional patients  will be selected  by [CONTACT_103], informed  by [CONTACT_534610]. The selected  
starting dose level will not exceed the highest dose level received by [CONTACT_534611]. 
Additionally, the sponsor will review clinical efficacy and safety response on an ongoing basis and 
take into account potent ial impact of certain baseline patient characteristics or chemotherapy  
regimens (such as from patients on a platinum vs non-platinum containing regimen) on treatment response in the selection of patients of baseline characteristics and starting dose(s) of subsequent patients.  Lastly, if there is more than one starting dose cohort open for enrollment at the same time

dosing schedule of roxadustat should be maintained through the 16 week treatment period, and 
patients  will continue  in the follow-up period. 
Other  Important Information: 
Best supportive care (BSC) including RBC transfusion is permitted to ensure patient’s safety. Principal Investigator  (PI) and site staff will utilize  their own institutional criteria  to determine  when  
to transfuse  a patient.  
Use of any ESA during the study (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, darbepoetin, Mircera, or others; see Appendix 5) is not permitted. Patients who receive an ESA will be discontinued from further treatment  with study medication.  
See the Inve stigator’s  Brochure for additional information  pertaining to roxadustat. 
STATISTICAL  METHODS  
The sample  size of the study was not determined  by [CONTACT_534612].  All analyses  will be  
exploratory for different  dose level.  
The following analysis  populations are defined  and will be used for the statistical analysis:  
• All enrolled  or ITT:  consisted  of all patients  enrolled  in the roxadustat treatment  period, 
regardless  of whether  patients received any  roxadustat.  
• Full analysis set (FAS): consisted of all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of 
roxadustat, have a baseline Hb and at least one corresponding on- treatment Hb  
assessment,  and will be used for all efficacy  analyses  
• Efficacy Evaluable (EE): consisted of all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of roxadustat for at least [ADDRESS_694326] dose.  
• Safety Population (SAF): consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of 
roxadustat. This population will be  for all assessments  of safety  and tolerability  
The efficacy analysis will be based on both the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population and Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population. 
Analyses  of the safety  data will be based on the Safety  Population. 
Baseline Hb value for efficacy analysis is defined as the mean of Screening (central laboratory) Hb  
values  and Day  1 (central  laboratory) Hb value. 
Data  Analyses 
Up to approximately 100 patients will be enrolled in the study, with various diagnoses of non- 
myeloid  malignancies.

Secondary  efficacy  analyses  
The mean change from baseline hemoglobin (without a RBC transfusion) will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765]. This will also be analyzed similar to the model used for the primary  
endpoint. 
In addition, missing hemoglobin data, either because of a missed visit or collected within [ADDRESS_694328] (LOCF)  approach.  
The Number (%) of patients meeting various criteria specified in the protocol as secondary endpoints will also be summarized  using the Clopper–Pearson confidence limits approach. 
The percentages  of patients  who  have a hematopoietic  response, who  receive at least  one RBC 
transfusion will be  estimated using  the Kaplan –Meier  (KM) method. 
Safety  Analysis 
Adverse events, laboratory, vital signs, ECGs data will be descriptively summarized and/or listed.  
Change from baseline values may be calculated for selected vital sign and ECG parameters. Shift  
tables  may  also be constructed. 
Additional endpoints may be detailed with corresponding statistical analysis methods spe cified in a  
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable  regulatory requirement(s), including the archiving of essential documents.

3. INTRODUCTION 
Roxadustat (the investigational study drug) is a new chemical entity (NCE) which belongs to a 
new pharmacological class  of small molecule  enzyme inhibitors (hypoxia inducible factor  
prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, HIF-PHI). It is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the prolyl 
hydroxylase enzymes that regulate the stability of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for  
regulation of erythropoiesis. Roxadustat has been investigated for the treatment of CKD anemia in multiple phase [ADDRESS_694337] efficacy and acceptable safety profile to date. Furthermore, when roxadustat was tested in a rodent model of 
chemotherapy induced anemia, it was efficacious. In light of the unmet medical need in 
Chemotherapy- Induced Anemia (CIA) where patients have limited choices all of which are 
suboptimal, we  aim to  develop a new therapeutic option. This study proposes to  evaluate the use 
of roxadustat in the treatment of  Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia. 
 
3.1. Chemotherapy  Induced  Anemia  (CIA)  
Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia is anemia from reduction in red blood cell production by [CONTACT_534613]. The anemia due to 
myelosuppressive effect of chemotherapy leads to a decrease in patient’s hemoglobin level. As 
oxygen is critical to survival of all cells in the body, a reduction in oxygen- carryi ng capacity, 
measured  as low Hb  level,  can have significant  impact  on the function of various organs and  
risks depending on the severity of anemia. The most common manifestations of anemia are 
fatigue, low energy, and poor quality of life. In severe cases of CIA when the anemia becomes  
life-threatening, blood transfusion may be given if available; in this case, the patient may be 
subjected to the risk of infection and/or immunogenic reactions associated with RBC transfusion. Patient outcome could be compromised if the dose and frequency of chemotherapeutic regimen were to be reduced  in order  to reduce its myelosuppressive effects  to address  the severe anemia.  
 
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_534593] 60% and prevalence is 30% to 90% in the same patient population particularly in those patients undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy. The incidence and severity of chemotherapy -related anemia depend on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the 
type of chemotherapy, schedule and intensity of therapy administered. Other factors are whether the patient has received prior myelosuppressive treatment, radiation therapy or both. There is relatively higher incidence of mild -to-moderate than severe anemia. However, elderly cancer  
patients may show higher severity of clinical symptoms of anemia even at higher hemoglobin levels than do younger people or anemic patients without cancer. Retrospective reviews of  
incidence of anemia that required RBC transfusions in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who received  cytotoxic chemotherapy indicate  that the highest frequency occurs in  those patients  
with lymphomas, lung tumors, and gynecologic (ovarian) or genitourinary tumors in which the incidence may be as high as 50% -60%. The proportion of anemic (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) 
patients increased from 17% before the first chemotherapy cycle to 35% by [CONTACT_534614], with 49% and 51% of the patients with ovarian and lung tumors, respectively, anemic 
by [CONTACT_534615]. The mean hemoglobin concentration at which a transfusion 
was given decreased progressively  with each treatment cycle.

3.1.2. Etiology of Chemotherapy  Induced Anemia  
Chemotherapeutic agents induce anemia through directly impairing hematopoiesis, including 
synthesis of RBC precursors, in the bone marrow. In addition, nephrotoxic effects of particular cytotoxic agents (e.g., platinum-containing agents) can also lead to anemia through decreased 
renal production of erythropoietin. Platinum-based regimens, commonly used in lung, ovarian, 
and head  and neck  cancers,  are well  known to induce anemia caused  by [CONTACT_534616]. The myelosuppressive effects of some cytotoxic agents are likely to accumulate over the course of repeated cycles of treatments, resulting in a steady  
worsening of anemia with additional chemotherapy  cycles.  An increase in the fraction  of grades 
2 and 3 anemia was associated  with increasing  number of chemotherapy  cycles.  
 
3.1.3. Clinical Features  of Chemotherapy  Induced Anemia  
Anemia is a common cause of morbidity in cancer. Because anemia of chronic disease is  
prevalent in cancer pati ents, mild anemia is common before initiation of treatment. Anemia  
generally worsens over time, over repeated cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The anemia associated with chemotherapy are normochromic, normocytic but with inappropriately low reticulocyte  count. Serum Iron and Iron-binding capacity are low. Bone marrow (BM) 
morphology reveals  normal erythroid precursor with  normal or slightly  increased  stainable  iron. 
Erythroid progenitors (BFU- E & CFU -E) size, number and degree of hemoglobinization are 
normal while the BM still maintains normal sensitivity to erythropoietin (EPO). CIA is  
characterized by [CONTACT_534617] (Hb) concentration, RBC count and / or packed cell 
volume to subnormal levels. 
 
3.1.4. Current  Treatment  of Chemotherapy  Induced  Anemia  
The current treatment options for CIA are limited, and thus the anemia in most patients with CIA  
remain untreated. Although ESA has been approved for the treatment of CIA, its use has 
decreased precipi[INVESTIGATOR_534594], death, and cardiovascular  risk.  Such  risks  are associated  with  the high doses of ESA  used in CIA (about 
3X to 5X of doses for CKD anemia).  RBC transfusions are sometimes  used for treating  severe 
CIA, but patients would be exposed to the risks of infection and immunogenic reactions 
associated with RBC transfusions. Reduction in chemotherapy use may decrease the myelosuppressive effects, but patients’ outcome could also be compromised. Given the limitations in the current choices, a new eff icacious, safe, and convenient treatment option for 
CIA is needed. 
3.2. Roxadustat  
3.2.1. Mechanism  of Action  of Roxadustat 
Roxadustat (FG-4592) is an orally administered inhibitor of HIF- PHI. FG-4592 increases  
cellular levels of HIF. HIF is a transcription factor that is believed to be the key element in the body’s oxygen sensing mechanism ( Semenza, 2000 ). HIF regulates expression of genes that 
modulate the acute and  chronic responses to hypoxia. In addition, HIF-responsive genes  regulate 
a wide range of processes, including erythropoiesis, iron metabolism, oxidation, cellular metabolism,  glycolysis, vasculogenesis, cell cycle progression, and  apoptosis.

with the body’s normal homeostatic response to anemia, but under normal oxygenation conditions. 
The physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of FG -[ADDRESS_694339]  
from that of ESAs. These differences result in several potential advantages over ESAs beyond 
the convenience of oral therapy, including: 
• Transient  increase  of circulating  endogenous erythropoietin levels  at or near 
physiologic levels  
• Improved iron metabolism and  bioavailability  
• Effective erythropoiesis in the presence of inflammation  
• Increase in the number of EPO  receptors  in the bone marrow  
• Improvement in lipid profile  
3.2.2. Clinical Experience with  Roxadustat 
A total of [ADDRESS_694340] been completed and three  
studies are ongoing at the time of this submission. As of the 07 September 2019 data cut- off, 
[ZIP_CODE] patients (943 healthy patients, 5994 patients with NDD-CKD, and 6126 patients with DD - 
CKD)  have been  randomized  in the roxadustat CKD clinical  development program. An 
estimated total of 7821 patients received roxadustat, 3129 patients received active comparator (epoetin  alfa or darbepoetin  alfa),  and [ADDRESS_694341] enrolled into Phase 3 studies. 
 
There are > 3200 CKD patients exposed to roxadustat for >= [ADDRESS_694342] received roxadustat for >=2 years. There is a small number of patients receiving roxadustat for > [ADDRESS_694343] been no 
safety  concerns to date, inclusive of thorough QT study which tested  roxadustat dose up to 
5 mg/kg in healthy volunteers, with no evidence of QTc prolongation. The anemia correction response rates  in anemic CKD  patients  not on dialysis (Studies FGCL-4592-041, 
FGCL -4592-047, FGCL -4592-808) and those starting  dialysis  therapy  (FGCL -4592-053, ASP- 
1517- CL-302) were >90%.  
Roxadustat has also been shown to maintain Hb levels when ESA has been withdrawn in dialysis -dependent (DD) end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who previously depended on 
ESA for Hb maintenance (Studies FGCL-4592-040, FGCL-4592- 048, FGCL -4592-806, and 
ASP-1517- CL-307). In CKD patients, the roxadustat dose requirement and achieved Hb levels 
are not impacted  by [CONTACT_25059] C- reactive protein level  (CRP),  a measure of inflammation,  which  
is suggestive of roxadustat’s ability to overcome the dampening effect of  inflammation on  
erythropoiesis (FGCL-45
 92-053, FGCL-4592-806).This is a challenge for ESA use for anemia in 
inflamed patients as higher ESA dose was used and the Hb level achieved were still lowered in  
patients  with  elevated CRP  in study 808. Anemia of inflammation  affect s various patient

populations with chronic diseases, including those with cancer. Roxadustat also overcomes the  
iron dysregulation in CKD patients to enable iron utilization for erythropoiesis, by [CONTACT_534618], and  also loweri ng serum ferritin  levels.  
Comprehensive safety  information  can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
3.2.3. Pharmacology (PK/PD)  of Roxadustat 
Supra-physiological recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) levels may be a contributing factor in the increased cardiovascular and thrombotic risk observed in ESA treated CKD patients and the very high doses of ESA  required  (up to five times  the dose required  in anemia associated  
with CKD)  potentially  contribute to  ESA’s cancer progression risks in oncology patients.  
Roxadustat, a HIF-PHI mechanism impacting multiple parts of the erythropoietic pathway, has been  shown to expose CKD patients  to much  lower  plasma  EPO  levels  than ESA  when  
achieving comparable erythropoietic effects, and the transient peak levels of EPO level with  
roxadustat doses used in CKD patients are within the range of physiologic adaptation. Figure [ADDRESS_694344] of environment on plasma EPO levels: with a range from 10 to 15 mIU/mL in  
healthy patients at sea level, while EPO levels triggered by [CONTACT_534619] 15 to 250 mIU/mL ( Goldberg, 1993, Maeda, 1992), and adaptation to 
moderate high altitude (4500 m) showed mean levels up to 70 mIU/mL ( Milledge, 1985), to  
doses used in CKD patients on dialysis (far right). The off- label ESA use for treatment of anemia 
in MDS patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_534595]-responsive ESRD- dialysis  
patients (such as those at or above the highest dose quartile in Figure 1) that leads to two orders 
of magnitude above the normal physiologic range of EPO. Exposure to high ESA levels are 
thought to be associated with higher risks to off- target effects of ESA. Roxadustat has a potential  
to address anemia need  with more  physiologic EPO  exposure.

3.3. Rationale  for Roxadustat  in Chemotherapy Induced Anemia  
The unmet medical need with CIA exists because of the unintended side- effect of anemia 
induced by [CONTACT_11553]’s  effect  on bone marrow  suppression. However,  the treatment options 
to address CIA are limited. Of the 3 options, RBC transfusion, ESA which leads to 
supraphysiologic levels of endogenous erythropoietin, and/or dose reduction of the chemotherapy treatments, each has its major shortcoming. Therefore, in the US, CIA is left  
mostly  untreated  and RBC transfusion has become patients’  last resort.  
Roxadustat has the potential to address this unmet medical need in light of its positive efficacy  
demonstrated  in multiple  phase [ADDRESS_694345] roxadustat has the 
potential for CIA  therapy.  
This study is an open label study investigating the efficacy and safety of roxadustat (FG-4592) for the treatm ent of anemia in patients receiving multiple cycles / rounds of chemotherapy 
treatments  for Non-Myeloid malignancies.  This will include anemic patients,  with  Hb ≤ 10 g/dL, 
in those who may require RBC transfusion, with treatment duration of 16 weeks. The primary  
efficacy  will be evaluated  after  16 weeks  of treatment  (Appendix 1– Schedule of Assessments).

3.3.1. Rationale for Roxadustat Dose  and Dosage Regimen  
For the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy, roxadustat 
will be administered  orally  three  times  per week (TIW)  and its dose will be titrated  to achieve the 
target response.  This study will provide the information for selection of optimal starting dose of 
roxadustat. In anemia therapy, the goal is to increase Hb level to ~ 11 +/- 1 g/dL. Dose requirement  is individualized, and  dose titration  will be needed  to optimize  treatment  results.  
Roxadustat dose selection in CIA is informed by [CONTACT_534621]. The roxadustat dose shown effective in preclinical CIA model is the same as the dose used in the 5/6 nephrectomy preclinical model of CKD anemia. The starting dose of ~ 2.0 mg/kg in the first 20 patients in this study is one that is efficacious in about 80% of CKD patients, and no safety concern observed. After every 4 weeks of treatment at a dose level of roxadustat, dose requirement will be evaluated and dose modification will be made according to Appendix 2. The maximum permitted dose will be the same as that allowed in the CKD  
program of 400 mg or 3.5 mg/kg TIW (whichever is lower). The highest roxadustat dose studied in healthy volunteers is 5.0 mg/kg in TQT study, and there was no safety concern. There has not  
been  a maximal tolerated  dose in this program. 
Upon evaluating the pharmacodynamics (hemoglobin) responses after 4 weeks of therapy with the 
starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg in initial 20 patients, it has been determine d to increase the starting dose for  
newly enrolled patients by [CONTACT_12691] i.e. from 2.0 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg level to achieve optimal 
hemoglobin response. The maximum permitted dose will remain the same i.e. 400 mg or 3.5 
mg/kg TIW  (whichever is lower).  
 
 
3.3.2. Risks/Benefit  Assessment  of Roxadustat Treatment  in This  Study  
Patients with anemia have a shortage of oxygen carrier, hemoglobin. Depending on the severity 
of anemia,  CIA can  lead  to fatigue,  poor QOL,  and when  severe,  it could be life-threatening. 
Thus, interventions such as blood transfusions, ESA use, or modification of chemotherapy 
regimen could be chosen by [CONTACT_534622]. 
Yet, each of these intervention  has its inherent risks:  blood transfusion carries  risks  of 
transfusion reaction, infection, and there may be limitation of blood supply; ESA use is associated with documented increased risk of death, MI, stroke, and tumor progression; and reduction in chemotherapy doses could lead to less favorable outcome for the patient. It is important to  highlight that the risk with  ESA  in treatment of CIA is related  to the very high doses 
required in cancer patients who suffer from myelosuppression superimposing on their varying degrees of anemia of inflammation where ESA is ineffective. The tumor progression risks and CV risks of ESA are associated with exposure to the high concentrations of exogenous recombinant EPO  in the blood, at orders of magnitude above physiologic range.  
The potential benefits of roxadustat include halting the reduction in Hb level and correction of anemia, thus reduction of pRBC transfusions, and avoiding the need to alter planned chemotherapy regimen to enable patients to maximal benefit of treatment. The se altogether will 
result in the relief of signs and symptoms associated with anemia, the avoidance of the risks associated with RBC transfusions, improvement in quality of life for these cancer patients, and achieving the benefit from the optimal dose of chemotherapy treatment. In contrast to ESA,  
patients  are exposed  to endogenous erythropoietin at  levels  at or near physiologic range to avoid

cells’ response to erythr opoietin, facilitate the mobilization of iron and ultimately lead to
improved erythropoiesis. Furthermore, oral route of administration of roxadustat offersconvenience to patients.
In the experience of roxadustat for treatment of CKD anemia, it has been found well toleratedandhighly efficacious ina number of phase [ADDRESS_694347] dose given ~2 hours before cisplatin to Sprague
Dawley rats. The treatment arms included vehicle, roxadustat 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg, doseresponse in anemia correction was noted on Day 14, per figure [ADDRESS_694348] ofcisplatin based on serum creatinine

Roxadustat Protocol FGCL -[ADDRESS_694349] potentially been linked to increasedtumor growth. Thedoses of FG-4592 used in these studies ranged from 6 to 80 mg/kg, up to
5 times the high dose in Phase 3 (2.5 mg/kg). No effect on tumor promotion was observed with
roxadustat in any of the studies. In addition, roxadustat had no effect on tumor initiation or
metastasis in the studies in which these end -points w ere also measured. Five other HIF -PH
inhibitors from our HIF-PHI library have been evaluated in many of the same rodent tumormodels as roxadustat, as well as some additional ones (35 studies of six HIF- PH inhibitors in
18models total), with no observed e ffect on tumor initiation, promotion ormetastasis.
Specifically, no tumor-related findings were observed when FG-[ADDRESS_694350] cancer. Intermittent treatment ofFG-4592
and another HIF- PH inhibitor, FG-4497, were evaluated in the MMTV-Neundl- YD5 (NeuYD)
transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, in which a significant elevation in markers oferythropoiesis were observed without any evidence of promotion of tumor initiation,progression, or metastasis ( Seely 2017) .
Finally, no significant increases in plasma VEGF levels have been observed inanyof our
nonclinical studies at clinically relevant erythropoietic doses of roxadustat.
3.4.3. Carcinogenicity Studies
Results of genotoxicity and 2- year rodent carcinogenicity studies showed FG -4592 tobe both
nonmutagenic andnoncarcinogenic andthus likely a low risk for carcinogenic potential.
In genotoxicity studies, FG-4592 demonstrated no mutagenic potential in the mouse
micronucleus assay orinthepresence or absence ofmetabolic activators (S9 fraction) as tested
in the bacterial reverse mutation (five Escherichia or Salmonella strains) assay and in the
chromosomal aberration assay.

doses administered, 60 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. Exposure levels (Cmax and AUC) of FG-4592 in the 2-year rodent bioassays were greater than in the human 
plasma collected from the healthy human volunteer clinical trial FGCL -4592-016. Based on the 
in vitro FG-4592 protein binding ratios in mice and rats which were demonstrated to be lower 
than in humans, the free (non-protein bound) exposure multiples between exposure at the NOAELs  in the rodent studies and  at the highest dose  administered  in the repeated  dose clinical  
trial would be greater (~10 and 2 times higher) in mice and rats respectively based on in vitro free fraction than those estimated using  total drug exposure.  
 
3.4.4. Preclinical  Safety  Summary  
The results of the chronic toxicity  studies, the ICH battery  of genotoxicity studies, and the rodent 
carcinogenicity studies showed no evidence of an increased risk of carcinogenicity following up 
to two years repeated  TIW  dosing of FG -4592. 
Conclusion from  preclinical  studies: preclinical evidence suggest FG -4592 does  not present  a 
carcinogenicity  risk.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
5.1. Overall Study  Design  
This is a Phase 2, open label study. The study will evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat for the 
treatment of anemia in patients receiving multi-cycle treatments of myelosuppressive 
chemotherapy. A total of up to 100 patients will be enrolled in this trial, across approximately  
10-20 study centers in the [LOCATION_002].  
This trial has three study periods: 
• Screening  (up to 28 days) 
• 16-week  Treatment  with roxadustat 
• 4-week  Follow- Up 
All screening procedures are to be completed within 28 days prior to Study Day 1. Patients will 
be evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine eligibility for participation  
in this trial.  Protocol assessments will be completed during screening visits in accordance with 
Schedule of Assessments (SOA)  to establish  a baseline profil e, including; demographics, 
medical history, clinical status and disease stage for each patient.  Eligible patients will be  
enrolled in the trial and receive roxadustat in an open-label manner. The starting dose for the 
initial 20 patients will be 2.0 mg/kg , with dose titration to Hb levels every 4 weeks. Starting 
dose(s) for subsequent patients will be selected by [CONTACT_456], informed by [CONTACT_534625]. 
Upon evaluating the pharmacodynamics (hemoglobin) respons es after 4 weeks of therapy with the 
starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg in initial 20 patients, it has been determined to increase the starting dose for 
newly enrolled patients by [CONTACT_12691] i.e. from 2.0 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg level to achieve optimal 
hemoglobin response. The maximum permitted dose will remain the same i.e. 400 mg or 3.5 
mg/kg TIW  (whichever is lower).  
The selected starting dose level of subsequent patients will not exceed the highest dose level 
received by [CONTACT_534608]. Additionally, the sponsor will review clinical efficacy and safety response on an ongoing basis and take into account potential impact of certain baseline patient characteristics or ch emotherapy regimens (such as from patients on a platinum vs non-platinum 
containing regimen) on treatment response in the selection of subsequent patients of such characteristics and starting dose(s) of subsequent patients. This may result in different starting  
dose revisions for each group. Lastly, if there is more than one starting dose cohort open for enrollment at the same time for a certain subgroup, such as a platinum (or non- platinum)  
treatment subgroup, patients will be randomized to receive a starting dose. A comprehensive table of potential doses is contained in the protocol body and in Appendix 2.  Finally, starting  
doses will not be adjusted for platinum containing or non-platinum containing regimens until [ADDRESS_694352] been  dosed at a specific dose level.  
Patients will undergo 16 weeks of study treatment with roxadustat. Study visits are scheduled 
every  2 weeks.  Patients’ clinical status  will be regularly  evaluated.  If disease  progression occurs  
during the treatment period, patients will be discontinued from study treatment and should continue to be followed for safety  evaluation throughout the follow-up period.

5.2.1. Enrollment  
Approximately (up to) 100 patients will be  enrolled  into this study 
No stratification is planned for this study, however sub-groups analyses will be performed as 
described  in the separate statistical analysis  plan (SAP).  Sub-Groups of interest  will include the 
following:

• Other  clinically  relevant characteristics  
Importantly, the initial 8 patients in each of the platinum and non-platinum containing groups 
will all receive the initial starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg.  Data from each group will be examined 
separately  to determine the need of a potential dose step increase for each group. It is possible  
that one group will have a dose increase and the other group will remain at the initial starting dose level.

 7. TREATMENT  OF PATIENTS 
7.1. Study  Treatment  
Roxadustat is administered as an oral tablet, TIW for up to a maximum of 16 weeks overall study 
treatment period.  If dosing delays occur due to AEs or scheduling conflicts, for example, it is 
acceptable to hold (not give) roxadustat for one single  instance not to  exceed a 2- week  period. 
Dosing visits should occur in accordance with the SOA outlined in Appendix 1 whenever  
possible, regardless of delays in chemotherapy dosing. Dosing of roxadustat should continue even  if the planned courses of chemotherapy  are halted.  
Information  regarding storage and  handling is found in the FG-4592 Investigator’s  Brochure and  
the IP Manual.  
 
7.1.1. Roxadustat 
The dose, route and schedule for the administration of  roxadustat is  provided below in Table 1 as

Principal Investigator (PI) and/or treating physician will determine when to transfuse a patient 
based  on clinical judgement. 
Evaluation for dose modification/adjustment will occur  every  4 weeks. Any  potential dose 
escalation/dose reduction will be at pre- defined  dose step increments.  
After  the initial 20 patients  are enrolled, starting  dose(s) for additional patients  will be selected  
by [CONTACT_456], informed  by [CONTACT_534627]. 
Starting  dose for newly  enrolled patients: 
Upon evaluating the pharmacodynamics (hemoglobin) responses after 4 weeks of therapy with the 
starting dose of 2.0 mg/kg in initial 20 patients, it has been determined to increase the starting dose for newly enrolled patients by [CONTACT_12691] i.e. from 2.0 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg level to achieve optimal hemoglobin response.

 8. ASSESSMENTS  OF EFFICACY 
8.1. Study  Assessments  
A signed and dated IRB/IEC-approved informed consent must be obtained before any study- 
specific assessments are performed. Assessments that are part of routine care are not considered  
study- specific and may be used at screening to determine eligibility. All patients will be screened  
for eligibility  before  enrollment.  Only  eligible  patients  will enrolled into  the study. 
 
8.1.1. Screening  Period  
All screening procedures must be performed within 28 days of Day 1. Study procedures to be 
performed  during the screening  period can be found in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 1).  Central  laboratory results  will be used to determine  eligibility.  No IWRS  system  
will be utilized for this study . All enrolled patients will be entered in the clinical database  
(EDC).  
Current disease burden measurement at baseline is required to be done within 3 months of 
enrollment (Day  1), documented in  CRF,  and the scans  or other reports  (used for disease burden 
documentation), as applicable, be available  for comparison  if needed:  
1. For tumor lesion(s) which  are measurable by [CONTACT_281762],  relevant  imaging  stud(ies) 
of choice to be determined by [CONTACT_976], i.e. CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc, is/are required. 
2. For bone lesion  (not measurable by [CONTACT_393]), a  bone scan  is required. 
 
8.1.2. 16-Week  Treatment  Period  
All enrolled  patients  will have  clinic  visits at a scheduled frequency  of every  [ADDRESS_694365] dose 
of study treatment. After the protocol-required reporting period ([ADDRESS_694366] dose), the 
investigator does not need to actively  monitor patients  for serious adverse events (SAEs).  
However, if the investigator becomes aware of a SAE that may be possibly related to study 
treatment after the protocol-required reporting period, the inve stigator may report the event to  
FibroGen as outlined in Section 9.0. SAEs reported outside of the protocol- required reporting 
period will be captured within the safety database only as clinical trial cases for the purposes of 
expedited  reporting. 
 
8.1.4. Missed  Visits  
Study treatment may be withheld/interrupted due to safety reasons, resulting in a “missed” visit. 
These visits may be rescheduled to accommodate interruptions within a total window of + 4 weeks  over the course of the study. Adjustments  to the dosing schedule for roxadustat should be 
discussed with the study Medical Monitor. If a visit is missed and not rescheduled, it will be  
captured  accordingly in the clinical database.

 8.1.5. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits/assessments  may be required  at the discretion  of the Investigator. 
Unscheduled visit data will be captured  accordingly in the clinical database.  
 
8.1.6. Early  Withdrawal from  Treatment  
Patients  who prematurely discontinue the study should be strongly encouraged to  complete  the 
final evaluations scheduled for the EOT visit as specific in the SOA ( Appendix 1).  These  
patients  must be followed for safety  for [ADDRESS_694367] dose of study drug. 
Discontinued patients will continue in the Follow -up period and be followed for progression, 
survival and additional anti- cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
8.2. Assessments  
Refer  to the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1) for details  regarding the timing  and 
frequency  of study assessments.  
 
8.2.1. Vital  Signs  (Including  Weight and Height)  
Vital signs to be collected  include; heart  rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_110387]:  
• Heart  rate should be collected  as beats/min  
• Systolic  and diastolic  blood pressure  should be collected  from  patients  in seated  
position 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_534596]/min  
• Temperature should be taken  as oral  or tympanic and captured  as °F or °C 
Weight  is collected  during screening  and Day  1. Dosing is based  at patient’s  weight at Day  1 of 
treatment.  Height is collected during screening  only. 
 
8.2.2. Physical Exam  
A full physical exam is required during screening, EOT and at the Follow-Up visit. A full 
physical exam  may  include,  but is not limited  to, review of the following systems:  
• G eneral  Appearance,  HEENT,  Lungs, Heart,  Chest  & Back,  Abdomen, Extremities, 
Neurologic, Skin 
 
8.2.3. Electrocardiogram  (ECG  or EKG)  
EKGs  will be performed in  accordance with  institutional standards at  Week  1/Day  1 prior to 
randomization, EOT  and 4- week  Follow-up. 
 
8.2.4. Laboratory Evaluations 
Details regarding sample collection, preparation and transport can be found in the central lab 
manual.  Importantly, dose adjustments/escalations will be made based on results from LOCAL 
Hb testing. This can either be hemocue (supplied by [CONTACT_2918]) or via local lab as long as there is real time turnaround of results to prevent patient inconvenience. However, if in PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the local lab value does not accurately reflect patient’s current condition, PI [INVESTIGATOR_534597].

 There will be a population PK sub-study for roxadustat in this protocol. Sites will not be  
required to participate in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) portion of the study. 
Patients  at sites  that have been  qualified  to participate  in the PK/PD  portion of the study will sign 
an additional informed consent form if they wish to participate in the PK/PD sub-study. Patients  
are NOT required to participate in the sub -study, and this decision will NOT make them 
ineligible for the overall study protocol.   Samples will be taken after [ADDRESS_694369]-dose (ideally on the same 
day as the pre-dose sample but not required). In addition, two samples should be taken at > 5 hours  after  dosing (may  be at  different clinic  visits  consequent with other assessments).  
Accuracy  of time  of most recent  dosing and sampling is important to  capture.  
Paclitaxel  PK sub-study: 
There will be a PK sub -study to evaluate the effect of roxadustat timing of administration on the  
pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in this protocol. Patients are NOT required to participate in the

9.2. Definitions  
9.2.1. Definition  of an Adverse Event  (AE) 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial patient. The 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by [CONTACT_534633]’s medical record. The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches and gout) 
has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly  worse  outcome.  A pre -existing  condition that has  not worsened during the study or 
involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event. ( Section 9.3.1).  
 
9.2.2. Definition  of a Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening AE (i.e., if in the view of the investigator or sponsor, the patient 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event). Life -threatening does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe,  
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707],  
• A persistent  or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life  functions, 
• A congenital anomaly  or birth  defect, or  
• Is considered a medically important event not meeting the above criteria, but which 
may jeopardize a patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other criteria listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events  
include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home, and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Confidential  Page  51 of 76  
 Please note that death is an outcome, not an event; the primary cause of death would be the 
adverse event.  
Surgical  procedures, per se,  are not SAEs.  The condition requiring the surgical  procedure, 
however, may  be an SAE.  
Scheduled  or pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135625] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534598] (including elective procedures) do not warrant reporting as adverse events unless resulting observations are deemed by [CONTACT_534634]. 
 
9.3. Procedures  for Eliciting,  Recording,  and Reporting Adverse  Events  
9.3.1. Adverse Event  Reporting  Period  
The safety  reporting  period begins after  the patient  has signed the informed  consent and  ends [ADDRESS_694372] dose, while all AEs (serious and non- serious) be reported thereafter.  The investigator should 
notify FibroGen of any death or other SAEs occurring after a patient has discontinued or terminated  study participation  that may  reasonably  be related to  this study (Section 9.3.5).  
Pregnancy  reporting  requirements  are outlined in  Section  9.3.6. 
Adverse events  will be followed until resolved, stable,  or until the patient’s  last study visit or 
patient  is lost to follow -up. 
 
9.3.2. Adverse Event  Eliciting/Reporting  
During the AE reporting period, study site personnel will query each patient at each visit to actively solicit any AE occurring since the previous visit. All AEs will be collected in response to a general question about the patient’s well-being and any possible changes from the BL or previous visit, but shall not be specifically solicited. There will be no directed questioning for any specific AE. This does  not preclude the site from  collecting  and recording any AEs reported  
by [CONTACT_534635].  
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be recorded when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology, as determined by [CONTACT_167440]. The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study patient represents a clinically significant c hange from the patient’s baseline values. In 
general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that 
require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where 
applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse  
event. The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.

Roxadustat  Protocol  FGCL -[ADDRESS_694373] be assigned  to each AE:  
• Description  (Investigator’s verbatim  term describing  the event)  
• Dates  of onset and resolution  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug 
• Outcome 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Other  treatment  required  
• Determination  of “seriousness”  
9.3.3. Assessing  Adverse Event  Severity  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, should be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) v 4.0 guidelines. For terms not specified  as part of NCI CTCAE,  the following guidelines should be used to determine grade:  
All AEs  will be assessed  for severity  using the following criteria:  
• Grade 1, Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms which the patient finds easily  
tolerated.  The event  is of little  concern  to the patient  and/or of little-or-no clinical  
significance;  intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2, Moderate:  The patient  has enough discomfort to  cause interference with or 
change in some of their age-appropriate instrumental activities of  daily  living 
(e.g., preparing meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_320627], using the telephone, 
managing money); local or noninvasive intervention indicated.  
• Grade 3, Severe: The patient is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in 
many or all usual activities. The event is of definite concern to the patient and/or 
poses substantial risk to the patient’s health or well-being; likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow-up, including but not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534599]. 
• Grade 4, Life- threatening:  The patient was at immediate risk of death from the  
event  as it occurred.  
• Grade 5, Death : Fatal  AE. 
9.3.4. Assessing  the Adverse Event’s  Relationship  to Study  Drug  
Most of the information about the safety of a drug prior to marketing comes from clinical trials; 
therefore, AE reports from investigators are critically important. The assessment of whether an AE is causally related to the study drug(s) using an evidence-based approach is critical in order to appropriately describe the safety profile study drug(s). Default reporting of individual events as possibly related  is uninformative and  does not meaningfully contribute to the development of 
the study drug’s safety  profile.  
DocuSign  Envelope  ID: 78AB005C -E4B7 -44BD -BE12 -24416589097B  DocuSign  Envelope  ID: F3BFD5A3 -C713 -484B -AB8C -0593506CF8EA  
Roxadustat  Protocol  FGCL -[ADDRESS_694374] provide an evidence-based assessment of the relationship of the AE to 
study drug in accordance with the guidance below. Absence of an alternative  cause would  not 
normally  be considered sufficient evidence to assess an  event as related  to study drug. 
• Related:  
− Any event for which there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the study drug 
may have caused the event. For example, an unanticipated medical condition 
occurs which resolves with study drug interruption and re- occurs with re- administration  of study drug; another example is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_534600]- related  medical  
condition such as a rash  that occurred shortly after first dose of study drug. 
• Not Related:  
− The event  represents  a pre -existing  underlying disease that has  not worsened on 
study 
− The event  has the same characteristics  of a known side- effect  associated  with  a 
co-medication  
− The event is an anticipated medical condition of anticipated severity for the study population 
− The most plausible explanation for the event is a factor that is independent of 
exposure to study drug 
 
9.3.5. Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_534636]/assent through [ADDRESS_694375] dose of roxadustat are recorded in the patient’s medical record and are submitted to FibroGen. All SAEs must be submitted to FibroGen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event  via the SAE  report form.  
If a patient is permanently withdrawn from protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to FibroGen. FibroGen will report serious advers e events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory 
authorities, investigators/institutions, and central IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting  
requirements  according to local regulations and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
There is no requirement to monitor study patients for serious adverse events following the 
protocol-required reporting period or after end of study. However, these serious adverse events can be reported to FibroGen. In some countries (e.g. European Union [EU] member states), investigators are required  to report  serious adverse events that  they  become aware of after end  of 
study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to FibroGen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting; these cases will not be included in the clinical study  report.  
To report an SAE, the investigator must complete an SAE Report Form and fax or email the completed  form to the Sponsor or its designated  safety  management vendor.

 Full details of the SAE should also be recorded on the medical records and in the CRF. The 
following minimum information is required: 
• Patient  number, sex  and age 
• The date of report  
• A description of the SAE  (event, seriousness of the event)  
• Causal  relationship to  the study drug 
• Follow-up information  for the event  should be sent promptly. 
For each SAE observed, the investigator should obtain all of the information available about the 
event,  including (but not limited  to): hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167401], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167402], death  
certificate, appropriate laboratory findings (including autopsies and biopsy results), and clinical 
examinations (including radiological examinations and  clinical consultations).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events  to the Institutional  Review  
Board / I ndependent  Ethics  Committee  
The investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) of SAEs in accordance with local regulations. The Sponsor, or its designated 
safety vendor, will provide a copy of expedited safety reports to the investigator that it intends to submit to global regulatory authorities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deaths  
The investigator will report the fatal event to the Sponsor’s medical monitor. The investigator must provide a causal  assessment  of the relationship of the event to  the study drug according to 
the guidance in Section 9.3.5. 
If the death occurred within the AE collection and reporting period (signed ICF to [ADDRESS_694376] dose) and meets the reporting crite ria, the investigator must submit the SAE Report Form in  
the same manner as described above in Section 9.3.5. If the investigator becomes aware of a death occurring after the AE reporting period and considers it related to roxadustat, it will be reported  as an SAE.  
 
9.3.6. Pregnancies:  Reporting  and Follow- up of Patients  
The outcome of all pregnancies for female patients should be followed up and documented as described. A Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and submitted to Sponsor or designated safety  management  vendor within  [ADDRESS_694377] follow-up to completion of the pregnancy to ascertain its outcome (e.g. spontaneous miscarriage,  elective termination,  ectopic pregnancy, normal birth  or 
congenital abnormality) and whether any AEs occur during the pregnancy  or birth. The  outcome 
of the pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_30036] a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form, 
which should be sent to the Sponsor and/or its designated safety vendor within [ADDRESS_694378] interfered  with  the effectiveness  of a contraceptive medication.  Pregnancies are 
followed up to outcome even if  the patient  was discontinued from the  study. Congenital

Roxadustat  Protocol  FGCL -4592 -092 
Confidential  Page  55 of 76  
 abnormalities/birth  defects  and spontaneous miscarriages  should be reported  and handled as  
SAEs.  Elective  abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed up and documented as described. To capture information about a pregnancy from the partner of a male patien t, the male patient’s  
partner consent must be obtained to collect information related to the pregnancy and outcome (should be handled on a case by [CONTACT_534637]/IEC  approval); the male patient should not 
be asked to provide this information. 
If a lactation  case occurs  while  the female patient  is taking protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  report  the 
lactation  case to FibroGen. In addition to reporting a lactation  case during the study, 
investigators should monitor for lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol- required  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_694379] dose of roxadustat. Any lactation case should be 
reported  to FibroGen’s Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of event.  
9.3.7. Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
An abnormal laboratory finding in absence of any other signs or symptoms is not necessarily an AE. The investigator must review and assess all results provided by [CONTACT_534638] a timely  manner,  and determine whether any  abnormal laboratory values  
are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS), and whether there are  
associated signs and symptoms. Laboratory abnormalities should be considered clinically significant when they occur after taking study medication, reflect a meaningful change from the screening value(s), and require active management (e.g., abnormalities that require study treatment  dose modification, discontinuation, more  frequent follow-up assessments,  etc.).  
Clinically significant laboratory abnor malities will be reported as AEs. If the abnormal 
laboratory finding is accompanied  by [CONTACT_142312], report the signs and symptoms as the 
AE in lieu of the abnormal laboratory value.  If a diagnosis is  available,  report the  diagnosis.

 10. STATISTICS  
10.1. Sample  Size Determination  
Up to approximately 100 patients will be enrolled into this study. The sample size is determined  
by [CONTACT_204851], not by [CONTACT_534639].  
 
10.2. Analysis Populations  
10.2.1. All Enrolled  or Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Population 
Defined as all patients enrolled in the roxadustat treatment period, regardless of whether patients  
received any  study drug. 
 
10.2.2. Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population 
Defined as all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of roxadustat, have a baseline Hb  
and at least one corresponding on- treatment Hb a ssessment. The FAS population will be used for 
efficacy  analyses.  
 
10.2.3. Efficacy  Evaluable (EE)  Population 
Defined  as all  enrolled  patients  who  receive roxadustat for at least  [ADDRESS_694380]  dose. 
The EE population will be  primarily  used for efficacy  analyses.  
 
10.2.4. Safety  (SAF) Population 
Defined  as all patients  who  took at least  one dose of  study medication.  The primary  analysis  of 
safety  will be  based on the Safety  population. 
 
10.3. Statistical  Analysis 
10.3.1. General  Considerations 
Summary statistics will consist of number of patients (N), means, standard deviations, medians, 
and minimum and maximum values for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables.  For efficacy endpoints, the standard error and 95% confidence intervals 
will be added as part of the descriptive summaries. Tables will summarize all efficacy and safety  
measures  by [CONTACT_7206], if appropriate. All analyses will be based on availabl e data unless  
otherwise specified.  
 
10.3.2. Patient  Enrollment  and Disposition  
Patient  enrollment and disposition will be presented  for all  enrolled  patients.  The total number 
and percent of patients who completed or discontinued, and reasons for early discontinuation, will be summarized.  
 
10.3.3. Demographics  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographics (age, race, sex), baseline characteristics (e.g., height, weight), and patient disease characteristics  will be  summarized  for the ITT population and safety  population.

 Descriptive statistics will be calculated for continuous variables (age and weight) and frequency  
counts and percentages will be tabulated for categorical variables (e.g., sex, race, and body mass 
index). 
 
10.3.4. Efficacy  Analyses 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of the Primary  Endpoint  
Hemoglobin results obtained from the central laboratory will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
Baseline Hb  is defined  as the mean  of the central laboratory  Hb values  prior to  the first  dose of 
study drug. 
The primary efficacy analysi s will be based on the EE and FAS population using an observed 
case dataset.  The primary  efficacy  parameter,  defined  as maximum change in  hemoglobin from  
baseline in 16 weeks without RBC transfusion, will be summarized by [CONTACT_534640].  Hb v alues within  4 weeks after  a RBC transfusion will be  censored. 
The mean change from baseline hemoglobin (without a RBC transfusion) will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765]. Maximum change from baseline will also be analyzed using Analysis of covariance using Cancer  types  as a class  variable and  the baseline Hb as a covariate.  
Least Square Means will be calculated from the model and tested against [ADDRESS_694381] (LOCF) 
approach. 
Number (%) of patients meeting specific criteria specified in the protocol as secondary efficacy  
endpoints will also be summarized descriptively and the Clopper – Pearson confidence limits  
approach  will be  used. 
The percentages of patients who have a hematopoietic response, who receive at least one RBC  
transfusion will also be summarized descriptively and estimated using the Kaplan–Meier (KM)  
method. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of the Secondary  and Additional Endpoints  
The mean change from baseline hemoglobin (without a RBC transfusion) will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_765].  This  will als o be analyzed similar  to the model used for the 
primary  endpoint. 
Additional efficacy analyses will use the EE and FAS populations. Number (%) of patients 
require transfusion/ESA will be summarized descriptively. Change from baseline in quality of 
life composite scores (as well as selected subscale scores, if applicable) will be summarized  
descriptively. 
 
10.3.5. Exploratory Analyses 
Changes from  baseline in iron parameters,  lipid parameters,  hepcidin  levels, cholesterol  
parameters  and biomarkers will be summarized descriptively.  
Subgroup analyses  of primary  and secondary endpoints will  be performed.

 10.3.6. Safety  Analyses 
All patients who received any dose of study drug will be included in the safety  analyses.  
All safety assessment data, including laboratory assessments (with special emphasis on Hb 
response and LFTs), vital signs, ECGs,  AEs,  concomitant medications  and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534601].  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any new or worsening of an existing 
condition occurred after the first dose of the study medication and within [ADDRESS_694382] dose of study medication. TEAEs will be tabulated to examine their frequency, severity, organ 
systems affected and relationship to study treatment. Deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to study or 
treatment  discontinuation will be listed or  tabulated  separately.  
Laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, as well as the changes from baseline will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_266099]. Clinically significant changes from  
baseline in these safety parameters will be identified. Shift tables will summarize chan ges for  
selected  laboratory measures.  
Medications used prior to and during the study will be coded using The World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug). Prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated by [CONTACT_534641].  
 
10.4. Interim  Analysis 
The study will have no formal  interim analysis with  statistical inference.  Safety  and efficacy  will 
be monitored on an ongoing basis.  
 
10.5. Statistical  Analysis  Plan  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to data analysis. The Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will include detailed analysis methods, statistical models, definitions, as  
well as data handling rules.  The SAP will document additional exploratory endpoints that  are not 
specified in the protocol. Any significant changes to the analyses described in this protocol will be highlighted in the SAP. Deviations in analyses from the SAP will be detailed in the Clinical Study Report.

International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH)  E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), the Declaration of Hels inki, any other applicable regulatory requirements, and 
Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  or independent ethics  committee  (IEC)  requirements.  
 
12.2. Communication with the Institutional Review Board or Independent  
Ethics Committee  
This protocol, the Informed  Consent Form,  the Investigator’s Brochure, and any  information  to 
be given to the patient must be submitted to a properly constituted IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_270180]/IEC before the study is initiated and before any investigational product is shipped to the investigator. In addition, any patient recruitment materials  must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC  before  the material  is used  for patient  recruitment.  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining re-approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC annually or as required 
by [CONTACT_494588]/IEC. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_8268]’s annual 
report and other required reports submitted to the IRB/IEC and copi[INVESTIGATOR_3762]/IEC continuance of approval must be furnished to FibroGen or designee. A copy of the signed FDA Form  1572 or other qualified  investigator statement (as  required) must also  accompany  the above 
approval letter  provided to FibroGen. 
Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/IEC  of any protocol changes  
or amendments,  changes  to the Investigator’s Brochure, and other safety -related  communications 
from FibroGen or its designee. Written documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be received before  the amendment is  implemented.  
Investigators must maintain a list of appropriate qualified persons to whom the investigator has delegated significant trial- related duties and update the list as staff and their delegated  
responsibilities  change.  
 
12.3. Patient  Information  and Consent  
Prior to participation in any study- specific procedures, the patient must sign (note: all references  
to “patient” in this section refers to the study patient or his/her legally acceptable representative)  
an IRB/IEC -approved written Informed  Consent Form  in his/her native language.  The approved 
written informed consent must adhere to all applicable laws in regards to the safety and 
confidentiality of the patients. To obtain and document informed consent, the Investigator should comply with applicable regulations, and adhere to ICH GCP standards and the ethical  
principles in the Declaration of  Helsinki (October  2008). 
The language in the written information about the study should be as non- technical as practical  
and should be understandable to the patient. Before informed consent is obtained, the Investigator should provide the patient  ample  time and  opportunity to inquire about the study and 
to decide whether  or not to participate.  
All questions about the study should be answered to the satisfaction of the patient.  The written  
Informed  Consent Form  should be signed and  personally dated  by [CONTACT_534642]: 78AB005C -E4B7 -44BD -BE12 -24416589097B  DocuSign  Envelope  ID: F3BFD5A3 -C713 -484B -AB8C -0593506CF8EA

Roxadustat  Protocol  FGCL -[ADDRESS_694384]  access  to source data and source documents  for trial- related  
monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory authority inspection. Direct access includes  
examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to 
the evaluation of the study. The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the  
patient to permit such individuals to have access to his/her study-related records, including personal information and medical records.  
13.3. Data  Collection,  Handling,  and Verification  
All required data will either be entered onto CRFs by [CONTACT_494592] a data transfer from authorized service providers (such as laboratory results from a 
central  laboratory). Data  will be entered  or uploaded into a validated,  clinical database compliant 
with 21 CFR Part 11 regulations. 
All patient  data will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_166327]/or designee.  Data that appear  inconsistent, 
incomplete  or inaccurate  will be  queried for site  clarification.  
Medical history, adverse events and medications will be coded using industry standard  
dictionaries  (e.g., MedDRA  and World  Health  Organization  Drug  [WHODrug]) Dictionary. 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all patient data (i.e. CRFs 
and queries) throughout the duration of the study and prior to study completion, ensuring that all  
data are verifiable with  source documents. 
 
13.4. Protocol  Deviations  
Unless  there is a  safety  concern, there should be no deviations or violations of the study protocol. 
In the event of a safety concern, the Investigator or designee must document and explain the 
reason for any deviation from the approved protocol. The Investigator may implement a  
deviation from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants without prior IRB/IEC approval. Immediately after the implemented deviation or  
change, the Investigator must submit a report explaining the reasons for the protocol violation or deviation to the IRB/IEC, FibroGen, and to the regulatory authorities, if  required. 
 
13.5. Retention of Data  
A FibroGen representative will inform the Investigator in writing when it is acceptable to dispose  
of any study records.  To enable evaluation and/or audits from regulatory authorities or FibroGen  
or designee,  the Investigator agrees  to ke ep records,  including the identity  of all participating

Footnotes: 
1. Windows  for procedures  listed  are +/- 3days  unless  otherwise  stated.  
2. ECG:  no clinically  significant findings  per PI [INVESTIGATOR_534602].  
3. Vital signs include BP, HR, RR, temperature. If possible, use the same device for BP measurement over the course of the study. Weight at 
registration/Day  1 will be used for  determination  of starting dose.  
4. ECOG  score: must  be 0, 1, or [ADDRESS_694387] screen  visit.  
5. LFTs = AST, ALT, TBili, alkaline phosphatase. ALT >[ADDRESS_694388] >3 × (ULN), OR TBili > 1.5 × ULN (patients with Total Bilirubin up to 2x  
ULN may be allowed if ALT/AST are within normal limit and investigator has no safety concerns) will exclude a patient from entering the study (see  
Appendix 4 for liver monitoring information).  
6. Serum chemistry = sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, LDH, albumin (Central Lab).  
See Table  [ADDRESS_694389]:  must  be negative  for women  of child  bearing  capacity  at screening.  
8. CBC = Hb, HCT, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC),  
RBC, WBC, platelets, differential; Regarding Central Lab Hb values: Two Hb values are obtained at Screening Visit 1 and 2, only 1 of 2 value needs to 
meet  the Hb  ≤ 10.0 g/dL  criteria.  
9. Iron biomarkers  = serum  iron, ferritin,  transferrin, TIBC,  TSAT,  and UIBC.  
10. Exploratory  biomarkers  (optional)  – [ADDRESS_694390] -An. 
12. Study drug dosing: begins on the first day of dosing (Day 1/Week 1).  All study procedures must be completed prior to administration of the 1st dose of  
study treatment.  Dosing should occur at approximately the same time of day.  Roxadustat can be taken with water with or without food. The dose of  
statins  should not exceed the protocol -recommended  daily  dose in the protocol.  
13. Dose  adjustment  review  will be performed  every  [ADDRESS_694391] dose adjustment.  
14. Samples for Pharmacokinetics will be taken at times described in the protocol text in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   PK samples will be collected at each dose level  
for each patient. An “X” in the above table for PK samples on weeks 9 and 13, indicates POTENTIAL days for samples, but will only actually be taken 
if there is a dose adjustment at that visit and at week 16/EOT if there is a dose adjustment between week 13 and week 16/EOT.  If there is only one dose  
level  for a patient during  the study then PK is only collected  once  at week  5. 
15. EOT visit should be scheduled  at the end of Week  16. Last dose of study drug must  be prior  to EOT assessments.

potential for the maximum dose being exceeded.  The dose given  should be at  one dose level  
immediately below what is in the above table.  In some cases, a dose escalation will NOT be 
allowed.  If a patient requires a further decre ase from what is listed in the table above, the  
medical  monitor should be  consulted. 
If there is ANY question as to the appropriate dose to administer contact [CONTACT_534646]. 
Dose  Adjustment  
Following commencement  of study treatment,  patients  are evaluated  for response after 4 weeks  
and the roxadustat dose will be adjusted per the table below. After each dose adjustment, the 
patient remains on the dose level for a minimum of 4 weeks before further adjustment is permitted.  
The following dose adjustment algorithm will apply to patients during the treatment phase of the 
study. In addition, the down titration  of the dose is allowed  at any  time.

Roxadustat  Protocol  FGCL -[ADDRESS_694392] (LFT) results. Any patient enrolled in a clinical study with active drug therapy and reveals an increase of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × upper  
limit of normal (ULN), or bilirubin > 2 × ULN, should undergo detailed testing (including at  
least alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and total bilirubin [TBL]) for further evaluation and follow-up. Alerts will be generated  
by [CONTACT_534647], study monitor and study team. Testing should be repeated within 48-[ADDRESS_694393] any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction. 
Definition  of Liver Abnormalities  
Confirmed  abnormalities should be characterized as  follows: 
 
 ALT  or AST   Total  Bilirubin  
Moderate  > 3× ULN  Or > 2× ULN  
Severe  > 3× ULN  And > 2× ULN

Hy’s  Law:  Drug -induced jaundice  caused  by [CONTACT_513368],  without  a significant obstructive  component,  has a 
high rate of bad outcomes,  from  10% to 50% mortality  (or transplant).  The two “requirements” for  Hy’s Law  are: 
1) Evidence  that a drug can cause  hepatocellular -type injury, generally  shown by [CONTACT_464489] 3 times the upper limit of normal (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in treated and untreated Patients to 
be discriminating”). 2) Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at least 
3 × ULN and no evidence of intra - or extrahepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated alkaline phosphatase) or Gilbert’s  
syndrome: Temple, R (2006) Hy's law: predicting serious hepatotoxicity. Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_9697] 15: (4):[ADDRESS_694394] severe hepatic abnormalities  for any  of the 
following: 
• ALT  or AST  > 8× ULN  
• ALT  or AST  > 5× ULN  for more  than  2 weeks  
• ALT or AST > 3× ULN and international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 (if INR testing  
is applicable/evaluated).  
• ALT or AST > 3× ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness,  fever, rash  and/or eosinophilia (>  5%).  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and  require additional monitoring and 
follow-up.

In addition, evaluate the patient  for potential causes,  which  may  include the following: 
• Detailed  history of symptoms and prior or concurrent  diseases  
• Concomitant drug use, including nonprescription medications, herbal and dietary 
supplements, alcohol or recreational drug  use, or special diets  
• Exposure to environmental chemical  agents  
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis Types A,B,C,D,E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; 
nonalcoholic steato hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; biliary  tract disease  
• Obtain additional tests as appropriate: e.g., INR, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) 
or direct bilirubin; ultrasound or other imaging  to assess biliary  tract disease 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations 
In general, in the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, 
preexisting or acute liver disease  or exposure to other agents  associated  with  liver  injury, the 
study drug should be discontinued. 
Discontinuation of treatment  should be considered if:  
• ALT  or AST  > 8 × ULN  
• ALT  or AST  > 5 × ULN for  more  than 2 weeks  
• ALT  or AST  > 3 × ULN and  TBL > 2 × ULN or INR  > 1.5) (If INR testing  is

Once LFTs  return to normal, and  depending on whether  there  is an explanation for the LFT  
elevations, study drug dosing may resume, after  discussion with the Medical Monitor

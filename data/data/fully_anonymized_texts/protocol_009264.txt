Introduction and  Background Information
You/Your child  (referred to as you in the rest of this document) are invited to take part in a research 
study because you have been diagnosed with asthma and have not been on inhaled medication for at 
least the past four weeks. The study is being conducted under the direction of Scott Bickel, MD, and 
Nemr Eid, MD, at the University of Louisville.  About 50 local subjects will be invited to take part in 
this research. 
Purpose
The purpose  of this study is to see how Flunisolide HFA (an FDA approved inhaled medication to 
treat asthma) affects the lungs in asthma, especially the small airways deeper in the lungs as 
measured by [CONTACT_113714]-to-day care of patients with asthma.
Procedures
To participate  in this study, you must meet certain criteria that will be evaluated and determined by 
[CONTACT_113715]/or study staff.  Your medical history and current medical condition will be 
reviewed.  You will be asked for personal information, such as your date of birth and race/ethnicity. 
The study doctor in charge of this study or a member of the study doctor’s staff will discuss with you 
all requirements for participation in this study.
Your participation  in this study will last for up to [ADDRESS_126856] 
the following procedures while you are in this study.   UofL Institutional Review Boards

2/1/2017 Page  2 of 10Visit 1:  (1 hour)
At this  visit you can expect us to do the following:
Ask you  to review and sign this informed consent and HIPAA document
Obtain  your past medical history and any medications you have taken in the past 4 weeks or 
are currently taking
Ask you  to fill out a simple questionnaire to help show how well your asthma has been 
controlled.
Measure  oxygen saturation on room air
Perform  a physical exam (weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc)
Collect  urine to preform a pregnancy test if you are a female who could be pregnant
Require  that you have the following procedures:
oSpi[INVESTIGATOR_038]   - a breathing test where you will be asked to take a very deep breath and 
blow out as hard and quick as you can into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_82424] a computer
oImpulse  oscillometry - a test where you will be asked to sit up straight and breathe 
normally for about [ADDRESS_126858].  You will hear a 
quiet “ticking” sound during the procedure but it is painless and does not require 
significant effort.  
This visit  will determine if you are eligible to be enrolled in the study.  If you meet the study criteria, 
we will ask you to continue in the study and schedule a second visit.
Visit 2:  (1 hour; 1 to 56 days after visit 1))
At this  visit you can expect us to do the following:
Ask you  to fill out a simple questionnaire to help show how well your asthma has been 
controlled
Review  your health status/medical history
Review  any medications you are taking
Obtain  vital signs (heart rate, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_49842])
Measure  your oxygen saturation on room air
Measure  your height and weight
Perform  a short physical exam
Perform  pre-bronchodilator impulse oscillometry
Perform  pre-bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]
Receive  bronchodilator (albuterol, 4 puffs via spacer, or ProAir if you are currently using it)
Perform  post-bronchodilator impulse oscillometry
Perform  post-bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]
Randomly assign  you (a process like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to a one of two doses of flunisolide (either 
80 mcg 1 puff twice a day or 80 mcg 2 puffs twice a day)
Provide  you with flunisolide and teach you how to use the study drug device, per 
manufacturer’s instructions
Provide  you with albuterol sulfate for breakthrough symptoms.

In addition,  you may suffer harms that we have not seen before. 
Possible Pregnancy  Risks 
You should  discuss pregnancy risks with your doctor before signing this consent form. Women who 
are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate in this research study.  If you are pregnant or 
become pregnant, your unborn child may suffer harms that we have not seen before. If you (or your 
partner) become pregnant while in this study, the sponsor may ask to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  If you agree to allow the study doctor to follow your pregnancy, you will be asked to read 
and sign a separate consent form for permission to follow the outcome of your pregnancy.  
If you are  a man taking part in the study and your partner becomes pregnant, the study doctor may 
ask you to ask your partner for permission to follow her pregnancy.  If she agrees, she will be asked 
to sign a separate consent form mentioned above.
Before starting  this research study, females able to have children will have a pregnancy test.  Talk to 
your doctor about the best method of birth control to use while you are in this study.  It is important 
that you call your study doctor at [PHONE_2574] right away if you become pregnant or father a child 
during the course of this study.  If you or your partner becomes pregnant, a decision may have to be 
made whether or not to end the pregnancy.

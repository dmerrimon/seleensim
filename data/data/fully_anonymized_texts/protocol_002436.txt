darker skin patients with Nd:YAG lasers.  Scarring is rarely observed following treatments with QS lasers 
as water is no longer the target chromophore.  
 
There are some challenges associated with tattoo removal. If mixtures of pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639] a nd/or multicolors 
are used, a complete clearing of the tattoo may not be achieved with lasers [19].  Different colors are 
usually mixed to achieve various levels of brightness and lightness. Another contributing factor to 
unsuccessful outcome is that most tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_294425].  When the exact compound of the tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_237120], paradoxical 
darkening of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_294426] y happen following tattoo removal, which may be difficult to remove [20-
23].  Additionally, white, orange, yellow and brown tattoo inks are particularly difficult to treat [24]. 
 
Although the mechanism of action is not clea rly understood, the effects of the lasers on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_294427]: 1) photothermal/photochemical and 2) photoacoustic/photomechanical [25, 26].  
Conver sion of absorbed energy into heat (photothermal effect) breaks the chemical bonds inside the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_237123].  At the same time, the ultrashort heating of the particle shell 
may cause heating of the surrounding tissue via rapid ther mal expansion resulting in shock waves. These 
shock waves may help destroy the surrounding cellular structures and tattooed compounds 
mechanically (photoacoustic/photomechanical). The resultant fragmented particles are then removed 
by [CONTACT_294432]: 1) transepi[INVESTIGATOR_237124], 2) removal via lymphatics, and 3) rephagocytosis 
by [CONTACT_237141] (inflammatory or resident cells) in the dermis.  
 
Histological examinations show that the tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_294428] w hich is a result of active phagocytosis in dermal cells, such as macrophages and 
fibroblasts [27, 28]. In electron microscopy of black tattoos immediately after treatment with 1064 nm 
Nd:YAG, vacuoles were observed in th e dermis [29].  Vacuoles were lined by [CONTACT_237142][INVESTIGATOR_2517] -
containing cells, flattened cell nuclei and disrupted lysosomes. Cells without pi[INVESTIGATOR_294429]. One week after treatment, a moderate chronic in flammatory infiltrate 
was observed in the dermis and all tattoo particles were phagocytosed and intracellular within 
fibroblasts and macrophages. At one month post -treatment, all residual pi[INVESTIGATOR_294430].  
 
Although nanosecond QS lasers are safe and effective in the treatment of tattoos, treatment sessions 
are often painful and as many as [ADDRESS_358512] tattoo particles ranging in size from 40 to 300 nm in vivo and 
their thermal relaxation times being mostly in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237128] [30].  For example, the most 
common pi[INVESTIGATOR_237129], carbon black in india ink, which is shown to be about [ADDRESS_358513] a thermal relaxation time of 1 nanosecond [31]. In that case, a thermally confined 
disruption of the particle can only be achieved via pi[INVESTIGATOR_237130].  This suggests that energy delivery 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237131].  
Moreover, the resultant ultra -short pulses with higher peak temper atures should decrease adverse 
effects, such as dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_237132].   
 
Up to date, various studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237133], both in vitro and in vivo, have been conducted to 
test the hypotheses on the potential benefits of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237133] [30-34].  In a split -tattoo study, 
Ross et all reported better clearing in 75% (12/16)  of tattoos with on pi[INVESTIGATOR_294431], Inc.

2. Incidence and severity of adverse effects during study duration (to be displayed descriptively 
as counts and frequency distributions).  
Device -related and procedure -related adverse effects (AEs) and subjects who prematurely terminate 
from the study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment -related pain ratings, as reported 
on case report forms will be tabulated and analyzed. For a given AE term, counting will be done by 
[CONTACT_1130], not by [CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once, the event will be counted 
only once, at th e most severe and most -related occurrence.  The number and percentage of subjects 
experiencing each AE Term will be descriptively summarized. Statistical hypothesis testing will not be 
performed for safety data.

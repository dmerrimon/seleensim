chronic plaque psoriasis (Cohort 2)  
Summary of Study 
Design:  There are 2 cohorts of subjects.  
Cohort 1 is a singl e dose study to 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaque(s) in 
8 psoriasis subjects.  Cohort 1 subjects will then be enrolled, if they 
meet entry criteria, into Cohort 2 of the study.  
Cohort 2 is a parallel group, double blind, vehicle controlled study in 
which ARQ -151 cream  0.5% , ARQ -151 cream  0.15%  or vehicle cream 
is applied QD x [ADDRESS_130304]  0.5% BSA of chronic 
plaque psoriasis ; area for application will not exceed 5.0% BSA . 
Blinding:  The single dose assessment (Cohort 1) to 25 cm2 of psoriati c 
plaque(s) is open label . 
The parallel group study (Cohort 2) is double blind and vehicle 
controlled.  
Countries:  Canada  (Cohorts 1 and 2) and [LOCATION_002]  (Cohort 2 only)

 Duration of 
Participation for 
Subjects:  1. Cohort 1: 22  days (Screening, Day 1, Day 2  and Day 8 ).  If 
subjects roll into Cohort 2, then total study duration prior to start of 
Cohort 2 is approximately 22 days.  Screening is up to 2 week s.   
2. Cohort 2 (n ot in Cohort 1):  Screening (up to 6 weeks) + Treatment 
phase and follow -up (5 weeks ), 77 days.  
Study Products:  ARQ -[ADDRESS_130307] will be supplied as a 0.15% and 0.5% 
cream . 
Matching vehicle cream will contain only excipi[INVESTIGATOR_78414] -151 cream . 
Planned Dose 
Level:  Cohort 1 subjects will receive ARQ -151 cream 0.5% applied to 25 cm2 
of psoriatic plaque (s). 
Cohort 2 subjects will receive ARQ -151 cream 0.15% or  0.5%  or 
matching vehicle cream applied to all psoriatic lesions up to an area of 
5.0% BSA  (if subject rolled over from Cohort 1, lesions treated in 
Cohort 1 can also be treated in Cohort 2 ). 
Safety 
Assessments:  Safety will be monitored through application site assessments , safety 
labs and AEs.  
Safety Analysis:  The following analyses will be p erformed; however, no formal 
inferential statistics will be done on safety assessments.  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and 
frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_78415].  
Adverse Eve nts: 
A subject -by-subject treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) data listing, 
including verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, severity, and 
relationship to study drug, will be provided.  
The number of subjects experiencing AEs and number of AEs will be 
summarize d by [CONTACT_61410].  
Medical History and Physical Examinations:  
Medical history will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  Physical examinations will be 
performed at screening, baseline and end -of-study.  
Clinical Laboratory Results:  
Routine blood chemis tries and [ADDRESS_130308] analyses only for safety and 
pharmacokinetics.  
The parallel group assessment (Cohort 2) will have analyses for 
safety, pharmacokinetics, and  efficacy.  
In the parallel group assessment ( Cohort 2), the Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint will be:  
• Difference in mean percent change from baseline at week [ADDRESS_130309] of: [Target Plaque Severity Score  (TPSS)  x Target 
Plaque Area (TPA) ] (TPSS x TPA) betwe en each dose 
concentration level of  ARQ -[ADDRESS_130310].  
The secondary e fficacy endpoints will include:  
1. Difference in mean percent change from baseline at week s 1, [ADDRESS_130311].  
Pharmacokinetic 
Sample Collection :  
(Cohort 1 n = up to 
8; Cohort 2 n = 45)  1. Cohort 1 : PK draws will be done at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours after 
ARQ -151 cream 0.5% application to 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaques  
2. Cohort 2: PK draws will be done on day 1: 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours; day 
14: pre -dose (trough) and [ADDRESS_130312] -dose; and day 28: pre -dose

 Statistical Analysis:  Four analysis populations will be defined:  
• Safety population will include all subjects who are enrolled and 
received at least one confirmed dose of study medication; this 
population will be defined separately for each cohort.  
• Modified Intent -to-Treatment ( mITT) population will include all 
subjects who are in the safety population for Cohort [ADDRESS_130314] -baseline efficacy evaluation . 
• Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who are  
in the safety population for Cohort [ADDRESS_130315] 80%  
compliant with study medication, and showed no other serious 
deviations from the study protocol.  
• PK population will include a ll subjects  receiving the active drug  
with sufficient plasma concentrations of ARQ -[ADDRESS_130316] ; this 
population will be defined separately for each cohort . 
The primary endpoint of mean percent change from baseline at Week 
4 in TPSS  x TPA will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). The difference between  treatment groups in 
TPSS  x TPA at Weeks 1, 2, and 3 will also be analyzed using the 
MMRM. Descriptive statistics will be provided for observed and 
percent change from baseline in TPSS  x TPA at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
A comparison of changes in TPSS and TPA  between treatment groups 
will be analyzed similarly  to TPSS  x TPA.

Th1 Type [ADDRESS_130323] is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approve d globally  to reduce the risk of  
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbations associated with chronic bronchitis.  
Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N -oxide, are high affinity selective inhibitors of 
PDE-4 (a major cyclic -3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) -metabolizing enzyme), 
whose activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP.  There are four different subtypes  
of PDE -4: PDE -4a, PDE -4b, PDE -4c, and PDE -4d, each with several isoforms (splicing variants) .  
IC50 values of both roflumilast and roflumilast N -oxide for the different PDE -4 isoforms and 
subtypes are mostly sub -nanomolar and single digit nanomolar (Hatzelmann 2010 ).  The PDE -[ADDRESS_130324] suggested 
a deficiency of cyclic AMP -dependent protein kinases in human psoriatic skin ( Brion  1986 ).  More 
recently, various cytokines produced by [CONTACT_78443]1 and Th17  cells have been shown to play a crucial 
role in the pathoge nesis of psoriasis.  It has been postulated that the anti -inflammatory effects of

 The dermal nonclinical program for ARQ -151 cream  followed current International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines .  A dermal toxicology program was initiated that included a 13 -
week dermal toxicity study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (with a 28 -day inte rim sacrifice to support Phase 1 studies), 
a skin sensitization study in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], a phototoxicity study and an eye irritation study.   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  

Protocol ARQ -151-[ADDRESS_130327] (DALIRESP®, DAXAS®) has been approved globally for the treatment 
of COPD and has been evaluated in nine Phase III/IV randomized  double -blind clinical trials  
(Wedzicha 2016 ).  Overall, the safety of oral roflumilast has been well established in its targeted 
population of mostly middle - and upper -aged individuals who currently smoke cigarettes or have 
smoked them extensively in the past.  Adverse events (AEs) reported with roflumilast tablets have 
been consistent with those expected for oral PDE-4 inhibitors .  In a pooled analysis of safety data 
from 6 -month and 1 -year clinical trials (N=8630), the most common AEs were diarrhea, weig ht 
loss and nausea.  Other AEs reported more frequently with roflumilast treatment than with placebo 
were back pain, influenza, insomnia and decreased appetite ( Michalski 2012 , Wedzicha 2016 ). 
In addition to the self -reported cases of weight loss in the 6 -month and 1 -year trials, clinically 
significant weight loss was also reported in two prospective studies that evaluated weight 
(Michalski 2012 ). 
Psychiatric -related AEs were also greater in patients treated with roflumilast tablets (5.9%) 
compared to those  treated with placebo (3.3%).  The most common psychiatric -related AEs were 
insomnia, depression and anxiety.  A small number of cases of completed suicide and suicide 
ideation have been reported in patients taking oral roflumilast in clinicals trials and also during 
post-marketing experience ( Michalski 2012 ).   
The only contraindication to oral roflumilast , other than hypersensitivity to components of the 
product,  is in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment (Child -Pugh B or C), where 
systemic l evels of roflumilast may become highly elevated.  
8.[ADDRESS_130328].  The 
products evaluat ed were the active comparators calcipotriol 0.005% and betamethasone 
valerate  0.1% (both in their marketed cream formulations), and investigational cream formulations 
of roﬂumilast 0.5%, TAK-084 0.5%  and 5% .  A vehicle cream was used as a control  (the vehi cle 
cream and roflumilast formulations in this study were different from the ARQ -151 cream  
formulation) .  Each treatment was applied daily to different test sites located on a single psoriasis 
plaque of an individual for 3 weeks.  Fifteen patients with pso riasis were studied.  The primary 
endpoint of mean change from baseline in skin inﬁltrate thickness after  3 weeks of treatment

 showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements for all treatments: betamethasone valerate  
(-286.9  μm), the selective PDE -[ADDRESS_130329]  0.5% ( -237.1  μm), TAK-084 0.5% 
(-153.6  μm), TAK-084 5% ( -216.7 μm) and calcipotriol 0.005% ( -187.7 μm) when compared with 
vehicle cream control (all p  < 0.001) ( Snape 2016 ).  
The above data indicated to us that topi[INVESTIGATOR_116756], in an app ropriate market image vehicle, 
could provide an important addition to the dermatologist’s armamentarium in treating chronic 
plaque psoriasis.   
8.2.1  Dose Selection  
The ARQ -151 cream  0.5% dose concentration was selected because of the efficacy observed in 
the Sna pe, et al study described above ( Snape 2016 ).   
  
The dose concentration of ARQ -151 cream  0.15% was selected to determine whether lower 
ARQ -151 cream doses are effective and whether systemic exposure is also reduced . 
Cohort 1 will involve application of ARQ -151 cream 0.5% to 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaque(s) . It is 
well known that cutaneous disease states can alter drug  permeability a s compared to normal 
human skin .  Since psoriatic skin is known to have different drug permeability characteristics than 
normal skin ( Tang -Liu 1999 ), we do not believe there is anything to be gained by [CONTACT_116765][INVESTIGATOR_116757].

Subject s in Cohort [ADDRESS_130330]’s psoriatic plaques.  ARQ -[ADDRESS_130331]’s armamentarium in treating 
patients with this disease .  
The safety monitoring practices employed in this protocol (i.e., physical examination s, application 
site reaction assessments,  hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and AE questioning) are 
adequate to protect the subjects’ safety and should detect expected AEs.    
 
   
8.3 Study Objectives  
8.3.1  Primary Objective s 
1. To assess the safety and PK of a sing le dose application of ARQ -151 cream 0.5% to 25 cm2 
of psoriatic plaque (s) (Cohort 1) . 
2. To assess the safety , pharmacokinetics  and efficacy of ARQ -151 cream 0.5% and ARQ -151 
cream  0.15% vs. vehicle applied QD x 28 days to individuals treated with up to  5.0% BSA  of 
chronic plaque psoriasis (Cohort 2).  
8.[ADDRESS_130332] analyses only for safety and pharmacokinetics.  
The parallel group assessment (Cohort 2) will have analyses for safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy.  
In the  parallel group assessment ( Cohort 2), the Primary Efficacy Endpoint wi ll be:  
• Difference in mean percent change from baseline at week [ADDRESS_130333] of: 
[Target  Plaque Severity Score  (TPSS ) x Target Plaque Area (TPA) ] (TPSS x TPA) 
between each dose concentration level of ARQ -[ADDRESS_130334].

8.5 Overall Study Design and Plan  
There are 2 cohorts of subjects:   
Cohort [ADDRESS_130336] aque (s) in up to up to 8 psoriasis subjects.  
Cohort 1 subjects may then be enrolled into Cohort 2 of the study  if all admission criteria are met 
at the Baseline Visit (Day 1, Visit 2 , per Cohort 2).   In this case, the same plaque(s) treated in the 
Cohort 1 study may also be treated  in Cohort 2.   
Cohort 2 is  a parallel group, double blind, vehicle controlled study in which ARQ -151 cream 0.5%, 
ARQ -151 cream  0.15% or vehicle cream is applied QD x 28 days to subjects with between  0.5% 
to 5.0% BSA of chronic plaque psoriasis . 
Including both Cohorts, a  total of up to 92 subjects will be enrolled at 7 study sites  in Canada  and 
1 site in the U.S.   Subjects will be adult (≥18 y/o) males or females with chronic plaque psoriasis . 
For inclusion i nto Cohort 2, subjects  must have at least [ADDRESS_130337] 9  cm2 in size 
with TPSS ≥4 .  While 1 target plaque is minimally acceptable, it is strongly recommended that 2 
or 3 target plaques be identified , if present,  meeting these criteria.  Target plaques may be on the 
knees and/or elbows, but priority should be given t o identifying target lesions in other areas.  All 
psoriasis lesions on a subject will be treated in this Cohort  except for those on the face, scalp, 
intertriginous areas, palms and soles.  
Subject Participation  
Cohort 1:  This cohort involves a minimum of three clinic visits includ ing Screening, Baseline, one 
follow -up visit ( 24 hours after the baseline visit)  and one follow up telephone call 7 days after the 
follow up visit .  Subjects may be asked to return for additional visits(s) if an adverse reaction 
occurs.  The interval between the Screening and Baseline visits could be up to [ADDRESS_130338] participation  in Cohort 1  is 22 days .  
Cohort 2:  This cohort involves a minimum of seven clinic visits including Sc reening, Baseline  and 
four visits at Week 1, Week 2, Week [ADDRESS_130339] participation in Cohort 2  is 77 days . 
8.6 Randomization  
Cohort 1:  Coho rt 1 is an open label single dose application of ARQ -151 cream 0.5% to 25 cm2 
of psoriatic plaque (s) in up to eight (8 ) subjects.  Cohort 1 subjects may enroll in Cohort 2 if the 
eligibility criteria for Cohort 2 are met.  
Cohort 2:  Subjects will apply  ARQ-151 cream 0.5% or ARQ -151 cream  0.15%  or vehicle to 
psoriatic plaques  that will not exceed an application area of  5% BSA .  Assignment of drug or 
vehicle will be made at a 1:1 :[ADDRESS_130340] at Baseline after the patient has been found to be fully eligible for 
participation. A kit containing ten (10) tubes of study medi cation will be assigned to each subject.  
Each kit has a unique kit number  (randomization number).  
8.[ADDRESS_130341]  two digits 
correspond to the site number  (assigned by [CONTACT_1034]) , the next three  digits correspond to the 
sequential order in which the subject was enro lled in to the study . Screen failures will not be 
assigned a number.  
The clinical site is responsible for maintaining a current log of subject ID number assignments 
and the kit number assigned to that subject.  The subject’s initials (first/middle/last) and  ID number 
are required to be entered on all clinical study documentation (e.g., case report for ms, labeling of 
clinical materials and sample containers, investigational product accountability logs, etc.).   
8.8 Blinding  
Cohort 1: This is an open label Cohort , therefore both the subjects and the clinical personnel will 
be aware that ARQ -151 cream 0.5% will be applied to 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaque (s). 
Cohort 2: This is a double -blind Cohort , therefore neither the subjects nor the clinical personnel 
will be aware of which treatment an individual has received.

 8.11 Treatments  
8.11.1  Drug Administration  
Cohort 1:  ARQ -151 cream 0.5% will be applied by [CONTACT_116766] 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaque(s)  
(more than one plaque may be identified for a total area of 25 cm2).  
The study sponsor or its representative will ensure the s tudy staff can demonstrate proper dosing 
for Cohort 1  at the Site Initiation Visit . Study staff will be trained to ensure a  unit dose  (a pea -sized 
amount of ARQ -151 cream vehicle ) is properly squeezed  from the  vehicle  training  tube and 
applied as a thin fi lm and rubbed in  using the index and middle finger , rubbing in thoroughly but 
gently,  until the ‘white’ has disappeared . 
Cohort 2:  At the randomization visit , the study staff will demonstrate to the subject how to apply 
ARQ -[ADDRESS_130348]’s application technique is correct.   
Re-training will be conducted at subsequent visits (visits 3 and 5) as needed  using a vehicle 
training tube  (i.e., if a returned tube weighs substantially more o r less than the expected weight).  
Subjects will be instructed to apply study m edication each evening at least 15 minutes after 
showering or bathing  (if they take an evening shower/bath) and then to not wa sh areas where 
ARQ -[ADDRESS_130349] ’s actual  use is substantially  greater than or less than the expected 
use, the subject will retrained on the study drug appl ication technique.

performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. Additional 
evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the  Sponsor for reasons related 
to subject safety.  
This study assesses the safety and efficacy  of ARQ -151 cream . Safety will be determined by 
[CONTACT_63287], application site reaction assessments, vital signs, ECGs, 
clinical laboratory param eters, and AEs as outlined in the Schedule of Visits and Assessments  
(Section 6). If deemed necessary, additional safety assessments  will be performed at the 
discretion of the PI.  
8.12.1  Screening  
Within 14-42 days  (depending on which Cohort the subject is enroll ed) prior to the first dosing,  
subjects will be provided details of study requirements and sign an informed consent.  Medical 
history and demographic data, including name, sex, age, race, ethnicity, body weight  (kg), and 
height  (cm) will be recorded. Each subject will undergo psoriatic plaque assessments,  a physical 
examination, vital sign measurements  (blood pressure, heart  rate, and temperature ), 12 -lead 
ECG, dermal photography  (at four investigational center s), and laboratory tests of hematological , 
hepatic and renal function , urinalysis, urine drug screen and a pregnancy test for female subjects .

 8.12.6  Application Site Reaction Assessment  (Cohorts 1 and Cohort 2)  
Application Site Reaction Assessments will be performed as follows:  
Cohort 1: Day 1  and Day 2  
Cohort 2: Baseline (Visit 2 ), Visit 3, Visit  4, Vis it 5 and Visit 6  
Application site reaction s will be graded  at the timepoints  outlined in the Schedule of Visits and 
Assessments  (Section 6 ).  Irritation reactions are graded using the scale de tailed in the following 
section  (Berger -1982 ).  Reactions at the  site of product application, which may occur post -
Baseline, should be differentiated from the preexisting inflammation associated with the subject’s 
psoriasis .  Changes in Dermal Response scores, consistent with disease fluctuation, will only be 
recorded as an AE if the Investigator considers the change to be  worse than normal fluctuation.  
Dermal Response  
0 = no evidence of irritation  
1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response  
3 = erythema and  papules  
4 = definite edema  
5 = erythema, edema and papules  
6 = vesicular eruption  
7 = strong reaction spreading beyond application site  
Other Effects  
 A = slight glazed appearance  
 B = marked glazing  
 C = glazing with peeling and cracking  
 D = glazing with fissures  
 E = film of dried serous exudates covering all or part of the patch site  
 F = small petechial erosions and/or scabs  
G = no other effects

 8.13 Efficacy  Evaluation s (Cohort 2 Only)  
8.13.[ADDRESS_130352] of the Target Plaque Severity Score (TPSS) and the Target Plaque Area  
(TPA)  
Target Plaque Severity Score (TPSS) will be determined for each target plaque on each subject 
as the sum of erythema (graded 0 -4), thickness (graded 0 -4), and scaling (graded 0 -4) using the 
descriptors listed below.  
Erythema   
0 = no ne (includes hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_116760])  
1 = Mild - faint redness  
2 = Moderate  - red 
3 = Severe  - Bright red / dark red  
4 = Very Severe  - Extremely dark red / purple  
Thickness   
0 = none  - no elevation over normal skin  
1 = Mild  - slight elevation  
2 = Moderate  -  moderate elevation with rou gh or sloped edges  
3 = Severe  -  marked elevation with hard or sharp edges  
4 = Very Severe  - very marked elevation with hard and sharp edges  
Scaling   
0 = none  
1 = Mild  - fine scale that covers part ( ≤ 50%) of the lesion  
2 = Moderate  - fine to rough scale that covers a large part (>50%) of the lesion  
3 = Severe  - rough, thick scale that covers almost all the lesion   
4 = Very Severe  - very rough, very thick scale that completely covers the lesion  
Target plaque area (cm2) is determined by [CONTACT_116769]  (cm) of the target 
plaque by [CONTACT_116770] (cm) (perpendicular to the longest diameter  of the 
target plaque ).  The same plaque(s) will be measured at each applicable visit.   If a plaque is 
resolved after baseline with a sco re of 0 for all descriptors (i.e., Erythema, Thickness and Scaling), 
then the TPSS  x TPA  should be  recorded as  0.  
  
Protocol ARQ -151-[ADDRESS_130353] 9 cm2 in size with TPSS ≥4.  
One or two target plaques are acceptable, but only if a subject does not have three plaques 
meeting the criteria  of at least 9 cm2 with a TPSS ≥4.  Target plaques may be on the knees and/or 
elbows, but priority should be given to id entifying t arget lesions in other areas.  
Whenever possible, t he same individual who performs the target plaque analyses  for a 
subject at baseline should continue to perform the analyses  for that subject during the 
course of the study.  
Changes in Target Pla que Severity Scores consistent with disease fluctuation, will only be 
recorded as an AE if the Investigator considers the change to be worse than normal fluctuation.  
8.13.2  Dermal Imaging  
Photography will be performed at  four center s only during the following visits:  Baseline, Visit 3, 
Visit 4, and Visit 6.

Depressive Symptomatology Questionnaire will be administered at Screening, Week 2 and Week 
4. 
8.15 Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Cohort 1:  Plasma PK assessments will be performed on all subjects.  
Cohort 2:  Plasma PK assessments will be performed on 45 subjects.  Tissue metabolite 
assessments will be performed on 15 subjects.  
8.15.1  Blood and Skin Sampling and Processing  
Blood samples for p harmacokinetic evaluation will be  performed as follows:  
Cohort 1: PK draws will  be done at 1, 2, 4, 6 , and 24 hours after ARQ -151 cream 0.5% application 
to 25 cm2 of psoriatic plaque (s). 
Cohort 2: PK draws will be done on day 1: 1, 2, 4 and 6  hours; day 14 : pre-dose (trough) and 
1-hour post -dose; and D ay 28: pre -dose (trough), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours.  On day s 1, 14, and  28, 
study medication will be applied in the clinic and blood draws performed subsequently.   Subjects 
will be contact[CONTACT_116771] 12 and 26 and reminded to apply their study medication in the morning 
of days 13 and 27.   Study medication will not be applied in the evening of days 13 and 27.

 8.16 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definition  
An AE  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE ca n therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) produc t. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event  
The definitions and reporting requirements of Health Canada/ the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)/ ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to.  If any AEs are serious, as defined ICH 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety, required  procedures will be followed. All SAEs will be reported to 
the Sponsor via fax or e -mail within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, whether or not the 
serious events are d eemed drug -related. All serious event reporting will adhere to  ICH E6: 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and ICH E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting.:  The ERB/IRB will be notified of the Alert Reports  as per 
HC, FDA,  ICH and the ERB’s policies and procedures . 
An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], results in any of the following 
outcomes:   Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116761], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect , important medical events that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospit alization may be considered serious 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above 
definition. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening is defin ed as an AE that in the view of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or  is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the  current IND . 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact [CONTACT_116772]  3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Review  
At each follow -up visit, subjects will be queried with an open -ended question such as: ‘How have 
you been feeling since your last visit?’  Additionally, the study staff will review subject  diaries and, 
if it appears that a potential AE was recorded, study staff  will query the subject and determine if 
an AE occurred.

 AEs (whether serious or non -serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s) 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78430]/or followed up for up to one month after end of 
treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_1600]. 
Treatment of SAEs will be performed by a physician. Where appro priate, medical test(s) and/or 
examination(s) will be performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified 
as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal or unknown (lost to follow -up). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_78431] (unrelated, unlikely, 
possibly, probably, lik ely). Each sign or symptom re ported will be graded on the NIH  NCI CTCAE 
toxicity grading scale 5 -point severity sca le (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The date and time of onset, 
time relationship to drug dosing, duration, and outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, 
fatal, or unknown/lost to follow -up) of each event will be noted.  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:  
Unrelated  • The AE must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, or the study 
procedure/conditions.  
• Definitely not related to drug.  
• Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of drug not 
reasonable.  
• Another obvious cause of an AE.  
Unlikely  • Time sequence is unreasonable.  
• There is another more likely cause for an AE.  
Possibly  • Corresponds to what is known about the drug.  
• Time sequence is reasonable.  
• Could have been due to another equally, likely cause.  
Probably  • Is a known effect of the  drug.  
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478].  
• Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state.  
Likely  • Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in Physicians' Desk Reference , 
Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties, IB).  
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Event stops upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395], event returns upon restarting drug.

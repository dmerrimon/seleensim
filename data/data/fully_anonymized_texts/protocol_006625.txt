HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / Decemb er 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_128983] of these clinical trials. The HIV 
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has addressed ethical concerns in the following 
ways:  
• HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base 
necessary to find a preven tive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically 
rigorous and valid, and in accordance with International Council for 
Harmonisation  of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH)  and/or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
• HVTN sc ientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies underlying 
major codes (1-3), declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to 
human subjects research into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical 
trials.  
• HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, co nduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
[CONTACT_115551] t.  
• HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are 
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infection 
according to local guidelines. S taff members will also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
• Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential clinical 
trials  they may want to join.  If a program  for antiretroviral therapy  (ART ) 
provision  is not available at a site and ART is needed, a privately established 
fund will be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent possible.  
• The HVTN provides trainin g so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the fullest exte nt possible, their privacy 
protected. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
• Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by [CONTACT_115552].  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 6 of 131 • HVTN trials are r eviewed by [CONTACT_106802].  
• The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both 
study participants and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols 
provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, 
as well as counseling, guidanc e, and assistance with any social impacts that 
may result from research participation. HVTN protocols also include careful 
medical review of each research participant’s health conditions and reactions 
to study products while in the study.  
• HVTN research ai ms to benefit local communities by [CONTACT_115553], support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Researchers involved in HVTN tr ials are able to conduct other 
critical research in their local research settings.  
• The HVTN values the role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , 
Ethics Committees (ECs) , and other Regulatory Entities (REs)  as custodians 
responsible for ensurin g the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 7 of 131 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of th ese research requirements. Each HVTN 
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol mi nimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c) performing dire ct observation of participants postvaccination and 
collecting information regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) 
having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause 
physical harm or psychological distress, s uch as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV 
testing and counseling and HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk 
reduction counseling and checking on contraception use (for persons assigned 
female at birth ); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reaso nable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.111(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public he alth research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and may have 
exhausted all conventional treatme nt options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowledge it is designed to generate.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 8 of 131 2.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject se lection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not because of positions of vulnerability or p rivilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 and 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 and 5: Info rmed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 
21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by [ADDRESS_128984] be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Eac h 
site is provided training in informed consent by [CONTACT_106805]. The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in 
addition to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 a nd 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section 11). Safety is 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_106806] 123  Protocol Safety 
Review Team (PSRT ). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) 
periodically reviews s tudy data.  
2.[ADDRESS_128985] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unaut horized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 9 of 131 research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of participants by [CONTACT_106807] (see  
Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is protected by [CONTACT_115554]’s name [CONTACT_115646]. In the 
[LOCATION_002], research participants in HVTN protocols are protected by a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the US  National Institutes of Health  (NIH), 
which can prevent disclosure of study participation even when that information is 
requested by [CONTACT_106809]. Participants  are told of the use and limits of the certificate 
in the study consent form. In  addition, each staff member at each study site in this 
protocol signs an Agreement on  Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens  
with the HVTN . In some cases, a comparable confidentiality agreement process 
may be acceptable. E ach study site participating in the protocol is required to have 
a standard operating procedure on how the staff members will protect the 
confidentiality of study participants.

HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_128986] HIV -1 infection remains an elusive goal (4) and will 
likely need to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses  in order to 
both redu ce acquisition and control post infection viremia (5, 6) . To date, only 
four vaccine concepts have been tested in field trials (7-12) and only one vaccine 
regimen has shown efficacy in preventing HIV -1 infection (12). In RV144, an  
ALVAC env/gag/PR prime at 0, 1, 3, 6 months  with an AIDSVAX B/E gp120 
Env boost at [ADDRESS_128987] overall vaccine efficacy  of 
31% in the modified intention -to-treat cohort (12). Subsequent detailed analyses  
of potential correlates of protection and risk found that Env -specific binding IgG 
antibodies directed against the V1V2 region were found to positively correlate 
with protection (13), although protection peaked soon after vaccination and then 
waned over several years (14). 
The successful use of a protein boost following a heterologous priming vaccine in 
RV144 has renewed interest in development of Env proteins as a component of 
future HIV -1 vaccine regimens. Howe ver, the field has been hampered by 
[CONTACT_115559], as well as uncertainty in the choice of 
immunogens (15). It is, therefore, quite likely that multiple different Env proteins 
will need to be tested in an iterative fashion, potentially both alone and as part of 
prime -boost comb inations (16). 
Furthermore, designing a vaccine regimen which can lead to induction of broadly 
neutralizing antibodies ( bnAb s) has been a significant challenge for the field (17-
19). Results thus far have m ostly been limited to activity against easily -
neutralized Tier 1 viruses (for example, HVTN 073E (20) and HVTN 083 (21)) 
although some activity against more representative Tier 2 viruses was seen in 
HVTN 205 (22). Amongst the reasons why eliciting bnAb s has proven  such a 
challenge  include the trimeric conformational structure of Env, molecular 
mimicry of host antigens by [CONTACT_115560][INVESTIGATOR_322], as well as the atyp ical B 
cell maturation pathways  and complex somatic mutations in immunoglobulin  
variable domains  which may be required (23-26). If frequent and sequential 
immunization with serial Env proteins is necessary to direct B cell somatic 
mutation toward bnAb  production in a step -wise fashion (27, 28) , a hypothesis 
being tested in HVTN 115, then a very large number of Env proteins will need to 
be synthesized and tested in phase [ADDRESS_128988] development timeline could be the use of 
transiently transfected cell lines (29) to produce Env proteins (30). In contrast 
with the current practice of developi[INVESTIGATOR_115528] -grade product (31), use of transiently 
transfected cell lines could reduce the time required by [CONTACT_115561] 
(32). This would allow novel immunogens to enter phase [ADDRESS_128989] regimens i n order to 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2 018 
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 15 of 131 choose candidate regimens for efficacy trials (16). First, however, we propose that 
Env proteins produced by [CONTACT_115562].  
This study will use a clade C HIV -1 gp120 envelope protein (CH505TF gp120) 
adjuvanted with GLA -SE as the immunogen. This protein, produced via stably 
transfected cells, with GLA -SE, is also being tested in HVTN 115  (see Section  
4.9.1 ). CH505TF gp120 produced by [CONTACT_115563] a clinical trial, and therefore, this will serve as the first -in-human study for the 
protein produced by [CONTACT_115564]. The use of a gp120 Env has several potential 
advantages: 1) immunogenicity is rel ated to binding affinity to B -cell receptors  
(BCRs)  on the responding B cells (33, 34) ; 2) gp120 Env binds with high affinity 
to the germline unmutated common ancestor (UCA) antibody of the CH103 -like 
bnAb  linea ge and binds with high affinities to other bnAb  lineage intermediates; 
and 3) the exclusion of gp41 avoids stimulating non -neutralizing antibody 
responses to gp41 epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. This trial will allow direct comparison of an Env 
protein produced by [CONTACT_115565] -1 vaccine development.  
4.2 Stable CH505TF gp120  
The Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI) developed the transmitted/founder 
CH505 Env (CH505TF gp120) vaccine in collaboration with NIAID as part of the 
B cell lineage approach to develop bnAb s (27, 2 8). CH505TF gp120 is a 
recombinant HIV -1 gp120 clade C Env protein with an N -terminal deletion that 
facilitates production by [CONTACT_115566]  (35). This envelope sequence was derived from an African clade 
C transmitted founder virus CH505 -infected individual  (36). The Stable 
CH505TF gp120 was produced via stable transfection of a CHO -DG44 cell line 
and is also being tested in HVTN 115  (see Section 4.9.1 ). The Stable CH505TF 
gp120 will be mixed with GLA -SE (glucopyranosyl lipid A in a stable emulsion 
[oil-in-water emulsion containing  squalene ]) manufactured  by [CONTACT_115567] (IDRI).  
4.3 Transient CH505TF gp120  
The Transient CH505TF gp120  amino acid (aa) sequence is identical to the Stab le 
CH505TF gp120. Transient transfection was achieved by [CONTACT_115568]-transfection scale up of suspension cultures to a bioreactor. CHO -DG44 cells 
did not recover from the transient transfection procedure as well as CHO -S cells; 
therefore, CHO -S cells were chosen to produce the Transient gp120. The 
purification process was similar to the stably expressed protein . As with the 
Stable CH505TF, t he Transient  CH505TF gp120  will be mixed with GLA -SE 
manufactured  by [CONTACT_115569] .

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 16 of 131 4.4 Biochemical  and biophysical e quivalency of Stable and Transient 
CH505TF gp120  
Bulk drug substance (BDS) batches of both Stable and Transient CH505TF gp120 
proteins produced from  CHO cells were purified by [CONTACT_115570] -exchange chromatography . The two products were compared 
by a series of biochemical and biophysical assays. Both forms (stable and 
transient) of CH505TF gp120 were monomeric by [CONTACT_115571]  
(SEC)  analysis ( Figure 4-1) and showed similar migration on SDS -PAGE that 
was consistent with that of a 120kDa protein band ( Figure 4-2). Neither form of  
CH505TF gp120 showed any detectable proteolytically cleaved fragme nt by 
[CONTACT_451]-PAGE under reducing or non -reducing condition s, and no clearly distinct 
fragment was detected by W estern Blot analysis.

The antigenic signature [CONTACT_115647]120 was ident ical to its stable protein 
counterpart, with both gp120 proteins binding to each UCA, the intermediate IA3 
as well as to the mature CH106 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of the CD4 binding 
site (CD4 -BS) bnAb lineage  (data not shown) . No difference was observed i n the

respectively) or CH106 (K d = 9.7 and 9.7  nM for transient and stable respectively)

CH106 -reactive fraction present in both stable and transient preparations when 
measured by [CONTACT_115573] ( ITC) analysis (stoichiometry n 
values) was similar  (~ 60% active) (Figure 4-5). The closeness in values of 
CH106 affinities and enthalpy changes ( ∆H) indicated that the binding of both the

similar thermodynamic mechanism when binding to the CD4 -BS bnAb. Thus ,

4.5 Trial design rationale  
This is a double -blind, randomized clinical trial , which will compare the safety 
and immunogenicity of a CH505TF gp120 produced via stably transfected cell 
lines compared with production via transiently transfected cell line . Fifteen 
healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adults will be enrolled into each group, vaccinated at 
months 0, 2, and 6, and followed for a total of [ADDRESS_128991] injection given 
at month 6. Assessments of h umoral immune responses are planned at earl y, peak, 
plateau, and la te time points by [CONTACT_115577] a panel of Env antigens using 
the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA). From an immunogenicity 
perspective, this study design will allow us to assess both magnitude and breadth 
of humoral immune responses as well as  understand in detail the kinetics of the 
antibody responses.

The CH505TF gp120 used in the initial an imal studies (guinea pig 501 and NHP 
79) was generated in transiently -transfected 293 cells. The 293 -produced 
CH505TF gp120 has a different glycosylation profile than that of the CHO -
produced protein used for the rabbit toxicology study , mouse immunogenic ity, 
and for the nonhuman primate (NHP ) dose response study (NHP 106).

were used to calculate the log -transformed area under the curve (AUC) as shown on the y -axis. 
CH505TF gp120 was immunogenic at all doses. Groups 1, 5 and 9 received no GLA -SE and had 
significantly less anti -gp120 antibodies than the groups with 5 mcg (Groups 2, 6 and 10), 10 mcg 
(Groups 3, 7, and 11) or 25 mcg (Groups 4, 8, and 12) of GLA -SE. Moreover, there was no

CH505TF, CH505w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100 . These proteins were  
administered to 3 groups of four rhesus macaques (NHP 79) with the GLA -SE 
adjuvant : 1) CH505TF Env gp120 alone; 2)  the Envs given in a sequential 
regimen (CH505TF, CH50 5w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100); and 3) an 
additive -immunization regimen consisting of CH505TF gp120 in combination 
with the evolved Env variants (CH505TF, then CH505TF + CH505w53, then

The CH505 gp120 Env derivatives (including CH505TF) were found to be 
immunogenic ( Table 4-4). An important readout in this study was differential

Immune responses fr om the Transient and Stable CH505TF gp120 vaccine s were 
evaluated in a preclinical immunogenicity study conducted by [CONTACT_115590] (DHVI). The immunogenicity of 
each vaccine was evaluated in female BALB/c mice after 2 or 3 IM 
immunizations with the respective protein adjuvanted with 5 mcg of GLA -SE per 
mouse dose. Six groups of 7 female BALB/c mice were immunized every 2 
weeks for a total of 3 immunizations with each respective vaccine. Pre -bleeds/ser a 
were  taken 2 weeks prior to and on the day of immunization 1 (day 0). Post bleeds 
were collected 1 week after each immunization.  
The immunogenicity of each form of recombinant gp120 was evaluated by

reference  (35). Groups were compared by [CONTACT_115593] (also called

in Panel A and binding to Transient CH505TF is shown in Panel B. The 
engineered resurfaced core 3 (RSC3) protein was used to detect antibodies 
antigeni cally related to CD4 -binding site binding, and results are shown in Panel 
C (37). Panel D shows binding to the heterologous gp120 YU2. YU2 gp120 is 
CD4 -binding site knock -out mutant lacking variable regions V1, V2, and V3 and 
truncated at the N - and C -terminal regions; binding to YU2 g p120 indicates serum 
antibodies directed to the gp120 scaffold (37). Panel E displays binding to the 
CH505TF V2 peptide 
(GMKNCSFNITTELRDKREKKNALFYKLDIVQLDGNSSQYRLIN). Lastly, 
Panel F demonstrates binding to CH505 V3 peptide 
(TRPNNKTRTSIRIGPGQAFYATGQVIGDIREAY). These data show that the 
binding profile of antibodies induced by [CONTACT_115596]120 or the 
transiently transfected -produced gp120 was near identical. With the data in Panels 
A, B, D and F, there was a slight but statistically non -significant trend to the

The immunogenicity of each form of the recombinant gp120 was near identical in 
all performed assays. The Transient CH505TF gp120 induced slightly better CD4 
binding site antibodies than the Stable CH505TF. Thus, the two proteins were 
highly comparable in their  immunogenicity in BALB/c mice, as measured by 
[CONTACT_115599]-reactive antibodies, with a trend toward higher induction of CD4 binding site 
targeted antibodies by [CONTACT_115600]120.

4.9.1  Clinical studies of Stable CH505TF gp120  vaccine  
The Stable CH505TF gp120 is being evaluated  in HVTN 115. In the dose ranging 
portion of that clinical t rial (HVTN 115 Part A) safety and immunogenicity data 
will be collected to inform the protein dose for the second part of that study. 
HVTN 115 Part A reached full enrollment with 42 participants in May 2018. As 
of June 25, 2018, there has been one case of grade 3 erythema/induration  with 
grade [ADDRESS_129008] regimens. 
The AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG) conducted an analysis of safety 
data from over 15 clinical tri als of gp120 and gp160 proteins administered to over 
500 individuals demonstrating that overall, HIV Env proteins at doses up to 640 
mcg were well tolerated. The majority of the local and systemic reactions were 
deemed associated with the adjuvant componen ts of the vaccine rather than the 
Env proteins themselves  (38). 
A monovalent subtype B and bivalent subtype B/E (CRF01_AE) recombinant 
gp120 HIV -1 vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) was evaluated in an efficacy study 
conducted in over 2500 injection drug users in Thailand. A total of 600 mcg o f 
AIDSVAX B/E was administered with alum as an adjuvant. The most commonly 
reported adverse event (AE) was tenderness at the injection site (71% of vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_115532] 66% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]), which did not increase with 
subsequent injections. The re were no differences between vaccine and placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_115533] (SAE s) (39). 
The RV144 study evaluated the same gp120 vaccine in a heterologous prime -
boost vaccination regimen consisting of a recombinant canarypox vector 
expressing gag, PR,  and env (ALVAC -HIV; vCP1521) followed by [CONTACT_115601]120 
protein boost. Over 8000 participants received multiple combined doses of 600 
mcg of gp120 in combination with ALVAC -HIV (12). Local and systemic 
reactogenicity noted after the gp120 protein (AID SVAX B/E) was mostly mild 
with very few SAEs reported  (40). 
Prior clinical experience comparing various doses of gp120 and gp160 Env 
proteins has not iden tified significant differences in the safety profile when the 
protein dose was altered and adjuvant dose remained constant. For example, in a 
study evaluating AIDSVAX B/E gp120 at 100 mcg ( N=31), 300 mcg ( N=31) and 
600 mcg ( N=30) of the protein adjuvanted with alum, the majority (80%) of 
participants reported at least one reactogenicity event, most commonly injection 
site pain/tenderness, but all of the reactogenicity symptoms were mild to moderate 
and self -limited. Furthermore , although there were fewer reactogenicity events at 
the 100 mcg dose, the safety profile in the 300 mcg and 600 mcg groups was 
similar  (41). A study of recombinant gp160 VaxSyn formulated with an alum 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 32 of 131 adjuvant compared two doses of 160 mcg (N=20) and 640 mcg (N=21) of the 
protein administered as 4 injections over a 12 month period. Local reactogenicity 
(injection site erythema/indurati on) was frequent but self -limited, last ed less than 
48 hours, and the frequency of local reactogenicity was similar between the two 
dose groups. There were no significant differences in severe local or systemic 
reactions between the dose groups. Importantl y, there were no significant 
differences in laboratory abnormalities (hepatic, hematologic and renal function) 
between the two different protein doses  (42). 
Taken together, the combined data from the large numbers of trial participants in 
these studies demonstrate that gp120 re combinant protein vaccines administered 
in combined doses of up to [ADDRESS_129009] formulated in a stable nano -emulsion of 
squalene oil and promotes a strong Th 1-type immune response  to vaccine  
antigens  (43, 44) . Although the Transient CH505TF gp120 protein in combination 
with GLA -SE has not  been evaluated in huma ns to date , as summarized in Section  
4.9.[ADDRESS_129010] was an open -label  phase 1 clinical trial conducted  in Brazil 
with a Schistosoma mansoni  antigen (Sm14 ) (45). Twenty healthy males received 
3 IM doses of 50 mcg Sm14 + 10 mcg GLA -SE at one -month intervals. The 
vaccine was safe and generally well tolerated with no SAEs or Grade 4 AEs  (45). 
Injection site pain was commonly reported ( 80%, 50%, and 41% after the first, 
second, and third dose, respectively) , but generally mild and self -limited . There 
were no abnormalities in physical exams, serum chemistries, and hematology 
values that were considered related to study vaccine.  Humoral and CD4+ T cell 
responses to Sm14 were reported (45). 
The second  clinical trial using the 10 mcg dose of GLA -SE is a recently 
completed  phase  1, open -label evaluation of the safety, tolerabil ity, and 
immunogenicity of a Leishmania vaccine (LEISH -F3) in combination with SLA -
SE (second generation glucopyranosyl  lipid A in stable oil -in-water emulsion) 
adjuvant compared to LEISH -F3 with GLA -SE in healthy adults ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
Protocol IDRI -LVVPX -117). The SLA -SE adjuvant is a next generation TLR4 
adjuvant formulation. Thirty -nine participants were randomized to 4 arms: high 
dose LEISH -F3 (20 mcg) and low dose SLA -SE (5 mcg); high dose LEISH -F3 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 33 of 131 and h igh dose GLA -SE adjuvant (10 mcg); low dose LEISH -F3 (5 mcg) and high 
dose GLA -SE adjuvant (10 mcg); and high dose LEISH -F3 and high dose SLA -
SE adjuvant (10 mcg). Partici pants received 3 injections at one -month intervals.  
This study is complete. The LEISH -F3 + GLA -SE and LEISH -F3 + SLA -SE 
vaccines were safe and well tolerated in adult subjects. No deaths, no dose -
limiting toxicities (DLTs), no Grade [ADDRESS_129011] 
frequently reported reactions were injection site tenderness/pain and fatigue.  
Three other clinical trials are evaluating GLA -SE in oncology. Two ongoing trials 
are investigating GLA -SE alone as an immunotherapy and one trial tested GLA -
SE in combination with a prostate cancer antigen. No data are currently available 
from these trials . 
Clinical experience with GLA -SE as an adjuvant for other vaccines at doses 
ranging from 1 mcg to 5 mcg suggests that it is safe and well -tolerated. Treanor et 
al. tested an avian influenza hemagglutinin (H5) subunit vaccine at a range of 
doses with and wit hout a fixed dose of GLA -SE (1 mcg) and reported mild to 
moderate injection site pain and/or tenderness in 50–70% of H5 + GLA -SE 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with myalgias and headaches reported by a minority (25 -27%) of 
vaccinees. No other safety findings were noted and t he GLA -SE adjuvant 
substantially increased the immunogenicity of the vaccine (46). 
A recent phase 1 clinical trial of a res pi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) vaccine in 
older adults ( ≥ 60 years of age) found that a combination of the RSV fusion (F) 
protein at three different doses with 2.5 mcg of GLA -SE was safe, well -tolerated, 
and immunogenic. Compared with unadjuvanted vaccine,  GLA -SE increased 
local reactogenicity, with 40-65% of subjects reporting mild-to-moderate, self -
limited  injection site pain and/or tenderness  (47). No other safety concerns were 
reported . Immune responses were F protein  dose-dependent, and  the adjuvant 
enhanced  both humoral and cellular immune respon ses (47). A follow -up study 
using a higher do se of F protein and three doses of GLA -SE has been completed  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). The vaccine was safe, tolerable, and immunogenic and the data 
supported the selection of 120 mcg F protein /5 mcg of GLA -SE for further 
evaluation (48). 
GLA -SE was also found to be safe and well -tolerated at doses of 2 mcg and 5 
mcg in a phase 1 trial of LEISH -F3 given three times at one month intervals  (49). 
Injection site pain and/or tend erness was quite common (90 -100%) with fatigue 
noted by 40 -60% of vaccinees receiving the adjuvanted product versus 33% of 
subjects who received unadjuvanted vaccine (49). The unadjuvanted LEISH -F3 
was essentially non -immunogenic while antibody and cytokine responses were 
noted in vaccinees in  both dose groups of GLA -SE (49). 
GLA -SE at a 5 m cg dose has also been tested together with protein antigens in 
several other clinical trials which are included in Table 4-5 and Table 4-6.

HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 1 2, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 42 of 131 6.2 Randomization  
A participant’s randomization assignment  will be computer -generated and 
provided to the HVTN CRS pharmacist through a Web -based randomization 
system. At each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for 
dispensing study products is charged with maintaining security of the treatment 
assignments  (except in emergency situations as specified in the HVTN MOP).  
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to 
participant treatment arm assignments. Study product assignments are accessible 
to those HVTN CRS pharmacists, DAIDS protocol pharmacists and contract 
monitors, and SD MC staff who are required to know this information in order to 
ensure proper trial conduct. Any discussion of study product assignment between 
pharmacy staff and any other HVTN CRS staff is prohibited. The HVTN SMB 
members also are unblinded to treatment a ssignment in order to conduct review of 
trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant will 
be told he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her 
treatment assignment.  
In some cases, the CRS, PSRT, or study s ponsor may believe unblinding of the 
site PI [INVESTIGATOR_115536]. The HVTN Unblinding MOP specifies procedures for 
emergency unblinding, and for ea rly unblinding for medical reasons.   
6.4 Statistical analys es 
This section describes the final study analys es, unblinded as to treatment arm 
assignment. All safety data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according 
to the initial randomization assignme nt regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a participant receives the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccination time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. A nalys es are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because of blinding and the brief length of time between 
randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 working da ys—very 
few such individuals are expected.  The primary and secondary analys es of 
immunogenicity  data are per -protocol in that only individuals who receive the 
expected vaccinations within the expected visit window contribute data.  
Analyses for primary endp oints will be performed using SAS and R. All other 
descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, 
StatXact, or R statistical software.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129024] of baseline participant characteristic s, safety, and 
immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concur rent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or sym ptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106862]. For a given sign or symptom, 
each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum 
severity for all injection visits. In addition, to the individual types of events, the 
maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, and of 
systemic symptoms will be calculated. Wilcoxon  tests will be used to test for 
differences in severity between arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be su mmarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred 
terms. Tables will show by [CONTACT_115610] a System Organ Class or within preferred 
term category by [CONTACT_115611]. For the calculations 
in these tables, a participant with multiple AEs within a category will be counted 
once under the maximum severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship to 
study product. Formal statistical testing comparing arms is  not planned since 
interpretation of differences must rely heavily upon clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study pr oduct, time between onset and last vaccination, and number of 
vaccinations received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study earl y will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106867].

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 44 of 131 6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints  analyses will be limited 
to participants who received all scheduled injections per protocol. Assay results 
that are unreliable, from specimens collected outside of the visit window, or from 
HIV-infected participants postinfection are excluded. Since the exact date of HIV 
infection is unknown, any assay data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an 
infected participan t’s last seronegative sample and thereafter may be excluded. If 
an HIV -infected participant does not have a seronegative sample postenrollment, 
then all data from that participant may be excluded from the analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints (eg,  response rates) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_106868]. Crude 
response rates and difference between treatment arms will be presen ted with their 
corresponding 95% CI estimates calculated using the score test method (50). 
For quantitative assay data, graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions 
by [CONTACT_488], treatment arm, and timepoint will be made. For all primary and 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots of estimated reverse 
cumu lative distribution curves will be used for graphical display of all of the 
study arms.  
Mean or median (if normality assumption severely violated) assay readouts will 
be compared between arms and bootstrap CIs will be estimated.  
More sophisticated analys es employing repeated measures methodology (for 
example, linear mixed models  or marginal mean models fit by [CONTACT_106869]) may be utilized to incorporate immune responses over 
several timepoints and to test for differences over time . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multivariate display of immunogenicity endpoints  
Data visualization techniques may be used to explore the relationship among 
immunogenicity readouts. The  set of readouts may be based on the set of primary 
endpoints, or on immunogenicity endpoints that also  include secondary or 
exploratory endpoints. To understand the relationship between pairs of readouts, 
scatter plots may be used when the number of readouts is small or for a larger 
number of readouts, a heatmap showing the degree of correlation between an y 
two pairs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and associated ‘b iplots’ of the 
scores and loadings are particularly useful to understand associations between 
readouts, especially when readouts are correlated  (51). PCA is a method to reduce 
the dimensionality of the number of readouts to a smaller set of values (principal 
components) that are normalized linear combinations of the readouts in such a 
way that the first principal component accounts for the most variability in the data 
and subsequent components, while maximizing variability, are uncorrelated with 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 45 of 131 each other. A ‘biplot’ displays the first and second principal component scores 
and principal component loadings. The x -axis is the  value from the first principal 
component and the y -axis is the second principal component, where each axis 
label includes the percentage of variation in the total set of readouts captured by 
[CONTACT_115612]. The top axis is the first principal com ponent loadings 
and the right axis is the second principal component loadings. An arrow is drawn 
for each immunogenicity readout (eg , Env-specific CD4+ T cell  polyfunctionality 
score, Env-specific CD8 + T cell  total magnitude) from the origin to the point 
defined by [CONTACT_106872]. The length of the arrow 
represents the amount of total variation of the set of readouts captured by [CONTACT_115613]. The direction of an arrow conveys the extent to which the variation 
of a readout is  in the direction of the first or second principal component. The 
angle between two arrows conveys information about the correlation of the two 
readouts, with a zero degree angle denoting perfect correlation and a 90 degree 
angle denoting no correlation. E ach arrow on the biplot is labeled by [CONTACT_115614]. A biplot is annotated with key meta -
information such as the treatment arm (most common application) or a 
demographic category. Depending on the application, K -means clustering and 
hierarchical clustering may also be applied for multivariate graphical display of 
immunogenicity readouts.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of multiplexed immunoassay data  
Two approaches will be considered to evaluate the magnitude and breadth of 
these responses. First, M-B curves maybe employed to display individual - and 
group -level response breadth as a function of magnitude. Two choices are to 
compare the M -B curves among vaccine arms, as follows: a non -parametric 
Wilcoxon rank sum test on the subject -specific area -under-the M -B curve (AUC -
MB) or a Kolmogorov -Smirnov type test on the [ADDRESS_129025] approach may 
be adopted. Details of either approach will be described in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of neutralization mag nitude -breadth curves  
The area -under -the-magnitude -breadth curve (AUC -MB) to the panel of isolates 
will be computed for each participant with evaluable neutralization data, as 
described in  Huang et al. (52). Methods for comparing AUC -MB are similar to 
those described in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response as measured by [CONTACT_115615]4+ and CD8+ T -cell response rates as measured by [CONTACT_115616]. 
For each T -cell subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool  will include  a 
multiple comparison  adjustment for the number of peptide pools used in the 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 46 of 131 assay.  In general, the Mixture Models for Single -cell Assays (MIMOSA) 
statistical framework  (53) and/or the Fisher’s exact test -based p ositivity criteria 
will be used. Details of the positivity criteria will be discussed in the SAP. The 
magnitude of marginal response will be analyzed as described for quantitative  
data in the general approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will be  used to 
display the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant by [CONTACT_109414], 
treatment arm and timepoint. When 3 or more cytokines are being measured by 
[CONTACT_106877], the polyfunctionality of ICS responses may also be analyzed as an 
exploratory endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional 
responses, the COMPASS ( Com binatorial Polyfunctionality a nalysis of Antigen -
Specific T -cell Subsets ) statistical framework  (54) may also be used to perform 
joint modelling of multiple T -cell subsets of different cytokine combinations. For 
example, the functionality score (FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) may 
be used to summarize the multi -parameter ICS respon ses.  
6.4.5  Analyses and data sharing prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or immunogenic ity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by [CONTACT_106880] a need to know basis in accordance with Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Interim 
blinded safety and immunogenicity data should not be shared outside of the SMB, 
HVTN [ADDRESS_129026] developer, and the study sponsor and/or its 
designee(s) for their regulatory reporting unless approved by [CONTACT_106881] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  analyses  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every [ADDRESS_129027] of the HVTN 123  PSRT. Refer to 
the process described in the  HVTN Unblinding MOP for any requests for 
unblinded safety data prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.

Participants will be healthy, HIV  uninfected (sero negative) adults who 
comprehend the purpose of the study and have provided written informed consent. 
Volunteers will be recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. F inal 
eligibility determination will depend on  information available at the time of 
enrollment, including  results of screening laboratory tests, medical history, 
physical examinations, and answers to self -administered and/or interview 
questions.  
Investigat ors should always use good clinical judgment in considering a 
volunteer’s overall fitness for trial participation. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Medical, psychiatric, occupational,  or other conditions may make evaluation of 
safety and/or immunogenicity difficult, and some volunteers may be poor 
candidates for retention.

7.3 Participant depa rture from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the study product 
administration  schedule. Pause rules for the trial are described in Section  11.3. 
7.3.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are no t 
limited to the following:  
• Within 45 days prior to any study injection   
▪ Receipt of b lood products or immunoglobulin  
• Within 30  days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of l ive attenuated vaccines  
▪ Receipt of a llergy treatment with antigen injections  
• Withi n 14 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines (eg, 
pneumococcal)  
• Prevaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask 
assessment of vaccine reaction.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 54 of 131 Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified 
in the HVTN 123  Study Specific Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who 
plan to receive lic ensed vaccines  or allergy treatments should be counseled to 
schedule receipt of these substances, when possible, outside the intervals 
indicated above. The effects of these substances on safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions with stu dy vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if 
circumstances allow, these substances should also be avoided in the 2 week  
interval between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 week  
postvaccination follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination sche dule 
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. 
If a participant misses a vaccination and the visit window period for the 
vaccination has passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should 
be asked to con tinue study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination 
schedule with the next vaccination unless there are circumstances that require 
further delay or permanent discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 
7.3.3 ).  
7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain ci rcumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be 
permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
• Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
excepti ons allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 123  PSRT)  
• Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system 
or for which continued vaccin ations and/or blood draws may pose additional 
risk), including but not limited to the following:  
▪ Pregnancy (regardless of outcome)  
▪ HIV infection  
▪ Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or 
AE that is subsequently considered to  be related to vaccination  
▪ Any grade 3 lab abnormality that is subsequently considered to be related 
to vaccination  
▪ Other grade 3 clinical AE that is subsequently considered to be related to 
vaccination with the exception of fever, vomiting, and subjective  local and 
systemic symptoms. For grade 3 injection site erythema and/or induration, 
upon review, the PSRT may allow continuation of vaccination  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 55 of 131 ▪ SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
▪ Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity  reaction associated with 
study vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 123  PSRT is required 
prior to subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity 
reaction associated with study vaccination  
• Investigator dete rmination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, 
for repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions)  
Participants discontinuing study product for reasons other than HIV infection  
should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the s tudy and strongly 
encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol -related procedures per 
the protocol for the remainder of the trial, unless  medically contraindicated  (See 
HVTN 123 SSP) . 
Participants diagnosed with HIV infection during the study  should be encouraged 
to participate in follow -up visits as indicated in Section 9.13 
7.3.4  Participant termination from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an indivi dual participant may be terminated from 
participation in this study. Specific events that will result in early termination 
include:  
• Participant refuses further participation,  
• Participant relocates and remote follow -up or transfer to another HVTN CRS 
is not  possible,  
• HVTN CRS determines that the participant is lost to follow -up, or 
• Investigator decides, in consultation with Protocol Team leadership, to 
terminate participation (eg, if participant exhibits inappropriate behavior 
toward clinic staff).  
• Any condi tion where termination from the study is required by [CONTACT_115619].

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 61 of 131 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedule of clinical procedures is shown in Appendix F  . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them while participating in a research 
study.  The HVTN in formed consent form documents that a participant (1) has 
been informed about the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, 
and (2) is willing to participate in an HVTN study. Informed consent 
encompasses all written or verbal study info rmation HVTN CRS staff provide to 
the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff will obtain informed 
consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the study. Key study co ncepts 
should be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be 
documented. At each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any  new information is learned that might affect the participants ’ 
decisions to stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ  recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent befo re any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  for human subjects protection 
review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registrat ion Manual, an RE is “Any 
group other than the local IRB/EC responsible for reviewing and/or approving a 
clinical research protocol and site -specific informed consent forms  prior to 
implementation at a site.” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requiremen ts of 
their applicable REs.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_129056] appr oval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 62 of 131 enrollment consent.  Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any applicable RE  may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the  eligibility criteria.  
9.1.2  Protocol -specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used and all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. 
A sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is located in  
Appendix A . A separate sample consent form for other uses of specimens is 
located in  Appendix C . 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent 
form (s) for local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent form s in 
Appendix A  and Appendix C . The consent form (s) must be developed in 
accordance with requirements of the following : 
• CRS’s IRB/EC  and any applicable RE s, 
• CRS’s institution, and  
• Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 
21 CFR, Part 50, and in the ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -
specific consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, 
issues of cultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed c onsent form s include instructions throughout the document 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_115539].  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the 
current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_129057] on 
the procedures an d issues presented, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant ’s 
understanding of key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must 
complete the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide 
assistance in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129058] verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. 
This process and the participant ’s understanding of the key co ncepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained thoro ughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE , whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion crit eria must 
be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the 
eligibility criteria (or below in this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are performe d: 
• Medical history, documented in the case history record  
• Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection  
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and thr oat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin  
• Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], 
alternative/complementa ry medicines (eg, herbal and health food 
supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots  
• Laboratory tests including:  
▪ Screening HIV test,  
▪ HBsAg,  
▪ Anti-HCV antibodies,  
▪ CBC with differential and platelets,  
▪ Chemistry panel (ALT, AST, alkaline  phosphatase, and creatinine),  
▪ Urine dipstick (as described in Section  9.8), and 
▪ Urine or serum pregnancy test (participants who were assigned female  sex 
at birth )

• Behavio ral risk assessment  
• Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section  9.6 
• Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was assigned  
female sex at birth and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead 
to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin ad equate birth 
control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the participant 
becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming 
pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN study  
If a participant screens for  an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does 
not join that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant 
consent, the participant has signed a consent f orm to begin screening for this 
study, and the tests were conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria ( see Section s 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.[ADDRESS_129059] vaccination. The HVTN CRS requests the 
randomization assignment  via a Web -based randomization system. In general, t he 
time interval between randomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working 
days. However, c ircumstances may require a participant’s enrollment visit to be 
changed. This may exceed the 4 -day randomiza tion time limit.  
At all vaccination visits, the following procedures are performed before 
vaccination:  
• Abbreviated physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation by [CONTACT_106903]/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 65 of 131 • Assessment of baseline reactogenicity parameters;  
• Assessment of concomitant medications (as described in Section  9.2); 
• Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses; and  
• Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were assigned  female  sex 
at birth ). Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy  or bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by [CONTACT_106904]), are not requir ed to undergo pregnancy testing . 
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list , and if results 
indicate that vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered 
(see Section s 8.3 and 8.4). 
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for 
observation. An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of [ADDRESS_129060] with the participant 
during the reactogenicity period (as described in Section  9.9). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These 
procedures may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
• Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section  9.6);  
• Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.7); and  
• Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about  the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a result of the trial participation).  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled visits as specified in 
Appendix E  and Appendix F :  
• HIV infection assessment including pretest counseling  and HIV testing . A

study product(s);  
▪ New diagnosis of HIV infection; and  
▪ Pregnancies and outcomes, including congenital anomalies/birth defects.  
All such events will be recorded, and AEs will be assessed for relationship to 
study product(s).   
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129062]. These contacts are reported as interim visits.  
9.6 HIV co unseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC ’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm following 
enrol lment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive 
due to the vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV antibody 
testin g outside of the HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during 
study participation and/or during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood 
of routine HIV t esting being offered or performed outside the study CRS at 
emergency rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more 
likely due to the CDC ’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well 
as policy changes in many countries to  make HIV testing more frequent and 
routine. CRS staff should inform participants of their right to opt out of HIV 
testing outside the study site. CRS staff should inform study participants if local 
and/or state policies and regulations permit medical prov iders to perform HIV 
testing without first informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS staff should 
advise study participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff 
should also inform participants if positive results must  be reported to local public 
health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of the need to 
maintain study blinding by [CONTACT_106913]. CRS staff 
should provide participants with CRS contact [CONTACT_106914]. The CRS can verify that 
the participant is in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the 
study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV -infected during screeni ng are not 
enrolled. Potential and enrolled participants identified as being HIV-infected will 
be referred for medical treatment, counseling, and management of the HIV 
infection. Participants who are found to be  HIV-infected after enrollment will not 
recei ve any additional study product but will continue to be followed in the study 
for safety assessments. These individuals may also be referred to appropriate 
ongoing clinical trials or observational studies.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / Decemb er 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129063] may elicit an antibody response to HIV proteins. Therefore, 
vaccine -induced positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection f rom vaccine -
induced positive serology. These precautionary measures include:  
• Participants will have physical examinations at visits specified in Appendix F . 
Signs or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness 
consistent with HIV -1 infection, or probable HIV exposure would prompt a 
diagnostic workup per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute 
Infection Testing to determine HIV infection . 
• HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study 
(see Appendix F ). The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic 
laboratory) will follo w the HVTN HIV testing algorithm  (see Study Specific 
Procedures (SSP) ), which is able to distinguish vaccine -induced antibody 
responses from actual HIV infections.  
• All participants can receive HIV -[ADDRESS_129064] vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
• All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as meas ured by [CONTACT_106915] -
HIV antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be offered 
poststudy HIV -1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing 
algorithm) periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated 
(approximately every 6 months)  unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer 
the standard test in clinical settings .  
9.6.[ADDRESS_129065] kits. This is called 
“vaccine -induced seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.6.1 ). In order to provide 
poststudy HIV testing to distinguis h between VISP and HIV infection, and to 
mitigate potential social harms resulting from VISP in HIV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106759], the HVTN has created a VISP registry. Following 
study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff  to verify that an individual 
has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Information in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry 
exists to support provision o f post study testing and counseling servic es to HIV 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The registry contains the names of all study participants, 
unless they request that their names be removed.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129066] that could cause that participant to become 
pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of 
using contraception and should be refe rred to specific counseling, information, 
and advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in Section  
7.1). This reminder shoul d be documented in the participant ’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 
year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal 
ligation —must be documented in the participant ’s study  record.  
9.8 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is 
performed on urine obtained by [CONTACT_106916].  
If the screening dipstick is tran siently abnormal due to menses or infection, 
document this issue in the participant ’s source documentation. For infection, 
provide appropriate treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the 
dipstick and, if within the eligibility limits specif ied in the protocol, the 
participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be deferred if a participant is menstruating, but 
should be performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnormal due 
to a participant ’s menstrual period, docume nt in the comment section of the case 
report form (CRF) and repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer 
menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is not required.  
9.9 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed befor e and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms 
are followed until resolution and graded according to the Division of AIDS 
(DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse Events , 
Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, except as noted in Section  11.2.[ADDRESS_129067]

a participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is 
seen by a clinician within 48 hours  after onset, unless the reaction is improving 
and/or has completely resolved. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved 
reactoge nicity symptoms present at day 7  to resolution.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of 
assessment in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of 
systemic and local symptoms, and vaccine -related lesions. Events not listed on a 
CRF, or with an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period (day of 
vaccination and 7 full days after), or those meeting SAE/ AEs requiring expedited 
reporting to DAIDS criteria, are recorded on an adverse experience log form.

each symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_106917] . All temperatures 
must be measured by [CONTACT_105] -axillary thermometry. This includes temperatures taken 
in the clinic, as well as temperatures  taken by [CONTACT_106918].  
Temperature is  reported in degrees Celsius. If temperature is measured in 
Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be documented in the participant ’s 
chart note. A measurement is taken once daily  during the assessment period and 
should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 72 of 131 9.10 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are def ined in HVTN 123  SSP. For a visit not performed within 
the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the missed visit is one 
that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN CRS staff should 
attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of  HIV testing, 
these procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if 
clinically indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_28023]. Blood samples for immunogenicity assays are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_115540].  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section  7.3.2  and Section  
7.3.3  for resolution.  
9.11 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff should consider if the 
following assessments are appropriate: a final physical examinat ion, clinical 
laboratory tests (including urine dipstick, CBC with differential  and platelets , and 
chemistry panel), pregnancy testing, social impact assessment, and HIV test.  For 
participants who have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, see Section 9.[ADDRESS_129069] administration. Follow -up duration for participants diagnosed with HIV 
infection may be adjusted in consultation with the CRS investigator and the 
HVTN 123 PSRT (eg, to avoid interference with participant initiation of HIV 
treatment). At post -infection follow -up visits, only specimens required for 
protocol -specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be

10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN 123 Site Lab Instructions  and SSP provide further guidelines for 
operational issues concerning the clinical and processing laboratories. These 
document s include guidelines for general specimen collection, special 
considerations for phlebotomy , specimen labeling , whole blood processing,  HIV 
screening/diagnostic testing,  and general screening and safety testing.  
Tube types for blood collection are specified in Appendix E . For tests performed 
locall y, the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood collection tubes may be redirected to another 
laboratory or may require study -specific processing techniques. In these cases, 
laboratory special instructions will be post ed on the protocol -specific section of 
the HVTN website.  
Of note, all assays described below are performed as research assays to evaluate 
the ability of the vaccine to induce immune responses in the context of the 
participants’ genetic background, and are not approved for use in medical care.

10.4.1  Flow cytometry : ICS 
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+ T -cell responses 
following stimulation of  peripheral blood mononu clear cells ( PBMCs ) with 
synthetic HIV peptides that span the proteins  encoded by [CONTACT_29500] . ICS 
parameters will include cytokines such as  interferon ( IFN)-γ, interleukin ( IL)-2, 
and tumor necrosis factor (T NF)-α, and may include other cytokines  (such as  
cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses ) to identify T cells of specific 
functionality . Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ T cells responding to 
a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, or functional 
markers may also be analyzed.  
10.4.2  Flow cytometry: antigen -specific B cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_115541] -specific B cells induced by [CONTACT_115623] -labeled recombinant proteins in combination 
with a flow cytometry phenotypi [INVESTIGATOR_4395]. In particular, HIV Env -reactive B cells 
will be enumerated and may be further characterized for expression of memory, 
activation, inhibitory or other markers of interest . B cells may also be sorted for 
further analysis by [CONTACT_115624] g or gene e xpression analysis.  B cells may 
instead be cultured for detection of and functional testing of secreted antibodies 
by [CONTACT_115625], and/or BCR sequencing.  
10.4.3  BCR repertoire analysis  
Single or bulk populations of naïve or memory B cells,  or plasmablasts, may be 
sorted for any combination of BCR sequencing, gene expression analysis, or 
functional antibody testing by [CONTACT_115626].  
10.5 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.5.1  Binding antibody multiplex assay  (BAMA)  
HIV-1–specific total binding IgG antibodies to CH505TF gp120 and a panel of 
heterologous gp120s will be assessed on serum samples from study participants 
taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s and baseline.  In addition, HIV -1–
specific total binding IgA antibodies and b inding to IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3, and IgG4) may also be assessed.  Specimens from other timepoints may also 
be assayed based on the results of the initial assay.   
10.5.2  Neutralizing antibody  (nAb)  assay  
HIV-1–specific nAb assays will be performed on serum samples from study 
participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s. Specimens from the

of the HVTN Laboratory Program. Other genes , including those  associated with 
immune responses (eg, immunoglobulin or T -cell receptor genes) or HIV -[ADDRESS_129073] genetics that may be conducted to determine 
endpoints in HVTN vaccine trials.  The type  of assay(s) employed will be 
dependent on the response obtained by [CONTACT_115628].  Please note that the Lab Assay Algorithm will be updated 
periodically to include new assays.  
10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be us ed for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved 
samples may be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and 
validation of existing or newly developed me thods.   
10.9 Specimen storage and o ther use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 77 of 131 Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by  [CONTACT_115629]  (see Appendix A ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and oth er 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed 
consent form, or as otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research  on 
specim ens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the CRS’s 
IRBs/ECs/REs if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local gov ernmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.

The roles and responsibilities of the SDMC in relation to safety monitoring 
include:  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2 018 
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 79 of 131 • Maintaining a central database management system for HVTN clinical data;  
• Providin g reports of clinical data to appropriate groups such as the HVTN 123  
PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section 11.1.2); 
11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
• Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 123  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section  11.3); 
• Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds 
are instituted and lifted (see Section 11.3); 
• Querying HVTN CRSs for additional information regarding reported clinical 
data; and  
• Providing support to the HVTN [ADDRESS_129076] submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, adverse experience, 
urinalysis, local lab results, and concomitant medications) before the end of the 
next business day , excluding federal or bank holidays . The forms should not be 
held in anticipation  of additional information at a later date. If additional 
information is received at a later date, the forms should be updated and 
resubmitted  before the end of the next business day after receiving the new

dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue);  
During the main study period (see Section 3) all AEs are reported to the SDMC 
on the appr opriate CRF. Clinic staff should evaluate every AE to determine if (1) 
the AE meets the requirements for expedited reporting to DAIDS ( see Section  
11.2.3 ) and (2) if the AE meets the criteria for a prompt AE review ( see Section  
11.3). 
After the main study period , report the subset of AEs bulle ted in Section 9.[ADDRESS_129078] (see Section 3) is complete .

Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedite d Reporting of 
Adverse Events  to DAIDS  (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC 
website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -
reporting -adverse -events -daids . The SAE Reporting Category will be used for this 
study.  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience  Reporting System (DAERS) must 
be used for expedited AE (EAE) reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system 
outages or technical difficulties, EAE reports may be submitted via the DAIDS 
EAE Form.  This form is availab le on the DAIDS RSC website at 
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting . 
For questions about DAERS, please contact  [EMAIL_2104]  or 
from withi n the DAERS application itself.  
For questions about EAE reporting, please  contact [CONTACT_115631] (DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com) . 
The study products for which expedited reporting are required are :  
• Stable CH505TF HIV gp120 with GLA -SE 
• Transient CH505TF HIV gp120 with GLA -SE 
While the participant is in the main study reporting period ( see Section 3), the 
SAE Reporting Category will be used.   
After completion of  the main study period through completion of the AESI health 
contact (see Section  3) the S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting Category will be used . 
After the participant has completed the AESI  health contact [CONTACT_115632], sites 
must report S[LOCATION_003]RS if the study site staff becomes aware of the events on a 
passive basis (eg, from publicly available information).  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).  However, because safety is  a primary study endpoint, the study 
sponsor Medical Officer will not routinely be unblinded to study treatment 
assignment when there is an assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the study 
product(s); and the safety report will be sent to the FDA based on the blinded 
attribution assessment.

Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safet y and Pharmacovigilance Team 
(SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 123  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the  pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core  notifies the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumpt ion or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 123  PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifies the FDA as needed.

The HVTN requires that each CRS submit  to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problem s involving risks to 
participants or others, and notification of othe r unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_106885] 123  PSRT (see 
Section 11.4.2 ).

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everythi ng clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]  are doing a 
study to test HIV vaccines . HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
About 30 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert nam e of site PI] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study vaccines  safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccines  without becoming too 
uncomf ortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccines ? (Your 
immune system protects you from disease.)  
• Does a small  difference in the way the 2 vaccines were made  change how 
people’ s immune systems respond?   
2. The study vaccines  cannot give y ou HIV.  
The study vaccines are  not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study 
vaccines  to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone 
else. 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 99 of 131 3. We do not know if the study vaccines  will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk  of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Site: Any change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at [EMAIL_2105].  You can remove the box around the text.  
Several studies have tested whethe r HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one 
study, people who got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV 
than people who did not get the vaccine. In studies with a different vaccine, some 
people who got the vaccine had a higher  risk of getting HIV than people who did 
not get the vaccine.  
This study differs from the studies in which people who got the vaccine had a 
higher or lower risk of getting HIV. We can tell you about the differences.  
We do not know whether the vaccines  in this study will affect your risk of getting 
HIV from another p erson. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. These  study vaccines are  experimental.  
The study vaccines are  protein vaccines called Stable C H505TF gp120 and 
Transient CH505TF gp120. From here on, we will call them  gp120S and gp120T 
study vaccines . They are  experimental HIV vaccines . That means we do not 
know if the vaccines  will be safe to use in people, or if they will work to prevent 
HIV inf ection. These vaccines are  used only in research studies.  
For both vaccines, first DNA is used in a lab to tell cells how to make the protein. 
The gp120S  vaccine was made by [CONTACT_115637] 
a part of the DNA of the cell. For th e gp120T  vaccine, the DNA that makes the 
protein was put into the cells, but did not become a part of the cell’s DNA. In both 
cases, after the protein is made, it is separated from the cells and purified into a 
vaccine.  
The vaccines were developed by [CONTACT_941] D ivision of AIDS (DAIDS) at the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). The vaccines have man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_115549]. Your body’s immune system might 
learn to recognize these proteins and prepare itself to fight HIV. This is called an 
immune response.  
The vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance added to the 
vaccine to  help the immune system respond better. The adjuvant in this study is 
called GLA -SE. GLA -SE was made by [CONTACT_115638] 
(Seattle, Washington, [LOCATION_003] ). 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018

not cause d serious health problems .  
General risks o f vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activit ies after getting a vaccine. Rarely, people have side effects that limit their 
normal activities or make them go to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vaccine causes an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system  attacks your own body, instead of attacking an infection.  
Risks of the study vaccines : 
This section lists the side effects we know about. There may be others that we 
don’t yet know about, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn about any 
new side eff ects. 
The gp120S vaccine with the GLA -SE adjuvant has been given to a small number 
of people in a study  that is still going on . The most common complaints have been  
pain or tenderness where they got the injection . One person had a skin infection 
where they  got the injection . It did not affect that person’s daily routine. That 
person took some medicine and it got better within [ADDRESS_129097] common complaints were pain and tenderness where 
they got the injection and feeling tired.

• Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
• Looking in your mouth and throat  
• Listening to your heart and lungs  
• Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of 
your health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We 
will also test you for: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and syphilis . We will ask you about 
medications you are taking. We will ask you about behaviors that might put you 
at risk for gett ing HIV. If you were assigned  female  sex at birth , we will test you 
for pregnancy.  
We will review the screening results with you. The screening results may show 
you are not eligible to join the study, even if you want to.

Being in the study  
If you meet the study requirements and want to join, here is what will happen:  
9. You will come to the clinic for scheduled visits about [#] times over 
[Insert period of time] . 
Site: Insert number of visits and range of visit lengths. (There is site -specific variation 
in screening protocols and in the number of possible follow -up visits between 
protocol -mandated visits.)  
Visits can last from [#] to [#] hours.  
You may have to come for more visits if you have a lab or health issue.  
We may contact [CONTACT_106992] (for example, to tell you about the 
study results).  
10. We will give you [Site: Insert compensa tion]  for each study visit you 
complete.  
This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text]

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129102].  
13. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
• Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV  
• Do physical exams  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 104 of 131 • Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned  female  sex at birth  
• Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking  
• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on th e lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 10 mL and 275 mL ( 2 teaspoon s to a little over  1 
cup). Your body will make new blood to replace the blood we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix D , Table of procedures (for informed consent form) in this 
section or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. 
You are not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. We will  counsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low.  
15. The HVTN will test your samples t o see how your immune system responds 
to the study products.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_106952], which are located in the [LOCATION_002]. In rare cases, some of your 
samples may be sent to labs approved  by [CONTACT_115639].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The d ifferences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129103](s) .  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.  
Site: Delete next section if using separate consent for use of samples and information 
in other studies  
16. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN cal ls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask . 
Do I have to agree? No. You are free  to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.   
Where are the samples store d? Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site:  Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or you r doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 1 2, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 106 of 131 Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and  
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan i s approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, so me information that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We 
may share information about the study product you received and how your body 
responded to the study product.  
What kind o f studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from you r samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them .  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researche rs 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it , but your name [CONTACT_107004] . 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small.  There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra sa mples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 109 of 131 18. We may stop your injections or take you out of the study at any time. We 
may do this even if you want to stay in the study and even if you were 
scheduled for more injections.  
This may happen if:  
• you do not follow instructions,  
• we think that staying in the study might harm you,  
• you enroll in a different research study where you get another study product, 
or 
• the study  is stopped for any reason.  
If we stop your injections, we may ask you to stay in the study to complete other 
study procedures.  
19. We will stop your injections if you become pregnant.  
We will encourage you to stay in the study if you choose. We will discuss your 
study options with you.  
If you leave the study while you are still pregnant, we will contact [CONTACT_106956].  
20. If you get infected with HIV during the study, we will stop your injections, 
take fewer samples, and help you get care and support.  
We will encourage you to stay in the study for up to 6 months if you choose. We 
will discuss your study options with you. We will counsel you about your HIV 
infection and about telling your partner(s).  We will tell you where you can get 
support and medical care.  Site: Modify the following sentence as appropriate.  We 
will not provide or pay for any of your HIV care directly.  
Other Risks  
21. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describe s the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 110 of 131 or infection wh ere you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimina tion because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time  away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause the 
body to make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make 
antibodies to HIV because you re ceived HIV study vaccines . The study vaccines 
may cause you to test positive on some types of HIV antibody tests, even if you 
are not infected with HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). 
VISP means that after you get the study vaccines , a routine HIV test done outside 
this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result  that is caused by [CONTACT_106983] . 
If you have a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_115640], we can 
arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will  test positive due to the study  vaccines . If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: M odify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you are 
infected with HIV even if you are not, you could face discrimination and other 
problems. For example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental 
care, employment, insura nce, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do have a 
positive HIV antibody test caused by [CONTACT_106985] , you will not be able to 
donate blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We 
will give you a brochure that tells you  more about testing HIV positive because of 
an HIV vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happen s with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away over time. For most babies antibodies from 
the mother last for about six months.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page [ADDRESS_129104] VISP, we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is 
needed . 
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test r esults show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk  
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal informati on if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost  impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
US sites, include the following paragraph  In the very unlikely event that your 
genetic information b ecomes linked to your name, a federal law called the 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect you.  GINA 
keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of genetic 
testing when deciding about giving you health insura nce or offering you work. 
GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_115641], disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccines  will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of  becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we 
do not know how the study [vaccine(s)]  might affect your HIV infection or how 
long it takes to develop AIDS.

about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccines  later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
23. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give  you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
24. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let us 
know.   
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples . We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from being in the study. We 
believe these ste ps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.

conditions are met.   
The HVTN has limited funds to p ay medical costs that it determines are 
reasonable.  (Sites: insert locale - appropriate medical insurance language in the

to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study rel ated.

• Any other contraceptive method approved by [CONTACT_41314].  
You do not have to use birth control if:  
• You are only having sex with a partner or partners who have had a vasectomy. 
(We will ask you some questions to confirm that the vasectomy was 
successful.);  
• You have reached menopause, with no menstrual periods for one year;  
• You have had a hysterectomy (your uterus removed);  
• You have had your ovaries removed;  
• You have a tubal ligation (your “tubes tied”) or confirmed successful 
placement of a product that blocks the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134];  
• You are having sex only with a partner (s) assigned female sex at birth ; 
• You only have oral sex; or,  
• You are sexually abstinent (no sex at all).  
Remember: If you are having sex, male and female condoms  are the only birth 
control methods that also provide protection against  HIV and other sexually 
transmitted infections . 
If you join the study, we will test  you for pregnancy at some visits, including 
before each study injection .

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 118 of 131 Appendix C  Sample consent form for use of samples and 
information in other studies  
Title: A phase 1 double -blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial in healthy, 
HIV-1–uninfected adult participants to compare the safety , tolerability  and 
immunogenicity of CH505TF gp120 produced from stably transfected cells to 
CH505TF gp120 produced from transiently transfected cells  
HVTN protocol number: HVTN 123  
Site: [Insert site name]  
When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use them 
in other studies and share them with other researchers. The HVTN calls these 
samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your extra samples to be 
used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end 
of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affect your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repo sitory. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with 
you. The researcher is not  likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being 
done for research purposes.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 119 of 131 6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with HVTN or other researchers. 
Once we share your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them 
back.  
7. How do other  researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board 
(IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs 
protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’ s location.  
8. What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_115652]. However, some information that we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, 
and HIV status.  We may share information about the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and  other 
diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them . 
If you agree, your samples could al so be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researche rs may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it , but your name [CONTACT_107004] . 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it t o you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk  of this is very small.  There may be other unknown risks.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 120 of 131 10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but t he genetic test s done on your samples  could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimin ation or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.   
US sites, include the following paragraph  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testin g when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term care insurance.   
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra  samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your  extra  
samples and information  
• Any regulatory agency that r eviews clinical trials,  
• The researcher’s IRB or EC 
• The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name [CONTACT_107005].

12. If you have questions or problems about allowing your samples and 
information to be used in other studies, use the following important contacts.

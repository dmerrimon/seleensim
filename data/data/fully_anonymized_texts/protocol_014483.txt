 Additional system componen ts 
• Patient’s own  smart device.  
BlueSync™ offers app -based remote monitoring via the patient ’s own 
smart device .  
The Azure ™ Smart P acemaker includes a Bluetooth Low Energy chip 
that allows wireless communication between the pacemaker and the 
patient ’s smart device .  
The patient ’s smart device with BlueSync™ acts as a hub and transmits 
the data to the remote monitoring network.  
Primary Objective  To assess the CareLink compliance to scheduled transmission , the 
primary objective is to characterize  the proportion of the CareLink 
quarterly scheduled transmissions that  are completed at specified 
intervals  during the 12-month  follow -up period after the baseline visit  in 
the CareLink Database via BlueSync™. 
Sample Size  Approximately 700 patient s may complete the screening questionnaire. 
It is expected that 60%  (420) of the screened patient s will use smart 
technology and 60% ( 252) of the  screened patient s that use smart 
technology will meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and may be enrolled 
in the evaluation. 
 
Assuming attrition from enrollment through 12-month  follow -up is 
7%, a total of 252 enrolled patient s would result in  approximately 
234 patient s available to assess the primary endpoint.   
 
A sample size of 2 34 evaluable patient s will produce a two -sided 95% 
confidence interval width of approximately  10%. 
 The evaluation  is expected to be conducted at approximately 20 
evaluation sites, 10 in Europe and 10 in the [LOCATION_002] . Up to 
approximately  35 patient s will participate from each evaluation site .  
Clinicians will screen sequential patient s who are indicated for implant 
with a pacemaker or CRT -P device.  Patients who will be/ have been 
implanted with Azure ™ pacemaker  or Percepta ™, Serena ™, Solara ™ 
CRT-P device  will be invited to participate in the evaluation  if the 
specified selection criteria are met . Patients will complete  a visit at the 
enrollment/baseline which is standard of care. Additionally patient s will 
complete a survey during the enrollment/ba seline visit , and once during 
the 12 month follow -up after the baseline visit which is designed to 
measure patient  engagement.  
Duration  The expected evaluation duration is approximately 16 months : Four 
months for enrollment of all patient s and [ADDRESS_488040] 12 
months from enrollment to 12-months  follow -up after the baseline visit .

5. Introduction   
5.1. Background  
Modern cardiac disease management seeks to integrate multiple device technologies  and capabilities to 
optimize disease management and health outcomes. The BlueSync™ Smart Monitoring System  utilizes a 
Bluetoot h enabled smart device  application to interface with the Azure™ Smart pacemaker to provide 
wireless remote monitoring for patient s. 
The use of smart device  technology allows for the integrated monitoring by a smart device  and eliminates 
the “bedside monitor”. The informative and reassuring app allows the patient  to view the status of 
CareLink trans mission, physical activity and provides  access to educational information which creates a 
completely new experience for the patient.  
Since Medtronic has  never launched a product that relies on patient s utilizing their own smart device  
instead of  a home monitor, BlueSync™ will be evaluated for compliance, patient  perceived  benefit , and 
value to the clinic using the technology as well as for identify ing workflow issues in th is new paradigm . 
 
Value of Remote Monitoring for pacemaker patient s  
The [ADDRESS_488044] of care with alert- driven in -person evaluation (IPE) replacing most routine 
office interrogations.  
Early detection of arrhythmias, lead issues and battery Recommended Replacement Time (RRT) may lead 
to important clinical actions for pacemaker patient s. Pacemaker patient s have a high risk of AF. AF is a 
known risk factor for stroke.  There is an opportunity to better manage AF leveraging the pacemaker 
capabilities1.  
In large studies, rem ote monitoring of pacemaker patient s is associated with:  
• Increased survival: Patients with high Remote Monitoring (RM) adherence had 53% greater 
survival than low RM and 140% greater survival than no RM2 
• 26% faster diagnosis of clinical actionable events ( PREFER)3 
• 66% fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389390] (COMPAS)4 
• 56% fewer ambulatory visits (COMPAS)4 
 Page 15 of 38

 • Lower health care expenditures in office visits among patient s with permanent pacemakers          
( PPMs )[ADDRESS_488045] and evaluate information related to CareLink transmission 
compliance as well as patient  perceived benefit of BlueSync ™ and clinical perception of value of 
BlueSync™ and satisfaction with BlueSync ™. Collection of this data will prov ide data to support 
development of clinical evidence  that will be used to aid in market adopt ion. To assess the CareLink 
transmission compliance (adherence to scheduled transmission), the primary endpoint will measure the 
proportion of the CareLink quarterly scheduled transmissions that are completed within a prescribed time 
period. The field evaluation will also assess adoption to remote monitoring, patient  perceived benefit of 
BlueSync™  (how patient s interact with the MyCareLink Heart application ) and clinic perception of value of 
BlueSync™ and satisfaction with BlueSync™ ( benefits experienced by [CONTACT_389399] ™). 
Interim analyses will take place after 2- months of follow up for all enrolled patient s. Enrollment and/or 
follow -up will not be  stopped due to the interim analyses . 
The expected evaluation duration is 16  months ; four months  for enrollment and twelve  months  to 
complete follow -up. The  duration of individual patient  participation will be 12  months  from enrollment 
date.  
6. Objective s and Endpoints  
6.1. Objectives  
6.1.1.  Primary Objective  
To assess chronic CareLink transmission compliance (adherence to scheduled transmission), the primary 
objective is to characterize  the proportion of the CareLink quarterly scheduled transmissions that are 
completed within  the prescribed window  during the 12-month  follow -up after the baseline visit  in the 
CareLink Database via the MyCareLink Heart ™ app  
• Four scheduled transmissions must occur quarterly 1 each starting at month 3 of follow up (one 
scheduled at month 3, another scheduled at month 6, the next scheduled at month [ADDRESS_488046] 
one scheduled at month 12).  
6.1.2.  Secondary  Objective  
To assess acute  (1st two months) CareLink transmission compliance (adherence to scheduled 
transmission), the secondary  objective is to characterize  the proportion of the CareLink monthly 
scheduled transmissions that are completed within  the prescribed window  during the2- month follow -up 
after the baseline visit in the CareLink Database via the MyCareLink Heart ™ app 
• Two monthly s cheduled transmissions must occur in the first 2 months of follow up (one 
scheduled transmission at month 1 and the second transmission at month 2).

6.1.4.  Additional Analysis  
Analytics data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_389400] ™ Systems Engineer and will not be part  of the 
objectives for the evaluation. 
6.2. Endpoints 
6.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
Proportion of CareLink quarterly scheduled transmissions that  are completed within prescribed window 
during the 12-month  follow -up after the baseline visit  in the Carelink Database using BlueSync™.  
Rationale for endpoint selection:  The primary endpoint will use the proportion of CareLink quarterly 
scheduled transmissions that  are completed within prescribed window  during the 12-month  follow -up 
after the baseline visit  in the CareLink Database via BlueSync™  to assess compliance with scheduled 
transmissions. 
Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic device s (CIEDs) has been shown to be cost effective, 
convenient and as sociated with reduced mortality2. Patient compliance  with monitoring  is another 
important  criterion which is important to clinicians.  By [CONTACT_389401] t ime, the evaluation will support the primary benefits of BlueSync ™ which are:  
• Seamless remote monitoring via a patient ’s smart device, even outside the home, leads to 
increased adherence/compliance with monitoring  
• Patient access to select information and automatic transmissions reduce workload and calls to the 
clinic

 7. Evaluation  Design   
The BlueSync™  Field Evaluation  will be a multi- center, prospective, single- arm, post -market field 
evaluation . All patient s will be implanted with a ny Medtronic market -released pacemaker  or CRT -P device  
that is compatible w ith BlueSync ( Table 2). It is recommended to use Medtronic RA, RV and LV leads that 
are compatible with the pacemaker and CRT -P devices used in the evaluation.  
The purpose of this field evaluation is to collect and evaluate information related to CareLink transmission 
compliance as well as adoption of  remote monitoring, patient  perceived benefit of BlueSync™ and clinical 
perception of value of BlueSync™ and satisfaction with BlueSync™ . 
Approximately 700 patient s may be screened and complete the screening questionnaire. It is expected 
that 60% ( 420) of the screened patient s will use smart technology and 60% (2 52) of the screened 
patient s that use smart technology will meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and may b e enrolled in the 
evaluation. 
Assuming attrition from enrollment through 12 month of follow -up is 7%, a total of [ADDRESS_488047] Azure ™, or Percepta ™, 
Serena ™, Solara ™ CRT -P device  implanted and compatible with BlueSync and MyCareLink Heart app 
downloaded onto the patient ’s smart device and patient s been followed for 12-month  with a total of  
six scheduled transmission s to occur from outside of the clinic . 
The evaluation  is expected to be conducted at approximately  [ADDRESS_488048] twelve months for the  patient  follow -up. Patients are anticipated to be in the 
evaluation for approximately 12 months . Patients will complete a baseline visit and then complete 
participation in the evaluation after the 12 months  follow -up period . Patients will not be replaced with 
newly enrolled patient s upon completion of participation in the evaluation. As described in Section 12.1.6, 
the sample size accounts for attrition.  
7.2. Rationale  
Medtronic has developed the BlueSync ™ feature which is a cardiac monitoring system that is secure, 
reliable, provides select inf ormation to patient s about their pacemaker  or CRT -P device  and uses only the 
patient ’s smart device  to monitor the patient  remotely.  BlueSync™ connects the Azure ™ Pacemaker or  
Percepta ™, Serena ™, Solara ™ CRT -P device via low energy to the patient ’s smart device and the 
CareLink network.  BlueSync™ allows for automatic  transmission of device data  through the use of 
Bluetooth technology. The patient  only needs to keep their smart device within one meter of their 
implanted device.   
This evaluation provides an opportunity to confirm that BlueSync™ will improve patient  compliance to 
scheduled transmission as recorded in the CareLink Network . See Section  5.2 for further background 
information and evaluation of collected data. See Section 12 for further background on the e valuation 
design.

 Page 29 of 38 
 BlueSync ™ Field  
VERSON 1.0  Evaluation Plan   
04 APRIL 2017  Medtronic Confidential  
 documentation of risk will be performed by [CONTACT_093].  
11.2.  Potential Benefits  
BlueSync™ may offer no benefit. The information gained from this evaluation could result in the 
improved management of other patient s with bradycardia and heart failure conditions.  Additionally, 
information collected from this evaluation may assist in the design of new product(s)/ therapy ( ies) and/or 
instructions for use.  
11.3.  Risk-Benefit Rationale  
The risk -benefit analysis has shown that there are no major  or minor  additional risks associated with the 
BlueSync™ feature .  
11.4.  Reporting of Adverse Events  
The collection of adverse event and patient  death data is not required to meet the objective(s) of this 
evaluation . The products used in the evaluation are market approved and used within the current 
indications for use as indicated in the product labeling; however, it is the responsibility of the Investigator 
to abide by [CONTACT_389412]’s IRB. User (Investigator) 
reporting of events to regulatory authorities related to market approved product may be required. Refer to local regulations for reporting r equirements.  
11.5.  Patient  Death  
Evaluation of patient  death data is not required to meet the objective(s) of this evaluation . Patient death 
information may only be reported as a reason for ending participation in the evaluation if it were to 
occur.  Investigator reporting of events to regulatory authorities related to market approved product may 
be required. Refer to local regulations for reporting requirements.  
11.6.  Product Complaint Reporting  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to report all product complaint(s) associated with a medical 
device distributed by [CONTACT_13735], regardless whether they are related to intended use, misuse or abuse of 
the product. Reporting must be done immediately and via the regular channels for market -released 
products.  
12. Statistical  Design and Methods  
 Medtronic employees or designees will perform  all statistical analyses. Additionally, a separate  Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed to further describe statistical methods, pre -specified data handling 
rules, and pre -specified analyses that will be included in the clinical  evaluation  report. Any change to the 
data analysis methods described in the field evaluation plan  will require an amendment only if it changes 
a principal feature of the field evaluation plan. Any other change to the data analysis methods described 
in the field evaluation plan , and the justification for making the change, will be described in the 
evaluation report. Additional exploratory analyses of the dat a may be conducted as deemed appropriate. 
Missing data will not contribute to the objectives unless specified otherwise within the analysis methods.

 BlueSync ™ Field  
VERSON 1.[ADDRESS_488060] been enrolled  and at the time their 2  month follow up is reached. 
Enrollment and/or follow -up will not be stopped d ue to the interim analyses.  
12.1.  Primary Objective  
To assess chronic CareLink transmission compliance (adherence to scheduled transmission), the primary 
objective is to characterize  the proportion of the CareLink  quarterly  scheduled transmissions that are 
completed within prescribed window during the 12-month  follow -up in the CareLink Database via the 
MyCareLink Heart ™ app. 
12.1.1.  Hypothesis  
There are no pre -specified hypotheses for this objective.  
12.1.2.  Performance Requirements  
There are no pre -specifi ed performance criteria for the analysis.  
12.1.3.  Endpoint Definition  
Scheduled transmissions are transmissions scheduled by a physician  and documented in the CareLink 
Database.  
Four quarterly  transmissions will be scheduled by [CONTACT_389413] c. Four scheduled transmissions must occur 
quarterly 1 each starting at month 3 of follow up (one scheduled at month 3, another scheduled at 
month 6, the next scheduled at month [ADDRESS_488061] one scheduled at month 12) .   
Scheduled transmissions are expected to be completed within prescribed window in the CareLink 
Database via the CareLink Heart ™ app during the 12-month  follow -up. The p roportion of the CareLink 
scheduled transmissions that  are completed within prescribed window  during the 12-month  follow -up in 
the CareLink Database via the BlueSync ™ is the endpoint of interest.  
12.1.4.  Analysis Methods  
For the calculation of the proportion of scheduled transmissions completed ,  
• Completed scheduled transmission  will be included in  this calculation .  
• For scheduled transmission s that were not completed , only patient s who died on or before  the 
schedule date of their scheduled transmission will be excluded in th is calculation. 
A two -sided 95% confidence interval based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) for binomial 
distribution will be calculated for this proportion . 
12.1.5.  Determination of Patient s/Data for Analysis  
Quarterly s cheduled transmission will be used for analysis. For scheduled transmissions that were  not 
completed, only patient s who died on or before  the schedule date of their scheduled transmission will be 
excluded from the analysis . 
 Page 31 of 38 
 BlueSync ™ Field  
VERSON 1.0  Evaluation Plan   
04 APRIL 2017  Medtronic Confidential  
 12.1.6.  Sample Size  
Approximately 700 patient s may consent to be screened and complete the screening questionnaire. It is 
expected that 60% (420) of the screened patient s will use smart technology and 60% (252) of the 
screened patient s that use smart technology will meet the inclusion/exclusion crite ria and may be 
enrolled in the evaluation. 
 
Assuming attrition from enrollment through 12-month  follow -up is 7%, a total of 252 enrolled 
patient s would result in  approximately 234 patient s available to assess the primary endpoint.   
 
A sample size of 234  evaluable patient s will produce a two -sided 95% confidence interval width of 
approximately  10%. 
12.2.  Secondary  Objective   
To assess acute  CareLink transmission compliance (adherence to scheduled transmission), the secondary 
objective is to characterize  the proportion of the CareLink  monthly  scheduled transmissions that are 
completed within prescribed window during the first 2- month of follow -up in the CareLink Database via 
the My CareLink Heart  App™ . 
12.2.1.  Hypothesis  
There are no pre -specified hypotheses fo r this objective.  
12.2.2.  Performance Requirements  
There are no pre -specifi ed performance criteria for the analysis.  
12.2.3.  Endpoint Definition  
Scheduled transmissions are transmissions scheduled by a physician  and documented in the CareLink 
Database.  
Two monthly s cheduled transmissions must occur in the first 2 months of follow up (one scheduled 
transmission at month 1 and the second transmission at month 2) .   
Scheduled transmissions are expected to be completed within prescribed window in the CareLink 
Database vi a the CareLink Heart ™ app during the  first 2- month  follow -up. The p roportion of the CareLink 
monthly scheduled transmissions that  are completed within prescribed window  during the 2-month  
follow -up in the CareLink Database via the BlueSync™ is the endpoint  of interest.  
12.2.4.  Analysis Methods  
For the calculation of the proportion of scheduled transmissions completed ,  
• Completed scheduled transmission will be included in th is calculation.  
• For scheduled transmissions that were not completed, only patient s who died  on or before  the 
schedule date of their scheduled transmission will be excluded in th is calculation. 
A two -sided 95% confidence interval based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) for binomial 
distribution will be calculated for this proportion .

Medtronic may form the BlueSync™ Targeted Launch Evaluation  Publication Committee from evaluation 
investigators. Medtronic personnel may serve as members  of the committee.  This committee will manage 
evaluation publications with the goal of publishing findings from the data.  The Publication Committee will 
develop the final Publication Plan as a separate document.  
The Publication Committee’s role is to:  
• manage elements addressed in the publication plan as outlined in this appendix

 • develop the final Publication Plan under separate cover 
• execute the Publication Plan  
• oversee the publication of primary, secondary and ancillary evaluation results 
• review and prioritize publication proposals provide input on publication content  determine 
authorship  
In addition, the committee will apply and reinforce the authorship guidelines set forth in the Publication 
Plan. Membership in the Publication Committee does not guarantee authorsh ip. The committee will meet 
at least yearly, as needed . 
13.8.  Management of Primary, Secondary and Ancillary Publications  
The Publication Committee reviews, prioritizes, and manages all publications including primary, secondary 
and ancillary publications. Primary and secondary publications are those that address analyses of any or all primary objectives or secondary objectives, respectively, as specified in the Field Evaluation Plan .  
An ancillary publication is any publication that does not address the evaluation objectives identified in the 
Field Evaluation Plan . They include publications proposed and developed by [CONTACT_389414], clinicians participating in this clinical evaluation , and clinicians not participating in this clinical 
evaluation . The committee will work with Medtronic to ensure that requests do not present conflicts with 
other proposals, are not duplicative, and to determine which ancillary publication proposals, if any, will be supported.  
The committee may  decide that no publications, including abstracts, will be published prior to the end of 
the evaluation or with individual center data. Requests for publications on evaluation  objectives utilizing 
subset data (e.g., regional) will be evaluated for scientific validity and the ability of Medtronic to provide 
resources.  
13.9.  Criteria for Determining Authorship  
Publications will adhere to authorship criteria defined by [CONTACT_4717] (ICMJE, Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals, www.icmje.org).  
Individual authorship criteria defined by [CONTACT_389415].  
Authors, including Medtronic personnel, must at a minimum meet al l of the conditions below:  
• Substantial contribution to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data  
• Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content  
• Final approval of the version to be published  
• Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved  
Decisions regarding authorship and contributor -ship will be made by [CONTACT_942]. The selected authors 
will be responsible for drafting the publication. All selected authors must fulfill the authorship conditions 
stated above to be listed as authors, and all contributors who fulfill the conditions must be listed as authors.  
All investigators not listed as co -authors will be acknowledged as the “Medtronic BlueSync™ Field 
Evaluation  Investigators” and will be individually listed according to the guidelines of the applicable

 scientific journal when possible and affiliation. Any other contributors will be acknowledged by [CONTACT_389416].  
13.10.  Transparency  
Transparency of evaluation  results will be maintained by [CONTACT_54465]:  
• A final report, describing the results of all objectives and analysis, will be distributed to all investigators. 
• Registering and posting the evaluation results on ClinicalTrials.gov based on the posting rules 
stipulated  
• Submitting for publication the prima ry evaluation results after the evaluation ends  
• Disclosing conflicts of interest (e.g., financial) of the co -authors of publications according to the 
Policies set forth by [CONTACT_54466]  
• Making an individual centers evaluation data accessible to the corresponding investigator after 
the completion of the evaluation , if requested

5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
Women with PCOS suffer from excess male hormone (androgen) production by [CONTACT_72115]. Androgen is made 
by [CONTACT_725128]. As the follicles (and eggs) grow and mature, there are more 
androgen producing cells. Women with PCOS have more follicles than normal women  and therefore more 
androgen producing cells . While androgen production has  been associated with the number of follicles, the 
relationship to the individual size of follicles in PCOS or normal women.  This study intends to determine 
whether the size and number of ovarian follicles are correlated to androgen production in PCOS and norm al 
women.      
 
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Specific Aim:  To determine the relationship between ovarian follicle size and ovarian androgen production in 
women with PCOS and normal women  
Hypothesis: In PCOS excess androgen production is positively correlated to ova rian follicle size  
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
In women with polycystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS) , the major abnormality is excessive ovarian androgen 
production marked by [CONTACT_725129] (T) and androstenedione (A) levels. Studies to deter mine 
the alteration in ovarian steroidogenesis that lead to abnormal production of ovarian androgens have revealed 
increased CYP17 gene expression with accentuated 17 -hydroxylase activity leading to exaggerated 17 -
hydroxyprogesterone (17P) responses to LH stimulation. In contrast, T and A responses did not distinguish 
between PCOS and normal women, although these androgens were clearly greater in the former compared to 
the latter group.  As a result, 17P responsiveness has been employed to determine the fun ctional capacity of the 
ovary to produce androgen.  Stimulatory agents have included GnRH agonist, Lupron, at a dose of [ADDRESS_989675] by [CONTACT_725130]. Extending these 
studies , we selecte d the mid -maximal dose of hCG to stimulate ovarian androgens and included morphometric 
measures of the ovary, such as ovarian follicle number (as determined by [CONTACT_2207]) and related hormones, 
such as anti -mullerian hormone and inhibin B, both products of  the ovarian follicle . The results showed that 
increased androgen and 17P responses in PCOS women were associated with increased antral follicle number 
and greater AMH levels compared to normal women. Inhibin B levels were similar between groups.

PCOS)  and those that did exceed the normal response (high r esponder PCOS; HR -PCOS) . This separation 
occurred at a rate of 50%. Notably, serum AMH levels were [ADDRESS_989677] shown that approximately 50% o f PCOS women will exhibit 17OHP responses 
to hCG  stimulation similar to those of normal women. Consequently, a sample size of 20 subjects in each group 
has an 80% power to detect a difference in the means of 0.820 ng/ml (the difference between the average 
17OHP expression level in high responder PCOS women (HR -PCOS), 2.840 ng/ml, and that of normal 
responder PCOS (NR -PCOS) women, 2.02 ng/ml), which is a 33% increase. In the proposed study, we believe 
that HR -PCOS (n=20) will show significantly greater (33% more) 17OHP production in response to hCG 
stimulation than NR -PCOS (n=20) at a power of 0.[ADDRESS_989678] drop out.  A secondary analysis will be performed between women with  
PCOS and normal controls (n=20).  
 
8. PROGRESS REPORT  
See item [ADDRESS_989679], thyroid studies, a fasti ng chemistry panel, 
and a hemoglobin.  If the hemoglobin is less than 11 gm/dL, the subject  will be given ferrous sulfate pi[INVESTIGATOR_725125] 11 gm/dL.  
 
Protocol  
1. Subjects will have a urine pregnancy test at UCSD/Reproductive Partners Medical Group.  Images of the 
both ovaries will be obtained using vaginal ultrasound  and the number, size, and spatial arrangement of 
ovarian follicles will be noted for both ovaries in each subject.  The ultrasound will be  complet ed for each 
subject according to schedule availability and each subject shall maintain normal activity before and after 
the imaging study.   
2. Normal subjects will be admitted to the CTRI  during the mid follicular phase (Days 5 -9) while PCOS     
      women will be anovulatory and will not have a cycle day parameter.  A urine pregnancy test will be  
      done on admission.  
3. On study day one, recombinant -hCG (r -hCG) will be administered intravenously at a dose of 25

4. Blood samples will be obtained a t T = -0.5, 0, and +[ADDRESS_989680] (OGTT). Each subject will ingest 75 gm of a glu cose solution and blood samples will be 
obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after the glucose load.  
8. Subjects will be advised to follow a 150gram carbohydrate diet for 3 days prior to OGTT  
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
A group of 40 women with PCOS and 20 normal  women ages 18 -37 will be studied.   
 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Women with hemoglobin less than 11 gm/dl at screening evaluation  
2. Women with untreated thyroid abnormalities  
3. Pregnant women or women who are nursing  
4. Women with BMI > 37  
5. Women with known se nsitivity to the agents being used  
6. Women with diabetes, or renal, liver, or heart disease.  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Subjects will be determined to have PCOS based on clinical history of irregular menses and clinical or 
laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.  
2. Subjects should not have been on any hormonal therapy or metformin for at least [ADDRESS_989681] a clinical history of regular periods  
 
11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
Individuals from UCSD Reproductive Medicine Clinics, Community advertisement, or social media (Craig’s 
list, etc)  will be asked whether they would be interested in participating in a research study by a reproductive 
endocrinology faculty or fellow. A brief description of the study will be made.  If the patient is interested, then 
the study will be thoroughly explained to the patient by [CONTACT_725131] a subsequent 
time. This will be done over the phone or by [CONTACT_725132]. The patient will be given a 
consent form to take home and read. A few days later, th e patient will be contact[CONTACT_725133]. At the start of the 
study , the patient will bring a signed consent to the CTRI or sign the consent at the CTRI . This process will 
allow the patient several opportunities to withdraw if they decide not participate in t he study and minimize any 
element of coercion.  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Participation will be completely voluntary. The purpose of the study will be thoroughly explained to all 
subjects.   The information being communicated to the participant during the con sent process will include any 
exculpatory language through which the participant is made to waive or appear to waive any of the participant’s 
legal rights or release or appear to release the Researcher or the University or its agents from liability for 
negligence.  A Human Subject Protection Program approved written consent and HIPAA form will be obtained 
prior to study commencement .  See attached.

N/A 
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
Hematological:    
Blood drawing may caus e minor discomfort and potentially a slight bruise.   There is a minimal chance of 
infection.   Serum hemoglobin will be checked on all subjects prior to sampling and individuals with 
hemoglobin < 11 gm/dl will not be studied.   We estimate approximately 38 cc blood loss per patient study .  
 
Pharmacologic:    
hCG:  Ovarian theca cells are primarily stimulated by [CONTACT_725134][INVESTIGATOR_573601].  The bioactive beta -
subunit of recombinant hCG is identical to LH and is used as a surrogate.  Pharmodynamic studies  have shown 
that following iv administration, beta hCG rises acutely and follows a biphasic exponential disappearance curve 
similar to other gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115].  Subcutaneous hCG may be associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, 
headache, confusion, diz ziness, irritability, restlessness, depression, fatigue, fluid retention, breast tenderness, 
and swelling or irritation at the injection site.  IV administration has only been associated with headache and no 
immunogenicity.  We have employed this drug for s everal years in numerous individuals and not observed any 
side effects from the drug.  
  
Transvaginal ultrasound may be associated with mild crampi[INVESTIGATOR_725126].   
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF R ESOURCES  
Qualified GCRC nurses using sterile technique will perform placement of indwelling catheters.   To assess the 
hematologic status of the subjects, we will measure hemoglobin at the beginning of the study.   A hemoglobin of 
11 gm/dL will be the minim um allowed.   If the hemoglobin is less than 11 gm/dL, subjects will be given 
ferrous gluconate pi[INVESTIGATOR_725127] 11 gm/dL.  
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Each patient will be assigned a study number. None of the study documents will contain the patient’s name [CONTACT_518101].  In order to protect the patient’s identity and protected information, the 
investigators will keep the list of subje cts and study numbers in a locked and protected area in our research 
office. Access will be restricted to the PI.   
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There will be no direct benefit to the subject by [CONTACT_50568] . In addition, you will not be provid ed 
with any results or information regarding your DNA test.  However, this study may further clarify  the 
mechanisms of excess androgen production in PCOS and may help us  better understand the disorder . In the 
future this study may lead to improved strategie s to suppress androgen production.   
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
While the control group has no direct benefit from this protocol, the information gained from their participation 
will provide important knowledge about PCOS.   Also, the dose of medication to b e is minimal and we expect 
minimal if any risk to the control group . Furthermore, there is minimal risk with transvaginal ultrasound and we 
do not expect any complications with this imaging modality.  Therefore, in view of the potential reproductive 
benefi ts and lack of significant identified risks associated with this study, the risk/benefit ratio favors 
performing the study.   
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT

Page 5 There will be no out -of-pocket expense to the subjects other than donation of time and possibly loss o f wages 
from work on the day of study.  Study drug provision and laboratory testing will be done free of charge to the 
subjects.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
Subjects undergoing ultrasound will be paid a total of $50 for their participation.  Subje cts undergoing hCG 
stimulation and blood sampling will be paid a total of $1 00 for their participation.  Subjects undergoing OGTT 
and blood sampling will be paid a total of $100 for their participation.

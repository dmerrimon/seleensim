Specific Aims  
 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life -threatening genetic disease, 
affecting 1 in 400 to 1000 individuals1.  The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_857851] -filled renal cysts that result in ultimate loss of kidney function  in the majority of individuals2.  .  
An increase in total kidney volume (TKV)  precedes the decline in kidney function, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_857826] 4th decade of life in patients with ADPKD, thus rate of TKV growth, as measured by [CONTACT_171479] c 
resonance imaging (MRI)  is an important indicator of kidney disease progression early in the course of 
ADPKD3.  Interventions that may slow progression of ADPKD are of considerable clinical impo rtance .   
 
Similar to the general population, the prevalence of overweight/obesity ha s been rising in ADPKD patients4, 
affecting about two -thirds of individuals5,6.  While obesity is known to be an independent predictor of incident 
chronic kidney disease in the general pop ulation7, the role of obesity in ADPKD progression is surprisingly 
unknown .  We have novel preliminary data that overweight/obesity is associated with substantially faster 
kidney growth in adults with ADPKD, independent of baseline kidney size and other risk factors.   
 
Additionally, recent work in multiple rodent models of ADPKD has shown that mild -to-moderate food restriction 
profoundly slows cyst growth and maintains renal function via mechanisms including activation of the AMP -
activated kinase (AMPK) pathway, suppress ion of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) -S6 kinase (S6K) 
signaling and insulin -like growth factor -1 (IGF -1) levels, and reversal of ADPKD -associated increased 
expression of hexokinase 2, the rate limiting step in glycolysis8,9.  Consistent with these findings, recent 
evidence indicates that in ADPKD metabolic reprogramm ing favors enhanced aerobic glycolysis promoting 
proliferation, which is dependent upon inhibition of the AMPK axis and activation of mTOR signaling10-12.     
 
Collectively, these data suggest that dietary restriction regimens may slow ADPKD p rogression.  The current 
standard of care dietary approach for the treatment of obesity is daily caloric restriction (DCR).  An alternate 
approach to traditional DCR is intermittent fasting (IMF), which consists of either fasting or substantially 
reducing caloric intake [ADDRESS_1195112] growth, as  evidence suggests  
cysts may rely on glycolysis and be unable to utilize ketones as an  energy source16.  
 
Thus weight loss, caloric restriction, and/or periods of fasting may be beneficial in slowing ADPKD progression.  
However, there is presently no information available  regarding the feasibility or efficacy of any dietary 
restriction approach specifically in patients with ADPKD.  Accordingly, the primary aim  of this application is to 
determine the feasibility of delivering a 1 year  behavioral weight loss intervention (ba sed on either DCR or IMF) 
in 30 adults with overweight/obesity and ADPKD with normal  to moderately  declined  renal function.  
Importantly, targeted weekly energy deficit is designed to be similar (~ 34%) between groups to aid in 
interpretation of the results .  A key secondary goal is to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and tolerability o f 
IMF specifically in the ADPKD population as compared to current standard of care (DCR).  Last, the third 
exploratory aim  is a) to obtain mechanistic insight into biological pathways that may be altered ; b) provide 
initial insight regarding any changes in TKV  with IMF and/or DCR.  These aims will be tested in a randomized, 
two-active arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833].  
 
Specific Aim 1 : To determine the feasibility  of deliver y of a 1 year  group -based behavioral weight loss 
program in adults with overweight/obesity and ADPKD with normal to moderately declined renal function, with 
regard to enrollment, retention, and weight loss, to guide a future large -scale randomized, control led trial.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate safety, acceptability, and tolerability  of IMF in f individuals with ADPKD, by 
[CONTACT_857852], dietary adherence, adverse events, and quality of life measures between 
groups, to optimize program development in a future large -scale trial.  
Page 2  
Specific Aim 3 : To measure makers of biologica l pathways , including serum IGF -1/IGF binding protein -1 
levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of p -AMPK and S6K, and serum β -hydroxybutyrate 
(ketone) levels after [ADDRESS_1195113] on the Field .  Although weight loss is recommend ed for individuals with overweight /obesity in the 
general population17, clinical studies evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of this recommendation in ADPKD 
patients, surprisingly, have not been performed .  This work will determine the feasibility of 2 dietary re striction 
regimens.  These results, combined with mechanistic insight obtained, will provide the necessary foundation 
for a subsequent long -term trial assessing the efficacy of dietary restriction for slowing ADPKD progression.    
 
1. Significance  
 
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)  is the most common monogenic and  potentially 
fatal disease, affecting 1 in 400 to 1000 individuals1.  Disease results from a mutation in either of 2 genes, 
PKD1 encoding polycystin  1, located on chromosome 16, and PKD2 encoding polycystin 2, located on 
chromosome 41.  ADPKD  is characterized by [CONTACT_857853], leading to end -stage renal  disease (ESRD) in the majority of 
afflicted patients1,2.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_857827], the prognosis of patients has not 
substantially changed in the last 20 years18, emphasizing the need for additional and better treatments.  
 
Total Kidney Volume in ADPKD.  An increase in total kidney volume (TKV)  precedes the decline in kidney 
function, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_857828] 4th decade of life in patients with ADPKD, and TKV is a prognostic 
biomarker of future renal insufficiency3.  Thus, a decrease in rate of TKV growth, as measured by [CONTACT_12705] (MRI)  is an important indicator of renal disease progression early in the course of 
ADPKD , and early therapeutic strategies to slow ADPKD progression are indicated.      
 
Overweight and Obesity , Kidney Disease, and ADPKD .  Quite similar to the general population, body -mass 
index (BMI) has been increasing in patients with ADPKD over recent decades4, and approximately two -thirds 
of individuals are overweight or obese5,6.  Obesity is an independent risk factor for incident chronic kidney 
disease  (CKD)  and ESRD in the general population7.  Higher BMI is additionally associated with a faster 
decline in renal function in individuals with prevalent CKD ( non-diabetic )19, and weight loss can prevent further 
decline in renal function20.  However, the role of obesity in progression of ADPKD, surprisingly, has not been 
evaluated.  We have novel preliminary data  that overweight and obesity  are associated with substantially 
faster kidney growth  (measured by  [CONTACT_201098] -corrected  total kidney volume [ htTKV])  in non -diabetic adults with 
ADPKD and normal renal function, independent of baseline kidney size and other risk factors.   Importantly, an 
increase in htTKV precedes the decline in kidney function, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_857829] 4th decade of life 
in patients with ADPKD, and htTKV is a prognostic biomarker of future renal insufficiency1.     
 
Dysregulated Metabolic Pathways in ADPKD.  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  is a highly 
conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, activated by [CONTACT_857854] -activated kinase (AMPK)21.  
Overactivation of mTOR and its downstrea m target S6 kinase (S6K) contribute to ADPKD progression by 
[CONTACT_857855][INVESTIGATOR_2130]22.  Additionally, AMPK, which is activated in response to 
low energy (high AMP/ATP ratio)21, mediates cyst growth both by [CONTACT_857856], which promotes cyst fluid secretion, and via mTOR inhibition23.  
Insulin -like growth factor -1 (IGF -1) is also a major regulator of mTOR signaling via the PI3K -Akt pathway and 
has pleiotropic effects including cell proliferation and differentiation24.  It has been proposed to  be secreted in 
cystic fluid in ADPKD and possibly contribute to cystogenesis25. 
 
Dysregulated Metabolic Pathways in Obesity.  Notably, obesity is also associated with enhanced mTOR -
S6K1 signaling26, mediated in part by [CONTACT_14799]-1 and reduced  AMPK -activation27.  Thus, these shared metabolic 
pathways could potentially contribute to the greater rate of kidney growt h observed in  ADPKD patients with 
overweight/ obesity (see Preliminary Data ).  Interestingly, obesity is a known risk factor for many types of 
cancers, possibly via the mTOR p athway, and ADPKD is characterized by [CONTACT_857857]28.           
Metabolic Reprogramming in ADPKD.  Also s imilar to cancer  cells, recent evidence supports that cells 
lacking the PKD1 gene  reprogram their metabolism to favor aerobic glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg effect), leading 
to enhanced cell proliferation and cyst expansion10,12.  These metabolic abnormalities are dependent upon 
Page 3 AMPK  axis inhibition and activat ion of mTOR signaling10.  Inhibition of glycolysis with 2 -deoxyglucose, a 
glucose analog that cannot be metabolized, slows kidney growth and decline in renal function via AMPK 
activation10,12.  Thus, agents targeting metabolic reprogramming may be effective in slowing ADPKD10,11.       
 
Dietary Energy Restriction in ADPKD.   Recently, mild -to-moderate food restriction (10 -40%) was shown to 
profoundly slow disease pro gression in multiple rodent models of A DPKD  in as little as [ADDRESS_1195114] and kidney growth and maintenance of renal function8,9.  These improvements were mediated 
in part by [CONTACT_857858], AMPK activation, and a re duction in IGF -18,9.  Additionally, caloric 
restriction reversed the  ADPKD -associated increase in hexokinase 2 expression, which is the rate limiting step 
in glycolysis, thus supporting metabolic reprogramming8.  However, no evidence is currently available 
regarding the effects of dietary energy restriction in h umans with ADP KD.       
 
Potential Benefit s of Fasting  in ADPKD.   Periods of fasting may modify numerous c ellular and molecular 
mechanisms implicated in ADPKD to a greater degree than traditional daily caloric restriction ( DCR ).  Among 
other pathways, intermittent fasting (IMF)  has been shown to stimulate the AMPK pathway, inhibit the mT OR-
S6K pathway, and  inhibit IGF -129.  It can promote  metabolic reprogramming via a shift from carbohydrate to fat 
metabolism, mediated in large part by [CONTACT_857859]30.  This shift to ketogenesis could suppress growth o f cysts, 
which favor aerobic glycolysis and may not be able to use ketones as an energy source14.  Related to this 
rationale, several clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate IMF in conjunction with chemotherapy to 
possibly slow tumor progression in numerous types of cancer, which is supp orted by [CONTACT_857860]31,32.    
 
Current Approaches to Dietary Energy Restriction and Weight Loss:  Animal data thus suggests w eight 
loss, caloric restriction, and/or periods of fasting may be beneficial in slowing ADPKD progression ; however, 
this has never been evaluated in humans .  The current standard of care dietary approach for treating obesity is 
DCR17.  IMF is a novel dietary approach to treating obesity involving 75 -100% energy restriction on fast days 
with habitual intake on fed days .  Various IMF regimens have been proposed (e.g. alternate -day fasting, fasting 
1-3 days per week)13 and shown to be safe and tolerable in healthy adults with overweight/obesity, with good 
adherence and comparable weight loss to DCR13,[ADDRESS_1195115] to lean 
adults, obese individuals become habituated to IMF after about 2 weeks, leading to decreased hunger on 
fasting days and a l ack of hyperphagic response on fed days33.  While both dietary approaches to energy 
restriction would be expected to produce comparable weight loss (especially if the tar geted weekly energy 
deficit is the same) , they may have a profoundly different impact on biological pathways in ADPKD.   
 
Scientific Premise .  The high prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients with ADPKD, independent 
association of overweight and obesity with substantially faster ADPKD progression, and mechanistic animals 
studies indicating profound slowing of ADPKD with dietary restriction, strongly support the conduction of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_857830].  The lack of previous 
trials of weight loss in APDKD support a two -arm comparison of traditional weight loss by [CONTACT_857861] a more 
novel approach of IMF.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_857831] a future, large -scale, longer -
duration, randomized controlled trial  (RCT)  of dietary restriction in ADPKD.   
 
2. Innovation  
 A clinical trial of weight loss and/or dietary restriction has never been performed in a population of 
patients with ADPKD.  
 Safe, lifestyle -related interventions have the potential for great clinical impact in ADPKD, which slowly 
progresses across a lifetime.  
 IMF is a novel approach to dietary restriction that may affect biological pathways shared by [CONTACT_857862].  
 Mechan istic insight will be gained by [CONTACT_2329] a translational approach evaluating circulating and peripheral 
blood mono nuclear cell (PBMC) markers of  biological pathways in response to DCR and IMF.  
 
3. Preliminary Data  
 
Recruitment of ADPKD Patients .  Since [ADDRESS_1195116] participated in longitudinal studies of the natural history of ADPKD 
progression, as well as clinical trials.  Currently, I am recruiting children an d young adults with ADPKD for a 1 
Page 4 year clinical trial and recruitment is on track for study completion, with 75% (n= 51) already enrolled.  Thus, I 
am confident in my ability to recruit n=[ADDRESS_1195117].   
. 
Overweight/Obesity and ADPKD Progression .  Using data from the HALT -PKD Study A5, I evaluated the 
longitudinal (5 -yr) association of overweight/ obesity with APDKD progression, measured as ∆htTKV (magnetic 
resonance imaging ).  455 non -diabetic adults with ADPKD and normal renal function were categorized by [CONTACT_857863] (18.5 -24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 -29.9 kg/m2), or obese ( ≥30 kg/m2).  In each approach, 
the initial model was unadjusted, then multivariable adjusted models were performed to include age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and randomization group (model 1), model 1 plus SBP, estimated g lomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), and urinary albumin excretion (model 2), and model 2 + baseline htTKV and liver volume (model 3).    
 
First, a multinomial logistic regression model was used with an outcome of three categories of annual htTKV  
growth (<5%, 5 -7%, and ≥7%), based on the first and last available measurements.   The annual percent 
∆htTKV was greater with increasing BMI category (normal weight: 5.4 +4.2%, overweight: 7.8 +4.7%, obese:  
9.5+6.0%; p<0.0001).   The odds of progressing at >7% compared to <5% according to BMI category is shown 
in Table 1 .  In the HALT -PKD Study A, me dian annual increase in htTKV was 6. 8%, thus categorization as 
>7% annual change represents rapid kidney growth.  Next, mixed effects linear regression models were 
performed considering htTKV measurements at all available time points (baseline, 24 months, 48 months, and 
60 months; Figure 1 ).  In these models, the main effect of BMI category was considered with all time points 
incorporated in the model, thus comparing  the difference across groups over time.   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Approach  
 
 
4.1 Subjects.  After obtaining their writt en informed consent, adults (18 -65 years) with overweight/ obes ity (BMI 
25-45 kg/m2) and a diagnosis of ADPKD (modified Pei -Ravine criteria38) with preserved  to moderately declined  
renal function (eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by [CONTACT_857864][INVESTIGATOR_8849] [ CKD -EPI] equation39) will 
be recruited to participate .  Screening and testing will occur at the University of Colorado PKD Center .  Non-
local participants will travel to twice to Colorado (Sessions 2 and 27).  Session 1 and subsequent blood draws 
will be arranged at a local contracted laboratory (Quest) for non -local participants.   The behavioral weight loss 
interventions (focusing on either DCR or IMF as the primary dietary restriction strategy) will be implemented by 
[CONTACT_857865] ( NORC ) Clinical Intervention and Translation (CIT) Co re of the 
Anschutz Health and Wellness Center (AHWC ) and delivered in a web -based manner.   Resting energy Table 1. Associations ( OR [95% Confidence Interval; CI )] of BMI

group had a 4.86 (95% CI): 2.54, 9.30) greater odds of a 
progressing at a rate of >7% compared to <5% htTKV growth . The 
odds of progressing at a rate >7% compared to <5% was also 
significantly greater in the overweight compared to normal weight.   Figure 1. Mean htTKV values according to BMI

be randomly assigned to either DCR or IMF.  Members of the investigative team involved in the acquisition and 
analysis of data will be blinded to the treatment status.  D ue the nature of the intervention, study participants 
will not  be blinded.  Both groups will receive a comprehensive, group -based, behavioral, weight loss 
intervention . Randomized  groups will meet  in small cohorts , via the web -based platform Zoom (which is HIPAA 
compliant), separately  (Sessions 3 -16 and Session 18 -26).  For non -local participants, diet records  will be 
returned by [CONTACT_2319] /electronically for session 17 and anthropometric measurements will be collected by [CONTACT_14662] a 
BodyTrace scale for remote transmission of body weight.

4.[ADDRESS_1195119]. Michel Chonchol (a board -certified nephrologist), will provide me dical 
oversight.  Curriculum for the DCR group will be based on the Colorado Weigh behavioral weight loss program, 
which employs a skills -based approach and cognitive behavioral strategies towards lifestyle modification40.  
Curriculum for the IMF intervention will be developed in consultation with [CONTACT_857885] and a RD and will 
include similar themes to DCR, but with focused behavior al support for IMF.  Sessions will be delivered on the 
HIPAA compliant web -based platform Zoom by [CONTACT_857866], last about [ADDRESS_1195120] 3  months.  Format will include a mix of large -group discussion, small breakout discussions, visual 
demonstrations, and written exercises.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_857835], self -monitoring 
strategies, mindful eating, stress management,  cognitive restructuring, and strategies to overcome barriers to 
healthy eating.   Specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_857836].   IMF-
specific strategies will include: strategies to deal with hunger on fast days, dist raction techniques, and choosing 
a balanced diet/appropriate portions on fed days.  Maintenance phase topi[INVESTIGATOR_857837], screen time and sedentary behavior, negative self -talk, cooking demonstrations, and guest 
speakers.   While the curriculum will primarily be delivered in an online small group setting, there is also an 
option for 1 on 1 online sessions and/or phone calls as needed.   Participant weight will also be tracked weekly 
at the time of these sessions by a BodyTrace scale.  
  
Both groups will reduce overall energy intake  (EI) by ~34% per week , using either DCR or IMF.  
Recommended macronutrient content (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 30% fat) will be the same in both 
groups.  The goal of the DCR group will be a n approximately  34% daily energy deficit from baseline individual 
weight maintenance energy requirements (based on resting energy expenditure [REE]  x activity factor of 1.5 ), 
which will we measured between [ADDRESS_1195121] 
calorimetry41 with the vent ilated hood technique .  Participants in this group will also be instructed in specific 
strategies to support DCR including: counting calories, portion size awareness, and daily food logging.    
 
Participants in the IMF group will be instructed to reduce EI to ~20% of estimated energy requirement  
(delivered as a single meal)  three non -consecutive days per week, resulting in a weekly energy deficit of ~ 34% 
(similar to the DCR group)  (Table 2 ).  Sample fast day menus and individualized fast day calorie goals w ill be 
provided to assist with achieving EI targets.  On fast days, participants will be allowed to consume their 
calories at the meal of their choice, as a previous study using a similar IMF protocol found that altering times of 
caloric intake during the modified fast day did not impact weight loss or compliance42.  On fed days, IMF will 
eat ad libidum, but encouraged to make healthy food and portion choices.   Participants in this group will be 
instructed in calorie counting , but will be asked to count calories and log food intake only on  fast days  on a 
weekly basis (3 -day diet records will also be employed as described below) .  They will also be instructed in 
specific strategies to support IMF, as described above.

of-study visit if they are more comfortable returning at a later time.   
 
Standardized Adjustments for Participants Experiencing Significant Intervention -Related Adverse 
Effects.  Participants will not be withdrawn by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_350] -adherence in this intent -to-treat study.  
Participants will be encouraged to adhere to the dietary prescriptions for the initial 2 weeks as a prior study 
suggests individuals with obesity become habituat ed to IMF after ~2 weeks33.  After the initial 2 weeks, a 
standardized dietary modification will be offered if a participant: 1) expresses a desire to withdraw due to 
intolerance of study diet and/or 2)  experiences adverse effects related to the study diet (i.e. insomnia, impaired 
concentration, irritability) that impair ability to function.  DCR participants will be allowed to raise their calorie 
goal to target an energy deficit of 20% from weight maint enance requirements.  IMF participants will be allowed 
to reduce fasting to 2 days per week (i.e. reduce targeted weekly energy deficit to ~20%).  Participants will be 
allowed to continue these strategies for [ADDRESS_1195124] been evaluated previously in humans with ADPKD.   Thus, a comparison of 
IMF to weight loss resulting from a traditional DCR approach is merited.  While a contr ol group was 
considered, given that the primary outcome of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_345363], it was determined that two active 
groups was a more valuable design than including a control group.   A cross -over design was also considered, 
but concerns about the  length of a washout period that would be required between phases favored a parallel 
group design.  The study duration of the intensive phase (3 months)  was selected to achieve ~5% weight loss 
based on the duration of numerous previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_857838] y studies in overweight and obese adults without 
ADPKD33,34,43,44, length of animal studies showing changes in biological pathways8,9, and to inform a large -

Page 8 provided, to avoid bias and ensure translatability of results, 6) development of a detailed curriculum for the 
weight loss programs to ensure treatment fidelity, and 7) development of a standardized manual of procedures 
and data collection protocols to e nhance transparency and reproducibility. Strategies to ensure consideration 
of relevant biological variables include : 1) stratification of randomization by [CONTACT_4321], 2) reporting results separately 
for men and women (though not formally powered to compare these  groups) and 3) examination of the impact 
of relevant biologic variables (including age, race/ethnicity, and BMI) on weight loss within both IMF and DCR.  
 
5. Outcome Measures  
 
Feasibility (Aim 1) . Careful records will be kept regarding numbers of individuals pre -screened, screened, 
enrolled, and completed in order to evaluate feasibility.  Body weight will be measured on a calibrated digital 
scale to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_1195126] and hip circumference will also be 
measured  and baseline and 1 year.  
 
Safety, Acceptability, and Tolerability (Aim 2) .  Fasting blood samples will be collected for screening and 
repeated at  3 and 12 months  for analysis including a comprehensive metabolic pane l (CMP) , complete blood 
count  (CBC) , HbA1c, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone  (TSH) .  Estimated GFR will be calculated 
using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]39 and a spot urine sample will be collected to measure microalbumin and 
creatinine excretion  at baseline and [ADDRESS_1195127] physical exam and medical history will be administered by a 
physician  or nurse practitioner , and a resting 12 -lead electrocardiogram  will be performed (baseline  and month 
12).  Additional information about demographics and family history will be collected using the PKD Research 
Group Contact [CONTACT_23094].   Subjects will also complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)[ADDRESS_1195128] (EATS -26)53 45 to screen for eating disorders.   Blood pressure 
(Omron) and other vital signs will also be measured at baseline and  month  12, and via home blood pressure 
monitors monthly.    
 
3-day diet records will be completed and then analyzed by [CONTACT_857867] ( University of Minnesota) at baseline, 
month 1, 3, and 12  to evaluate self -reported EI and macronutrient intake.   The IMF will include both a fasted 
and ad libidum day.   We recognize the limitations of self -reported measures of EI46; measures will be primarily 
used to compare intra -individual changes in dietary intake.  Additiona lly, self -reported dietary adherence, effort 
to adhere, and self -efficacy to adhere will be assessed  monthly using a 1-[ADDRESS_1195129] additional parameters to assess 
tolerability at baseline and months 3 and 12  as follows.  Quality of life (QOL) will be assessed with the RAND 
36 Item Health Survey (RAND -36)48 physical and mental health component summary score.  Mood state will 
be assessed with the Profile of Mood States 2 (POMS -2)49.  Binge eating behavior will be assessed with the 
Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns -Revised (QEWP -5)50.   
 
Circulating Markers  (Aim 3) .  Serum IG F-1/IGF binding protein -1 (IGFBP -1) levels (ELISA; DSL/Beckman 
Coulter ) and serum β -hydroxybutyrate (ketone) levels ( quantitative enzymatic method )43 will be measured 
before  and after 3 and 12 months  of IMF or DCR  using fasting blood samples  (Aim 3) .  Additional secondary 
outcomes to gain further mechanistic insight will include serum levels of leptin , ghrelin (ELISA, Linco Research 
Inc.), and brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; ELISA, Promega)43 as regulators of appetite .  Samples will 
be collected the morning following a fed day for the IMF group to avoid acute effects  of fasting .   
 
PBMC Isolation and Western Blot Analysis  (Aim 3) .  PBMCs will be isolated  from heparinized whole blood 
using Histopaque -1077 (Sigma -Aldrich) as described previously  at baseline, 3, and 12 months51,52. The 
PBMCs will be washed and protein will be extracted for Western blot analysis of p-AMPK  (Thr 172)51,52 and 
S6K (phospho -p70S6K)51 (Cell Signaling) as indices of AMPK and mTOR activity, respectively (Aim 3 ).  
Previous studies have shown PBMC protein expression of p -AMPK and S6K significantly change in response 
to caloric restriction or metformin51,52.  Samples will be collected the morning following a fed day for the IMF 
group to avoid acute effects  of fasting .   
 
Page 9 MRI Measurement of TKV  (Aim 3) .  A Siemens  4T system  will be used for all studies.  Renal images will be 
acquired  at baseline and [ADDRESS_1195130], MRI study te chnicians and the PI , 
who will calculate TKV  using Analyze software (Analyze 11.0, Mayo Foundation, [COMPANY_002]ster, MN),  will be 
blinded regar ding group assignment.  In addition cyst volume and renal parenchyma (TKV – cyst volume) will 
be measured .  
 
Physical Activity.  Participants in both the DCR and IMF may increase physical activity as an additional 
mechanism to lose weight while participating in the study, and IMF could potentially specifically impact physical 
activity.  Of note, p revious studies evaluating changes in free -living physical activity during IMF have shown no 
change in physical activity as assessed by [CONTACT_6270] -report [ADDRESS_1195131] Physical Activity Questionnaire 55.    
 
Abdominal Adiposity . Using the MRI images obtained for assessment of TKV, abdominal adiposity will be 
quantified  (using de -identified images ) in collaboration with [CONTACT_857886] at the Mayo Clinic, as described 
previously.[ADDRESS_1195132] with slice 
level at the L3 vertebrate to segment and thereby [CONTACT_857868], muscle, visceral 
adipose tissue, visceral organ, and bone compartments. From this, regional measurements of bo th area (2D) 
and volume (3D) can be used to quantify various body composition parameters.  
 
 
Additional Blood Samples  
For subjects signing the Informed Consent Addendum, an additional 10 mL of serum and 9 mL of plasma  will 
be collected for future research.    
 
6. Statistical Analyses .  Randomization  (1:1; blocked randomization sequence  with stratification by [CONTACT_4321] ) and 
statistical analysis will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zhi ying You, biostati stician in the Renal Division.  We will aim to 
recruit 30 participants in smaller cohorts (goal of  approximately 6 -10 participants ).  Up to [ADDRESS_1195133] instructor.   Additionally, a total of 12 participants  (accounting for 20% drop -out) per group 
will afford 99% power at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1195134] weight loss of >5% (-6.2+0.9%)34 in each group  (note, 
we do not exp ect significantly different weight loss between group s, thus between group calculations are not 
appropriate for our hypothesis , and this comparison is to no weight loss ).     
 
Aim 1: Feasibility .  We will assess overall implementation to guide development of a large -scale RCT.  
Enrollment : We will assess the ability to enroll 30 participants meeting I/E criteria over the proposed 
recruitment window (see below).  If enrollment is <30, we will determi ne barriers to enrollment and re -evaluate 
study design and/or recruitment.  We will also assess the number approached compared to enrolled 
(participation rate) and reasons for declining.  Retention : We will assess drop -out rates, reasons for attrition, 
and compare drop -out between groups.  If drop -out exceeds 30% we will consider modifications.   Weight l oss: 
We will evaluate weight loss  at 3 months (and maintenance at 12 months)  as in index that the intervention can 
be effectively delivered and compare  percent  weight loss between groups (t -test).  These data will be used to 
estimate  an effect size for a large -scale RCT.  
 
Aim 2: Safety, Acceptability, and Tolerability . Safety and tolerability : Rates of study -related adverse events 
will compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test.   Any change in eGFR  or microalbumin excretion  will 
be compared between groups using two -sample t -tests.  Changes in QOL Measures (RAND -36), Mood State 
(POMS -2), and Binge Eating Behaviors (QEWP -5) will be compared between groups using two -sample t -tests.  
Acceptability:  Changes in self -reported EI and macronutrient intake will be compared between groups using 
two-sample t -tests.  Descriptive statistics will be per formed on dietary adherence  ratings (1 -10 Likert scale) .   
 
Aim 3: Mechanistic Markers  and Change in TKV .  Baseline , 3, and 12 month levels of serum IGF -1/IGFBP -
1, PBMC expression of p -AMPK and S6K, and serum β -hydroxybutyrate levels will be compared using  paired 
t-tests within each group, thus evaluating the efficacy of each intervention separately.   We expect IGF -
1/IGFBP -[ADDRESS_1195135] -hoc analysis, change in 
abdominal adiposity (visceral, subcut aneous, total) will assessed within each group using a paired t -test and 
between groups using an independent samples t -test.  For the associative analysis, multivariable linear 
regression will be used to determine the association of change in abdominal adi posity with change in TKV. We 
will test for any significant interaction terms between adiposity category and sex and age. 
  
7. Recruitment Plans and Study Time Line.   We will use recruitment and adherence strategies and 
experience previously implemented by  [CONTACT_277675].  [CONTACT_184561] has successfully recruited 
patients with various etiologies of kidney disease to clinical trials for many years, and I also have over 10 years 
of experience conducting translational intervention studies.   The University of Colorado PKD Center has a rich 
history of recruiting patients with ADPKD to clinical research, including enrolling n= 256 in the recently 
completed 5-year HALT -PKD studies5,6.  Participants will be recruited as in small  cohort s (goal of 
approximately 6 -10) randomized to either DCR or IMF.  Each cohort  will undergo baseline measurement s and 
randomization at approximately  same time in order to conduct the behavioral intervention in a group setting.  
The initial [ADDRESS_1195136] period will be used to obtain regulatory approvals and develop the 
intervention curric ulum.  Screening and enrollment will completed over the next ~[ADDRESS_1195137] 
duration in order to accrue n=[ADDRESS_1195138] period.  
 
8. Potential Problems, Alternative Strategies , and Future Directions.   There is a possibility that adherence 
to the diets may be more diffic ult in ADPKD patients than other adults with overweight and obes ity for unknown 
reasons; however, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate feasibility.   We recognize that u se of doubly -
labeled water would allow for a more objective measure of total daily energy expenditure and EI and is an 
important future direction, however, was felt to be beyond the scope of this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_346507].   An 
alternate approach  to weight loss is exercise ; however, given that there is less available literature s upporting 
this intervention in ADPKD, we opted for a comparison of dietary restriction strategies ( DCR and IMF ).  We 
recognize that the proposed study duration and sample s ize will only provide a trend for any changes in TKV 
with dietary energy restriction.  Importantly, the propose d study will provide the necessary foundation for a 
subsequent longer duration, larger -scale RCT (R01) assessing the efficacy of dietary restriction for slowing 
ADPKD progression, including measurement of change in TKV.  
 
9. Human Subjects  
 
9.1 Risks to the Subjects  
 
a) Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics.  
 
Subjects.  After obtaining their written informed consent, 30 adults (18 -65 years) with overweight/obesity (BMI 
25-45 kg/m2) and a diagnosis of ADPKD ( modified Pei -Ravine criteria38) with preserved to moderately declined 
renal function (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by [CONTACT_91019] -EP equation39) will be recruited to participate.   
Screening and testing will occur at the University of Colorado PKD Research Center .  A local contracted 
laboratory (Quest) and medical records will be used for screening for non-local participants.  The behavioral 
weight loss interventions (focusing on either DCR or IMF as the primary dietary restriction strategy) will be 
implemented by [CONTACT_857869] a HIPAA -compliant web -based platform 
(Zoom) .  Resting energy expendi ture (REE) will be measured at the AHWC and r enal magnetic resonance

19) Inability to cooperate with/clinical contraindication for MRI including severe claustrophobia, implants, 
devices, or non -removable body pi[INVESTIGATOR_857841] [ADDRESS_1195144]. Catenacci as appropriate.   
 
Any screening results that preclude enrollment will be communicated to potential subjects who will be 
recommended to consult with their primary care provider.  
 
b) Sources of Research Materials .  This is a prospective study of newly recruited human subjects aged [ADDRESS_1195145] identities 
and records will remain strictly confidential.  
 
c) Potential Risks .  We see no psychological, social, or legal risks beyond those of participation in health -
related research in general.  The potential physical risks of participating in the proposed experiments are 
reasonably small.  The only invasive measurement will be collection of a small amount of blood.  Moreover, the 
research will be overseen by a study -specific DSMB  (described in more detail under Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan).  
 
The risks associated with the experimental protocols include:  
 
Blood Draw - may result in temporary discomfort, bruising, bleeding, and on rare occasions, infection; 
however, the potential health risks are minimal.  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) - The risk of performing abdominal MRI is minimal.  The magnetic field  
generated within the MRI is not harmful but can cause metal within the body to heat up or electronics to  
stop working.  All subjects will be questioned regarding the presence of metal or electronic devices  inside 
their body.   All subjects with either metal implants or implanted electronic devices will be excluded  from the 
study.   As the MRI tube is a small ro und tube, it may make subjects who experience  claustrophobia 
uncomfortable , thus such individuals will be excluded.   The most common minor side effect of having an 
MRI exam is flashing  lights in the eyes. This is caused by [CONTACT_857870].  Some 
people also  experience warmth and reddening of the skin, which usually goes away after a few minutes. 
For all  female participants of possible childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test prior to MRI will be 
required.   Severe claustrophobi a is an exclusion criterion for the study.  Thus, undue stress due to a 
confined space during the MRI procedure will not be a potential risk.   
 
Dietary Weight Loss Interventions – The most common side effects are hunger, fatigue, insomnia, 
irritability, a nxiety, headache, impaired concentration, and cold intolerance.  Occasionally subjects can 
experience constipation, nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort when changing their usual diet.  These 
conditions usually improved within a few weeks.  Occasional ly, subjects may also experience weakness, 
dizziness, lightheadedness, tremor, psychological stress, or cognitive difficulties.  The most serious side 
effect of low calorie diets is gallstone formation, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_857842].  
Rarely, limiting energy intake may cause dehydration, hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, 
change in mood, arrhythmias, syncope, seizures, worsening of an underlying eating disorder, or impact 
performance at home, work, or school.  
 
Resting Energy Expenditure  – The hood may cause claustrophobia in those susceptible.  Participants will 
have an opportunity to try the hood prior to beginning the measurement.  
 
Group Behavioral Meetings – Due to the nature of the group setting to deliver the intervention, there is a 
risk of loss of privacy and confidentiality, including external knowledge of diagnosis of ADPKD and 
participation in a research study.  
 
 
There is a risk that people outside of the research team will see research information.  We will do all that we 
can to protect information, but it can not be guaranteed.  
 
There are no alternative methods that would provide the same type and accuracy of information as the state -
of-the art procedures proposed in this application.  
 
9.2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
Page 13 a) Recruitment and Informed Consent.  I will use the recruitment and adherence strategies and experience 
previously implemented by [CONTACT_277675].  [CONTACT_184561] has successfully recruited patients with 
various etiolo gies of kidney disease to clinical trials for many years, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_857843] 10 years of 
experience conducting translational intervention studies.  The University of Colorado PKD Research group has 
a rich history of recruiting patients with ADPKD to clinical research, including enrolling n=256 in the recently 
completed 5 -year HALT -PKD studies5,6.  Patients for the study will be recruited from the ADPKD Research 
Center at the University of Colorado Denve r Anschutz Medical Campus (UCD), with access to >[ADDRESS_1195146] (IRB), that provides appropriate information about the study and 
the potential risks and benefits.  The participant will read the consent/assent form and the investigator will 
review these forms and will answer any questions that the subject may have prior to obtaining the subject’s 
written consent.  Volunteers will meet with a study representative in a private and quiet room and will be 
permitted ample time to read the document in a quiet room and an unhurried setting.  The volunteer’s 
comprehension and autonomy will be assessed by [CONTACT_857871].  The consent form w ill then be signed by [CONTACT_857872].  A copy of 
the signed consent form will be given to the subject.  All of the proposed procedures and protocols will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_857873].  
 
b) Protection Against Risk . 
Minimizing General Risks - The potential general risks of the proposed studies will be minimized by:  
•  Ensuring all participants meet the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Screening for adverse events.  
• Using only safe, well-established procedures, with only qualified and experienced personnel performing 
the procedures.  
• Ensuring constant personal monitoring of each experimental session by [CONTACT_857874].  
• Providing appropriate clinical supervision and  emergency equipment through the PKD Research Center 
environment.  
•  Safety monitoring annually by a DSMB  (described below).  
• Employing record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_497164].  All subject identities and records 
will remain strictly confide ntial.  Individual subject data will not be associated with subject name.  
• All blood pressure and blood draws will be performed in the arm not designated for future vascular 
access for dialysis.  
 
Minimizing Specific Risks Related to Dietary Intervention:  
 Risks of the dietary interventions will be minimized by [CONTACT_857875]/exclusion criteria.  Subjects will undergo a medical screening including medical history 
interview and physical exam, screening labs (CBC, CMP, Lipid Profile, TSH, Hemoglobin A1C and in 
women, a urine pregnancy test) and 12 -lead electrocardiogram.  
 Subjects in the DCR group will be guided to reduce fat intake to 30% of total calories but will be advised 
to maintain an intake of at least 10 -20 g of fat pe r day to reduce risk of gallstone formation.  
 Subjects in the IMF group will be guided to ensure adequate fluid intake on fast days.  
 Subjects in both arms will be monitored closely for adverse events.  Subjects will be instructed to report 
all side -effects and adverse events.  Participants will not be discontinued from the study if they fail to 
comply with the dietary interventions or fail to lose weight, nor will the protocol be modified, as 
feasibility is the primary outcome.  Participants may be discontin ued upon request or if deemed 
medically appropriate by [CONTACT_20685].  
Page 14  Safety will be monitored regularly via frequent contact [CONTACT_857876] (weekly during intensive phase; 
monthly to bi-monthly during maintenance phase)  
 
Minimizing Specific Ri sks Related to Confidentiality:  
Group sessions will only include participants in the research study and other members of the community will 
not be enrolled in these weight loss sessions.  All study participants will be asked to keep the identities of othe r 
study participants confidential.  In addition to identities, all conversation topi[INVESTIGATOR_857844].  Participants will be instructed that they have the right to refuse to answer any 
question or discuss any issu e that makes them feel uncomfortable.  Strict confidentiality of subjects’ 
information will be kept in accordance of HIPAA policy.  Zoom is a HIPAA compliant web -based platform 
available through the University of Colorado.  All clinical samples will be sto red by [CONTACT_857877].  Data will be 
stored  as well as collected using  Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap), an encrypted, secured, HIPAA 
compliant website that meets all IRB regulations for secure data management.  Paper hard -copi[INVESTIGATOR_857845], will be locked in the research offices and in a locked cabinet, and will be 
accessible to members of the research team only on an as -needed basis.  All information in our database is 
treated with the same confidentiality as a medical record.         
 
9.3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
Because the risks of participating in this study  are relatively small, the risk -to-benefit ratio also is relatively low.  
Subjects will receive benefits associated with overall knowledge of their health from any testing performed.  
Participants in the study will potentially benefit by [CONTACT_857878] b ody weight.  
 
9.4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
The findings from the proposed research should provide important new information regarding the feasibility, 
safety, acceptability, and tolerability of two behavioral weight loss programs in adult s with overweight/obesity 
and ADPKD with normal  to moderately declined  renal function, as there is no available information to date on 
these questions.  In addition, the proposed research should provide important insight changes in markers of 
biological pa thways.  Together, this information will contribute to will provide the foundation for a subsequent 
long-term trial assessing the efficacy of dietary restriction for slowing ADPKD progression.  
 
9.5. Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Safety Monitoring  
The risks in this study are minimized by [CONTACT_462555], and by [CONTACT_857879]. In addition, the primary research team is qualified and experienced in all of 
the study procedures.  Nonethele ss, since this study places the subjects at more than minimal risk, a data 
safety monitoring board (DSMB) including clinicians and a statistician (independent of the study investigators 
but part of the faculty at the UCD  School of Medicine) will be formed to assess potential adverse events.   
These data will be prepared by [CONTACT_228935], ensuring the study statistician remains blinded until the 
final analysis.   The DSMB  will meet after 1  and 3 months , and thereafter every 6 -12 months  with study 
investigators to review the protocol and will follow the guidelines established by [CONTACT_857880], which include: a) monitoring the progress of the protocol (e.g. reviewing subject 
recruitment, attrition and minority involvement ) and the safety of research participants (e.g. reviewing  
unblinded data for safety); b) assuring compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse  
events; c) assuring that any action that results in the temporary or permanent suspension of the protocol is  
reported to all of the appropriate monitoring bodies (IRB, NIH, etc.) and d) assuring data accuracy and protocol  
compliance.  
 
a) Data Safety Monitoring Board  
1.  The DSMB  will be comprised of  independent (i.e. not affiliated with the study) faculty member s from 
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (including a nephrologist, endocrinologist and 
statistician) .   We have avoid ed conflict of interest by [CONTACT_30224] a person who is not aff iliated with any 
member of the research  team (i.e. not a collaborator)  
2.  The DSMB  will meet with study investigators at 1 and 3 months  during t he intensive  phase of the study , 
and every 6 -12 months thereafter.  During these meetings, the following information will be reviewed:  
Page 15 i.  Study progress to date, projected timeline and schedule, discussion of issues or potential problems  
ii.  Adverse events report (see below)  
iii.  Recruitment and enrollment statistics i ncluding the following information:  
1.  Adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria  
2.  Sex, race/ethnicity  
3.  Number of subjects who were disqualified prior to randomization and reasons  
4. Number of subjects randomized  
5. Number of subjects who have withdr awn from the study, and the reasons for withdrawal  
6.  Adherence to study timeline for enrollment and goals for subject retention  
3. Minutes  will be taken during  the meeting, and after the meeting copi[INVESTIGATOR_857846] d.  The minutes 
will be reviewed a t the beginning of the next DSMB  meeting.   The DSMB report will be submitted to 
the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ( COMIRB ) at the annual review.  
 
b) Reporting of Adverse Events .  Subjects will be instructed to report side effects to the investigator and their 
nephrologist, if not part of the investigative team.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_776040] ([CONTACT_184561]) will continually monitor 
all adverse events during the screening process, during proce dures performed as part of this research, and 
during the weight loss interventions.  Detailed information on all adverse events will be recorded by [CONTACT_857881] a standardized adverse event form and will be and evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours.  Any serious 
adverse events  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4318] , PI, and study MD within 24 hours and  will be reported to the 
Colorado Multiple IRB in accordance with the guidelines.   
 
1. Screening Failures:  When a screening failure occurs, the individual will be contact[CONTACT_857882].  
2. Serious Adverse Events:  Any serious adverse events that are definitely or probably related to the 
protocol and any deaths (regardless of relatedness ) will be reported to the DSMB and  COMIRB within 5 
days using the COMIRB Unanticipated Problem Report Form.  Serious adverse events are defined as: 
death, life threatening injuries, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Any study -related serious adverse events and any deaths (regardless of 
relatedness) will be reported to the NIH  (if applicable)  within 2 weeks.  For all serious adverse  events 
determined by [CONTACT_857883], probably, or possibly related to the study or  interventions , 
COMIRB will take whatever action(s) it deems appropriate, including but not limited to:  
i. Modification of the protocol  
ii. Modification of the consent form document  
iii. Modification to the timetable for continuing review requirements  
iv. Suspension of new enrollment into the study  
v. Suspension or termination of the study - If the study is suspended or terminated, it will be promptly 
reported to any agency that has provid ed funding for the study.  All other events not requiring 
suspension or termination shall be reported during the annual progress report.  
3. Unanticipated Adverse Events : Any unanticipated adverse events that are definitely or probably related 
to the protoc ol will be reported to the DSMB , COMIRB, and CTRC within 5 days using the COMIRB  
Unanticipated Problem Report Form and will be included in the annual report to any funding agency  
4. Other Adverse Events:  All other adverse events will be documented by [CONTACT_857884], at the annual COMIRB protocol review, and will be 
included in the annual report to any funding agency . 
 
c) Exit Criteria .  The primary exit criteria will include completion of the study, patient request, IRB or DSMB  
request, or other medical rationale as determined by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators.  Other exit criteria are listed 
below.  The number of subjects exiting the study a nd the reasons for exit will be carefully documented.  
Participants who drop out of the study will be handled using an intent -to-treat analysis.  
 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
An individual subject may be terminated from the study based on the criteria list ed below. Any subject that is 
terminated from the study based on these criteria will be reported to COMIRB during the annual continuing 
review.  
 
1. Absolute termination criteria  
Page 16  Request by [CONTACT_462558]  
 Pregnancy - Rapid weight gain (>4 kg/month) or secondary amenorrhea in a female volunteer will 
be cause for a pregnancy test determination  
 Alcohol abuse; illicit drug abuse  
 Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment  
 Participation in another weight loss program or use of  a weight loss medication  
 Development of a chronic condition (e.g. hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, 
congestive cardiac failure, or neurological disorders such as MS or stroke) likely to impact upon 
ability of the subject to participate  
 Development of an acute condition (e.g. myocardial infarction, major depression, accidents outside 
of the study resulting in physical impairments) likely to impact upon ability of the subject to 
participate  
2. Potential termination criteria  
 Development of an acute or chronic condition that may impair the ability of the subject to participate  
or impact safety .  Subjects will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis and will be reported to the 
DSMB . 
 We do not have a comprehensive list of criteria or ca uses, but we have prepared plans for:  
o Depression or low mood – subjects will be referred to their primary care provider, and if 
appropriate, to a psychiatrist. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_857847].  
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:   
There are no efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_857848].  It is unlikely that the power to make such a 
decision would be present during the short timeframe of this study with endpoints related to feasibility and 
adherence, thus no formal interim analy sis is planned.  In this relatively minimal risk study it is unlikely that 
excess adverse events will require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  However, as outlined above, we will monitor adverse 
events injury rates in all participants and alert COM IRB and NIH if a lar ger than reasonably expected adverse 
event rate should occur.   
The DSMB  may recommend study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223854]:  
 The data show a significantly increased risk of serious adverse effects in either treatment group.   
 It becomes clear that successful completion of th e study is not feasible (e.g. there is an excess of patient 
dropout, missing data, lack of recruitment etc).  
 
Data Monitoring  
As described in Section 9.2b Protection Against Risk, study data will be collected and managed using REDCap 
(Research Electronic D ata Capture). The database is hosted at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical 
Campus  Development and  Informatics Service Center (DISC), which will be used as a central location for data 
processing and management.  This server has a high level of security, controlled access, daily back -up, and 
long-term retention of back -up files.  All members of the research group at Colorado Anschutz Medical 
Campus Development have individual computers that are part of the institut ion network with institutional 
oversight of security.  Field and range checks will be programmed to minimize data entry errors.  
 
Clinical Trials.gov Requirements  
The application includes a trial which requires registration at ClinicalTrials.gov.  This registration will be 
performed.

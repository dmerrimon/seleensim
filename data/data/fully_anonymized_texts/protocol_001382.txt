STATISTICS
Primary Analysis 
PlanThe primary endpoint is improvement of PGWB at week [ADDRESS_1109398] (LOCF) will be used to impute 
missing data.  Analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population (all subjects enrolled and receiving the treatments).  Analyses 
on the per-protocol (PP) population will be considered supportive of the 
ITT analyses.  Subjects will be eligible for the PP analyses if they complete 
the 52 week evaluation without any noteworthy study protocol violations 
(i.e. failure to use the study medications or investigator activity that could 
have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the 
treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy).
ETHICAL 
CONSIDER-
ATIONSThis study will be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations and according to the recommendations of International 
Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) 
guidelines and those of the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh, 2000); 
only after approval for the study has been obtained from the relevant 
regulatory authority and relevant independent ethics committee (IEC). The 
institutional review board (IRB)/IEC must review and approve the protocol 
and informed consent form (ICF) before any subjects are enrolled. The 
subject must be consented using the approved ICF before any procedures 
specified in the protocol are performed.
Trial number R668-AD-1833Confidential
Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, 2019 Page 10 of 391 BACKGROUND
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, complex, immune-mediated condition affecting 5-15% of 
children and adults worldwide. Adults with AD suffer from severe pruritus and inflammatory 
skin rash with a chronic disease course.
Patients with moderate-to-severe AD report a multidimensional burden including itch, pain, 
sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression, and impaired health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). 
Patients suffering from AD are more likely to be depressed when compared to the general 
population, which can lead to increased suicidal ideation. Furthermore, AD can create a negative 
impact in the workplace, as patients with the disease are more likely to miss work due to their 
skin symptoms. With the significant negative psychosocial impact of AD, patients not only want 
to improve their skin lesions, but also their personal experience with this chronic disease.
2 STUDY RATIONALE
The overall aim of this study is to demonstrate, beyond the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI), improvement in the quality of life of adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are being 
treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_803615] 1 year. 
The University of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco (UCSF) Skin Treatment Center is a high-volume 
atopic dermatitis referral center whose activities include outpatient care, a phototherapy unit, a 
Goeckerman tar treatment program, and over [ADDRESS_1109399] specifically chosen the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWB) and Work 
Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI) as quality of life assessment tools because they are not 
specific to skin diseases; they have been used extensively for non-dermatologic serious medical 
conditions. By [CONTACT_803634], we hope to show that patients being considered for treatment have baseline 
deficiencies in psychological well-being and work productivity comparable to patients with 
Trial number R668-AD-1833Confidential
Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, 2019 Page 11 of 39serious non-dermatological disorders (such has heart disease, cancer, and untreated diabetes). 
Moreover, we aim to go beyond this by [CONTACT_803635] a therapeutic intervention to hopefully show 
that treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_803616], but also brings 
them to a level comparable to a disease-free non-patient population. 
Beyond administering these questionnaires, we will also take a novel approach to assessing 
patient experience with a medication. Each patient will be given a video recording device to 
document their experience from a pre-dupi[INVESTIGATOR_803617] a post-dupi[INVESTIGATOR_803618]. Human-interest stories excite payers and the general public who are not 
healthcare providers. It is best to have both human-interest stories in a narrative form before and 
after treatment as well as quantitative documentation with the PGWB and WPAI. 
It is hoped that the information gained from this study will not only provide more insight into the 
psychosocial and occupational impact of AD, but also confirm the value of dermatological care 
by [CONTACT_803636][INVESTIGATOR_803619]. 
Thus, in this real-world study of atopic dermatitis, we aim to examine the value and efficacy of 
medical intervention, extending beyond physical improvement, and into the realm of 
psychosocial and occupational functions.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Adverse Events
Definition of an AE: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product.
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) includes the drug under evaluation and the comparator 
drug(s) if specified as part of the research objective, given at any time during the study. Medical 
conditions/diseases present before starting the drug of interest are only considered adverse events 
if they worsen after starting the drug of interest.
The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
[CONTACT_24479], laboratory test, or other 
assessments. All adverse events will be recorded in the study database including the following 
information:
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)
2. its relationship to the drug(s) of interest (suspected/not suspected)
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)
Trial number R668-AD-1833Confidential
Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, 2019 Page 29 of 39AE Severity
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the 
experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Error! Reference 
source not found. below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term 
“severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.

drug.
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
results in death,
is life-threatening,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
is otherwise a significant medical event.
This includes any SAEs likely to arise from the trial indication or progression of 
underlying/concomitant illness(es) (e.g. progression of cancer in oncology trials), unless 
specified in the protocol as study specific exemptions.
Any SAE, irrespective of causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed consent 
and until four weeks after the subject has stopped study participation must be reported unless 
otherwise stated in the protocol. SAEs occurring after four weeks from ending study 
participation should only be reported if considered by [CONTACT_24480](s) during the trial period. This includes the period in which 
the study protocol interferes with the standard medical treatment given to a subject, even if study 
treatment has not yet started (e.g. withdrawal of previous treatment during washout period, 
change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication).
11.3. Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF 
CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is 
obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.
SAEs occurring after four weeks from ending study participation should only be reported if 
considered by [CONTACT_374636](s) during 
the trial period. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard 
medical treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet started (e.g. withdrawal 
of previous treatment during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant 
medication).
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report SAEs 
to the IRB/IEC.  
Trial number R668-AD-1833Confidential
Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, 2019 Page 31 of 39Timelines: All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported by [CONTACT_24481] [ADDRESS_1109423] Party Study/Investigator Initiated Trial 
Agreement.  All reports must be sent to Regeneron as below:
Fax SAE/CIOMS or MedWatch Reports to [PHONE_16755]
Email forms to [EMAIL_7649]
Follow-up reports: SAEs will be followed until resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, 
and an assessment will be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to the drug of interest, the interventions required to treat it, 
and the outcome. 
The Sponsor shall support Regeneron in the following-up of all SAEs so that complete 
information is available to maintain patient safety and also as part of any commitments by 
[CONTACT_803641]-up requests for the 
product under investigation.
Pregnancies: Any occurrences of a pregnancy in a patient (or a patients partner) during study 
participation will be collected. All pregnancies will be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.
[ADDRESS_1109424]’s best interest to continue.  The following is a list 
of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation: 
Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)
Subject is not compliant with study procedures
Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_256029]
Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment
Lost to follow-up
Sponsor request for early termination of study
Positive pregnancy test (females)
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be followed 
and treated by [CONTACT_256058].  
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation visit as 
Trial number R668-AD-1833Confidential
Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, [ADDRESS_1109425]’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents Refer to Section 10.[ADDRESS_1109426]’s best interest to continue.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice.
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents. As noted above, subjects who discontinue study treatment early (i.e., 
they withdraw prior to Visit 11) should have an early discontinuation visit. Refer to Section 
10.13 for early termination procedures. Subjects who withdraw after Visit 1 but prior to Visit 10 
should be encouraged to come in for a final visit (and the procedures to be followed would 
include those for their next scheduled visit). Subjects who sign the informed consent form (ICF) 
and who are discontinued or withdraw from the study before study product administration will be 
defined as screen failures. No data will be collected in the CRFs for screen failure subjects.

endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication.
Non-compliance with study drug regimen.
Non-compliance with study visit procedures.
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a 
protocol violation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50366] a protocol violation will result in withdrawal 
of a subject.
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications 
to the analysis plan described below.  
14.[ADDRESS_1109428] 
(LOCF) will be used to impute missing data.  Analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population (all subjects enrolled and receiving the treatments).  Analyses on the per-
protocol (PP) population will be considered supportive of the ITT analyses.  Subjects will be 
eligible for the PP analyses if they complete the 52 week evaluation without any noteworthy 
study protocol violations (i.e. failure to use the study medications or investigator activity that 
could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise 
evaluation of treatment efficacy).
14.2  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
1. Efficacy Endpoints
a.EASI and IGA scores at week 16 will be compared to baseline.
2. Safety Endpoints
a.Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_511554] (AEs), including any 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) within treatment groups.  All AEs occurring 
during the study will be recorded.  Descriptions of adverse events will include the 
date of onset, the date the adverse event ended, the severity of the adverse event, 
and the outcome.  All reported adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_803642], body system, severity, seriousness, and 
relationship to study treatment.
3. Analysis of Other Endpoints
a.Other variables may be analyzed and presented descriptively.  The methods to be 
used will include (but are not limited to) parametric and nonparametric analysis, 
means, standard deviations, frequency counts and graphs, as appropriate.
b.Video footage of patient experiences will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_803625]. The

Version 3.0 Version Date: February 14, 2019 Page 34 of 3914.3 Sample Size
Up to 30 subjects will receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_803615] a treatment period of 52 weeks (i.e. last injection on 
week 50). This is based on previous similar studies investigating the impact of adalimumab and 
ustekinumab on QoL in psoriasis patients which included [ADDRESS_1109429]’s visit into the protocol-specific 
electronic (eCRF) or paper Case Report Form  when the information corresponding to that visit 
is available. Patient recorded videos will be downloaded to a secure storage site. Subjects will 
not be identified by [CONTACT_374641], but will be identified 
by a site number, subject number and initials.
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the time and date stamps track the person entering or 
updating eCRF data and creates an electronic audit trail. If a correction is made on a paper CRF, 
the study staff member will line through the incorrect data, write in the correct data and initial 
and date the change.
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  
All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness 
and accuracy by [CONTACT_737]. A copy of the CRF will remain at the Investigator’s site at the 
completion of the study.
15.[ADDRESS_1109430] been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. On eCRFs, queries 
are entered, tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly. On paper, query reports 
(Data Clarification Requests) pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to 
the Investigators and study monitors for resolution.  The study database will be updated in 
accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes to the study database will be documented.

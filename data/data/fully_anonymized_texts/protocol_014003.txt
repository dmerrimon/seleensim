The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to ensure that the data listings, 
summary tables and figures which will be produced, and the statistical methodologies 
that will be used, are complete and appropriate to  allow valid conclusions regarding the 
study objectives.   
2.1. RESPONSIBILITIES  
INC Research  will perform the statistical analyses and is responsible for the production 
and quality control of all tables, figures and listings . 
2.2. TIMING OF ANALYSES  
The final analysis of safety and efficacy  is planned after all subjects complete the final 
study visit  or terminate early from the study . At that time, the database will be locked, 
the study will be unmasked, and then final analyse s will be performed.

3.1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different topi[INVESTIGATOR_785128] (3.0% and 6.0%) when added to latanoprost (0.005% or 0.0025%), 
one drop daily to both eyes over two consecutive 4 week periods.   
All subjects were dosed (in a masked manner) with AM active drug during Weeks 1 – 4, 
and with PM active drug during Weeks 5  - 8. 
3.2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE S 
The secondary objectives are  to evaluate the tolerability and safety of different doses 
of trabodenoson (3.0% and 6.0%) when added to latanoprost (0.005% or 0.0025%), one drop daily to both eyes over two consecutive 4 week periods.   
3.3. SUB-STUDY 
The analyses for protocol “Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LCVA) Sub -study for IPC-02-
1015”, run on a subset of subjects from IPC -02-2015, is included in this SAP.  
3.4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION  
This is a phase II, randomized, double -masked study to evaluate the efficacy and 
tolerability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_785129] -dose combinations of trabodenoson and 
latanoprost in subjects with Ocular Hypertension  (OHT) or Primary Open -Angle 
Glaucoma  (POAG). 
All subjects who meet the study’s enrollment criteria following Screening will undergo washout of all prohibited medications (if washout is needed), including their routine glaucoma medications. During the Placebo Run -In Period, placebo (vehicle control 
matched to trabodenoson) is applied twice daily to both eyes in all subjects. During the 
Treatment Period, study drug is applied to both eyes for a total of [ADDRESS_1080101] will be assigned 4 weeks of AM and 4 weeks of PM dosing in a m asked manner. 
The Treatment Period will be followed by [CONTACT_785139] 7 
days wherein no study eye drops are instilled.  
These periods are described in detail in the study protocol (Section 9.2).  
To mimic what is generally seen in clinical trials, the number of subjects with ocular hypertension as their diagnosis will be limited to approximately 30% of the total subjects enrolled. Additionally, so the trial mirrors the general population demographics 
(so as to improve generalizability of the results) the proportion of African American 
subjects will be approximately 25% or less but not less than 12% of the total subjects enrolled.

topi[INVESTIGATOR_785130] (3.0% and 6.0%) when combined with latanoprost (0.005% or 0.0025%) one drop daily over two consecutive 4 week 
periods in subjects with POAG or OHT. Data collection will include efficacy (masked - 
Intraocular Pressure s [IOPs]), local (ophthalmic) and systemic tolerability and safety 
assessments. 
Approximately 40 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) will participate in this trial.  
The following is a schematic of the trial treatment plan. Please note that Screening, 
Washout, and Placebo Run- In Periods can vary in length and therefore are presented as 
ranges throughout the protocol instead of specific days.

validated Interactive Response Technology.  Subjects will be randomized in equally allocat ed groups (1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of the following 5 treatment arms: 
1) trabodenoson 6.0% / latanoprost 0.005% QD and Placebo QD, instilled OU for a total of 8 weeks .  
2) trabodenoson 3.0% / latanoprost 0.005% QD and Placebo QD, instilled OU for a total of 8 weeks . 
3) trabodenoson 6.0% / latanoprost .0025% QD and Placebo QD, instilled OU for a total of 8 weeks . 
4) latanoprost 0.005% QD and Placebo QD, instilled OU for a total of 8 weeks . 
5) latanoprost 0.0025% QD and Placebo QD, instilled OU for a total of [ADDRESS_1080120] of the study will also remain masked until after data lock. Subjects will receive 4 week s of AM active 
drug dosing and 4 week s of PM active drug dosing. AM and PM dosing will also be 
masked.  
(Note that all subjects will be dosed, in a masked manner, with AM active drug during Weeks 1 – 4, and with PM active drug during Weeks 5 -8). In the event of an emergency 
in which unmasking is required at an investigative site, the emergency procedures detailed in the clinical study protocol will be followed ( Protocol Section 11.2).

The study populations include Intent- to-Treat (ITT), the Per- Protocol (PP), and the Safety 
population. The primary analysis will be performed using the Intent -to-Treat Population. All 
decision rules regarding any exclusion of a subject from Intent -to-Treat, Per- Protocol, and 
safety populations will be made and documented before locking the  study database and 
unmasking this study . 
5.1. INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATION  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who are randomized and who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug (a modified ITT).  
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. For efficacy analysis, sub jects 
will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized . 
5.2. PER-PROTOCOL POPULATION   
The Per -Protocol (PP) population is defined as all subjects who are included in the ITT 
population, who have at least [ADDRESS_1080126] efficacy results  will be identified prior to unmasking /unblinding the study, and will be 
excluded from the PP population. 
  
In regards to study dosing, a compliant subject is defined as one who after randomization 
missed no more than [ADDRESS_1080127] one dose of study drug. For 
safety analysis, all subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received  
 
5.4. PROTOCOL VIOLATION OR DEVIATIONS  
The Investigator and his/her designees are  required to adhere to the protocol. While 
deviations from the protocol are discouraged, they may be necessary in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to subjects or to facilitate adherence to protocol procedures.  
If protocol violations do occur as outlined in the criteria below, then the data from complete 
individual subjects, individual visits or individual evaluations may be excluded from selected analyses. The finalization of protocol violations and excluded data will be made prior to the randomizati on code being revealed.  
All protocol violations will be presented in a data listing.

6.1. GENERAL METHODS  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_785143] (AM dosing, Week 1 – 
Week 4; PM dosing, Week 5 – Week 8) . Summary statistics for continuous variables will be 
described by [CONTACT_249776] (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD) and minimum 
and maximum. For continuous efficacy variables, the standard error of the m ean (SE) may 
also be reported. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. All 
data collected will be included in the data listings.  
 
Statistical analysis and data descriptions will be carried out using SAS statistical analysis 
software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, No rth Carolina, [LOCATION_003]) version 9.3  or higher.  
 Summary statistics and analyses will be displayed for the following treatment groups:  
• trabodenoson 6.0% / latanoprost 0.005% QD  
• trabodenoson 3.0% / latanoprost 0.005% QD  
• trabodenoson 6.0% / latanoprost .0025% QD  
• latanoprost 0.005% QD  
• latanoprost 0.0025% QD  
Unless otherwise noted, the baseline value will be considered to be the most recent non-missing value (or mean value in the case of IOP) obtained prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  
 
6.2. KEY DEFINITIONS  
Mean IOP : “Mean IOP” is the average of the 2 or 3 IOP measurements per eye performed at 
each time point.  
 Study Eye : The study eye will be an eye that meets all the following criteria: (1) mean 8AM 
IOP on Placebo Run- In Visit, Day -1 , and Day 1 (AM predose) of ≥2 5 and ≤34  mmHg; and 
(2) mean IOP ≥[ADDRESS_1080129] -dose (~4PM).  If both eyes meet the above 
IOP criteria then the eye with the  highest mean 8AM IOP on Day 1 will be designated as the 
‘study’ eye. In the event that the mean IOPs in both eyes are equivalent, the right eye will arbitrarily be designated as the ‘study’ eye.  If only 1 eye meets all the Study Enrollment 
Criteria, that  eye will automatically be designated as the ‘study’ eye.  
 
First Dose Date:  The first dose date is defined as the date on which the first drop of study 
drug in treatment period is taken.  
 Last Dose Date:  The last dose date is defined as  the date on which t he last drop of study drug 
in treatment period is taken.  
 
Baseline:   
• The study baseline is the last valid mean IOP prior to the first drop  of the study drug 
(8AM on Day 1) . 
• The diurnal baseline is defined the mean IOP at the respective time point (8AM, 10AM, 
12PM and 4PM) on Day  -1 for analyzing time -matched change.

03.007A.02       INC Research © LLC  Page 26 of 49  Study Day: The study day is the current event date relative to the first dose date  in the 
treatment period . That is, the study day  = the current event date – first dose date  +[ADDRESS_1080130] dose date . Otherwise, the study day  = the current 
event date – first dose date. That is, the first dose date is Study Day 1, the day preceding the 
first dose date is Study Day –1. 
 
6.3. MISSING DATA 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after the study drug has been 
applied will not be replaced.  
The reason(s) for any premature withdrawal must be explained in detail in the CRF and source documents.  
Complete missing or partial date wil l be presented in the listings as reported on CRFs. Missing 
or incomplete onset dates for adverse events and concomitant medications will be imputed as 
needed in order to determine treatment emergence or determine the prior and concomitant 
medications. 
If an AE has a completely missing onset date, then the AE will be considered a TEAE  unless a 
non-missing stop date indicates otherwise . In cases where severity is missing for TEAEs, the 
AE will be considered to be the highest degree of severity: Severe. In cases where relationship 
information is missing for TEAEs, the AE will be considered to be related. A medication with a 
completely missing start date is considered a prior medication. A medication with a completely missing stop date is considered a concomitant medication.  
 
If an adverse event or a medication has a partial start or stop date, the following rules will be used to determine whether it is an AE or a TEAE, or a prior or concomitant medication.

The analyses will be based on visit designation. Visit dates are required within specified time 
windows relative  to Day 1 Visit (see Table 2: Schedule of Assessments ). The visits out of the 
visit window are considered protocol deviations, but the measurements at these visits are also 
include d in the analyses. If there is more than one measurement within the same visit 
designation, then the observation recorded at the time closest to the target day will be used. 
When there is more than one measurement on the same day, the latest observation will be 
used in the analyses . 
 For subjects withdrawing early, the end of study data collected (Early Termination visit) will 
be mapped to the next planned visit for summarization and analysis.  
 
6.5. SUBGROUPS 
Subgroup analyses will include:   
• Primary diagnosis – POAG versus OHT.  
• Day 1 pre -dose baseline IOP – Baseline >26 mmHg versus Baseline ≤26 mmHg.  
• Washout vs. No Washout. 
• Race: African Americans versus non -African Americans.  
• Baseline corneal thickness: ≥490 microns and ≤555 microns, >555 microns and ≤610 
microns.

03.007A.02       INC Research © LLC  Page [ADDRESS_1080132] may be withdrawn from the study under the following conditions: • Subject withdraws consent.  
• Subject’s compliance to the protocol is poor, per discretion of the Investigator.  
• Any condition that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may cause risk to the subject (also see  
Protocol Section 9.5). In this case, the Investigator will specify the reason for the subject’s 
withdrawal.  
Note: All effort will be made to capture the complete set of serial IOP measurements for the 
subject on the day of withdrawal.  
• Occurrence of a concomitant disease that violates the study protocol due to its severity or duration or due to changes in treatment being required.  
Any subject who withdraws or is withdrawn from the study should undergo the End- of-Study 
Visit procedures, preferably 7 (±1) days later, in order to assure the safe ty of the subject.  
The number of subjects receiving study treatment, including the washout and placebo run -in 
failures and the number of subjects who completed or discontinued the study and the reasons for any premature discontinuation from the study will  be summarized by [CONTACT_785144] . A by -subject listing of early withdrawal and study population will also be 
provided.  
7.2. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER  BASELINE CHARACTERIST ICS 
All baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. This will 
include age, sex, race, ethnicity, primary ophthalmic diagnosis, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), Study baseline IOP  (mean IOP at 8AM on Day 1) and Diurnal Baseline (average of 
the diurnal IOP measurement on Day -1). 
Age will be calculated as of the screening visit date using SAS functions as floor((intck('month',date_of_birth,visit_date) - (day(visit_date) < day(date_of_birth))) / 12) ; 
BMI will be calculated as BMI (kg/m2) = Weight(kg)/[Height(m) ^2].

All efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_785149] (AM 
dosing, Week 1 – Week 4 when randomized treatment is used during AM ; PM dosing, Week 5 – 
Week 8 when randomized treatment is used during PM ). 
The confidence interval and the adjusted mean s will be  computed for the study eye. IOP 
measurements  will be summarized separately for the study eye and non -study eye using 
descriptive st atistics.   
For the study eye, all the efficacy end points (both primary and secondary) will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_776699] (n, mean, median, standard deviation and range ) by 
[CONTACT_1570], and visit. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_785138] 90% and 95% CI’s  (assume standard 
normal distribution) will also be computed. In addition adjusted means (adjusts for 
differences in baseline values) and 90% and 95% CI’s , will be computed based on an Mixed 
effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM)  model with tre atment , visit, and the interaction of 
treatment and visit  as the independent variable s and baseline IOP as the covariate.   All 
efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population and PP population.  
8.1. PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT AND ANALYSIS  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the daily IOP- change from diurnal baseline (average of the 4 
diurnal changes from baseline calculated during a dosing interval) calculated at the Week 4 (after 4 weeks of AM dosing regimen) visit and the Week 8 visit  (after 4 weeks of PM dosing 
regimen) . The four IOP measurements from Day -1 are used as the diurnal baseline  for the 
analyses at both Week 4 and Week 8 .  
The daily IOP- change at Day 28 (AM dosing regimen) from diurnal baseline  is calculated as 
average of the following diurn al changes:  
Day 28 8AM IOP Change = Day 28 8AM IOP minus Day  -1 8AM IOP  
Day 28 10AM IOP Change =Day 28 10AM IOP minus Day -1 10AM IOP  
Day 28 12PM IOP Change = Day 28 12PM IOP minus Day -1 12PM IOP  
Day 28 4PM IOP Change =Day [ADDRESS_1080135] Model Repeated Measure (MMRM)  model with Daily IOP-change from diurnal baseline as 
the dependent variable, and treatment , visit, and the interaction of treatment and visit  as 
factor s, and  Daily IOP at Day -1(average IOP of the four serial time points on Day -1) as a 
covariate.  Taking into consideration  the correlation of these visits, as well as intra -visit, the 
covariance structure will  be assumed to be unstructured. In the event convergence cannot be 
attained, alternative structures will be attempted  in the following order: Toeplitz , compound 
symmetry , and then autoregressive. Least squared means (LS means) will be estimated from 
the model by [CONTACT_247072] . LS means for each treatment group at Day 28 and 
Day 56 will be estimated using LS means from the MMRM model. The comparison of the

following pair-wise treatment comparisons will be made between treatment groups : 
 
• Trabodenoson 6.0%/ Latanoprost 0.005% vs Latanoprost 0.005% only;  
• Trabodenoson 6.0%/ Latanoprost 0.0025% vs Latanoprost 0.0025% only;  
• Trabodenoson 3.0%/ Latanoprost 0. 005% vs Latanoprost 0.005% only.  
• All three groups of  Trabodenoson / Latanoprost vs. Latanoprost 0.005%  
• Trabodenoson 6.0%/ Latanoprost 0.005% AND Trabodenoson 3.0%/ Latanoprost 0.005%      
vs. Latan oprost  0.005%. 
 The distribution of the data will be visually examined, and t he residuals from the MMRM 
model will be investigated for normality using the univariate Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk W -test. The 
primary endpoint, as well as parameters that do not meet th e assumptions of a normal 
distribution  will also be analyzed using a non -parametric version of the MMRM model above, 
utilizing ranked IOP post -baseline data.  The Media n, Q1, and Q3 will be summarized for each 
treatment group and combined treatment group  and the p -values will be presented for the 
pairwise treatment differences of  LS mean differences of rank at each visit .   
 The effect of AM dosing vs PM dosing will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_785150] ( or Day 28) and PM dosing (or Day 56) within each 
treatmen t. The LS mean will be estimated from the model by [CONTACT_785151].  The within subject correlation will  be adjusted by [CONTACT_785152].   
 The daily IOP change from diurnal baseline will be descriptively summarized for the following subgroups: 
• Primary diagnosis – POAG versus OHT.  
• Day 1 pre -dose baseline IOP – Baseline > 26 mmHg versus Baseline ≤26 mmHg.  
• Washout vs. No Washout.  
• Race: African Americans versus non -African Americans.  
• Baseline corneal thickness: ≥490 microns and ≤555 microns, >555 microns and ≤610 
microns.  
 
8.2. SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  AND ANALYSES  
The following secondary analyses will be performed.  
8.2.1. Daily IOP  
Daily IOP, the average of the 4 serial IOPs taken during a dosing interval , will be calculated at 
the Week 4 visit  (Day 28 – after 4 weeks of AM dosing regimen ) and the Week 8 visit  (Day 56 – 
after 4 weeks of PM dosing regimen ).

model as section 8.1, with Daily IOP as the dependent variable, treatment , visit, and the 
interaction of treatment and visit  as factors , and Daily IOP at Day -1 (average IOP of the four 
serial time points on Day  -1) as a covariate.  
The mean daily IOP vs visit day will be plotted by [CONTACT_1570].  
8.2.2. Daily IOP –change from Study Baseline  
A change from study baseline (8AM Day 1 predose IOP) analysis will be performed.    
The endpoint  at Day 28 (after 4 weeks of AM dosing) is calculated as the average of the 
following:  
Day 28 8AM IOP Change from study baseline =Day 28 8AM IOP minus Day 1 8AM PRE -DOSE IOP  
Day 28 10AM IOP  Change from study baseline  = Day 28 10AM IOP minus Day 1 8AM PRE -DOSE 
IOP  
Day 28 12PM IOP Change from study baseline = Day 28 12PM IOP minus Day 1 8AM PRE-DOSE 
IOP  
Day 28 4PM IOP  Change from study baseline  =Day 28 4PM IOP minus Day 1 8AM PRE -DOSE IOP   
 
The endpoint at Day 56 will be calculated similarly.  
Daily IOP – change from study baseline on Day 28  and Day 56 will be analyzed using  the same 
MMRM model, with Daily IOP as the dependent variable, treatment , visit, and the interaction 
of treatment and visit  as factor s, and study baseline (Day 1 8AM pre -dose IOP)  as a covariate.  
8.2.3. Mean IOP at 8AM, 10AM, 12PM and 4PM   
A mean IOP at each time point will be calculated for the subject’s study eye at the end of 
week [ADDRESS_1080136] randomization from the pre -randomization circadian 
curve, will be calculated at the end of the 4 weeks of treatment (Day 28 AM dosing, and Day

8.2.3 , with diurnal baseline of the corresponding time point on Day -1 as a covariate.   
8.2.5. IOP Change from Study Baseline 
IOP change from study baseline, calculated as the change in IOP from 8AM Day 1 baseline IOP, 
is comput ed at the end of the 4 weeks of treatment (Day 28 AM dosing, and Day 56 PM dosing) 
for each of the doses/combinations tested.  
IOP Change from study baseline at 8AM  will be analyzed using the s ame MMRM  model as 
section 8.2.3 , with Day 1 pre-dose IOP at  8AM as a covariate .  
8.3. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES

• Washout failure population is defined in the protocol, but not used. It is thus 
removed from the SAP. 
• 90% confidence intervals have been included, in addition to the 95% confidence 
intervals.  
• An exploratory analysis on daily IOP change from diurnal baseline, excluding “non- responders” to latanoprost has been added.  
• The LCVA analysis will only be performed on the ITT population  due the small 
sample size in the Per -Protocol Population.

03.007A.02       INC Research © LLC  Page 46 of 49  12.2.5. Body of the Data Display  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Conventions  
Data in columns of a table or listing should be formatted as follows:  
• alphanumeric values are left -justified; 
• whole numbers (e.g., counts) are right -justified; and  
• numbers containing fractional portions are decimal aligned.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Table Conventions  
• Units will be included where available  
• All tables have their source listing referenced in a footnote  
• If the categories of a parameter are ordered, then all categories between the 
maximum and minimum category should be presented in the table, even if n=0 for 
all treatment groups in a given category that is between the minimum and maximum level for that parameter. For example, the frequency distribution for symptom severity would  appear as:  
Severity 
Rating  N 
severe  0 
moderate  8 
mild 3 
Where percentages are presented in these tables, zero percentages will not be 
presented and so any counts of 0 will be presented as 0 and not as 0 (0%).  
• If the categories are not ordered (e.g., Medical History, Reasons for Discontinuation 
from the Study, etc.), then only those categories for which there is at least [ADDRESS_1080152] represented in 1 or more groups should be included.  
• An Unknown or Missing category should be added to any parameter for which information is not available for 1 or more subjects.  
• Unless otherwise specified, the estimated mean and median for a set of values 
should be printed out to [ADDRESS_1080153] error should be printed out to 2 more significant digits than 
the original values. The minimum and maximum should report the same significant digits as the original values. For example, for systolic blood pressure:  
N   XX 
Mean  XXX.X  
Std Dev       X.XX  
Std Error       X.XX  
Median  XXX.X  
Minimum  XXX

• P-values should be output in the format: “0.xxx”, where xxx is the value rounded to 
3 decimal places. Any p -value less than 0.001 will be presented as <0.001. If the 
p-value should be less than 0.0001 then present as <0.0001. If the p-value is 
returned as >0.999 then present as >0.999  
• Percentage values should be printed to one decimal place, in parentheses with no 
spaces, one space after the count (e.g., 7 (12.8%), 13 (5.4%)). Pre-determine how to 
display v alues that round down to 0.0.  A common convention is to display as '<0.1', 
or as appropriate with additional decimal places . Unless otherwise noted, for all 
percentages, the number of subjects in the analysis set for the treatment group who 
have an observation will be the denominator. Percentages after zero counts should not be displayed and percentages equating to 100% should be presented as 100%, 
without any decimal places.  
• Tabular display of data for medical history, prior / concomitant medications, an d all 
tabular displays of adverse event data should be presented by [CONTACT_150154], 
treatment  class, or SOC with the highest occurrence in the active treatment group 
in decreasing order, assuming all terms are coded. Within the body system, drug class and  SOC, medical history (by [CONTACT_11702]), drugs (by [CONTACT_61094]1 code), and 
adverse events (by [CONTACT_11702]) should be displayed in decreasing order. If incidence for more than 1 term is identical, they should then be sorted alphabetically. Missing descriptive statistics or p -values which cannot be estimated 
should be reported as “ -”. 
• The percentage of subjects is normally calculated as a proportion of the number of 
subjects assessed in the relevant treatment group (or overall) for the analysis set 
presented. However, careful consideration is required in many instances due to the 
complicated nature of selecting the denominator, usually the appropriate number of subjects exposed. Describe details of this in footnotes or programming notes.  
• For categorical summari es (number and percentage of subjects) where a subject can 
be included in more than one category, describe in a footnote or programming note if the subject should be included in the summary statistics for all relevant categories or just 1 category and the criteria for selecting the criteria.  
• Where a category with a subheading (such as system organ class) has to be split over 
more than one page, output the subheading followed by “(cont)” at the top of each 
subsequent page.  The overall summary statistics for  the subheading should only be 
output on the first relevant page.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Listing Conventions  
• Listings will be sorted for presentation in order of treatment groups as above, 
subject number, visit/collection day, and visit/collection time.

03.007A.02       INC Research © LLC  Page 48 of 49  • Missing data should be represented on subject listings as either a hyphen (“ -”) with 
a corresponding footnote (“- = unknown or not evaluated”), or as “N/A”, with the 
footnote “N/A = not applicable”, whichever is appropriate. 
• Dates should be printed in SAS® DATE9.format (“ddM MMyyyy ”: 01JUL2000). Missing 
portions of dates should be represented on subject listings as dashes ( --JUL2000). 
Dates that are missing because they are not applicable for the subject are output as 
“N/A”, unless otherwise specified.  
• All observed time values must be presented using a 24 -hour clock HH:MM or 
HH:MM:SS format (e.g., 11:26:45, or 11:26). Time will only be reported if it was 
measured as part of the study.  
• Units will be included where available . The unit associated with a variable will be 
presented only once within parentheses either below or next to that variable in the heading portion.  
• In the case that a subject’s record has been continued to the next page, an 
appropriate identification (eg., subject ID number) must be presented at the 
beginning of t hat page.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Figure Conventions  
• Unless otherwise specified, for all figures, study visits will be displayed on the X- axis 
and endpoint ( e.g., treatment mean change from Baseline) values will be displayed 
on the Y -axis. 
 
12.2.6. Footnotes  
• A solid line spanning the margins will separate the body of the data display from the 
footnotes.  
• All footnotes will be left justified with single -line spacing immediately below the 
solid line underneath the data display.  
• Footnotes should always begin with  “Note:” if an informational footnote, or 1, 2, 3, 
etc. if a reference  footnote. Each new footnote should start on a new line  where 
possible. 
• Subject specific footnotes should be avoided , where possible . 
• Footnotes will be used sparingly and must add value to the table, figure, or data listing. If more than six lines of  footnotes are planned, then a cover page may be 
used to display footnotes, and only those essential to comprehension of the data will 
be re peated on each page.  
• The last line of the footnote section will be a standard source line that indicates the 
name [CONTACT_150184], date the program was run, 
and the listing source (i.e., ‘Program : myprogram.sas    Listing source: 16.x.y.z’).

SAS programs are developed to produce clinical trial output such as analysis data sets, 
summary tables, data listings, figures or statistical analyses. INC Research  SOP 03.010 
and 03.013 provide an overview of the development of such SAS programs.  
INC Research  SOP 03.009 describe s the quality control procedures that are performed 
for all SAS programs and output. Quality control is defined here as the operational 
techniques and activities undertaken to verify that the SAS programs produce the proper clinical trial output by [CONTACT_150155], efficiency and commenting and by [CONTACT_150170].

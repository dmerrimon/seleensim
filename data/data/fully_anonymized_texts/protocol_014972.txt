 4 1.0 Background  
 
According to the 2005 -2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) , 
approximately [ADDRESS_187037] 
important modifiable risk factor for kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and stroke.2-5 
Comorbidities such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], obesity, and insulin resistance account for additional  
cardiovascular risk. T hese cardiovascular risk factors comprise the  metabolic syndrome, which i n 
turn increases the risk of type 2 diabetes  (T2DM) . Diabetes has also been associated with a 
dramatically increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and renal failure.6 It is estimated that more than 
24 million people in the [LOCATION_002] ha ve diabetes. In t hese individuals , the prevalence of 
hypertension is 1.5 to 3 times greater than in sex -aged -matched controls.7,8  
 
   Given the additive cardiovascular risk of diabetes and hypertension, blood pressure goals in 
diabetic subjects are ≤ 130/80 mm Hg, as defined by [CONTACT_11026] (ADA) 9 
and the Seventh Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7).10 The evidence that supports the lower bl ood pressure 
goals in diabetic patients comes from large controlled studies, such as The [LOCATION_008] 
Prospective Diabetes Study ([LOCATION_006]PDS), which demonstrated a 45% reduction in relative risk of 
fatal and non -fatal stroke with tight BP control, with a BP 1 0/5 mm Hg lower than the group 
randomized to less controlled.11 Similarly, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study showed a 
50% reduction in cardiovascular disease in the group randomized to achieve a diastolic blood 
pressure below [ADDRESS_187038] proven to be effective, however only few 
patients are able to achieve blood pressure control with those interven tions.13 The JNC 7 guidelines 
recommend starting both antihypertensive medication and lifestyle modifications in patients with 
diabetes when hypertension is diagnosed.10 Among the antihypertensive drugs available, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the first -line therapy in patients with 
hypertension and diabetes, according to guidelines from the ADA, the NKF, the World Health 
Organization, and the JNC 7. 9,10,14,15 
 
To reduce the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and renal failure in patients with 
both diabetes and hypertension, it is also important to achieve a good glycemic control. Among 
the anti -diabetic agents, dipepti dyl-peptidase -4 (DP P-4) inhibitors are novel anti -diabetic agen ts. 
These drugs inhibit the DPP [ADDRESS_187039] DPP -4 inhibitor 
approved by [CONTACT_1622] w as sitagliptin. Since its approval in 2006 this drug has become one of the 
leading branded oral anti -diabetic agents in the [LOCATION_002].17 DPP-4 inhibitors offer advantages 
over commonly used anti -diabetic agents, such as a glucose -dependent mechanism of  action and 
lack of weight gain.18,19,20 However, there is information that remains to be known regarding 
safety, effica cy and drug interactions of DPP 4 inhibitors.

 5 2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Hypertension and diabetes are important modifiable morbidity and mortality risk factors. The 
prevalence of hypertension is nearly 1 billion worldwide.21 On the other hand; approximately [ADDRESS_187040] line therapy in patients with 
diabetes and hypertension are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because of its 
renoprotective and antithrombotic  properties . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_161207] -diabetic drugs 
available, it remains difficult to achieve  adequate glycemic control. DPP 4 inhibitors are a 
promising new anti -diabetic drug class. By [CONTACT_161218] 4 enzyme, they 
prevent the  degradation of  incretins GLP -1 and GIP, which increase the release of insulin, suppress 
glucagon release, and delay gastric emptying.16  
 
Notably, DPP4 enzyme intervenes in the degradation of several vasoactive peptides such as 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), Neuropeptide Y (1 -36), Peptide YY (1 -36), and substance P 
(SP).23 The ubiquitous nature of this enzyme would translate into diverse hemodynamic ef fects, 
and could potentially result in diverse drug interactions, as it was ascertained by [CONTACT_161219].  
They  found that the DPP -4 inhibitor, P32/98, significantly increased blood pressure  in pre -treated 
(captopril 30 mg/kg or hydralazine 5mg/kg) adult sp ontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR).[ADDRESS_187041] induced by [CONTACT_161220] -4 inhibitor 
in that study was attributed to neuropeptide Y; nevertheless  a hypertensive effect mediated through 
other vasoactive peptides, such as substance P could not be ruled out.   
 
Substance P is pr imarily inactivated by [CONTACT_161221] -converting enzyme (ACE); under ACE 
inhibition however, DPP -[ADDRESS_187042] s of the concomitant inhibition of the 
DPP-4 enzyme and the ACE  in subjects with metabolic syndrome. The main finding of the study 
was that sitagliptin prevented the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP ) when ACE was 
fully inhibited by  [CONTACT_161222] , but not during sub -maximal ACE inhibition . Furthermore, the heart 
rate ( HR) significantly increased in response to [ADDRESS_187043] not 
12/15/16  
 
 6 been fully characterized  in humans. Neuropeptide Y is co -stored with norepi[INVESTIGATOR_161208]. Neuropeptide Y is degraded to neuropeptide Y (3 -
36) by [CONTACT_149789]4. Whereas neuropeptide Y causes vasoconstriction via the  Y1 receptor and amplifies 
adrenergic (α1) -mediated vasoconstriction, neuropeptide Y (3 -36) has no effect at the Y1 receptor 
and suppresses release of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_161209] Y via presynaptic Y2 receptors. In 
support of a contribution of neuropept ide Y to the hypertensive effects of DPP4 inhibition, Jackson 
et al have reported that DPP4 inhibition elevates BP in spontaneously hypertensive rats pre -treated 
with an ACE inhibitor, but not those pre -treated with a ganglionic blocker; moreover, the 
hype rtensive effect of DPP4 inhibition was blocked by [CONTACT_27180] a selective Y1 antagonist .[ADDRESS_187044] notable effects on 
catecholamine release and vasoconstriction via  neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor activation irrespe ctive 
of anti -hypertensive use. ( Figure 1 ) Understanding these mechanisms of neuropeptide Y will 
provide insight to DPP4 inhibition effects and future potential therapeutic targets for the treatment 
of hypertension.  
 
 
Specific Aim  1: 
To test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition decreases degradation of neuropeptide Y to 
neuropeptide Y (3 -36), resulti ng in increased vasoconstriction (decreased fore arm blood flow)  and 
increased sympathetic activation in individuals with T2DM.  
 
 
Hypotheses : 
1a) We hypothesize that DPP4 inhibition, due to decreased degradation of neuropeptide Y to 
neuropeptide (3 -36), will lead to increased vasoconstriction, evidenced by [CONTACT_161223] (FBF) , and will increase norepi[INVESTIGATOR_161210] (1 -36) concentrat ions compared to 
placebo.  
1b) We hypothesize that Power Spectral Analysis will demonstrate  increased sympathetic 
activation (i.e. higher LF/HF RRI ratio) after higher neuropeptide Y concentrations are 
administered.  
1c) W e hypothesize that with combined ACE and DPP4 inhibition, there will be increased 
substance P dependent release of neuropeptide Y (rather than an interactive effect of ACE an d 
DPP4 inhibition directly on neuropeptide Y  degradation).  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_187045] with neurokinin -1 
(NK 1), NK 2, NK 3 receptors.34 Its effects however, are mainly mediated by [CONTACT_66150] 1 receptor. This 
peptide is widely distributed in enteric, peripheral , and central nervous system s. SP is involved in 
a wide variety of mechanisms, such as pain perception, nociception, emesis,  and inflammatory 
responses.35,36 The e vidence suggests  that SP is also involved in cardiovascular regulation . 
12/15/[ADDRESS_187046] of  substance P in the nucleus of the tractus 
solitarious (NTS) and its effect in the modulation of cardiovascular function.37,38,39,[ADDRESS_187047], GR2051 71, on baroreflex bradycardia inhibition observed during the defense 
reaction triggered by [CONTACT_161224]. The bilateral microinjection of SP in NTS produced an immediate and brief (6 -7 min) increase 
in MBP (+25±2 mm Hg from a baseline of 84±1 mm Hg, P<0.05) and a concomitant decrease in 
HR ( -45±7 bpm from a baseline of  334±5 bpm, P<0.05). Moreover , bilateral microi njections of 
SP into the NTS produced a dose -dependent inhibition of phenylephrine evoked -cardiac response 
and aortic cardiac response which was reversed by [CONTACT_161225]1 receptors antagonist, 
GR205171.[ADDRESS_187048].41 SP increased MAP and HR +31.4±2.5 mm Hg and +190±13.[ADDRESS_187049], muscinol.41 Similarly, the microinjection of substance P in the 
nucleus of the amigdala centralis also elicit s pressor responses, whereas pre -injection with [D -
Pro2, D-Phe7, D-Trp9]-SP, a substance P antagonist, in the same area attenuated the pressor 
response to glutamate.42  
 
The mechanism underlying the pressor actions and heart rate responses are attributed to 
sympato -adrenal stimulations, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_161226].30,31,32 Unger et al reported increased BP, HR , and sympathetic nerve activity (splenic, 
renal , and adre nal nerves) in conscious rats. Th ey found that the acute administration of 1 µg of 
substance P increased the sympathetic nerve activity by +  85%, + 147%, and +  63%, respectively  
(P < 0.001).32 In a similar fashion, Dzurik et al demonstrated that substance P increases 
sympathetic outflow in humans, as evidenced by a decrease muscle sympathetic nerve activity 
(MSNA) with the administration of the NK -[ADDRESS_187050] of enal april (10 mg) in patients with metabolic syndrome. Mean arterial blood pressure 
changes were -7.9±2.4 mm Hg with placebo plus enalapril , whereas MAP was -0.9±0.9±2.[ADDRESS_187051] was only evidenced  with 10 mg of 
enalapril, but not with 5 mg. Moreover, the HR significantly increased in response to 10 mg 
enalapril plus sitagliptin. This was also associated with increased in plasma catecholamine levels , 
which suggests an increased sympathetic outflow.29 We p roposed that the effects on blood 
pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic activity could be due to an unrestrained amount of substance 
P, secondary to the inhibition of the two main enzymes involved in its degradation.29 
 
In addition, neuropeptide Y (NPY) has previously been administered intra -arterially in humans. 
Nilsson et al infused 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 nmol/min of NPY (total concentration for each 1mL/min) 
to the brachial artery. They reported a dose dependent reduction in forearm blood flow. During the 
highest dose infusion of NPY, forearm blood flow was reduced from 4.3 +2.0 to 2.3 +1.2 
12/15/16  
 
 8 mL/min/100mL. These findings did not differ significantly between subjects with or without 
hypertension .49  
 
Similarly, Clarke and colleagues studied intra -arterial NPY administration. They also found that 
among their study population (normotensive subjects) NPY decreased forearm blood flow in a 
dose dependent manner. At maximal dose of 1,000 pmol/min administered for 6 minutes, the mean 
decrease in forearm blood flow  was from 3.8 +0.6 to 1.8 +0.2 ml/100ml/min .50  
 
NPY has also been administered intravenously in humans. Ullman et al studied intravenous doses 
of NPY: 3, 10, 30 pmol/min/kg infused at a rate of 1ml/min over 20 min and bolus infusions of 
90, 200, or 900 pmol /kg in healthy subjects. Forearm blood flow was not measured in this study, 
however, arterial blood pressure increased with increasing doses of NPY, and this effect was 
attributed to vasoconstriction (baseline MAP 94 +2 mmHg compared to 104 +[ADDRESS_187052] 
dose NPY) .51  
 
Finally, Schuerch et al studied 12 healthy subjects who received intravenous phenylephrine with 
or without one of two doses of NPY: 1.4 and 14.3 pmol/kg/min for a total of 90min. Subjects who 
received higher doses of NPY were noted to ha ve lower forearm blood flow and increased forearm 
vascular resistance, and these effects were more prominent with increased doses of co -
administered phenylephrine .52  
 
In agreement with this, Linder and colleagues evaluated healthy subjects who received 
phenylephrine administration with and without combined NPY at concentrations of 1 or 30 
pmol/min. They found that the effects were synergistic, meaning that even at relatively small doses 
of NPY, NPY can potentiate α -adrenergic effects .53

6.0 Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is  vasoconstriction measured by [CONTACT_161231] (FBF) ( Standard 
Techniques ), and the primary analysis will focus on  comparing this endpoint in the setting of 
placebo  administration  or sitagliptin, and enalaprilat vs enalaprilat plus sitagliptin .  
 
 
Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include  comparisons of  catecholamine concentrations, neuropeptide Y  and 
neuropeptide Y (3 -36) during each intervention . Seconda ry mechanistic analyses include  
comparison s of additional measurements during sitagliptin versus placebo and during 
sitagliptin+enalaprilat versus sitagliptin alone to determine the effects of sitagliptin and concurrent 
DPP4 and local ACE inhibition on sympathetic activation and hemodynamic parameters: Power 
spectral analysis (as a measure of sympathetic/ vagal tone), MAP,  BP, and HR.  Additional 
laboratory analysis  will include: ACE activity, DPP4 activity, tPA, and glucose homeostasis 
biomarke rs (plasma glucose,  insulin , and GLP -1). 
 
 
 
7.0 Study Procedures  
 
Screening Visit  1: After informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo a medical history 
and physical examination. During this and all visits to the CRC we will measure blood pressure 
three times , every two minutes  as described under Standard Techniques . We will measu re 
weight, height, and hips and waist (horizontal umbilicus) circumference to 0.5 cm precision in 
triplicate. We will use a spring -loaded tape measure (Gulick II by [CONTACT_161232], Gay 
Mills,WI) for these measurements to ensure the tightness of the tap e is consistent.  We will obtain 
screening laboratory tests including: electrolytes, serum creatinine, fasting glucose level, complete 
blood count, liver enzymes, lipid profile, hemoglobin A1C, prothrombin time/ international 
normalized ratio (PT/INR), and urinalysis . Data will be transferred using the REDCap Dynamic 
Data Pull (DDP) to enable transfer of relevant study related data directly from the Vanderbilt 
Research Derivative , if available . 
 
Screening Visit 2: subjects who se screening labs are adequate  will return to the CRC to undergo 
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).  
 
Medication withdrawal:  Subjects taking medications that may alter forearm blood flow  (for 
example  non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs,  beta blockers, ACE -inhibitor s, stimulant 
medications , etc ) will be asked to withhold this medication during the washout period and 
12/15/16  
 
 13 throughout the remainder of the study. Female subjects taking oral contraceptives will be asked to 
continue the same regimen throughout the duration of the study.  
 
Medication Visit: Subject s will be asked to come to the CRC at least [ADDRESS_187058] of childbearing 
potential  undergo β-HCG testing . Subjects  will be instructed on how to take the medication .   
 
Study days : During each study day s ubjects will be asked to  report to the CRC in the morning  in 
a fasting state to undergo serial blood pressure and heart rate measurements.  Subjects will be asked 
not to exercise for at least 48 hours prior to each study day  and to refrain from alcohol and caffeine 
intake for 1 week prior to each study day .  
 
Subjects will be studied in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a temperature -controlled room. Upon arrival, 
female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo  pregnancy testing. Baseline hemodynamic 
monitoring (BP, HR, MAP, repeated three times), will be obtained, followed by [CONTACT_161233] . An indwelling IV catheter will be placed in the non-dominant arm  
along with one blood pressure c uff. On the non -dominant arm, an intra -arterial line ( Standard 
Techniques ) will be placed by a trained study physician . Forearm blood flow (FBF) cuffs will be 
placed on the same arm as the intra -arterial line.  
Fifty minutes after study drug administration, subjects will undergo Power Spectral Analysis 
(Standard Techniques ) followed by [CONTACT_161234] : baseline  catecholamines  
(venous and arterial) , tPA (venous and arterial) , insulin, GLP -1, BG , substance P,  neuropeptide Y 
including total and (3 -36)), DPP4 and ACE activity levels.   
Starting at time  point  1 hour, we will  give NPY ( U-1230, Clinalfa, Bachem AG) in doses of 0.1, 
0.3, and 1.0 nmol/min  intra-arterially via the brachial artery catheter . Each dose will be infused for 
[ADDRESS_187059] simultaneous venous samples for substance P , NPY and 
its fragments, and arterial and venous catecholamines (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) . After the first series of 
NPY infusions is complete, Power S pectral Analysis will be repeated . The finger blood pressure 
cuff for Power Spectral Analysis will be placed on the contralateral arm as the arterial line. In 
addition,  venous samples will be collected to measure  insulin and blood glucose and venous and 
arterial samples will be collected to measure tPA after completion of the first set of NPY infusions.  
Ninety min after the last dose of NPY , enalaprilat will be infused via the brachial artery  catheter 
at 0.33 µg/min/100mL. Twenty minutes later, the Power Spectral Analysis will be rep eated. After 
this is completed over ten minutes ( thus time point [ADDRESS_187060] NPY infusion) , we will repeat a second NPY infusion at the same rates as previous ly 
described . Again, we will  collect venous samples prior to and at the end of each dose of NPY  to 
measure NPY and its fragments, substance P , and venous and arterial samples to measure 
catecholamines  (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) . In addition, venous samples for GLP -1, insulin, blood glucose, 
DPP4 and ACE activity levels as well as venous and arterial tPA will be collected just prior to the 
initiation of the  second  set of NPY infusion s. We will measure FBF at the end of each dose of 
NPY, similar to during the firs t infusion.  At the end of the NPY infusion, Power Spectral Analysis 
will be repeated  and venous insuli n and blood gl ucose as well as venous and arterial tPA will be 
collected.  
Hemodynamic monitoring will include MAP, BP, HR via blood pressure cuff, measure d at 
baseline, at the start of both NPY infusion periods, and at the end of each dose administered.  
 
12/15/16  
 
 14 After 4 week washout, subjects will undergo a second treatment period using the opposite drug 
(sitagliptin or placebo) and repeat the study day.  
 
 
 
DNA samples:  A blood sample for DNA analysis will be drawn once during the study and will be 
stored for analysis of genetic markers related to subject’s susceptibility to the development of 
hypertension, cardiovascular disease , metabolic alterations , and/or re sponse to treatment. This 
sample is not required for participation in the study. Genetic information will be linked with data 
collected during the conduct of this trial. As the rel ationships between genes and  diseases become 
less equivocal, it might be pos sible to predict an individual’s susceptibility to a disease, its 
prognosis, and the response to treatment.  Bloo d specimens will be coded. C odes will not include 
any identification information; such as name, date of birth, or medical record number. Only st udy 
key personnel will have access to those codes. The identity of each code will be kept in a file in an 
encrypted computer.  
 
 
8.0 Risks of Investigational Agents/Devices (side effects)  
 
Risks/Inconvenience  
 
 Insertion of venous catheters may cause bleeding, bruising , or infection.  
 Frequent blood draws can  cause anemia . 
 Spending study days at the CRC can be inconvenient for subjects.  
 It has been reported that vildagliptin, a DPP -[ADDRESS_187061] 4 weeks . The half -life of 
sitagliptin is 12 hours , therefore  it is unlikely that subjects develop angioedema.  
 Sitagliptin can cause hypoglycemia, peripheral edema, or nausea. In addition, s itagliptin can 
rarely increase the risk of pancreatitis; however, this is not likely to occur given the short 
duration of the study and the exclusion of subjects with past medical history o f pancreatitis.  
 The FDA has warned  that dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin, 
saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin may cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling. 
After the patients discontinued the DPP -4 inhibitor medicine, their symptoms were relieved,  
usually in less than a month. Some patients developed severe joint pain again when they restarted 
the same medicine or another DPP -4 inhibitor.  
 Enalaprilat theoretically increases the risk of hypotension; although, generally this does not 
lower blood pressure significantly in individuals with normal blood pressure .  
 Insertion of brachial artery and venous catheters may cause bleeding, bruising, or infection. 
Insertion of a brachial artery catheter may cause damage to the artery or thro mbosis. This is 
potentially serious and could result in loss of blood supply to the arm, requiring intra -arterial 
administration of fibrinolytic agents and/or surgery. Complications arising from arterial line 
insertion are usually seen in the setting of lo w flow and prolonged arterial line placement, neither 
of which occur in these protocols. We have conducted studies involving the insertion of brachial 
artery catheters safely in over 400 subjects. We will limit subjects to two arterial line study days.  
12/15/16  
 
 15  We will use lidocaine to numb the skin prior to the insertion of the brachial artery catheter. 
Lidocaine can cause numbness and burning and/or local rash or irritation in subjects who are 
allergic to it.   
 Not exercising or taking caffeine, anti -inflammatori es for 48hours   
 
 
Protection against risk  
 
 A nurse or physician will be present at all times during the study days.  
 Subjects with a hematocrit less than 35% will be excluded from study.  
 We will exclude any subject with a history of angioedema.  
 We will monitor BP and HR and rhythm throughout each study day.  
 We will exclude individuals with a history of pancreatitis  
 We will ask subjects to monitor their home glucoses for hypoglycemia.  
 We are limiting each subject to participation in two arterial line study days  to minimize risk of 
thrombosis.  
 A trained study physician will insert the arterial line . 
 We are giving NPY locally so as to avoid systemic effects.  
 
 
Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
If at any time the blood glucose is determined to be a t an unsafe level (sustained > 3 00mg/dL 
or < 70mg/dL), the subject will be withdrawn from the study.   
If the subject experiences significant side effects, allergic reaction, or other concerning signs/ 
symptoms related to study day procedures or medications as d etermined by [CONTACT_5989], 
the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
The subject may withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Arm [ADDRESS_187062] vascular blood flow, such as: non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs, oral estrogens, ACE inhibitors if used for microalbuminuria (not for 
purposes of hypertension, a s this is an exclusion criteria), beta blockers, or medications that may 
affect sympathetic tone including stimulants. Following washout and seven days before the first 
study day, subjects will receive the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan 160mg/d.  
12/15/[ADDRESS_187063] will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_187064] will undergo two treatment periods separated by a 4 week washout. Subjects will 
receive either sitagliptin 100mg/d for one week or matching placebo in  random order. On the last 
day of each treatment, subjects will report to the CRC after an overnight fast for the first study 
day. After 4 week washout, subjects will undergo a second treatment period using the opposite 
drug (sitagliptin or placebo) and re peat the study day.  
The primary and secondary endpoints will be the same for this sub -study as they are in the 
previous study protocol. Also, subjects will undergo the same procedures for Screening Visit 1, 
Screening Visit 2, and the Medication Visits.  
On the study day, subjects will be studied in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a temperature -controlled 
room. Upon arrival, female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo pregnancy testing. 
Baseline hemodynamic monitoring (BP, HR, MAP, repeated three times) wi ll be obtained, 
followed by [CONTACT_161235]. An indwelling IV catheter will be placed in the non -dominant arm and a blood pressure 
cuff will be placed on the dominant arm. On the non -dominant arm, an intra -arterial line will be 
placed by a trained study physician. Forearm blood flow (FBF) cuffs will be placed on the same 
arm as the intra -arterial line.  
Fifty minutes after study drug administration, subjects will undergo Power Spectral A nalysis 
followed by [CONTACT_161234]: baseline catecholamines (venous and arterial), tPA 
(venous and arterial), insulin, GLP -1, BG, substance P, neuropeptide Y including total and (3 -
36)), DPP4 and ACE activity levels.  
Starting at time point  1 hour, we will give NPY (U -1230, Clinalfa, Bachem AG) in doses of 0.1, 
0.3, and 1.0 nmol/min intra -arterially via the brachial artery catheter. Each dose will be infused 
for [ADDRESS_187065] simultaneous venous samples for substance  P, NPY 
and its fragments, and arterial and venous catecholamines (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). After the NPY 
infusion is complete, Power Spectral Analysis will be repeated. The finger blood pressure cuff 
for Power Spectral Analysis will be placed on the contralateral  arm as the arterial line. In 
addition, venous samples will be collected to measure insulin and blood glucose and venous and 
arterial samples will be collected to measure tPA after completion of the NPY infusion. 
Hemodynamic monitoring will include MAP, BP , HR via blood pressure cuff, measured at 
baseline, at the start of the NPY infusion period, and at the end of each dose administered.  
After 4 week washout, subjects will undergo a second treatment period using the opposite drug 
(sitagliptin or placebo) and repeat the study day.  
 
Valsartan Risks  
12/15/16  
 
 17 Common risks of valsartan include diarrhea, high blood potassium, and low blood pressure. 
Uncommon risks include headache, dizziness, and excessive tiredness. Rarely, valsartan can 
cause fainting.  
 
(Of note, enalaprilat will not be infused for this specific study protocol)  
 
 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_187066] medical event will be classified 
as an adverse event, regardless of its causal relations hip with the study. An adverse event it is 
considered to be serious if it results in: death, life -threatening condition, requires inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Serious adverse events 
will be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) and the IRB within 10 
days of the PI’s notification of the event . Non-serious adverse events will be reported at the time 
of continuing review.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_161212]. The report will 
include: the number of adverse events and an explanation of how each event was handled, the 
number of complaints and how each complaint was handled, the number of subject withdrawal s 
with an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was withdrawn, and the number of instances 
of noncompliance with the protocol  with explanation. Before submission, the report will be 
reviewed i nternally by [CONTACT_978] .

10.[ADDRESS_187068] of NPY on FBF.49 
Specifically, in normotensives NPY reduced FBF from 4.3 to ~3.55±2.0, ~2.91±1.5, and 2.3±1.2 
mL/min/100mL at 0.3, 1, and 3 nmol/min NPY, respectively. With a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_187069], a sample size of 18 will provide a power of 93% 
to detect an increase in vasoconstriction at the 0.3 nmol/min NPY dose during sitagliptin from 
FBF 3.55 to 2.3 mL/min/100mL (i.e., comparable to the 3 -nmol/min dose in the absence of 
sitagliptin or a 10 -fold shift to the left in the dose -response curve) and a power of 61% to detect 
an increase in vasoconstriction at 1 nmol/min NPY from 2.91 to 2.3 mL/min/100mL (a 3 -fold shift 
to the left in the dose -response curve). Based on prior studie s of the effect of ACE inhibition on 
the vasodilator response to bradykinin we expect to see at least an [ADDRESS_187070] dropouts.  
 
We will recruit a small number of healthy individuals (5) to inform us of the difference s in vascular 
pathophysiology in persons with diabetes compared to non -diabetics.  
 
 
Data Analysis Plan  
 
We are using a 2x2 crossover design. Although we have designed the study with a prolonged [ADDRESS_187071] approach described in Section 
2.3 (page 21) of Jones and Kenwood.118 Second, we will take additional baseline measurement of 
key study endpoints right before study subjects take study medication ( placebo or sitagliptin ) in 
both treatment periods. This will allow us to estim ate any residual carryover effect using  the 
following described mixed effects models with factor [ADDRESS_187072] effec t and with treatment factor 1 
(sitagliptin versus placebo) and treatment factor 2 (absence or presence of enalaprilat) as fixed 
effects. We will evaluate treatment effects and interactions using properly set up contrast in the 
mixed -effect models. We will include gender, race, and glucose as covariates. In addition to 
evaluating treatment effects and interactions using regression analyses, we will calculate within -
subject mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for specific effects of interest and tes t for 
treatment effects using paired t -test or sign rank test as appropriate.  
12/15/[ADDRESS_187073] all hypothesis at the level of α=0.05. We will use SPSS for Windows (Ve rsion 22.0, SPSS, 
Chicago) and the open source statistical package R (version 2.12, R Development Core Team, 
2006) for analyses.  
 
Because subjects who drop out will be replaced and based on prior experience, missing data will 
be unusual. Nevertheless, if d ata are missing for a particular time point, mixed -effects models are 
robust in that subjects with missing data at some time points can be included to estimate effects of 
interest. In addition, we will conservatively impute missing data to perform corrobor ative analyses 
with and without missing data.  
 
Interim analysis  
 
Due to the size of the project, with 18 subjects (9 male, 9 female), there is no plan for an interim 
analysis.  
 
 
Data Management and Quality Control  
 
We will use the Vanderbilt REDCap system to design an electronic data collection form. This form 
will be tested before its use . The form allows for direct  data entry by [CONTACT_161236]. Clinical data, including clinical 
laboratory  values , will be entered by [CONTACT_54340].  Research laboratory data will be entered 
by [CONTACT_17033].  A unique identification case number will be used to protect the 
confidentiality of the study par ticipants. The electronic data collection system will allow us to 
monitor the quality performance by [CONTACT_161237].  Before analysis raw data will be 
reviewed to assess its accuracy and completeness.  
 
 
11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Clinical data, including clinical laboratory  data, will be accessible only to key study personnel . A 
unique identification case number will be used to protect the confidentiality of the study 
participants. Th e case numbers and participants  names will be in cluded in the protected source 
Redcap database, accessible  only to members of the research team . For statistical analysis purposes 
the information will be de -identified, and only case numbers will be included.  
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_187074] Techniques  
12/15/16  
 
 20  
BP Measurements:  During screening, washout, and active treatment outpatient BP, HR, and MAP 
will be measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY), 
using the appearance and complete disappearance of the Korotokoff sounds (K1 and K5) as SBP 
and DBP. The mean of three supi[INVESTIGATOR_161213] . During study days, BP will be 
measured before and using an automated oscillometric recording device (Dinamap, Critikon, 
Carlsbad, CA).  
 
Instrumentation for intra -arterial infusions:  An intravenou s catheter will be placed in the 
antecubital vein of the non -dominant arm. After subdermal administration of 1% lidocaine, a 3 -
French catheter (Cook Inc., Bloomington, IN) will be inserted into the brachial artery of the non -
dominant arm for direct intra -arterial infusion of peptides and enalaprilat. Following placement of 
the catheters, subjects will be allowed to rest at least 30 min before baseline measurements are 
made. Arterial catheter patency will be maintained by [CONTACT_161238] a rate of 1 
mL/min. After measurement of basal FBF and blood sampling, peptides will be infused at the 
doses and durations described. FBF will be measured during the last two min. Drug concentrations 
in the infusate will be adjusted to maintain infusio n volumes at 1 mL/min.  
 
Forearm blood flow measurements:  FBF will be measured using mercury -in-silastic strain -gauge 
plethysmography. The wrist will be supported to raise the forearm above the level of the atrium, 
and a strain gauge placed on the widest part of the forearm. The strain gauge will be connected to 
a plethysmograph (Model EC -4, D.E. Hokanson, Issaquah, WA), calibrated to measure percent 
change in volume and connected to a chart recorder to record flow measurements. For each 
measurement, a cuf f around the upper arm will be inflated to 40 mmHg with a rapid cuff inflator 
(Model E -10, Hokanson) to occlude venous outflow from the extremity. The hand will be occluded 
from measurement of FBF by [CONTACT_16131] a pediatric sphygmomanometer cuff to [ADDRESS_187075] 3 -4 pulses; 7 readings will be obtained for each mean.  
 
Assays:  All blood samples will be centrifuged for 20 minutes  immediately following blood 
drawing. Plasma will be storage at -80°C until analysis.  
 
Laboratory Analyses:  Catecholamines will be quantified after batch alumina extraction by [CONTACT_5019] -
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection. We will measure 
ACE (Olympus AU400/AU600, Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH) and DPP4 activity by [CONTACT_161239] s.54,55 Details regarding sample collection and assays appear in the cited publications.  
 
Substance P and Neuropeptide Y (NPY total and NPY (3 -36)):  Plasma samples will be collected 
in a protease cocktail inhibitor containing an aminopeptidase P inhibitor  (apstatin), DPP4 inhibitor 
(vildagliptin), serine protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), ETA, and 
phosphoramidon to avoid ex vivo degradation of the peptides. NPY will be concentrated from 
plasma by [CONTACT_161240] -NPY monoclon al antibody (NPY02) coupled to 
magnetic beads, followed by C18 micro -extraction (Ziptip, Millipore). Recovery (~70%) will be 
calculated using 13C, 15N -labeled internal standards for NPY and NPY (3 -36). NPY and NPY (3 -
36) will be quantified using an IonKey -based system (Acquity M -Class + IonKey + Xevo TQ -S) 
using a modification of [CONTACT_161250]’s previously published method that allows detection of 
12/15/[ADDRESS_187076]  0.001 pg NPY 
and fragments injected and is linear for NPY, NPY (3 -36), NPY (3 -35) from 0 to 8 pM (all r2>0.99).  
We have previously used HPLC to separate substance P from substance P (3 -11) prior to assay.55,[ADDRESS_187077] refined a UPLC -MS/MS method to detect  substance P. We 
have markedly increased sensitivity of the assay by [CONTACT_161241]/MS working 
temperature from 270 to 325oC to reduce background, utilizing a 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 
H2O/1% FA in CHC3N gradient to optimize separation of substance P, and by [CONTACT_161242] -extracted blood samples with Nexus and C [ADDRESS_187078] curve is linear (r2=0.995) fr om 0.[ADDRESS_187079] 50 pg. The 
coefficient of variation is 2.2%. The basal concentration of substance P in plasma is 9.2±7.8 
pg/mL (mean±SD, N=11).  
 
Glucose, Insulin , GLP -1: Plasma glucose will be measured by [CONTACT_161243] 
a YSI glucose  analyzer (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH).  Plasma insulin concentrations 
will be determined by [CONTACT_69727]. The insulin assay cross -reacts with 38% intact human pro -insulin and 
with C -peptide, ≤0.01% . GLP -1 (glucagon like peptide 1) will be measured using an ELISA assay.  
 
 
Power Spectral Analysis : Blood pressure fluctuates with a 10 -second periodicity, and these 
fluctuations are commonly termed “Mayer” waves. The low frequency variability (LF SBP) is 
thought to reflect sympathetic regulation of vasomotor ton e. LF SBP is increased by [CONTACT_161244], such as upright posture, lower body negative pressure, or infusion 
of depressor substances47 and correlates with direct measurements of sympathetic traffic using 
microneurography. A derivative -threshold algorithm provided the continuous series of RR 
intervals from ECG signal, continuous non -invasive BP from finger arterial pressure (Finapress 
2300, Ohmeda, Madison, WI), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_161214]. All the data recorded will  be 
used for determination of  spectral analysis. Beat -to-beat data will be digitized using the WINDAQ 
data acquisition system (DI220, DATAQ, Akron, OH, 14 Bit, 1000Hz) and processed off -line 
using a custom -written software in PV -Wave language (PV -wave, Vis ual Numerics Inc., Houston, 
TX). Detected beat -to-beat values of R -R intervals and blood pressure values will be interpolated 
and low pass filtered (cutoff 2 Hz). Data segments of interest are used for spectral analysis. Linear 
trends will be removed, and power spectral density will be estimated with the FFT -based Welch 
algorithm. The power in the frequency range of low frequencies (LF: 0.04 to <0.15 Hz), and high 
frequencies (HF: 0.15 to < 0.40 Hz) will be calculated according to the Task Force 
recommendat ions.48

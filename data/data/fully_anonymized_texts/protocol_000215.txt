Background and Rationale
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the U.S.(1, 2) and in other industrialized 
countries.(3)  The lifetime probability of PCa in males is one in nine, and it has a high economic burden, with 
costs expected to rise.(4-6)  Modern tailored treatment approaches, including androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT), have resulted in longer life expectancy, but also longer treatment periods, which lead to significant 
adverse side effects.(7) These often include decreased bone mineral density (BMD), increased risk of 
fractures, low functional capacity, loss of lean body mass (LBM), increased fat mass, insulin resistance, 
psychological distress and pain.(8-12) Of particular concern is a sharp decline in bone health, with systemic 
bone loss caused by [CONTACT_531863]-produced osteoclastogenic cytokines and drug interventions. Independent of 
disease stage, fractures in PCa patients are predictors of survival.(13, 14) In addition, concomitant physical 
inactivity and stress during and after treatment predispose PCa patients to elevated risk of deconditioning, 
BMD loss, cardiovascular and metabolic disease morbidity and mortality.(15-18) 
Exercise-based lifestyle interventions aimed at counteracting treatment-induced adverse effects have been 
shown to be safe and effective in improving bone, functional and cardiometabolic health for patients with 
PCa.(19, 20) However, men, in general, are harder to engage in physical activity (PA) and lifestyle 
interventions.(3, 21) As an alternative to traditional exercise programs, recreational team sports provide a 
unique environment that may lead to increased physical activity participation and motivation to engage in other 
lifestyle changes.(22) Results from a recent meta-analysis by [CONTACT_531864]-based, 
recreational team sports interventions lead to significant improvements in weight, waist circumference, body fat 
percentage, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], blood pressure and measures of fitness, with a greater change in males vs females.(23) 
More than any other sport, recreational soccer (RS) has been shown to be a successful health intervention in 
patients with, or at risk of chronic diseases,(24-26) including PCa.(27, 28) While soccer is extremely popular in 
many counties outside of the U.S. and has been found to dramatically improve health in PCa patients,(27, 29) 
soccer has only recently begun to gain popularity in the U.S., especially among men. Therefore, there is a 
need to develop implementation science strategies to adapt these interventions that can enhance adherence to 
lifestyle interventions in a population that stand to benefit greatly from a physical, phycological and mental 
health perspective. 
Leveraging the growing enthusiasm around soccer in Atlanta and the U.S. may lead to increased interest, 
participation, retention and engagement in lifestyle change programming among PCa survivors. Therefore, this 
study seeks to directly test the implementation feasibility of a soccer-based lifestyle change intervention vs a 
low-cost mobile-health (mHealth) enabled lifestyle intervention and determine their effects on bone health, 
body composition, mental health, functional and cardiometabolic status among PCa survivors. 
Bone health is of particular interest among PCa survivors given the ADT-related declines in BMD and 
increased risk of fractures, an independent factor inversely associated with disease survival independent of 
disease stage.(13) A recent meta-analysis that included five prospective cohort studies with a total of 533 
patients, evaluated the change in BMD in patients with PCa receiving ADT, compared to those with PCa or 
other urologic conditions not receiving ADT.(14) The mean difference of percent change in BMD in the ADT 
treatment vs control group in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BMD -3.60, 95% CI -6.72 to -0.47, P = 0.02) shows that there is 
a statistically and clinically significant relationship between ADT and BMD reduction in patients with 
PCa and that strategies to counteract BMD loss should be considered in patients with PCa undergoing 
ADT.(14) Further, changes in BMD have been detected with PA interventions within six months.(30, 31)
      Soccer has been shown to be a successful vehicle to deliver health interventions.(32, 33) Soccer is 
the most popular sport in the world and an important staple of social interaction globally, with over 500 million 
active registered participants worldwide and nearly 16 million in the US.(32, 33) Recreational soccer, can be 
effective to reduce cardio-metabolic risk in both children and adults through varied movement patterns and 
highly functional training.(26, 34) Generally, there are close to 100 high-intensity short runs and other specific 
intense actions over a 1-hour training session, with average heart rates around 80% of maximal heart rate, 
irrespective of age, fitness status and previous soccer training experience.(35) These high intensity 
intervals (HIIT) reduce insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and arterial stiffness.(36) Proper screening and 
RS programming delivered by [CONTACT_23872] “Football (soccer) Medicine ” coaches are safely tolerated by [CONTACT_361641]-
aged and older adult participants with hypertension, obesity, diabetes and cancer.(28, 37-40) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_531856], small-sided RS had the lowest perceived exertion rate compared to interval running.(41) This 
may contribute to the high adherence rates (> 90%), long-term retention and high enjoyment seen in RS 
interventions.(35, 42)  In addition, adding a functional warm-up program, has shown to reduce injuries by 
40%.(43-46). RS also builds social capi[INVESTIGATOR_531857].(47) The 
physiologic and behavioral aspects of RS associated with health improvements are summarized by [CONTACT_531865] (soccer) is Medicine collaborative we belong to.(24)

bone health and diet and physical activity related measures.
Planned Sample Size: [ADDRESS_690449] population: Inclusion criteria: 1) Men aged 18-79 years; 2) PCa survivors that had at least 6 
months of hormone therapy (i.e. ADT with testosterone lowering agents) within the past 10 years; 3) not 
engaged in soccer practice or other exercise or lifestyle intervention program for the past 12-months; 4)

English or Spanish and provide informed consent; Exclusion criteria: 1) BMI > 40 kg/m2; 2) resting BP 
≥170/100 at screening or uncontrolled hypertension; 3) any mobility issues or exercise program 
contraindications (48); 4) a recent (i.e., within 12 months) myocardial infarction, diagnosis of congestive heart 
disease, other active cancer 5) bone or organ metastases, 6) chemotherapy within past 6 months; 7) 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_531858] e.g. systemic glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, 
denosumab, osteomalacia; osteosarcoma; Paget’s disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; inflammatory 
bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthitis; thyroid/parathyroid disorder or mental illness.8) Not COVID-19 vaccinated
Specific Aims
Aim 1:  We will conduct a single-arm clinicaltrial over [ADDRESS_690450] 6 
months of hormone therapy (i.e. ADT with testosterone lowering agents) within the past 10 years. Participants 
(n=20) will be offered an intensive intervention including RS programming and lifestyle education. The group 
will receive RS, consisting of small-sided (5vs5) conditioning drills and games, adapted to the population (60-
minute sessions twice/week). We will evaluate pre vs post differences over 3-months in: 
(Aim 1a): Primary outcome: lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_531859] 3-months.
(Aim 1b): Secondary outcomes: impact on additional markers of bone health including total hip BMD and 
bone turnover markers (Osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation) and C-terminal telopeptide of collagen (CTx) 
a bone resorption marker), body composition (weight, BMI, % body fat, waist circumference, lean body mass), 
cardiometabolic markers (resting heart rate and blood pressure), functional markers (aerobic capacity, muscle 
strength), behavioral factors (diet and PA self-efficacy, dietary intake, smoking and alcohol habits, weekly 
steps, sedentary and sleep time) and patient-reported quality of life and depression symptoms.
Aim 2: To assess implementation feasibility and evaluate overall efficacy to increase engagement and 
adherence with PA, we will evaluate between-group differences over 3 months in:
(Aim 2a):  compliance with recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA/week.
(Aim 2b): To assess the RS program adherence and tolerance, we will monitor session attendance, attrition 
rates, injuries or adverse events, use surveys for assessing participant program satisfaction and behavior 
change self-efficacy
Research Design:
Organizational structure of study team: This study was investigator initiated and proposed to the Winship 
Cancer Institute prostate cancer funding opportunity at Emory University as part of an internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_50522]. The 
funder’s expectation was for the investigator to conduct feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_531860] a larger grant. 
Funder will provide a speedtype for all expenses related to the study.
Setting: All assessments will be conducted at the Emory University Hosptial Georgia CTSA GCRC location 
(baseline and post intervention). Those randomized to the soccer intervention will attend soccer sessions at a 
local soccer field (either Dunwoody Elementary or the Atlanta Silverbacks indoor facility), no permission is 
needed to conduct the study, but field owners are aware of the study be conducted. All data will be collected on 
paper and transferred to a REDCap database at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.
Aim 1. Experienced soccer coaches will be identified and hired from the local area to deliver the soccer program. 
These coaches will be trained in two key aspects of the program: 1) leading small-sided recreational soccer 
training designed to safely engage participants in HIIT conditioning; 2) facilitate the lifestyle education by 
[CONTACT_531866] (based on Life’s Simple 7 topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]), 
fostering discussion and using the groups’ social dynamics to promote sustained lifestyle behavior change and 
increase self-efficacy. These coaches will be the primary facilitator of the study, conducting both soccer specific 
activities and education discussion. The study staff will conduct consent and all measurements and 
assessments.
Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the Emory Oncology clinics and if needed Georgia Urology 
through our Winship Cancer prostate cancer physicians and Kaiser Permanente and usingthe recruitment flyer. 
Interested participants will be screened over the phone to determine eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion 
criteria above. Those meeting inclusion criteria will be scheduled for baseline assessments at the Georgia CTSA 
research center. Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.
Study Assessments. Prior to testing, subjects will be asked to refrain from physical activity for [ADDRESS_690451] intervention at the 
Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531861] (GCRC). Blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure will be measured while sitting using a calibrated electronic blood pressure sphygmomanometer 
prior to any activity and after five minutes of rest., height and weight, waist circumference, aerobic and 
musculoskeletal fitness assessments will be performed. Bone mineral density will be measured by [CONTACT_751] x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scan at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L2-L4) and total hip. Body composition will also be determined 
by [CONTACT_531867]. Venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_531868] (Osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation) and C-terminal telopeptide of collagen (CTx) 
a bone resorption marker), a total testosterone level if not included in a recent clinic visit, and to bank one tube 
of plasma for future metabolomics studies. In addition, questionnaires will be used for self-reported physical 
and mental health, quality of life, PA and diet self-efficacy, program satisfaction and injuries.  Dietary recalls 
will be conducted at baseline and 26 weeks by [CONTACT_531869].(49) In addition, both groups will also be asked to wear a Garmin fitness tracker for the duration of 
the study to measure steps and moderate and vigorous activity. Once baseline measurements are complete 
and [ADDRESS_690452] completed they will be randomized to either the soccer group or the mobile health 
(mHealth) group. Participants in the soccer group will participate in soccer drills and other fitness routines (two 
1-hour sessions per week). They will meet with the soccer coach after the soccer sessions to discuss the 
lifestyle education topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (Life’s Simple 7 education topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]). During the soccer sessions participants will be 
fitted with a wearable soccer-specific device to measure how much they move and their heart rate. 
Informed Consent Process:
Adult consent forms will be prepared for this study. The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, 
the procedures and risks. Participant will be presented with the consent form by [CONTACT_531870], in 
person and given time to read and ask questions. A signed consent form will be obtained from the participant. 
A copy of the consent form will be given to the participant and this process will be documented.
Risks:
There is minimal risk in this study. Potential risks are related to 1) Venipuncture and Finger sticks 2) Dual x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA scan) 3) Physical injury related to sport and 4) Confidentiality. 1) A single-use finger stick 
device will be used during assessments along with alcohol to clean the site prior to stick to reduce chances of 
infection. Trained research nurses will be used for venipuncture in a clinical setting with proper antiseptic 
precautions 2) DXA involves exposure to small amounts of radiation. The radiation dose is equal to or less 
than the amount of background radiation received in a round-trip flight from [LOCATION_001] to Los Angeles or the 
natural environmental radiation the average person receives in the [LOCATION_002] annually. The risk from 
radiation exposure of this magnitude is considered to be negligible when compared to everyday risks. 3) 
Exercise can cause muscle soreness, weakness and in some cases muscle strains, ligament sprains and 
rarely bone fractures can occur. In very rare cases exercise can induce chest pain or a heart attack or other 
medical emergency. The training program led by [CONTACT_531871]. Soccer sessions will be led by [CONTACT_531872]. They are trained to recognize medical emergencies, will have basic 
equipment available, and seek emergency care if needed.  4) There is a risk of loss of confidentiality. Efforts 
will be made to keep all personal information confidential. All data will be stored in locked offices and 
password-protected computers. Personal identity will be protected in any publication.
Benefits:  There are no direct benefits of this study beyond opportunity to exercise and information about 
healthy behaviors.
Compensation:
Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_690453] for each assessment visit plus a parking voucher (total compensation 
value $52). Subjects that complete the study will be allowed to keep the Garmin fitness tracker.
Data Analytics and Statistical Plan:
Descriptive analysis will be performed to assess the study primary aims. All statistical tests will be 2-sided, and 
the significance level will be set at 0.05. Data will be assessed for normality and reviewed for outliers and 
missing values. Mathematical transformations may be applied to meet normality assumptions. All primary 
analyses will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle to estimate the effects of the program. 
Moreover, we will estimate the intervention efficacy using as-treated analysis, where participants are classified 
according to the number of sessions actually attended (i.e. the dose-response will be evaluated). To assess 
the effect of the proposed intervention program between baseline and 3 months, to compare the differences in 
the changes of the primary outcome of BMD and secondary outcomes, multilevel longitudinal models (MLM) 
will be used to test for differences  time effects while adjusting for attrition and the correlational structure within 
time (repeated measures). Potential covariates may include potential effects of age, smoking, alcohol use, and 
therapy type. Attention will also be paid to heterogeneity between subjects (random intercept effects). Given 
the sample size of [ADDRESS_690454] sizes will be detectable at 80% statistical power. However, the 
primary focus of the analysis will be to gather initial estimates on the effect sizes (group differences and 
intervention efficacy) to establish adequate statistical power for a future larger study. All analysis will be 
conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Higgins.
Training of study team:
As stated above all staff and soccer coaches will receive adequate training of all study procedures. All study 
staff and collaborators will take CITI training upon hire.
Confidentiality: All participants will receive a study ID and this will be used on all paper and electronic forms. 
We will destroy all identifiers and any audio from key interviews after the study is complete.

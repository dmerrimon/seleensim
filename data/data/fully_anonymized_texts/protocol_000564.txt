OVERVIEW  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_585871] 1% of all children, and patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_585872]. [1,2] Benign epi[INVESTIGATOR_585873] (BECTS) is the most  common  pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_585874] , accounting for  
15-25% of all cases . Children  have  frequent, focal, sleep -potentiated interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_585875]  (IEDs) emerging from one or both motor cortices, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_585876]. BECTS self -resolves in adolescence , so treatment  is 
often not initiated .[3] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_585877], children with BECTS develop a variety of 
cognitive deficits, most prominently in language [4–6] that may persist even after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_585878]. [7,8] Language difficulties correlate with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_585879]. 
Specifically, lateralization of language function to the left hemisphere is either delayed [9–11] or 
permanently disrupted [8] and functional connectivity within the language network [10–13] is 
decreased. We do not understand the pathophysiology of language dysfunction in BECTS and 
have no specific treatments to target it.  
 
Many speculate that frequent IEDs disrupt language development in BECTS, but studies focusing 
on the correlation between IED frequency and cognition have had variable results .[8,14 –18]  
Several lines of evidence suggest that the interaction between IEDs and the language network 
may be critical. First, children with BECTS and left-lateralized  IEDs  have  greater  language  
dysfunction  than those  with right-lateralized  IEDs. [8,17,18]  Second, functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) shows that the inferior frontal gyrus, a key structure in the language 
network, has increased blood flow during IEDs. Third, plasticity of the motor cortex correlates 
strongly with children’s performanc e on language learning tasks. [19] Current pharmacologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585880]. The impact of IEDs on language 
presents a critical gap in our knowledge with both biological and clinical significance.  
 
High-density electroencephalogram ( HD-EEG ) alone and high -density EEG paired with single 
pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( spTMS -EEG ) can help map the impact of IEDs on 
brain connectivity in children with BECTS. HD -EEG is a minimally -invasive, well -established 
method for assessing connectivity between brain regions with much greater temporal specificity 
than fMRI. TMS -EEG is the only n on-invasive way to directly assess the influence of one brain 
region over another. In TMS, an extracranial magnet ic field is used to induce an intracranial 
electrical current, which can be traced to structurally and functionally linked regions. While 
spTMS -EEG interrogates the brain state at the moment of stimulation, repetitive trains 
administered in specific patterns ( repetitive TMS or  rTMS ) can change underlying cortical 
excitability. [20] Studies of rTMS to treat seizures [21] as well as our preliminary data in BECTS 
patients suggest that IEDs transiently decrease in frequency after rTMS. Therefore, rTMS will 
allow us to test how connectivity changes with IED suppression.  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if rTMS to the motor cortex : (1) reduces IEDs  in children 
with BECTS ; and (2) changes brain connectivity between the motor cortex and language 
regions.  
Literature Review  
i. Children  with BECTS  have  disturbed  language  skills . Detailed  neuropsychological  profiles  show  
deficits  in many  language  domains, including reading, expressive  and receptive  language, and  
phonological  processing. [4,5] Children have near -normal language abilities at the time of 
diagnosis of BECTS but their language skills lag behind their peers over time, [4,22]  suggesting 
that BECTS can be classified as a mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_41711] . The few studies to formally 
assess language in adults with a history of BECTS have found persistent deficits. [7,8]  
ii. Maturation of the language network is also altered in BECTS . Language typi[INVESTIGATOR_585881]. Neurocognitive,  evoked potential, [8,18]  and fMRI [23–25] studies 
find that this process is delayed [9–11] or permanently disrupted [8] in BECTS. Language 
performance varies with the degree of disruption.   
iii. Interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_41713] (IEDs) may interrupt normal language development. 
Substantial evidence indicates that IEDs cause transient changes in perception, processing, and 
reactivity. [26] Disorders like Landau -Kleffner Syndrome – in which patients experience a sudden 
language regression accompanied by [CONTACT_585919] – suggest that frequent nocturnal IEDs may be sufficient to disrupt cognition. [27] 
In BECTS, the effects of IEDs have largely been inferred from studies correlating diurnal [14] and 
nocturnal [15,16]  IED burden with degree and type of cognitive dysfunction, though not all studies 
have found a correlation. [4] Location of IEDs likely matters; of the 60% of BECTS patients with 
unilateral discharges, those with left-lateralized  IEDs  have  greater  language  dysfunction  while  
those  with right-lateralized  IEDs  have  greater  spatial  dysfunction .[8,17,18]   
iv. Brain connectivity is altered in BECTS, potentially due to IEDs . fMRI studies suggest that in 
BECTS, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_585882]. [10–13,28 –33] Broader resting state networks [33–35] are also altered. A 
series of studies [9–11,36]  found that BECTS patients have decreased  connectivity between the 
motor cortex and language regions, but these studies did not account for the effect of IEDs. In 
contrast, Xiao et al. [33] found that connectivity between the motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus 
increases after IEDs, and that greater connectivity correlates with worse language function. This 
literature suggests that the immediate impact of IEDs on connectivity may differ from persistent 
connectivity changes that develop with chronic IED exposure. This highlights a need to investigate 
both types of connectivity. Furthermore, connectivity differences may be especially prominent 
during language tasks compared to when at rest. [24]   
v. EEG -based connectivity analysis offers superior temporal specificity for the study of IEDs . 
Assessment of IEDs using fMRI is limited by [CONTACT_585920]. IEDs last 
hundreds of milliseconds whereas blood flow changes measured by [CONTACT_585921]. In contrast, EEG is a temporally -precise method for studying the im pact of IEDs on 
network connectivity. [37] High-density EEG (HD -EEG) specifically estimates the underlying 
source of this activity. Surprisingly, however, few EEG connectivity analyses have been done in 
children with  BECTS. [38–41] Only one study assess the impact of IEDs in wakefulness and it is 
limited by a small sample size of children with only right hemispheric IEDs, thus obscuring the 
impact of IEDs on language network connectivity. Furthermore, all EEG connectivity studies in  
BECTS have been done in the resting state, whereas language network connectivity is likely to 
be better measured when the network is engaged in a task. Therefore, a significant gap persists 
in understanding connectivity in BECTS.   
EEG connectivity analysis has been limited by [CONTACT_585922], a problem that 
arises when activity in nearby [CONTACT_585923][INVESTIGATOR_585883] a single common source. 
Fortunately, new connectivity metrics, such as the weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) ,[42] are 
quite robust against volume conduction. To calculate wPLI, the EEG signal is broken down into 
frequency bands (i.e. alpha, beta) and the phase of the waveforms in each band is compared 
across brain regions; non -zero phase lags are considered true conn ectivity. [42] wPLI is a 
continuous metric ranging from [ADDRESS_770936] 
connectivity. wPLI offers better spatial -specificity when it is calculated from a high number of EEG 
electrodes.   
vi. Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with EEG (TMS -EEG) will shed new insight into 
BECTS by [CONTACT_585924][INVESTIGATOR_585884] . TMS is the only non -invasive method 
to directly interrogate the influence of one brain region over another. Single pulses of TMS 
(spTMS) introduce a current into the stimulated cortex, the immediate downstream effect of which 
can be mapped by [CONTACT_585925]. [20] The strength of the magnetic pulse 
required to induce a muscle twitch (typi[INVESTIGATOR_585885] [APB]) is known as the motor threshold (MT) . The EEG data recorded immediately after 
TMS pulses can also be analyzed with connectivity measures like wPLI. Additionally, TMS  elicits 
motor evoked potentials (MEPs)  recorded by [CONTACT_585926] -EEG evoked 
potentials (TEPs)  broadly across the brain. Finally, repetitive trains of TMS (rTMS)  induce long -
lasting c hanges in brain excitability, [43,44]  and inhibitory rTMS can reduce IED frequency in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_58804]. [21,45]  rTMS can therefore be used to model how changes in IED frequency 
affect brain connectivity.   
  
Significance  
 
The impact of IEDs on children with BECTS and other epi[INVESTIGATOR_585886].  We typi[INVESTIGATOR_585887] . In this trial, we will evaluate 
if rTMS could be a treatment for focal IEDs in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_585888] 
a treatment on the language network. Successful completion of the proposed studies will 
determine if IEDs directly alter co nnectivity between the motor and language regions in children 
with BECTS, if such connectivity differences persist even during IED -free periods, and whether 
connectivity differences correlate with langu age dysfunction. We will utilize rTMS as a novel 
method to suppress IEDs in BECTS in order to determine if rTMS could be a treatment for focal 
IEDs and what the impact of such treatment on the language network might be. Together, these 
data lay the groundw ork for highly innovative future neurostimulation trials targeting IEDs in not 
only BECTS but also a wide range of pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_31630].  
 
  
RISKS/BENEFITS  
 
Potential Risks:   
(1) Risks of EEG Recording : EEG does not cause harmful effects, though some children 
may find the EEG caps uncomfortable.  
(2) Risks of TMS : TMS is considered very safe in both adults and children. [46–49] The main 
concern is that TMS could induce a seizure, but this is a truly rare phenomenon. In our 
preliminary study of 14 children with BECTS, none had seizures with TMS; a separate 
study also reported no seizures in children with BECTS. [19]  
a. In considering the TMS literature more broadly, the main risk of seizures is in 
individuals: a) receiving high -frequency repetitive (>2Hz) stimulation or 
stimulation using the H -coil (which allows for deeper stimulation); or b) taking 
certain psychiatric m edications.  
b. TMS is safe in children. In the most recent review of over 4000 children with and 
without neuropsychiatric disease, the 3 reported new seizures all occurred with 
high frequency TMS; in addition, 2 of these children were on psychiatric 
medications and one c hild received H -coil stimulation. [49] Another recent study 
found no seizures in 165 healthy children receiving a form of repetitive TMS. [50]  
c. Risks of seizures induced by [CONTACT_585927][INVESTIGATOR_002]. In one study of 152 patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_585889] 1 Hz 
or less, none had induced seizures. [47] A review [51] found that 4 of 280 epi[INVESTIGATOR_585890] a seizure around time of TMS, reflecting a risk of 1.4%. However, 
these patients also had refractory and frequent spontaneous seizures at other 
times. In children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], TMS is very safe; some children wit h very difficult 
to control seizures (multiple per day at baseline) self -reported a slight increase in 
seizures for 3 days after TMS but then a return to baseline. The authors felt this 
was a minimal increase in risk in this population. [49]  
d. Other potential risks of TMS include hearing problems from the sound of the coil 
or scalp burns if the EEG electrodes are excessively heated by [CONTACT_40427]. 
These are mitigated by [CONTACT_585928] -cancelling ear protection and by 
[CONTACT_281438] -cooled coils. Min or potential side effects include scalp discomfort, 
headache, lightheadedness and boredom. There is a theoretical risk that rTMS 
could lead to a change in mood, but this is highly unlikely when applied to the 
motor cortex. Procedures to minimize the risk o f TMS are described in more 
detail below.  
(3) Risks of Collecting Personal Information:  One potential risk is breach of confidentiality 
related to the collection of sensitive information, but this will be minimized by [CONTACT_585929].  
 
Protection Against Risk:   
Risk of EEG:  We will monitor the children during the studies and can adjust or remove the EEG 
caps if there is any discomfort.  
Risk of TMS: We protect against the risk of seizure by [CONTACT_7661] a pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_427785] ([CONTACT_585937]) in the room during all TMS procedures and actively monitoring the EEG during 
stimulation so that stimulation can be stopped if there are any concerns. Furthermore, we use 
only single pulse stimulation and low -frequency repetitive stimulation (<1Hz), both of which 
have been well studied and are quite safe. [CONTACT_585938] will be present for all TMS sessions. 
She has extensive experience performing TMS in childre n and clinical expertise in the 
management of seizures in children. Furthermore, all TMS will be done at Stanford University 
in close proximity to Lucile Packard Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Any persons assisting with the TMS 
will undergo TMS safety training and s eizure training. All children wear noise -cancelling 
headphones to protect their ears from the TMS click. Scalp burns are prevented using cooled -
coils. We speak with children throughout the TMS session so will actively monitor them for any 
other discomfort. If there is minor discomfort due to the TMS, the st udy will be paused and 
potentially halted.   
Risk of Loss of Privacy : To maintain confidentiality, we will restrict access of private health 
information exclusively to the PI, necessary personnel of the Data Safety Monitoring Board 
and research staff.  We will de -identify all data obtained from subjects. We will store all data 
on a PGP encrypted server within the School of Medicine at Stanford University. All hard 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837], including medical records and copi[INVESTIGATOR_20045], will be maintained 
in a locked file cabinet in the lab. All membe rs of the research team will undergo HIPPA 
training.  
 
Additional Protections for Children :  The study is recruiting children as BECTS is a pediatric 
condition not present in adults; there are also no good animal models of this condition. The 
study procedures will be reviewed with the children in language they can understand before 
the protocol b egins and children will be told they can stop the study at any time. Parents of 
children participating will also be informed that they are free to choose not to participate and 
may withdraw at any time. We will obtain assent from children who are of an app ropriate age 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] >8yo of age). We will frequently check -in with children throughout the study to 
ensure that they are comfortable with continuing the procedures.  
 
Potential Benefits: IEDs lead to cognitive problems in some children. Participants may benefit by 
[CONTACT_7661] a reduction in IEDs at least temporarily. Additionally, we will learn more about the 
pathophysiology of BECTS, which may improve treatment in the future.

STUDY DESIGN  
Overview: Children with BECTS will undergo both active  rTMS and sham rTMS to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_585884]. We will compare the impact of active vs. sham rTMS on: (a) IED 
frequency; and  (b) m otor-to-language connectivity.  We hypothesize that active rTMS induce a 
greater decrease in: (a) IED frequency and (b) motor -to-language cortex connectivity than sham 
rTMS.  
 
Study Stage: Stage 0  
 
Study Design: Sham -controlled cross -over study in which all participants will receive both active 
and sham rTMS, with randomization of order of intervention. We will have repeated -measures 
data as subjects will undergo both sham and real rTMS on different days. The potential missing 
data issue will be evaluated t horoughly prior to the analysis. Multiple imputation will be applied if 
needed.  
 
Assignation Methods: Not applicable, subjects will undergo both active and sham rTMS.  
 
Study Arms: All subjects will participate in each arm, and arm order will be randomized on a per -
subject basis. Participation in each arm will take approximately 4 hours (including set -up of 
equipment and data recording). Arms will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 1 week.  
Arm 1 (active rTMS): 1000 pulses of rTMS administered via an active TMS coil at 1Hz to 
the motor cortex. EEG and spTMS -EEG data will be recorded during the 20  minutes prior 
to and following the rTMS.  
Arm 2 (sham rTMS): 1000 pulses of rTMS administered via a sham TMS coil at 1Hz to the 
motor cortex. EEG and spTMS -EEG data will be recorded during the 20  minutes prior to 
and following the rTMS . 
 
Control Groups: As above, each subject will receive sham rTMS and thus serve as their own 
control. This within -subject analysis is meant to reduce the influence of inter -subject variability in 
IED frequency (which can be high) on the results. A potential l imitation is that a sham -control may 
be excessively stringent, given that other studies have found clinically meaningful improvements 
when sham rTMS is used (i.e. in post -stroke motor recovery), suggesting that even sham rTMS 
can exert a meaningful physiol ogic influence. A second limitation is that IED frequency and 
connectivity may be influenced by [CONTACT_585934], which may change between days or 
behavioral states; we will interact with participants and monitor EEG to maintain behavioral state.  
 
rTMS Intervention : The [ADDRESS_770938] measurements to the 10 minutes before and after the rTMS; we will 
shorten the second intervention accordingly. If a subject does not tolerate [ADDRESS_770939] in rTMS trials.  
 
RECRUITMENT & RETENTION  
Anticipated number to be screened : We expect to recruit 36 -40 subjects and anticipate 
screening 70 -80 subjects to reach this target enrollment.  
Anticipated Sample Size : We expect to recruit [ADDRESS_770940] 60 -70% of subjects to be male and 80% 
of subj ects to be between the ages of [ADDRESS_770941] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_585891], 
subjects are expected to be 35% Caucasian/Non -Hispanic, 25% Caucasian/Hispanic, 30% 
Asian, 4% African American, and 6% Mixed/Other. Adults will not be included as B ECTS 
resolves in adolescence.  
Planned Recruitment Strategies : The study will recruit children with BECTS seen at Lucile 
Packard Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (LPCH) outpatient neurology clinic or the neurophysiology 
laboratory. Additionally, children will be recruited if they are referred to the study from 
surrounding child ne urology practices. The catchment area for LPCH extends south into 
[LOCATION_004]’s Central Valley, north to the Oregon border and east to Reno, Nevada. The patient 
population is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. In addit ion to direct referrals, we will 
screen the LPCH medical records to identify potential participants and request referrals from 
their treating providers. We will advertise the trial online and during speaking/outreach events 
with patient advocacy groups to allow for direct referrals from interested patients and their 
families. Screening and data gathering will not occur in a public setting.  
Retention : Subjects must return for [ADDRESS_770942] 1 week. To improve 
retention, we will endeavor to schedule the 2 sessions as close together as possible, and 
specifically within 4 -8 weeks of one another. We will frequently check -in with the part icipant, 
allow for flexibility in the scheduling, send reminder emails and phone calls, and provide a 
reasonable stipend for the child’s time ($25/session).  
Participant Incentives : Children will be given a $[ADDRESS_770943] at the completion of each session. 
This is meaningful enough to thank the child for his or her effort without being significant enough 
to unduly influence the parents when they are providing informed consent. The pa rents will also 
be reimbursed for travel costs such as parking.  
 
JUSTIFICATION FOR STUDY DESIGN AND DOSE  
Active rTMS : The active  intervention is 1Hz rTMS applied with an active coil to the motor 
cortex. Low frequency (1Hz or slower) rTMS  can induce changes in brain excitability  lasting 
minutes to hours [43,44]  and has been show n to reduce IED frequency in patients with 
refractory focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. [21,45]  Focal changes induced by [CONTACT_585935]. Theoretically, 1Hz active rTMS will 
reduce cortical excitability of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_585884], thus reducing IED frequency. 
Furthermore, i t will alter connectivity between the epi[INVESTIGATOR_585892]. Thus, we are measuring IED frequency and EEG -based connectivity.  
 
Sham rTMS : The sham control is 1Hz rTMS administered with a sham coil, which will help 
account for the impact of other components of the experimental session (i.e. fear, boredom, 
variable attention).  
 
rTMS  Administration: The rTMS (sham and active) will be administered by a study team 
including [CONTACT_585938] and a research assistant over the course of [ADDRESS_770944] a week. This will occur in a room dedicated to the TMS session. The 
rTMS will  be administered as 2 blocks of 500 pulses applied at 1Hz to the motor cortex. A break 
of 2-3 minutes between blocks is acceptable if needed to allow for maximum participation. The 
sham rTMS will be administered using the same paramete rs and same stimulation site, but the 
intensity of the sham coil is such that it is not expected to induce an intracranial current.  
 
 
 
RANDOMIZATION & BLINDING:  
The order of conditions (active vs. sham rTMS) will be randomized on a per -subject basis. A 
random number generator will be used to create a random list using numbers [ADDRESS_770945] session and 
sham rTMS in the second session and vice versa for odd numbers. Participants will be blind to 
the condition order. The sham rTMS will be administered using the same parameters and same 
stimulation site as the active stimulation. The intensity of the sham coil is such that it is expected 
to create a scalp sensation without inducing an intracranial current. It is possible that some 
subjects will recognize a difference between the 2 sessions, and we will ask them after each 
session to as sess if it was active vs. sham rTMS. If subjects can consistently identify a 
difference, than we will report that blinding was not successful in our final analyses.  
 
Researchers will not be blinded during the session, but the data will be coded prior to analysis 
and the person performing the analysis will be blinded to the session type.  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening : For subjects referred by [CONTACT_9682], the study team will confirm the diagnosis of 
BECTS with the referring provider. Parents of participants will then be called by a member of the 
research team and screened on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the parents primarily 
speak a different language than English, the screening will be conducted with the help of an 
interpreter or by a study team member fluent in that language.   
 
For subjects who self -refer to the study, the study team will review the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria with the family. Subjects who screen -in and consent to the study will be asked to bring a 
physician's note stating their diagnosis and prior EEG findi ngs. 
 
Screening will be done within 2 months of participation. If this time window is delayed, the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed on the day of the first intervention to ensure the 
subject is still eligible.   
 
Informed Consent & Assent : Since informed consent is required from both parents and/or 
legal guardians if they are reasonably available (i.e. not deceased, imprisoned, whereabouts 
unknown or not involved in the care of the child), informed consent will be first obtained over the 
telephone with the help of an interpreter if necessary.  Assent will be obtained from the 
participating child on the day of the first rTMS session.  
 
Coding of Subjects & Randomization : Subjects will be assigned a study -number based on 
the order of consent. This will be used to label all information and the CRF. In addition, the 
study number will be compared against a list of randomly generated numbers to determine if the 
subject will r eceive active or sham rTMS first (as described in the section on randomization).  
 
Baseline Assessments :  
Clinical & Demographic Data : We will collect the following variables: age, gender, age of first 
seizure, number of lifetime seizures, anti -seizure medications, and side of centrotemporal IEDs 
(left, right or bilateral) from the medical chart. We will measure degree of right -handednes s with 
the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire51 and parental education and socioeconomic status 
with The Hollingshead Four -Factor Index.  This coded data will be kept in subject -specific binders.  
 
Anti-Seizure Medication Dose and Level : We will record the daily dose (both absolute and 
dose -by-weight) of all medications that the subject is receiving. If the subject is on an anti -
seizure medication, we will record a level within [ADDRESS_770946] intervention day. We will 
use a clinically -drawn level if this is available or otherwise draw a serum level as part of the 
experimental procedure.   
 
Neurocognitive Testing:  All subjects will complete the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of 
Intelligence – Second Edition (WASI -II)[ADDRESS_770947] of Variable Attention 
(T.O.V.A.)53 to provide a continuous measure of attention.  The Clinical Evaluation of Language 
Fundamentals 5 (CELF -5)[ADDRESS_770948] intervention.  
  
MRI: If subjects have undergone an MRI as part of clinical care, we will request that they bring a 
copy of this MRI on disc to be used for neuro -navigation for the rTMS session. If an MRI is not 
available, we will use a dummy head model.  
  
First rTMS Session : BECTS subjects will wear a [ADDRESS_770949]’s MRI if  one is clinically  available.  At the beginning of the session, we will monitor 
the EEG recording to determine if IEDs are unilateral or bilateral. We will then measure the 
resting motor threshold (rMT) for the hemisphere with the higher IED burden or the left 
hemisphere if IEDs are bil ateral. The rMT will be established in the standard way.55 We will 
apply 150 single pulses of TMS (spTMS) at 90% rMT in 2 blocks, with additional resting -state 
EEG (without spTMS) data gathered between these blocks. The patient will then receive either 
1000 pulses of 1Hz rTMS at 90% rMT or 1000 pulses of sham 1Hz rTMS  to the motor cortex, 
depending on the prior randomization . After the rTMS, we will repeat the blocks of  spTMS 
interspersed with  resting -state EEG.  
 
Second rTMS Session : The second session will occur at least one week after the first session, 
but ideally will be done within [ADDRESS_770950] sessi on unless >80% of IEDs are emerging from the contralateral 
hemisphere. If this occurs, we will stimulat e the contralateral hemisphere and request that the 
subject come in for a third “tie -breaker” session.

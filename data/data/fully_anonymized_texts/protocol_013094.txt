2. BACKGROUND  
 2.1 Study Agent  
 Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel, orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In addition to targeting Breakpoint Cluster Region- Abelson (BCR- ABL), other targets of 
clinical interest include the kinases c -KIT (KIT), ret proto -oncogene (RET), Fms- like 
tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs).  
 
Chemical  
Ponatinib is a chemical entity prepared by [CONTACT_293852]. The ponatinib active pharmaceutical ingredient is the mono -hydrochloride salt (AP24534 hydrochloride). 
Ponatinib for investigational use is supplied as white opaque capsules containing nominally 5 mg of ponatinib, or as 15 mg or 45 mg round, white, film- coated tablets. 
The commercial dosage form, Ponatinib, is supplied as 15 mg or 45 mg round, white film-coated tablets.  
 
 Nonclinical  
A nonclinical development program was implemented to support clinical studies of 
ponatinib. In vitro assays demonstrated that ponatinib potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of T315I ABL kinase, as well as that of the native (unmutated) enzyme. In leukemia cell lines expressing these BCR -ABL variants, ponatinib potently inhibited 
BCR-ABL signaling, leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Ponatinib also potently inhibits proliferation of cell lines expressing other major, clinically observed imatinib -, nilotinib -, and dasatinib resistant mutants of BCR-
ABL. In vivo antitumor activity has been shown in tumor-bearing mouse models. Ponatinib has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of certain other tyrosine kinases implicated in the initiation and progression of leukemias and other tumor types. In particular, it inhibits FLT3, which is frequently mutationally activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and inhibits all members of the FGFR family, which are implicated in a variety of myeloproliferative disorders and solid tumor indications. Ponatinib also inhibits several other kinases, including KIT, RET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet -derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), receptor tyrosine 
kinase expressed on vascular endothelium (TIE2), and tyrosine kinase homologous to the Rous sarcoma virus oncogene protein PP60 (SRC). The kinase inhibition profile of ponatinib suggests potential for clinical activity in other hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies, in addition to Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).  
 Nonclinical safety assessment studies were performed on ponatinib, including 6-month oral toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The rat was shown to be the most sensitive species to toxicologic effects of ponatinib; in a [ADDRESS_707392] level (NOAEL) in the rat was 0.25 mg/kg/day. 
Higher dose levels of 0.75 and 2 mg/kg/day caused mortality of some animals. Histologic examination revealed decreased numbers of chondrocytes along the physis in the femur at the 0.75 and 2 mg/kg/day dose levels, and lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus at the 2 mg/kg/day dose level. Toxicity studies in pregnant rats demonstrated fetal malformations and embryo-fetal toxicity at dose levels of 1 and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively, and higher. In a phototoxicity study in pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922], signs of minimal ocular phototoxicity were observed at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Administration of ponatinib to cynomolgus monkeys for 6 months at oral dose levels of 0.25, 0.75, and 2 mg/kg/day was well tolerated, with no ponatinib-related microscopic findings being observed at any dose level.  
Clinical 
Ponatinib received accelerated approval in the [LOCATION_002] (US) (December 2012) and approval in the European Union (EU) (July 2013) for patients with refractory CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. As of [ADDRESS_707393] been treated with ponatinib commercially. Regulatory actions were taken by [CONTACT_87345] (ARIAD) and/or the competent authorities following increased 
 cumulative risk of vascular occlusiv e events observed in patients using ponatinib. From 
a development perspective, on 08 October 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) placed a partial clinical hold on all new patient enrollments in clinical studies with ponatinib, and a phase 3 study (EPIC: AP24534-12-301) was terminated on 17 October 2013. From a postmarketing authorization perspective, prior approval supplement/type II variation were evaluated by [CONTACT_542276] (EMA), respectively, to revise ponatinib product information to include updated data and warning/precautions on arterial thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolic events, cardiac failure/left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), and cardiovascular deaths. The type II variation received a positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_542220]’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on 21 November 2013. Subsequent to completion of the Type II variation procedure, a referral procedure under article 20 of regulation (EC) No. 726/[ADDRESS_707394] been or are being conducted in adult patients: 
• A phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with hematologic malignancies (AP24534-07-101) 
• A pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 2 study in patients with refractory CML (chronic phase [CP], accelerated phase [AP], or blast phase [BP]) or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (AP24534-10- 201; PACE)  
• A pi[INVESTIGATOR_542221] 3 study of ponatinib versus imatinib in patients with 
newly diagnosed CP-CML (AP24534-12- 301; EPIC)  
• A phase 1/2 study in Japanese patients with CML or Ph+ ALL (AP24534-11-106) 
• A phase 2 study of patients with metastases and/or unresectable gastrointestinal 
stromal tumor (GIST; AP24534 -12-202) 
 Seven clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects have been completed:  
• A food-effect study (AP24534-11-102) 
• A drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with ketoconazole (a cytochrome P450 
[CYP]3A4 inhibitor; AP24534-11-103) 
• An absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) study with 
[14C]ponatinib (AP24534-11-104) 
• A DDI study with rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer; AP24534-12-107) 
• A DDI study with lansoprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor; AP24534-12-108) 
• A study of ponatinib in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment 
(matched to control subjects; AP24534-12-109) 
• A bioequivalence study of ponatinib in healthy volunteers (AP24534-13-111) 
 
  
 In addition, ponatinib has been provided via an expanded access program through the 
following mechani sms: 
• A company-sponsored expanded access study (AP24534-12-901 in the US; this study was closed on 14 December 2012, coinciding with the approval and commercialization of Ponatinib in the US).  
• An expanded-access study (AP24534-12- 903) in [LOCATION_009] in patients  with refractory 
disease; the study is ongoing and accepting new patients. 
• An expanded-access study (AP24534-12- 904) in Belgium in patients with 
refractory disease; this study also is ongoing and enrolling new patients. 
• Individual- patient treatment investigational new drug (IND) applications in the US 
• Named Patient Programs (NPPs) outside the US  
 Multiple investigator -sponsored trials (ISTs) are underway to evaluate the response of 
hematologic cancers as well as solid tumors to ponatinib. Two of these have had 
preliminary efficacy results published: 
• AP24534-11-001 (clinicaltrials.gov # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a phase 2 study of 
ponatinib (45 mg QD) in combination with hyper- CVAD (fractionated 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone), alternating with 
high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine every 21 days, in patients with Ph+ ALL. As of 07 October 2013, 30 patients received ponatinib.  
• AP24534-11-002 (clinicaltrials.gov # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a phase 2 study of ponatinib in newly-diagnosed CP- CML patien ts, with 41 patients treated as of 07 
October 2013. 
 Full descriptions of all clinical, clinical pharmacology, and investigator-sponsored studies can be found in the Investigator Brochure  
2.2 Study Disease  
 Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumors in adults. The annual incidence in the [LOCATION_002] is 3 -4 per 100,000, with over 10,000 new 
cases each year (Wen and Kesari 2008, Dolecek, Propp et al. 2012) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_542222], radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor. In 2005, results from a randomized Phase III trial indicated that the addition of temozolomide chemotherapy to radiation therapy for treatment of newly-diagnosed GBM prolonged median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months ( Stupp, Mason et al. 2005 ). For participants with recurrent 
GBM, treatment options are limited (Wen and Kesari 2 008). The median time to tumor 
progression is only [ADDRESS_707395] cytotoxic agents ( Wong, Hess et al. 1999) and 4 -5 
months with bevacizumab containing regimens ( Friedman, Prados et al. 2009, Kreisl, Kim et 
al. 2009).  Tumors that progress during bevacizumab therapy often cannot be treated successfully. A retrospective series of 37 participants treated with various non -antiangiogenic approaches 
following bevacizumab failure reported a median overall survival of 4.5 months (Iwamoto, 
Abrey et al. 2009).  Continuation of bevacizumab is also typi[INVESTIGATOR_542223]. Among 54 recurrent high -grade glioma participants who 
 were treated with bevacizumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy, continuing bevacizumab and 
changing to another chemotherapy agent at recurrence was ineffective (Quant, Norden et al. 
2009). The median PFS was only 6 weeks, and there were no radiographic respons es. In a 
Phase II study of 48 recurrent GBM participants treated with bevacizumab monotherapy, 19 participants received bevacizumab and irinotecan at recurrence ( Kreisl, Kim et al. 2009 ). The 
median PFS was approximately one month, and there were no radiographic responses using standard criteria (Macdonald, Cascino et al. 1990 ). At this time, no treatment has proven 
even modestly effective in the post- bevacizumab setting.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_707396] growth factor (bFGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) ( Casanovas, Hicklin et al. 
2005, Batchelor, Sorensen et al. 2007).
  Drugs such as ponatinib targeting not only vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR), but also fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), may potentially help overcome some of 
the putative mechanisms of resistance and result in increased antitumor effects. The additional activity that ponatinib has on members
 of the Src family of tyrosine kinases may 
also contribute to a therapeutic effect since there is increasing evidence that Src is also important in glioma invasion ( Stettner, Wang et al. 2005, Du, Bernasconi et al. 2009 ).   
 
In addition, ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and may be particularly active against patients with FGFR -driven cancers (Gozgit, Wong et al. 2012). In patients with glioblastoma, 
approximately 3.1% harbor oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse the tyrosine kinase coding domains of FGFR genes to the transforming acidic coiled -coil (TACC) coding 
domains ( Gozgit, Wong et al. 2012 ). The FGFR -TACC fusion protein demonstrates 
oncogenic activity and inhibition of this with use of an FGFR inhibitor has shown prolonged survival in mice with intracranial glioma harboring the FGFR3 -TACC3 fusion ( Singh, Chan 
et al. 2012 ). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_707397] the effects of anti- angiogenic agents 
would be an ideal tool to track tumor response and elucidate tumor escape mechanisms. Since angiogenesis requires an exquisite balance of signaling from pro - and anti-
angiogenic to maintain the vascular supply ( Jain, di Tomaso et al. 2007 ), multiple 
biomarkers will need to be monitored. In addition to the VEGF and CXCR4 pathways 
 described previously, several other molecules have been implicated in tumor 
angiogenesis, including: placental growth factor (PlGF), angiopoietin- 1 (ANG1), 
angiopoietin- 2 (ANG2) and the soluble receptor Tie -2 (Reiss, Machein et al. 2005 ); the 
angiogenesis inhibitors tumstatin and thrombspondin-1 ( Nyberg, Xie et al. 2005) ; and the 
pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin -8 (IL-8) (Waugh and Wilson 2008).  
 
Additionally, studies have shown that the structure of collagen IV is modified after VEGFR2 blockade ( Inai, Mancuso et al. 2004, Tong, Boucher et al. 2004, Winkler, 
Kozin et al. 2004). Collagen IV degradation subsequently leads to release of tumstatin into the blood stream, whose levels are inversely correlated with angiogenic activity and tumor growth rate (Hamano, Zeisberg et al. 2003 ).  
 
More recently, clinical studies have shown  that plasma levels of angiogenic proteins 
change with anti -VEGF treatments. A pattern that has been described in several cancers 
including GBMs is an increase in VEGF and PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252], along with reduced levels of soluble VEGFR-2 (sVEGFR-2) ( Willett, Boucher et al. 2005, Motzer, Michaelson et al. 2006 , 
Batchelor, Sorensen et al. 2007, Drevs, Siegert et al. 2007) . One of these studies also 
demonstrated that plasma levels of circulating cytokines SDF1-α, soluble Tie- 2 (sTie-2), 
bFGF, and collagen IV were predictive of radiographic responses and increased survival to cediranib, a pan- VEGFR inhibitor (Batchelor, Sorensen et al. 2007). Serial monitoring 
allowed investigators to show that treatment with cediranib elicited a reactive increase in plasma VEGF and PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252], which reve rsed during treatment interruptions. These studies 
demonstrate the feasibility of serum angiogenic cytokines and soluble receptors as predictive and prognostic biomarkers for anti- angiogenesis treatments.  
 
Circulating endothelial cells (CECs, with a CD31+CD45– phenotype) and circulating precursor cells (CPCs, CD34+ cells), may also be potentially useful as a surrogate angiogenesis marker. The use of CECs and CPCs as surrogate angiogenesis markers has been reported in several clinical studies of angiogenesis inhibitors. Bevacizumab, an anti -
VEGF agent, decreased the number of viable CECs and CPCs in rectal carcinoma patients (Willett, Boucher et al. 2004).  
 
In patients with recurrent glioblastom a treated with cediranib, progression during 
treatment with this pan -VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor was associated with an 
increase in viable CEC counts whereas progression during drug interruptions correlated 
with elevations in circulating progen itor cell counts (Batchelor, Sorensen et al. 2007 ). 
These findings may suggest a differential role for viable CECs versus CPCs in 
assessment of clinical outcomes in recurrent GBM. In addition, preclinical and clinical 
evidence show that certain CD45+ CD11b+ myelomonocytic cells may have a particularly important role in tumor vasculogenesis and their influx into tumors can be 
prevented by [CONTACT_542277] ( Kioi, Vogel et al. 2010 ). Serial monitoring of CECs, CD34+ 
CPCs, and VEGFR2+CD11b+CD45+ myelomonocytic cells will be measured concomitantly by 8- color flow cytometry. The following biomarkers will be obtained 
from serial plasma samples of patients treated with plerixafor and bevacizumab: SDF1α, collagen IV, sTie2 and G -CSF (using ELISA kits), and VEGF, PlGF, sVEGFR1, and 
bFGF (growth factor 1 array plat e, Meso-Scale Discovery) and IL -1b, TNF-a, IL-6 and 
IL-8 (cytokine array plate, Meso -Scale Discovery).

ponatinib. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal 
infections when treated with marrow -suppressive therapy. Appropriate 
studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination 
antiretroviral therapy when indicated.  
1.1.39  Pregnant or breastfeeding . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ponatinib has 
potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects in animal models. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ponatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ponatinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

 4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials  Management 
System (OnCore) . Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol 
therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins 
will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will 
complete the protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
  
Following registration, participants may begin protocol therapy. As noted in 3.1.16, 
protocol treatment must begin within 5 consecutive days after registration.  Issues  
that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal 
Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on the study must be cancelled. R egistration cancellations 
must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.  
 4.2 Registrat ion Process for DF/HCC Institutions  
 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject 
Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 5.1 Treatment Regimen and Agent Administration  
 Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Expected toxicities and potential risks 
as well as dose modifications for ponatinib are described in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modification). No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_345863]’s malignancy.  Protocol treatment must begin within 5 consecutive days after registration. The starting dose of ponatinib will be 45 mg taken orally once- daily.  Patients will take the prescribed number 
of tablets with water, with or without food, at approximately the same time each day.  Patients will be provided a medication diary (Appendix D) where administration specifics will be recorded (dose, date, time) . The medication diary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of 
each cycle and a new one will be given to the participant for the next cycle. Participants are to return all ponatinib pi[INVESTIGATOR_542225].    Patients who forget to take their dose more than [ADDRESS_707418] not be crushed, chewed, or dissolved in water.   
 Treatment cycles are 28 days in length; days are counted continuously, even if treatment is 
held for toxicity.  During dose interruptions, continue to observe the study schedule as planned. All study evaluations and treatments should continue as if study treatment is not being held.  Following a dose delay which resumes mid cycle, day [ADDRESS_707419] the DFCI Coordinating Center as soon as possible in order to establish a plan prior to the time point in question. If a participant requires a treatment hold > [ADDRESS_707420] be discontinued from study treatment.   Criteria for dose modifications and delays apply to intracycle administration and Day 1 administrations; there are no separate ‘start of cycle’ criteria.  However Day 1 treatments 
may not begin until the respective results of the Day 1 procedures are reviewed .  
Required assessments and windows for assessments are detailed in Section 9.  
 All patients are to be started at a 45 -mg dose once daily.  For patients with stable disease or 
better at the end of Cycle 6, as determined by [CONTACT_95733] ( Wen, Macd onald et al. 2010 ), the dose 
of ponatinib must be reduced to [ADDRESS_707421] of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity, and revealed several risk factors 
that pre-dispose patients to vaso -occlusive events (VOEs) on ponatinib.  Based on an analysis 
of odds ratios (OR), the leading risk factors for serious arterial VOEs are cardiovascular 
disorders such as any history of MI (OR = 6.86), coronary artery disease (OR = 7.14), and coronary revascularization (OR = 6.19).  The OR for serious arteria l VOEs is 3.53 for history 
of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 3.78 for diabetes mellitus, 2.49 for hypertension, and 2.07 for hypercholesterolemia.  Based on this analysis, the following supportive care recommendations are provided to decrease the risk o f VOEs for patients taking ponatinib. 
 
Anti-diabetic Treatment  
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of experiencing arterial thrombotic events while being treated with ponatinib.  Therefore, as a part of the assessment and management of the patient’s cardiovascular risk factors, initiation of or modifications to diabetic care should be 
considered in patients being treated with ponatinib who have elevated glucose levels.  The American Diabetes Association guidelines should be followed, and anti- diabetic treatment 
and lifestyle intervention (includes but are not limited to weight loss, decreased fat intake, calorie restriction, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation) should be started in any patient with fasting glucose >130 mg/dL (7.2 mM/L) and/or HbA1c ≥7% {Knowler, 2002 #129}{American Diabetes, 2003 #131}.   
Hypertension Treatment  
 Hypertension (HTN) may contribute to risk of arterial thrombotic events.  Patients who have 
HTN should be managed appropriately before initiating treatment.  During ponatinib treatment, blood pressure elevations should be monitored and managed.  Hypertension should be treated to achieve a goal of <150/90 mmHg.  Initial antihypertensive treatment should generally include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB){James, 2014 #132}.  Ponatinib treatment should be temporarily interrupted if HTN is not medically controlled (refer to Section 6.2.5below for additional management recommendations).  Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for HTN associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. 
 OTHER CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Participants must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over-the-counter products) during the trial without prior consultation with the investigator. All medications taken within [ADDRESS_707422] be added or changed, including over- the-counter medications or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
the reason and name [CONTACT_18467]/therapy should be recorded.  
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_542226], including drugs given prophylactically (e.g., antiemetics) with the following exceptions: 
 5.2.[ADDRESS_707423] that ponatinib is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Co-administration of ponatinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase the systemic exposure to ponatinib; likewise CYP3A inducers can be expected to decrease systemic exposure to ponatinib, possibly resulting in sub-therapeutic drug levels.  Refer to Appendix B for a li st of CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers.  
5.2.2 QT interval prolonging medications known to induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP) or to promote QT prolongation are prohibited at study entry. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If a participant, after initiating study drug, requires the concomitant use of a drug known to prolong the QT interval, then investigators, at their discretion may co-administer such medications with appropriate monitoring; however, 
participants must not initiate any medication known to induce TdP. Refer to 
Appendix C (Table C- 1) for a list of prohibited drugs on study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant use of QT prolonging medications that have a conditional or possible risk to induce Torsades de Pointes is allowed with caution and monitoring. Please refer to Appendix C (Table C-2) for a list of drugs. 
5.2.3 Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the study. These 
herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John‘s wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, ginseng. Participants should stop using any herbal medications [ADDRESS_707424] dose of study drug.
 
5.2.4 Anti-seizure medications should be used as indicated. Only participants receiving 
non-EIAEDs are eligible. If for unavoidable clinical reasons (emergency 
department visit, severe allergies, toxicities, etc.) a participant‘s AED is switched 
to another AED, the participant should be started on another non- EIAED if at all 
possible. Participants who need to permanently change anticonvulsant, but who 
cannot change to another non-EIAED, must be discussed with the PI.  
5.2.5 Prophylactic use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or statins will be left to the discretion of the prescribing physician.  
5.2.6 Febrile neutropenia should be managed according to NCCN guidelines or the local institution's guidelines. Measu res may include appropriate laboratory 
testing, including blood and urine cultures and the institution of broad-spectrum antibiotics. If a source for the fever is not identified or the fever resolves when the neutrophil count recovers, antibiotics may be discontinued and the participant observed. If a patient’s individual risk factors place them at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_542227], primary prophylaxis use of colony- stimulating 
growth factors for the prevention or reduction of febrile neutropenia is recommended according to the published NCCN guidelines
 
5.2.7 Antiemetics: The use of antiemetics will be left to the investigators‘ discretion. The preferred antiemetic is metoclopramide which is not known to prolong QTc. Prophylactic anti- emetic is not recommended as it is not necessary.
 
  
 5.3 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease 
progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s),  
treatment may continue indefinitely, until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillin gness to comply with the oral

6.2 Dose Modifications/Delays 
  
Criteria for disrupting treatment, dose modification, or discontinuation are found below and in Table 6.2. Toxicity will be assessed using the NIH -NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.0 (CTCAEv4.0).  These guidelines should be followed by [CONTACT_87405]; however, for an individual patient, dose interruptions, reductions, and treatment discon tinuation should also be based on the clinical circumstance.  Deviation from 
these guidelines must be documented and communicated with the study’s Overall PI, [CONTACT_542302] (prospectively whenever possible).  NOTE: Section 6.3 provides additional guidance for management of selected AEs for ponatinib.  Comprehensive assessments of any AEs (adverse events) experienced by [CONTACT_381450].  Anticipated study-drug related adverse drug reactions that may be experienced are described in section 6.1.1 above.  The severity of the event, as well as clinical judgment, will be utilized to determine appropriate management of the patient for any AE experienced while participating in this study.  Any medication, including those administered for therapy of symptoms considered associated with study drug administration, should be reported on the appropriate concomitant medication page of the patient’s eCRF.  The symptoms should be reported on the AE page.  NOTE: When choosing medications to manage toxicities per the instructions below (Sections 6.2 & 6.3), please refer to sections 5.2.1 – 5.2.[ADDRESS_707429] of prohibited and discouraged concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 No dose re- escalation will be allowed.  
 No dose reduction below [ADDRESS_707430] be discontinued from study treatment.  Doses may be interrupted for study-drug related toxicities for up to 28 days. If a nonhematologic study-drug related toxicity does not resolve to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_707431] be discontinued from study treatment. If a hematologic study-drug related toxicity does not resolve to ≤ grade 1 or baseline after dose interruption for more than 28 days, the study’s Overall PI, [CONTACT_542302], must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Additionally, the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_542229] 28 days.  Cycle length will be 4 weeks (28 days), even if treatment is held for toxicity.  During dose interruptions, continue to observe the study schedule as planned. All study evaluations and treatments should continue as if study treatment is not being held.  Following a dose delay which resumes mid cycle, day [ADDRESS_707432] treatment evaluation 
(section 5.4). All SAEs must be reported as detailed in Table 11.3. 
 When treatment must be held pending resolution of toxicity to grade 1 or return to baseline, and the toxicity is a lab abnormality, in cases where participant had a pre -existing laboratory 
abnormality at baseline, the toxicity can be considered “resolved” from a hold perspective when it has resolved to within 1 grade of the baseline value.  
 
NOTE: For the purposes of data entry, values from screening assessments should be entered in as ‘baseline’ values.   However, true “baseline values” - for the purpose of 
dose modifications on study, etc. - will be considered the last assessments/tests performed prior to initiation of study therapy. 
 
Exception: In instances where the value within [ADDRESS_707433]. Lee to determine when participant may resume treatment ponatinib after his/her surgery.

 6.[ADDRESS_707441] occurred in ponatinib- treated patients.  Patients with and without 
cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events.  Vascular occlusive adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Arterial Occlusion and Thrombosis 
Serious arterial thrombotic adverse events occurred in ponatinib- treated patients 
with some patients experiencing events of more than one type.  Serious cardiovascular  thrombotic adverse events included myocardial infarction and 
coronary artery disease.  Some patients developed congestive heart failure concurrent or subsequent to the myocardial ischemic event. 
Serious cerebrovascular adverse events were also reported in  ponatinib- treated 
patients.  There were patients who developed stenosis of large arterial vessels of 
the brain (eg, carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery).   
Serious peripheral arterial adverse events were reported in ponatinib -treated 
patients; some patients developed digital or distal extremity necrosis with 
complications of diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease that required 
amputations.   
Monitor and aggressively treat factors that increase cardiovascular risk, such as 
hypertension, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia.  Interrupt and consider discontinuation of study drug in patients who develop arterial thrombotic adverse events.  Any patient who experiences a serious adverse event of myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent revascularization while on trial must be discontinued from the trial unless, for that individual patient, the investigator believes the potential benefits of ponatinib treatment are likely to exceed the risks of continued treatment and the pat ient has no other treatment 
options.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Venous Thromboembolism 
Serious venous thromboembolic adverse events occurred in ponatinib- treated 
patients, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial 
thrombophlebitis, and retinal vein thrombosis.  Consider dose modification or discontinuation of ponatinib in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolic adverse events.   
 Ponatinib should not be restarted in patients with serious venous occlusive 
adverse events unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of recurrent venous 
occlusions and the patient has no other treatment options.   
1.1.[ADDRESS_707442] occurred in ponatinib- treated patients.  In clinical trials, serious peripheral ne uropathic 
adverse events reported included the following: peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia.  Of the patients who developed neuropathy, many developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment.  Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness.  Consider interrupting ponatinib and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_707443] commonly manifested by [CONTACT_542283], has been observed with 
ponatinib.  Monitoring of hepatic function is recommended and management of laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption and/or dose reduction according to Table 6.2. 
1.1.47  Congestive Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction  
Severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction have been reported in patients taking ponatinib.  Patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac disease should be monitored carefully and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac failure should be evaluated and treated. In patients who develop severe CHF (grade 4 left ventricular dysfunction), 
ponatinib should be held and the overall PI ([CONTACT_6321]) should be consulted to 
determine how/if to proceed with treatment.  
 
1.1.48  Hypertension  
Blood pressure should be monitored at each visit.  Hypertension (HTN) by [CONTACT_2669] 2 blood pressure measurements should be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0, which defines HTN as a disorder characterized by a pathological increa se in 
blood pressure; a repeated elevation in the blood pressure exceeding [ADDRESS_707444] comprehensive eye exams at baseline and when clinically indicated.  See the ‘Non- Heme: General (not 
otherwise specified)’ category of Table 6.2 for dose modification details. 
1.1.50  Pancreatitis and Lipase or Amylase Elevations  
Pancreatitis (symptomatic abdominal pain associated with pancreatic enzyme elevation) and/or elevations in lipase and amylase are known AEs associated with ponatinib.  Most cases of pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes o ccur within 
the first [ADDRESS_707445] all patients are able to continue on with ponatinib treatment at the same or a reduced dose once the event has improved to grade 1 or resolved.  Patients with low-grade (1 or 2) elevation in amylase can be continued without dose reduction but should be monitored closely with serial enzyme level determinations.  See Table 6.[ADDRESS_707446] hemorrhagic events occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia.  Maintain or discontinue ponatinib as outlined in Table 6.2. 
1.1.52  Fluid Retention and Edema  
Ponatinib is associated with edema and occasionally serious fluid retention.  
Patients should be weighed and monitored regularly for signs and symptoms of 
fluid retention.  An unexpected rapid weight gain should be carefully inves tigated 
and appropriate treatment provided.  Interrupt, reduce the dose of, or discontinue ponatinib as outlined in Table 6.2. 
1.1.53  Cardiac Arrhythmias  
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in patients treated with ponatinib.  Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of rapid heart rate (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness).  Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias have also been reported.  Advise patients to report signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness, or chest pain, see Table 6.2). 
  
 1.1.[ADDRESS_707447] month on treatment. Myelosuppression can partially be attributed 
to the CML itself; however, treatment with ponatinib could also contribute.  These events can typi[INVESTIGATOR_542231], if felt to be treatment-related, either a reduction or interruption of treatment with ponatinib should 
occur.  Rarely, one or more cytopenias can lead to permanent discontinuation of treatment.  The use of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte- macrophage colony- stimulating factor is 
permitted on study; these agents may be used to support blood counts as clinically indicated to minimize treatment interruptions or repeated dose reductions.  
The important clinical AE of febrile neutropenia falls und er the broad category of 
myelosuppression.  If a patient’s individual risk factors place them at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_542227], primary prophylaxis use of colony- stimulating 
growth factors for the prevention or reduction of febrile neutropeni a is 
recommended according to the published NCCN guidelines [NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2012 – Myeloid Growth Factors].  
1.1.55  Rash and/or Pruritus  
Skin rashes have been commonly reported to be associated with ponatinib.  The vast majority of the skin events are nonserious, either self -limiting or manageable 
with antihistamines or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], and do not result in discontinuation.  In more severe cases, a short course of oral corticosteroids may be used until the rash has improved or resolved.  
In patients tr eated with ponatinib, the most common skin manifestations are a 
diffuse maculo -papular rash that is non- pruritic or an acneiform dermititis.  
Occasionally, patients treated with ponatinib have been reported to have a dry, flaky or exfoliative type of rash or a psoriasiform dermatitis.  Rarely, an erythema multiforme type of rash has been associated with ponatinib.   
Most patients can be maintained on the current dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted, 
and if necessary their symptoms can be managed with antihistam ines, emollients, 
or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  Follow the dose modification guidelines for ’Skin rash’ in Table 6.2. 
  
 1.1.[ADDRESS_707448] of ponatinib.  The use of anti- diarrhea 
medications is permitted.  Patients who experience ≥grade [ADDRESS_707449] treatment schedule (4 mg orally x 1, than 2 mg orally 
after each loose stool, up to a maximum of 16 mg/day). 
Nausea and vomiting are also reported as side effects of ponatinib.  The use of an 
antiemetic prophylactically is not recommended.  However, if a patient is symptomatic, appropriate antiemetic medications may be used as clinically indicated. 
1.1.57  Constitutional Symptoms/Joint Pain  
Certain constitutional symptoms such as myalgia, arthralgia,  headache, weakness, 
fatigue, asthenia, and low grade fever have been very commonly reported with ponatinib.  These symptoms have been reported mainly at the initiation of treatment, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_542232] (<2  weeks), and are seldom, if ever, reported 
beyond the first month of treatment.  These AEs are most commonly low grade (grade 1 and 2) and are self- resolving without the need for dose interruption or 
dose reduction when they do occur.  Most patients can be maintained on the current dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted, and their symptoms can be managed with a short course of oral analagesics, corticosteroids, and/or anti- pyretics as 
clinically indicated.  If dose interruption is indicated, patients can resume the same dose of ponatinib typi[INVESTIGATOR_542233]. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_707450]. Lee to determine when participant may resume treatment ponatinib after his/her surgery.  
1.1.59  Prolonged QTcF  
If a prolongation of QTcF is observed, it is important to perform serum electrolyte analysis (including potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and correct any significant abnormalities with supplements if below normal limits.  It is also necessary to review all concomitant medications the patient is on and discontinue medications that are known or suspected to cause QT prolongation. 
If no contributing reason is identified and the reason for QTcF prolongation is 
believed to be due to study medication, dose interruption and reduction guidelines for general non-hematologic toxicities in Table 6.2 should be followed.  Additionally, weekly ECG monitoring is recommended for 4 weeks upon resumption of study drug, then monthly for 6 months, and then every 3 months for the remainder of the study treatment, or more frequently as clinically indicated.

within [ADDRESS_707459] ponatinib dose, no need to repeat); otherwise, pregnancy test must be repeated within [ADDRESS_707460] -dose evaluation may be contact[CONTACT_542288]. 
j. Brain MRI (standard contrast enhanced MRI of the head) will be performed at baseline, prior to Cycle 2, and then prior to 
every even -numbered cycles ( approximately every 8 weeks) thereafter . Perfusion and diffusion MRI should be performed at 
baseline and prior to Cycle 2. The baseline scan must be performed within [ADDRESS_707461] 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased within 5 days 
from the date of scheduled imaging or if it is increased between the date of imaging and initiation of study treatment , a new 
baseline MRI/CT is required. The same type of scan ( i.e., MRI or CT ) must be used throughout the period of protocol 
treatment for tumor measurement. A patient who develops a contraindication to undergo an MRI scan during study treatment may remain on study and undergo contrast enhanced CT scans.

s. A comprehensive eye exam must be performed at scree ning.  Additional exams should be performed as clinically indicated.  The 
eye exam should test visual acuity, refraction, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_542240], ocular motility, visual fields, and  introcular pressure.  
t. MUGA or ECHO to  be done within [ADDRESS_707464]  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for response prior to even 
cycles (C2D1 and every 8 weeks thereafter). In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory 
scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of objective response. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using RANO response criteria (Section 10.1.4) (Wen, Macdonald et al . 2010). Efficacy evaluations will occur every [ADDRESS_707465] their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit 
objective disease progression or die prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)  
1.1.[ADDRESS_707466] or surgical 
cavity represents a particularly difficult challenge. In general such lesions should be considered non- measurable unless there is a nodular component measuring > 10 
mm in diameter. The cystic or surgical cavity should not be m easured in 
determining response.  
 
Non-measurable disease. Non- measurable disease is defined as either 
unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly defined, or lesions with maximal perpendicular diameters < [ADDRESS_707467] lesions may be measured.  
 1.1.75  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Neurological Examination 
A neurological examination will be performed at baseline and before each 28 -day 
course of therapy. The clinical examination will be conducted by a member of the 
neuro-oncology study team (neuro- oncologist or nurse practitioner). Evaluation 
will be based on changes in signs or symptoms compared to the prior examination 
and deemed unrelated to a  post-ictal state or an unrelated event such as an infection 
or venous thrombosis. Relative changes will be graded as definitely better, possibly better, unchanged, possibly worse or definitely worse. 
 
Radiologic Assessment  
All patients will be followed with contrast- enhanced brain MRI (preferred) or 
contrast-enhanced head CT. All efficacy determinations will be based on RANO 
response criteria (Section 10.1.4) ( Wen, Macdonald et al. 2010 ).  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 14 days prior to registration. Thereafter, tumor measurements will be obtained prior to every even cycle 
(approximately every 8 weeks) days after the first dose as long as the patient remains on the study drug. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_707468] with the same magnet strength, for the duration of the study to reduce difficulties in interpreting changes. 
 Table 10.1: Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI And Clinical Factors  
 
All measurable and non -measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as 
baseline.   
 
Complete Response:  
 
Requires all of the following: 
a) Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non -measurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks.   
b) No new lesions. 
c) Stable or improved non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  
d) Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only).   
e) Stable or improved clinically.  
 NOTES:  
• Patients with non -measurable disease only cannot have a complete response. The best 
response possible is stable disease.  
• In the absence of a scan confirming sustained response [ADDRESS_707469] response 
would be considered a Non -Sustained Complete Response  
Partial Response:  
 
Requires all of the following: 
a) Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
b) No progression of non- measurable disease.   
c) No new lesions.  
d) Stable or improve d non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseline scan.  
e) The corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of baseline scan.  
f) Stable or improved clinically.  
 NOTES:  
• Patients with non -measurable disease only cannot have a partial response. The best 
response possible is stable disease.  
• In the absence of a scan confirming sustained response [ADDRESS_707470] response 
would be considered a Non -Sustained Partial Response  
  
 Stable Disease:  
 
Requires all of the following: 
a) Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression.   
b) Stable non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared to baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow- up imaging shows that this increase in corticosteroids was 
required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
c) Stable clinically.  
NOTE: In the absence of a scan confirming stable disease [ADDRESS_707471] response would 
be considered Non -Sustained Stable Disease  
Progression:  
 
Defined by [CONTACT_39132]: 
a) Greater than > 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids.* 
b) Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy,* not due to co-morbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post-operative changes, or other treatment effects).  
c) Any new lesion. 
d) Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose.  
e) Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. 
f) Clear progression of non- measurable disease.  
 
*Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corticosteroids

 Evaluation of Best Overall Response.  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment  will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria. Complete and partial responses should be confirmed by [CONTACT_542289]. Stable disease will be accepted if it is measured at least two cycles (8 weeks) after the start of treatment and confirmed at least four weeks apart.  
1.1.77  Efficacy Assessments  
 Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined from the time the patient enters the study until there is clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease (see definition of PD above).  Overall survival (OS) will be defined from the time the patient enters the study to the date of death. Patients not known to have died will be censored for survival as of the last date known alive.    PFS and overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_33480]-Meier method. 
 The proportion of patients alive and progression free at 3 months (PFS3) is defined as the number of patients alive and progression free at [ADDRESS_707472] been 
determined by [CONTACT_542290]3, complete radiographic response, or partial radiographic response. When a participant’s films are requested, all films of all views from pre -registration and subsequent scans must be submitted for central review. 
Once the Central Review is complete, the central review results will be made available to the local PI.

 11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Adverse Event Characteristics and Definitions:  
1.1.78  Adverse Event (AE) Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
1.1.79  CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_707473] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. 
1.1.80  General Consideratio ns: 
o Information on all adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_2299], directly observed, or detected by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory test or other means, will be collected, recorded, followed and reported as described in the following sections.  
o The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning 
of the participant at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_542291], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as 
possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
 the severity grade (using CTCAE v. 4.0) 
 its attribution to the study drug  
 its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
 action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non- drug therapy given; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
 whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)  
o Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_542292] , throughout the study, and within [ADDRESS_707474] dose of study medication. Participants who experience an ongoing adverse event related to a study procedure and/or study medication beyond 30 days will continue to be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the study team until the event is resolved, stabilized, or determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_79442].  
 o All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include 
changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
o Participants should be instructed to report any serious post -study-treatment 
event(s) that might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The 
investigator should notify the IRB and any other applicable regulatory agency of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.  
1.1.81  For expedited reporting purposes only:   
o AEs for ponatinib should be reported only if the adverse event varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which is provided. 
o Other AEs for the protocol that do not requi re expedited reporting are outlined in 
the next section (Expedited Adverse Event Reporting) under the sub- heading of 
Protocol-Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions. 
1.1.82  Expectedness of the AE : Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
o Expected adverse event  
“Expected” adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For recording and reporting purposes on this trial, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the 
Ponatinib expected adverse events list Section 6.1.1 of the protocol.   
o Unexpected adverse event  
For recording and reporting purposes on this trial, an adverse event is 
considered “unexpected” when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the Ponatinib expected adverse events list Section 
6.1.1 of the protocol.   
1.1.83  Attribution of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
  
 1.1.84  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition: 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
o Results in death  
o Is life-threatening. Life- threatening means that the person was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e.,  it does not include a 
reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
o Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
o Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a p erson’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
o Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
o Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the deve lopment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. 
All serious adverse events, whether “reportable” as defined in this protocol or not, must be reported to ARIAD.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol-Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions :  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58172], not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284417] -planned treatment for a pre-existing 
condition that did not worsen 
 Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542242] d rug 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159917] , if felt related to patient’s underlying disease  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542243]’s underlying disease (e.g. admission after patient is removed from active study treatment for craniotomy) 
 Lymphopenia (grades 2-4) 
 1.1.[ADDRESS_707475] (AESIs) Definition: 
Vascular occlusive events have been identified as AESIs for ponatinib.   These 
include arterial and venous thrombotic and occlusive adverse events that meet the 
criteria for SAEs (cross- refer to the section where the serious criteria are 
described and defined) and those adverse events that do not meet the SAE criteria.  
AESIs require ongoing monitoring by [CONTACT_87406].  All  AESIs, whether 
SAEs or not, must be reported within 2 business days of the study sponsor awareness to ARIAD .   
 ARIAD has determined that the events listed below (whether considered serious or non-serious by [CONTACT_431]) should be considered AESIs: 
A. Myocardial infarction: The Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Thygesen et al, 2012) is used to define MI  
B. Angina (newly diagnosed or worsening of existing angina or unstable angina) 
C. Coronary artery disease (CAD) (newly diagnosed or worsening of existing CAD) or symptoms that may reflect cardiovascular disease (Thygesen et al, 2012) 
D. Cerebrovascular ischemic disease including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, vascular stenosis, transient ischemic accident (TIA), cerebrovascular occlusive disease documented on diagnostic neuroimaging, or symptoms that may reflect cerebrovascular disease (Easton et al, 2009)   
E. New onset or worsening of peripheral artery occlusive disease (eg, renal 
artery, mesenteric artery, femoral artery) or symptoms  that may r eflect 
peripheral vascular disease  
F. Retinal vascular thrombosis, both venous and arterial            
G. Venous thromboembolism where significant compromise of organ 
function or other significant consequences could result (eg, pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis) or symptoms that may reflect venous thrombosis 
 Any event of a vascular occlusive nature, either serious or non -serious, must be 
reported to ARIAD within 2 business days  of the study sponsor’s awareness.  
 ARIAD may reque st additional information to the study sponsor on observed 
AESIs and this information should be provided in a timely fashion (ie, within 2 business days of the study sponsor awareness).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_707476] or other means, 
will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study- specific 
case report forms (eCRFs) .  
11.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting R equirements (By [CONTACT_422528] [INVESTIGATOR_542244])  
 
The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting 
requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
 
Each adverse event will be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for reporting. 
Adverse event reporting is to occur according to the site’s specific IRB guidelines, and as outlined in this Section. Any serious adverse event occurring after the participant is registered in the study and until [ADDRESS_707477] report to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_102802] (SAE) that occurs 
after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within [ADDRESS_707478] dose of treatment on the local institutional SAE form.  
 
It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report adverse events to the Overall PI[CONTACT_87345], DF/HCC IRB, and/or others as described below.  
The Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_542245], as appropria te (FDA, etc.). 
 
Adverse event reporting by [CONTACT_542293] 11.3. Adverse event reporting 
by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Overall Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_542302]) /or their 
designees follows in Section s 11.4 and 11.5.   
 
For trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the Overall Principal Investigator, 
each participating institution must  abide by [CONTACT_57931]/HCC. This applies to any medical event equivalent to an unexpected grade 2 or 3 with a possible, probable or definite attribution, and any grade 4 toxicities  or grade 5 
(death) regardless of attribution.  
 
Whenever feasible, the participating investigator should provide follow-up information 
on the serious adverse event  within the following 24-48 hours.  Follow-up information 
should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event w as 
treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participation.  
 
Note: If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time of 
continuing review.

 11.4 Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
The IND has been exempt by [CONTACT_1622]; therefore, IND reporting requirements do not 
apply.  
11.5 Reporting to Participating Institutions  
 
The Overall Principal Investigator (or her designee) will  circulate to all participating 
Investigator Teams: 
• All reportable AEs occurring on this study protocol. A cover letter will indicate the 
protocol title, the IND#, and whether the FDA and/or DF/HCC IRB were informed.  
• And all IND safety reports received on study that have not occurred directly on this 
protocol, within 30 days of lead site notification. A letter will accompany the report 
indicating whether a consent form change or protocol change is required or other actions 
including a statement re: whether the report has been or will be submitted to DF/HCC IRB for review.  
11.6 Reporting of Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during study participation (through long- term follow -up), 
regardless of whether or not a serious outcome occurred, will be reported to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_542246] 11.[ADDRESS_707482] to follow -up. The presence and resolution of AEs 
and SAEs (wi th dates) should be documented on the appropriate case report form and 
recorded in the participant’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
 
For some SAEs, the study sponsor, Overall PI, or designee may follow -up by [CONTACT_756], 
fax, and/or monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report).  
 
Participants should be instructed to report any serious post-study event(s) that might reasonably be related to participation in this study. Participating investigators should notify the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_542247] a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a single arm, open label, Phase II trial in adult participants with recurrent 
glioblastoma who have progressed on bevacizumab.  Although anti- angiogenic approaches 
for GBM therapy show promise, GBMs usually develop resistance to treatment within months or even weeks of starting therapy. Drugs such as ponatinib, which target multiple 
receptors,  may potentially help overcome some of the putative mechanisms of resistance and 
result in in creased antitumor effects. Its additional activity may also contribute to a 
therapeutic effect . 
Primary Endpoint:  
a) To determine the efficacy of ponatinib in participants with recurrent GBM who progressed on bevacizumab as measured by 3 -month progression- free survival 
(PFS3) 
Secondary Endpoints: 
• Radiographic Response (RR) 
• Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)  
• Safety profile  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• To explore the extent to which the tumor’s genotype and expression profile correlate with outcome 
• To explore the correlation between serum angiogenic peptides, circulating 
endothelial cells, and circulating progenitor cells with response to therapy  
• To explore the correlation between dynamic-contrast MRI, perfusion and 
diffusion MRI and response to therapy. 
14.[ADDRESS_707489] progressed on a bevacizumab containing regimen as measured by 3-month progression- free survival (PFS3). PFS3 was chosen since agents with ant i-
VEGFR a ctivity may produce pseudoresponses, making response a less reliable endpoint. 
Based on retrospective data, PFS3 rate among recurrent GBM patients who received a second bevacizumab -containing regimen after failing bevacizumab treatment once is 15% ( Quant, 
Norden et al. 2009) . This trial will enroll enough patients to discriminate between a 15% and 
35% PFS3 rate. A Simon optimal t wo-stage design will be used to permit early cessation of 
the study if the agent is unlikely to be effective. The first stage will accrue 15 participants. To account for drop outs, 2 additional participants (up to 15 + 2 = 17 participants) may enroll in the first stage. If at least [ADDRESS_707490] 15 participants achieve PFS3, 12 more participants will be accrued for a total of 27 participants. To account for drop outs in the second stage, 3 more additional participants may enroll, increasing total e nrollment for Stage 
1 + [ADDRESS_707491] 10 or more out of 27 participants achieve PFS at 3 months.  This design assumes alpha error of 0.10 and beta error of 0.2. The probability of early termination if the drug is ineffective is 69%.   
 A total of 32 participants may be accrued . With an accrual rate of 3-4 participants per month, 
the anticipated enrollment period will be 8-11 months.  
14.3 Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Response rate will be the proportion of participants with measurable disease who experience 
complete or partial radiographic response determined by [CONTACT_542294] (Wen, 
Macdonald et al. 2010 ). Progression free survival, PFS 3, and overall survival will be 
calculated using standard statistical methods. Safety will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Participants will not be replaced for any reason.   
 In general the circulating biomarker and neuro- imaging results will be summarized in a 
descriptive manner with comparison between pre - and post- treatment assay results when 
possible. 
14.[ADDRESS_707492] by [CONTACT_284384], national and local health authorities, Pharmaceutical company providing the agent, and the IRB for each study site, if appropriate. The intention is to publish the results of this study in a medical journal such as Journal of Clinical Oncology or Neuro-Oncology. Results may be presente d at national meetings of the American 
Society for Clinical Oncology and/or Society for Neuro-Oncology. Results will be made publicly available as required by [CONTACT_2371].

Plasma Biomarkers 
Local Processing Instructions  
 
In the event that a Plasma Biomarkers sample is drawn without sufficient time to be processed at the Steele 
Lab within 2 hours of collection, (e.g. in the event patient is drawn at 4 pm), please refer to the following 
processing instructions . 
 
NOTE: The instructions below are provided on an as needed basis.  This alternative should be avoided whenever 
possible, as this additional process does render samples no longer analyzable by  [CONTACT_4133] . 
 
1. Blood Draw and Centrifugation  
• As noted in protocol section 8. 1.1: 
o Collect 2 tubes of ~[ADDRESS_707497] be pre -cooled in an ice bath.  
o Gently invert five to six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent coagulation.  
o Cool the tubes immediately in an ice bath.  
 
• Within [ADDRESS_707498] be processed locally for storage.  To process these samples locally:  
o Centrifuge the blood tube at 700g (2000rpm) for 20 minutes at 4°C with no break at the end of  
centrifugation for plasma extraction.  
o Using a sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], pi[INVESTIGATOR_542268] (careful not to disturb the bottom red layer) and aliquot  equally into 3 pre -labeled 1.8 mL Nunc cryovials.  
o Visually check the plasma for hemolysis.  
 If the plasma appears to be yellow and clear, please proceed with processing the plasma, record the observation  internally per standard practice, and make the Study Team aware 
of any abnormality . 
 If the plasma appears to be dark red, please discard the  plasma, record the event 
internally per standard practice, and make the Study Team aware of the event . 
o After the plasma has been extracted, check the red blood cells by [CONTACT_542299]. Record if there was clotting 
observed per standard practice, and make the Study Team aware of the any abnormality . 
o Immediately store the cryovials into a -80°C freezer*.  
o Record time of freeze and  location of the vials (i.e., freezer number, shelf, box number, and 
room #, as  applicable) per standard practice. 
 
2. Labeling and Storing Specimens  
 
Each specimen should be labeled with the following information:   
Patient study number  
Patient Initials  
Military time sample was obtained  
Date sample was obtained  
Cycle #/Day# of sample  
 and that label affixed to the cryvials and then covered completely with protective cryogenic freezer tape 
(Fisher catalogue no. 11 -867B).  
 
All cryovials should be stored in a monitored -80° C freezer.

1.  Background and Significance  
Parents of children with disabilities experience elevated levels of p arental stress, distress, and 
poorer health outcomes compared to the parents of children without disabilities (Lindo et al., 2016 & Olodsen & Richardson, 2006). Currently, research has focused primarily on mothers, “educators,” or “parents” who have childr en with disabilities, with little research pertaining to fathers specifically 
(Hastings & Beck, 2004 & Oelofsen & Richardson, 2006). However, studies including fathers have found that they experience more stress, parenting daily hassles, and health stress than fathers of 
children without disabilities (Darling, Senatore, & Strachan, 2012; Oelofsen, & Richardson, 2006; 
Seymour et al., 2017) and are more likely to show violence in times of distress (Kimberlee et al., 2014). Additionally, contrary to the percep tion that fathers of children and youth with special health care 
needs (CYSHCN) do not want to be involved in their child’s life, some studies have found fathers report a desire to be involved and see involvement as highly important (Rankin et al., 2019). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_454431] (Darling, Senatore, & Strachan, 2012), significant gaps in the literature r egarding interventions for this demographic remain.  Therefore, 
future studies that aim to increase resiliency and decrease stress among fathers of CYSHCN are needed.  
Fathers of CYSHCN may be underrepresented in research, in part, due to the barriers, men,  
particularly men of color, report experiencing when accessing health care (ex., social influence/stigma, economic strain, cultural influences, and changing gender roles) (Khanalou et al., 2015; Addis & Mahalik, 2003; Sicouri et al., 2018; Tully et al., 20 17). Further, it has been established that men are 
less likely to seek help compared to women (Addis & Mahalik, 2003; Liddon, Kingerlee, & Barry, 2018).  
Significant gender differences observed between men and women indicate the need to tailor 
interventions for the specific needs of fathers. Several studies have found that fathers reported preferring interventions and activities with their children that incorporated physical activity into their designs (Rankin et al., 2019; Kingerlee et al., 2014; Sicouri e t al.,2018). Additionally, fathers of CYSHCN 
tend to prefer male-focused support groups over other intervention designs (Kingerlee et al., 2014; 
Batchelor, Maguire, & Sheran, 2021; Sicouri et al., 2018). Finally, some studies have found that fathers

Version 2021.[ADDRESS_580833] (Sicouri et al., 2018).  
Given these preferences, it is crucial that clinicians understand the intersection between male gender roles and recruitment approaches to accommodate current interventions for fathers (Julion et al., 
2018 & Batchelor, Maguire, & Sheran, 2021). Currently, little research focuses on reducing stress and 
increasing resiliency among fathe rs of CYSHCN, leaving few opportunities for in -person or virtual care 
(Kuhlthau et al., 2020). However, several studies have found that prioritizing cultural sensitivity, addressing the influence of masculinity in culture, and addressing systemic barriers have the potential 
to increase male involvement in interventions that target resiliency (Seidler et al., 2018 & Khanlou et 
al., 2015).  
Additionally, a meta -analysis revealed six interventions that targeted the fathers of children with 
developmental disabil ities, where two explored the influence of home -based behavioral parent 
training and the remaining four explored the influence of copi[INVESTIGATOR_454432] (Lindo et al., 2016). In a more recent meta -analysis, ten papers were ide ntified that 
examined interventions that included fathers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (Rankin et al., 2019). Of these studies, five were in -home training programs, two had control groups, and six 
compared mothers to fathers (Rankin et al., 20 19).  Finally, one study on Mindfulness found that 
fathers who were more mindful were also more involved in their child’s life and that the level of mindfulness may predict father -child relationships and child outcomes (Macdonald & Hastings, 2010). 
Large g aps in the literature persist regarding interventions targeted toward fathers of CYSHCN, 
indicating a need for future studies to accommodate current intervention for the parents of CYSHCN to fathers.   
Resiliency is a multidimensional construct that refers  to the ability to maintain adaptation and 
effective functioning when faced with stressors. Resiliency provides a framework for understanding 
the adjustment to stress as a dynamic process. Allostasis refers to the capacity to maintain stability of 
physiolo gical systems in the face of adversity. When the exposed to chronic stressors, such as care for 
a CYSHCN, individuals expend a great deal of energy attempting to maintain allostasis; this can lead to 
the metabolic wear and tear described as allostatic load. Evidence is accumulating that this wear and 
tear is mediated by [CONTACT_454441].  Allostatic load and resilience can therefore be assessed by [CONTACT_454442] (HPA axis and salivary alpha-amylase).  
Research to improve fathers’ responses to stress is warranted and may help improve the 
wellbeing of both fathers and their children. Yet, a treatment targeting  the psychosocial needs of 
fathers of CYSHCN has not b een developed. This study aims to design and develop a resiliency 
intervention to provide support to fathers of CYSHCN.  
This intervention will be a modified version of [CONTACT_77108]’s evidence -based 8 -week multimodal 
treatment which is designed to promote adapt ation to stress and resiliency. The original program (the 
SMART -3RP) is an 8 session, 1.5 hours weekly multi modal intervention that incorporates relaxation 
techniques, stress awareness discussion, and adaptive strategies to improve copi[INVESTIGATOR_7315]. In 
Phase 1 ( Protocol #:2021P002838), we conducted a series of interviews to adapt  the original  SMART -
3RP to meet the unique needs of fathers caring for children with special health care needs . This 
protocol outlines Phase [ADDRESS_580834]  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol 
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 4 of 15 2. Specific Aims and Objectives  
Based on findings from our prior trials with parents of children with learning and attentional disabilities 
and parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (Kuhlthau et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020 ; IRB 
approved: #:2016P001622 and 2016P002037 respectively), we propose to pi[INVESTIGATOR_454433] -3RP among fathers of children with special health care needs. In both  of these trials , 
the majority of participants who completed an earlier version of the intervention were mothers. T he 
current study has the following objective s: 
 
Aim 1: 
Through participation in an open pi[INVESTIGATOR_3627], w e aim to  further refine the adapted  SMART -
3RP content and study procedures . Treatment and study adaptations will be informed by [CONTACT_454443], a post -intervention survey, and exit inte rview(s)  with participants, which will be 
recorded and transcribed.  
 
In addition to aim 1, we have one exploratory aims:  
 
Exploratory Aim 1: We aim to explore the preliminary feasibility (by [CONTACT_454444]) and acceptability (assessed using the 
Participant Feedback Survey) of an 8 -session Relaxation Response Resiliency (SMART -3RP) program for 
fathers of CYSHCN .  
 
 
 
3. General Description of Study Design  
This is a n open pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . Based on Phase I findings, w e propose to enroll up to 12 fathers of CYSHCN in 
the adapted SMART -3RP intervention. The SMART-3RP is an 8 -session mind -body resiliency intervention 
that will be conducted virtually. Participants will complete the study survey at baseline and immediately 
following the intervention. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], participants will also be asked to provide weekly feedback on program sessions and  participate in exit interview (s) following the int ervention.  The intervention may 
be iteratively modified as we receive feedback from participants.  
 
4. Participant  Selection  
Inclusion Criteria:  
1) Self-reported identify as f ather or male guardian of at least one child with special health care needs  
(e.g.,  autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, dyslexia)  
2) Age 18 or older 3) Ability to participate in group, virtual sessions including a ccess to computer, tablet, or smartphone 
and internet . 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
Fathers will not be eligible if they are un able to speak or read English, are unwilling or unable to 
participate in the study, or are considered medically or otherwise unable to participate by [CONTACT_9154].  
There are no exclusion criteria with respect to ethnicity or socioeconomic status.  To infor m feasibility 
and acceptability, we will document reasons for refusal and reasons why fathers are excluded (and will 
maintain this data in a de -identified way). 
 Recruitment:  
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol 
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 5 of 15 Participants will be recruited through advertisements (e.g.,  flyers) placed throu ghout social media 
platforms and online support groups for parents and families of CYSCHN. Flyers will also be placed 
throughout clinical and community settings  and on the Mass General Brigham (MGB)  Rally website . 
These flyers are included in the IRB submi ssion. We will also share the flyer with family leaders who may 
distribute it to their networks. Interested participants may call or email the study staff to learn more 
about the study.  
 We will also recruit through our contacts in the community including providers from [LOCATION_005] 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454434], as well as through local and national support groups, such 
as Family Voices and clinics affiliated with the Children and Youth with Special Healthcare Needs 
Network.  MGH ps ychologists may also refer potentially eligible participants. If individuals reached 
through this recruitment method are interested in the study, they will complete the screening process described below for participants responding to advertisements.  
 
5. Parti cipant  Enrollment  
Interested participants may call or email study staff to learn more about the study. A member of the study staff (e.g.,  a PI [INVESTIGATOR_454435]) will explain study procedures, answer any 
questions, and complete an eligibility  screening over the phone or via REDCap. They will then complete 
the electronic  consent process described below. We plan to enroll up to 12 participants  with the goal of 
conducting up to 2  intervention groups ; each group will consist of approximately [ADDRESS_580835].  Participants  will be made aware of security 
concerns related to email communication and will be informed  of how to use the REDCap Survey Login 
feature. If not already specified via the completion of an eligibility screen, the participant will be given 
the option of using the MGB send secure system or unencrypted email.  
 Electronic Informed Consent Process (EIC):  
The participant  will be emailed the informed consent portal via REDCap. The REDCap link will direct the m 
to an encrypted REDCap portal; the Electronic/Paperless Consent Template Project will be used. Once the  
participant  confirms receipt of the EIC form link, they will be prompted to enter in their full name [CONTACT_454461]. This portal will have the electronic 
(paperless) consent form, to guide the m throu gh the consent discussion with study staff over the phone. 
The participant  will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and take their time to consider their 
participation. If a  participant  would prefer, they may return to the EIC portal as many times as they would 
like to review the consent form on their own time. When ready, participant s will digitally sign and 
date/time the consent form. Additionally, the participant  will be prompted after signing to indicate the 
method through which they would like to receive a copy of the consent form for their record: digitally or 
through hard copy. If a patient would like to receive a copy of the consent form digitally, they will be asked 
of their preference to receive the email as encrypted, the default, or opt -out and receive the email 
unencrypted. These options allow participants to be informed of what an encrypted (Send Secure) email would appear as in their inbox and the steps to get into the email, or alternatively, to give permission 
receive the email without this extra layer of security but in a more accessible format.  MGB  language 
concerning the Send Secure feature is included to assist in this decision. Study staff will confirm receipt of

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol 
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_580836] protected computer. The SSN will only be shared with the Partners 
Accounts Payable office and will be removed from research records when th e check is generated.  The SSN 
and a valid US address (collected on demographic form in “Contact [CONTACT_7171]” section) will be reported in the eCheck submission, which will be used for participant remuneration.  
 
The consent forms will include a description of all study procedures, information about potential risks and 
benefits of participation, and study contact [CONTACT_3031] (including that of the IRB) in case questions arise 
at a later time. The consent form will also explicitly state that study participatio n is voluntary, and that 
participants may refuse to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable and  may discontinue 
participation at any time. The consent forms will also describe what participants will be asked to do in 
participating in the study. P articipants will also be made aware that confidentiality would be broken if 
participants reported thoughts of harming themselves or others, in order to obtain appropriate care for 
the person.  Lastly, the consent form will ask participants to consent to au dio-recording of the exit 
interview (s) following the intervention.  
 
In addition, special attention will be given during the consent process to the implications of receiving an 
intervention online via a videoconferencing platform. Participants will be explicitly informed that the 
video conferencing service, Zoom, provides s ecure web-based HIPAA -compliant videoconferencing 
software. Zoom is routinely used at MGB  institutions and participants do not need to sign an end -user 
license agreement in order to use it. Zoom is a cloud -based solution, so participants need only click on  
the meeting link to participate on the platform, and they do not need to install the software onto their personal devices.  All use of Zoom throughout the duration of this study will be with a MGB Zoom 
account.  Participants will also be advised to wear he adphones and sit in a quiet place to protect their 
own, and other group members’ privacy. We will explain to participants that although we will do our 
best to ensure confidentiality on our end, we cannot guarantee 100% that other group members will not 
share the content of the group. Participants will also be advised to wear headphones and sit in a quiet 
place to protect their own, and other group members’ privacy.  
 Participation will not be recorded in medical or employment records. All procedures and pro tocols will 
be approved by [CONTACT_454445] (MGB) IRB. The participant will be given as much time as they 
need to review the consent  and ask any questions.  
 Following consent, the participant will be asked to complete a demographic survey. The participant will 
also have the option to complete a brief test call with a study staff member using the videoconferencing 
software in order to ensure proficiency with the software.  
 
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Participant communication  
Participants will be asked to  provide contact [CONTACT_454446].  
 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol 
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_580837] via phone, paper mail, email and/or text message to 
schedule group sessions a nd send study reminders, that will be sent up to twice a week. At minimum, 
participant s will be asked to provide a home address and telephone number to allow for supplemental 
contact [CONTACT_271989] ( e.g.,  intervention guide, study material s, etc.). Participants  will 
be informed of MGB policies regarding text -messaging and email, per the information below.  
 
Text Message:  Participant s will be given the option of communicating with study staff via text -message. 
Study staff will send brief tex t messages, containing limited information related to session scheduling as 
well as group session and survey reminders. Text -messages will be sent through a dedicated study 
phone plan, reviewed and administered by [CONTACT_454447]. Text -messages wi ll instruct the 
participants to refer to their email for more information. P articipants will be given the opportunity to 
review the  MGB  texting language within the consent form. If a participant chooses to receive text 
messages from study staff, they given  the option to receive encrypted or unencrypted text message and 
will be read the following language:  
 “The MBH  standard is to send secure text messages.  If you prefer, we can send you "unencrypted" texts 
that are not secure and could result in the unaut horized use or disclosure of your information.  If you 
want to receive communications by [CONTACT_454448][INVESTIGATOR_241608], MGB  will not be held 
responsible.  Text message and data rates may apply based on your cell phone service plan.  Your 
preference  to receive unencrypted texts will apply to text messages sent to you from research staff in 
this study.  If you wish to communicate with other research staff at MGB  regarding additional studies, 
your preference will have to be documented with each researc h study.”  
 
Under no circumstances will study staff ever screen or discuss personal medical history, exchange 
personal health information, or other sensitive information via SMS message. If a participant introduces 
sensitive information, including but not l imited to the examples just listed, into a SMS message 
conversation, the study staff member will direct the participant to call them to discuss it further over the phone on a dedicated secure phone line. Participants  will be able to opt out of receiving SM S text 
message, at any time, for any reason, by [CONTACT_454449]. We intend to use a dedicated study phone plan, reviewed and administered by [CONTACT_454450].  
 Email:  Participants  will also be given the option to communicate (receive reminders, schedule, etc.) with 
study staff by [CONTACT_6968]. If participant chooses email as their preferred method of communication, study 
staff will explain th e encrypted, Send Secure default feature of emails sent from within the MGB  
Healthcare network. Study staff will verify that no sensitive or patient health information will be 
disclosed in emails but ensure that the patient understands that by [CONTACT_454451]-out of the send secure 
feature, information will not be as secure.  
 
Assessments  
Study assessments will include a battery of questionnaires via REDCap. At baseline, participants will be 
administered baseline questionnaires. Immediately following the intervention, participants are 
administered a second set of questionnaires (see attached  “Participant Survey).  
 The assessments are itemized below. In addition, participants will be asked to complete weekly 
feedback surveys via REDCap  throughout their intervention.

Intervention  
In the i ntervention, sessions focus on developi[INVESTIGATOR_454436] (RR), on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a regular practice of eliciting the RR, and on 
learning cognitive behavioral and positive psychology/resilience skills. In addition to the weekly group 
sessions, participants will receive the manual, via paper mail and/or an emailed pdf, which describes the 
content of the sessions, and audio recorded guided meditations for independent relaxation practice. 
Participants are expected to practi ce eliciting the RR for approximately 20 minutes a day throughout the 
course of the study, using the audio recording provided and/or any other meditative or mind body 
techniques. Participants will complete a daily log reporting how often and by [CONTACT_454453]. (Please see attached practice log).  
 
The intervention  will be delivered virtually, via Zoom, a secure videoconferencing platform. The 
intervention will not be delivered clinically and will be a psycho -educational interventio n. Participants 
will be asked to wear headphones and sit in a quiet room by [CONTACT_454454].   
Participants in  all groups will be given questionnaires at the same timepoints (baseline, post 
intervention). Study staff will email these questionnaires to the participants via the REDCap system. 
Participants who have not responded within two weeks of each time point will be contact[CONTACT_454455].  
 
Exit Interview  
Following the intervention, we will conduct individual and gr oup exit interview s with participants.  
Participants will be offered the option of participating in a group interview and an individual interview –  
they may participate in either or both formats, depending on their preference and availability. Group 
interviews will [ADDRESS_580838] and transcribe the conversation  (see “Exit Interview 
Guide”)  
 
Remuneration  
Participants will receive a check of which the amount is based on the number of surveys completed. Participants will receive $25 per survey completed (baseline, post intervention) . If they complete both 
surveys, they will receive an additional $25. Additionally, participants will receive $5 per each weekly 
feedback survey (8 surveys in total) and $25 for participating in  the exit interview s ($25 for each 
interview: group and individual)  following the int ervention. In total, participants  may be able to receive 
a check of up to $[ADDRESS_580839]

Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 9 of 15 7. Risks and Discomforts 
Participants may feel uncomfortable completing various psychosocial questionnaires. As in any research 
study, there is a  small risk that confidentiality may be breached; all efforts to minimize this risk will be 
taken, as outlined below. In addition, participants may find it time consuming to practice techniques 
learned in the intervention or tracking behavior such as elicitation the relaxation response.  
 
As previously described , all participant information will remain confidential unless there is a reasonable 
concern for the safety of a participant . Depending on the nature of the situation, study staff will provide 
a clinical referral and/or contact [CONTACT_454456]. 
Specifically, the leader(s) of the intervention sessions will be study staff members who are licensed 
psychologists and have experience delivering the program. If, at any point throughout the delivery of the intervention, staff members recognize a participant  as distressed, they will ask the participant if they 
would like to take a break or continue and remind them they can terminate being part of the study at any time or opt out of a portion of the study.  The interventionist will inform the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or fellow 
co-investigators of the conversation with the participant and discuss how to proceed. If, in the judgment 
of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or fellow co -investigators, the  participant appears to be too emotionally distressed by 
[CONTACT_114363], we will recommend that the participant to leave the study. If, at any point during the 
intervention, the participant appears to be at risk or harming themselves and/or others, study st aff will 
provide a clinical referral and/or contact [CONTACT_454457].  
 
 
8. Benefits  
Participants may not benefit from this study. Participants in the current study may observe a reduction 
in symptoms of stres s related to being a father of CYSHCN. It is hoped that the intervention will result in 
a statistically significant reduction of symptoms of stress and an increase in resiliency.  
 
The current study may provide support for fathers. This intervention may enhance our understanding of the role of psycho -educational interventions such as the SMART -3RP in fathers of CYSHCN. This 
intervention may have widespread implications for types of resources available that may ultimately improve wellbeing of CYSHCN.  
 
9. Statistical Analysis  
We plan to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] a virtual -based SMART-3RP for fathers of CYSHCN.  Our main goal is to 
gather feedback from program participants  through weekly descriptive surveys  in order to iteratively 
adapt the SMART -3RP manual for  fathers . Data from these  surveys , in addition to the post-intervention 
survey and  the exit interviews,  will be used to inform any adaptations to program content and 
structure. We will utilize rapid analysis to analyze qualitative feedback collected in th e surveys  and 
thematic content analysis to analyze qualitative data collected in exit interviews .  In addition, we hope 
to assess the questions below as exploratory outcomes.  
 
Exploratory Outcomes  
1) Is the virtual intervention feasible and acceptable for fathers of CYSHCN? 
Feasibility will be assessed using attendance (i.e. 6/8 sessions).  
Feasibility will also be assessed by [CONTACT_454458].

attached).  
 
 
10.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
Data Management and Quality Control Procedures  
All study staff will complete required MGB human participants trainings prior to the start of study 
procedures. All interventionists and assessors will have advanced training in interviewing and 
assessment. Participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer questions that make them feel 
uncomfortable. Par ticipants will be advised to wear headphones and sit in a quiet place during each 
virtual session. Participants will also be asked not to share the contents of the group with anyone else.  
 
Electronic information will be stored in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a free, secure, and HIPAA -compliant web -based application hosted by [CONTACT_454459] & Services (ERIS) group (based at the PHS Needham corporate 
datacenter).  
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free, secure, HIPAA compliant web -based application 
hosted by [CONTACT_251052] & Services 
(ERIS) group. The system offers easy data manipulation with audit trails, r eports for monitoring and 
querying participant records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages 
(SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).  
 Participants will complete surveys using a REDCap link that will only be sent to them. They will be 
instructed to complete the survey in one sitting, within two weeks of receiving the survey link. Not all 
survey questions require completion. Participants will have the option of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_454437], and they will not be able to go back to the survey at a later time. If not all of the questions are 
answered, the survey will simply be left as incomplete. Rate of survey completion will be used to 
measure the feasibility of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. Only participants themselves will be able to edit survey 
responses.  
 The REDCap project will use the logging feature to track data entry. Data will be monitored weekly by a 
study coordinator. The coordinator will meet regularly with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_454438] .  
 
Data will be stored on password protected computers that will be stored in secure locations at all times. Only research staff will have access to these data locations.  
 
A unique anonymous identifier will be assigned to each participant; subsequently, all data collected will 
be associated exclusively with this identifier. This includes all questionnaires administered over the 
course of the study, as well as home practice logs.  
 
All groups will meet using Zoom, a secure, HIPAA compliant web -based videoco nferencing platform. All 
group sessions will be password protected, and the password will only be shared with trained study staff 
and study participants .

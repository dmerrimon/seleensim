1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE 
More than 50% of all patients with cancer receive some form of radiotherapy (RT), for curative or 
palliative purposes, during the course of their illness.  
One of the dose-limiting effects of radiotherapy is the acute reaction that ionizing radiation 
induces in normal tissues. The severity of adverse events resulting from exposure to 
radiotherapy is, in general, related to age and general health as well as to treatment-related 
factors such as the area being treated, radiation dose per fraction, and the total dose administered. 
Skin toxicity is the most common acute side effect of radiotherapy to the breast, occurring in more 
than 90% of patients. (1)  
 The specific purpose of this trial is to determine whether the hyaluronan components of HylaCare
TM induce an effectiveness response significantly greater than use of a vehicle control 
which lacks those ingredients in the management of acute skin reactions to external beam 
radiotherapy.   
 
2. BACKGROUND 
Early-onset adverse events occur to tissues soon  after treatment initiationwith external beam 
radiation therapybegins. The emergence of such symptoms, when severe, can adversely affect 
the patient's quality of life, result in treatment interruptions, and can reduce patient compliance 
with the treatment regimen. Among the most common of these is skin toxicity, observed frequently in patients being treated for breast cancer. The onset of acute radio-epi[INVESTIGATOR_186131], epi[INVESTIGATOR_344], and epi[INVESTIGATOR_108632], with the skin in the treated area becoming dry, pruritic, hypersensitive, easily irritated, and in the longer term, hyper-pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194]. With some forms of radiotherapy, treated skin may develop a mo ist reaction, resulting in severe soreness in 
the area of body folds. In addition, patients treated for breast tumors may develop changes in 
skin texture. Most skin reactions resolve within a few weeks after treatment is completed, although the skin may remain slightly darker than pretreatment.   The present management of radiation-associated skin  toxicity includes instructions for care of 
the affected areas and the use of skin care products which can combat symptoms, without inducing further skin irritation.  Attention has recently been focused on the effe cts of hyaluronan (HA) for the management of 
radio-epi[INVESTIGATOR_186132]. Liguori et al. (2) reported the effects of hyaluronan 
serum when applied to skin surfaces affected by [CONTACT_186149], breast, and pelvic 
tumors. Compared to a matching placebo serum, patients treated with the HA serum showed a 
significant postponement in the first signs of acute radio-epi[INVESTIGATOR_186133] a reduction in the severity of skin reactions. 
The present study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HylaCare
TM in the management 
of acute skin reactions to extern al beam radiotherapy.  HylaCareTM contains the patented 
HylaSponge®System, composed of small and large molecular weight hyaluronan 
(hyaluronic acid) and polymerized HylaSponges of infinite molecular weight.  Due to its 
structure and preparation, the HylaSponge®System is  designed to improve the controlled 
release and slow delivery of various ingredients. A Repeated Insult Patch Test (RIPT) with HylaCare
TM in 30 volunteer subjects demonstrated no potential for eliciting either dermal 
irritation or sensitization (3). 
[ADDRESS_219909]   
The major properties which make this biopolymer unique and valuable for skin care are: 
 Its ability to be loaded with, and then slowly release, water and a variety of active 
ingredients  
 Extremely high water retention 
 The quality of acting as a  “second skin”,  which is hydrated, protective, and 
biocompatible 
HylaCareTM, formulated as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_119029], has super-hydrating properties. It contains skin 
moisturizers such as pure low and high molecular weight hyaluronan, the HylaSponge
®System, and squalane. These characteristics make HylaCareTM an excellent 
candidate for use in the skin care of patients who may develop acute skin toxicity associated with the use of external beam radiotherapy.

The primary measures of effectiveness will be: 
 
1. Physician's Follow-Up Evaluation: assessing signs and symptoms at each irradiated site  at 
week [ADDRESS_219911]-treatment:  
2. Physician's Global Assessment:  assessing each irradiated site at [ADDRESS_219912]-treatment 
A secondary measure of effectiveness will be: 
 The patient's independent and separate assessment of the tolerance to radiotherapy of each 
treated site at Week 5 of  radiotherapy and at 2 weeks after its completion. 
An additional method of evaluation will be the Investigator’s assessment (disease oriented team 
to do assessment) of the baseline and treatment timeline photos. 
 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This will be a randomized, double blind, vehicl e-controlled evaluation of the effectiveness and 
safety of HylaCareTM. The study will employ the patient as her own control, a commonly used 
method for the evaluation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_186134]. Each patient will be randomized blindly 
as to whether  the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line (see Figure  1. below). The product and placebo will 
also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control. The study 
drug and placebo will be applied three (3) times daily, but not within [ADDRESS_219913] to be applied to either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) portion of the breast, a placebo product will be used on the other side. Patients and clinical investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments.

Applications three (3) times per day will continue throughout the course of radiotherapy and for 
24 weeks after its completion (end of study).  On any treatment day, there will be an application 
of test and control products immediately after the radiotherapy. No application will be made within four (4) hours prior to radiotherapy.   HylaCare
TM and a matching (in appearance, consistency and odor) vehicle control product will 
be supplied in identically appearing opaque bottles and dispensed according to a randomized 
code list prepared by [CONTACT_186150].  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_186135] [ADDRESS_219915]  for acute skin toxicity changes using the NCIC-CTC version 4.0 scale.  A 
second Investigator Grading Scale will also be used for evaluation.  Evaluation of the
 changes will 
also include examination and questioning for eryt hema, pruritis, pain, dryness, exfoliation, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_344], hyperesthesia, or other signs/symptoms at each site.  A supra-clavicular field  may 
be  irradiated and may also be treated with Products A and B, but will not be assessed for dermatitis.    
At study completion, both the Investigator and patient will, independently and separately, 
assess the overall dermatitis of the irradiated breast and the contralateral (non-irradiated) breast.

4.[ADDRESS_219920] of 10 Gy in 5 fractions (total of 
33 fractions).  Patients will be followed for 2weeks after radiotherapy has finished, with a follow- 
up visits at [ADDRESS_219921]-treatment.  
 
 4.3 Data Collection 
Data will be collected (typewritten, or handwritten legibly in black ink) on the appropriate case 
report forms supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
4.4 Concomitant Medications 
 Patients will be asked about changes in their medications (prescription, nonprescription, or 
herbals) during their participation including name [CONTACT_18467], indication for use, dosage, date started and date stopped.  Changes in medications will be recorded. 
 
4.5 General Plan 
 
The patient's overall treatment plan will be guided by [CONTACT_186153]. In general, its planning 
steps will include: 
 
1. Special radiologic studies may be ordered to help plan the radiation treatments 
2. Devices (e.g., breast boards, vac lok) may  be fabricated to maintain proper 
positioning during treatment per the radiation oncologist 
3. Simulation x-rays will be performed to ensure accurate planning of the size and 
direction of the radiation treatment fields on a weekly basis 
4. Tattoos or other markers will be applied to ensure the proper setup for daily treatment 5. Custom-made blocks may be fabricated, based on CT simulation, to shield normal 
structures 
6. During a setup session, the field ar rangements and blocks will be checked for proper 
alignment 
7. In general, the borders of the field are: 
i. Superior:  inferior to the clavicle 
ii. Lateral:  mid-axillary line 
iii. Inferior:  2 cm inferior to the infra-mammary fold 
iv. Medial:  Mid-sternum 
 4.[ADDRESS_219922] radiotherapy visit, the patient will be provided with 3 Set Bags containing 
sufficient materials for 3 weeks of treatment, or as needed.  Patients will receive more Set Bags at Week 3 and Week 5, or as needed. Each Set Bag will contain two (2) 60 mL bottles of 
HylaCare
TM, and two (2) i dentically appearing bottles of Placebo (Control Vehicle). Both 
containers will be labeled with the patient's initials , study number, and location of skin to be 
covered (ie. right lateral breast, left medial breast, etc.)  Additionally, the patient will be instructed as to the proper application of the serums, including amount, location, coverage, 
[ADDRESS_219923]  and hand washing.  See “Patient Instructions”, Form 8 
The contents of each bottle (HylaCareTM or Placebo) will have been determined by a 
computerized random assignment scheme, the code fo r which will be kept at the study site in a 
sealed envelope. 
 
The radiotherapy nurse, research team or physician will instruct the patient as to the proper application method and ensure that the patient understands which container contents are to be applied to which site (see Figure 1 and Patient Instructions, Form 8). The patient will apply a sufficient amount  of either HylaCare or plac ebo (as prescribed in the experimental randomized 
design) to cover the entire marked surface of their irradiated skin area IMMEDIATELY AT THE 
END OF THE TREATMENT SESSION. At this time the same treatment will be applied to the 
contralateral (non-irradiated) breast. The patient will make two other applications during the day to ensure a total of three (3) daily applications of both HylaCare
TM and the vehicle control.  No 
applications will be made within 4 hours before radiotherapy.  The three (3) daily 
applications will continue throughout the course of radiotherapy and for [ADDRESS_219924], as seen in Figure 
1 will determine areas for use of study serum and placebo.  The patient will also be instructed: 
1. To apply product only to the areas identified on both breasts immediately  after the 
radiotherapy session, and then two more times that day.        
2. On non-treatment days, to apply the product three (3) times daily 3. Not to use other skin care products on any of the radiotherapy-exposed skin areas 4. To report any generalized reactions  or any localized reactions in treatment area to the 
investigator at the next daily session, or more severe reactions by [CONTACT_756] (See Section 8). 
5. to discontinue use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_186137] >/= grade 3 dermatitis. 
 
 Suggestions for personal care of the irradiated treatment sites may include:  
1. Avoid irritating the skin 2. When washing, use only lukewarm water and mild soap, patting the surface 
dry  
3. Avoid the use of tight clothing 4. Do not rub, scrub or scratch the skin 5. Avoid the use of heating pads or ice packs 
6. Do not use powders, creams, perfumes, deod orants, body oils, ointments, or lotions 
on the irradiated surfaces 
7. Avoid direct sun exposure; if necessary, wear protective clothing

6.4 Informed Consent  
Written consent will be obtained from each patient prior to entering this trial and will become 
part of the patient’s permanent study record.  Each patient will be assured that study 
participation is voluntary and that she may withdraw at any time.  At the time of obtaining written consent, the Investigator will advise patients of the experimental nature of HylaCare
TM, 
the duration of the trial, alternate modes of prophylaxis, and prevalent adverse events that might occur and discuss willing ness to have photographs taken.  
 7. EFFICACY PARAMETERS 
The primary measures of effectiveness will be: 
 Physician's Follow-Up Evaluation(Form 3): assessing signs and symptoms at each 
irradiated site  Week [ADDRESS_219933]-treatment  
 Physician's Global Assessment:  assessing each irradiated site at Week [ADDRESS_219934]-treatment 
A secondary measure of effectiveness will be the patient's independent and separate assessment 
of the tolerance to radiotherapy of each treated site at the completion of  radiotherapy and at 2 weeks after its completion. 
An additional method of evaluation will be the Investigator’s assessment (disease oriented team 
to do assessment) of the baseline and timeline photos.  
 
In addition, other local (irradiated areas) symptoms/signs (e.g., pain, tenderness, pruritus, dryness, epi[INVESTIGATOR_344], hyperesthesia) and any gene ralized adverse events will be evaluated on the 
basis of NCIC toxicity criteria  
http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html  . 
 
Week 5 of radiotherapy and at the final evaluation ([ADDRESS_219935]-treatment), the Investigator will 
make an overall global assessment of effectiveness of radiation tolerance of the treated breast (medial and lateral breast will be scored individua lly).  This assessment will be based upon the 
Investigator’s  experience, comparing the skin appearance and symptomatology of the site with the normally expected degree of radiation damage for similar body sites. The overall result will 
be graded as: 
 
0= poor       (worse than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139]) 1= fair          (equal to, or slightly better than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139]) 2= good       (moderately better than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139])  3= excellent (markedly better than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139]) 
 The Investigator will also judge which of the paired sites (medial, lateral) ) tolerated radiotherapy better, in terms of: (1) symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_5363] (2) overall skin appearance. If investigator feels medial and lateral breast symptomatology equivalent, then this will be reported as such. 
 
Independent of the Investigator, the patient will also assess  which of the paired sites fared better in terms of: (1) symptoms experienced and (2) overall skin appearance, at the completion 
of radiotherapy and [ADDRESS_219936]: 
In previous use of HylaCare as a commercial product, no adverse events have been identified. 
 
Psychological Stress: Questionnaires will be given to the patient as a part of this study, which may make them feel uncomfortable.  Patient can refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break or stop participating in this study at any time. 
 
Loss of Confidentiality: Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to keep the patients information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.   
Photographs: 
Patient could feel slightly uncomfortable during the photographic sessions when asked to position the body to take the photograph of the breast area. Patients could be uncomfortable with standing still for an extended period of time or from turning their body in various positions. They could be sensitive to the bright and repeating flashes from the camera, which 
can sometimes cause headaches, irritation of the eyes, discomfort, after effects such as 
seeing spots, and in rare cases, could stimulate a migraine headache or epi[INVESTIGATOR_141064].  Photographs include a risk of identification.  Patients privacy will be protected to the greatest extent possible.  Photos will be taken to exclude faces or any other identifying marks. Photos will only be identified by a unique subject identification number that contains no personal 
identifying information. For research purposes, photos may be used in scientific publications. 
 Risks to Embryo, Fetus or Breast-fed Infant: Females: For patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding an infant, it is possible that they may expose the unborn child or infant to risks.  For that reason, pregnant and breast-feeding 
females cannot participate in the study.  For patient who are participating in this study and are of childbearing age and sexually active, results of a urine pregnancy test will be obtained, and it must be negative before participating in the study. Patient taking part in this study and who are sexually active, must use medically-acceptable birth control (contraceptives) during the study.  Medically-acceptable birth control (contraceptives) includes: 
(1) Surgical sterilization (such as  hysterectomy or “tubes tied”), 
(2) Approved hormonal contraceptives ( such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or ring; Depo-
Provera, Depo-Lupron, Implanon), (3) Barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a substance that kills sperm), or  
(4) An intrauterine device (IUD). 
Patient who become pregnant during this study, must notify the researchers immediately.  Other Risks There may possibly be other side effects that are unknown at this time.  
 
Radiation exposure to a woman’s reproductive organs may harm an embryo or fetus.  Also, if radioactive materials are used for certain types of scans, harm may come to an embryo, fetus, or an infant who is breast feeding.    
[ADDRESS_219937] policy in clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186140].  This policy applies unless there is an important medical reason requiring 
radiation outside this time frame.  Risks of Radiation – Radiation Therapy : The radiation therapy used in this research is the standard radiation therapy, therefore, the risk of harm involved is the same. 
 
High-dose radiation treatments to or near a man’s testicles or a woman’s ovaries may produce harmful changes that could be passed on to children through a sperm or an egg.  Women:  Females able to have children should avoid becoming pregnant until after they 
have had three menstrual periods after the end of all radiation therapy.  After three 
menstrual periods, there is almost no risk of harmful changes to an egg.    Possible side effects of radiation therapy to the breast include:  
Likely (these side effects occur in 10% or more of patients): 
 Reddening of the skin during treatment and for several weeks following 
treatment 
 Tanning of the skin lasting months and may be permanent 
 Slightly smaller breast size or change in the way the breast looks 
 Tiredness and weakness during treatment and for several weeks following 
treatment 
 Swelling of the breast 
 Peeling of the skin in the area treated with radiation 
 Mild pain at the site of radiation treatment requiring over the counter pain 
Relievers. 
 
Less Likely (these side effects occur in 3-9% of patients): 
 Soreness or tightness in muscles of the chest wall under the treated  
breast 
 Severe pain at the site of radiation requiring prescription pain relievers 
 Rare but Serious (these side effects occur in less than 3% of patients): 
 Cough 
 Difficulty breathing 
 Inflammation of the heart muscle 
 Rib fracture 
 Slight increase in risk for heart disease for patients with cancer in the leftbreast 
 Risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_186141]-up assessment, patients will be evaluated for any adverse effects. These will be grouped as follows:  1. Localized reactions at the irradiated sites   
2. Other adverse events 
 The Investigator will enter details of any of these events on the Adverse Event Form. The 
[ADDRESS_219938]  duration, intensity, and any action taken will be recorded. 
 
8.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient receiving study treatment 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
8.2 Severity of Adverse Events 
All non-hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE v4 is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html 
 If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows: 
Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities. 
Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities. 
Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or 
significantly affects his/her clinical status. 
Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. 
Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death. 
8.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting 
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4).  
 
Step 2: Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4. 
 
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows: - Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment. 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment. 
Note: This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_219939] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must 
also be reported accordingly. 
 Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  Expected events are those that have been prev iously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse  event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of 
the event is not listed in: 
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information 
Section of this protocol; 
 the drug package insert; 
 the current Investigator’s Brochure 
 
The intensity of adverse events will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe to describe 
[ADDRESS_219940]  these observations regardless of whether they are medical events, symptoms, or physical 
findings. For purposes of consistency, the following definitions of intensity are provided:  
Mild:  Easily tolerated, causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere 
with everyday activities 
Moderate:  Causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal 
everyday activities 
Severe:  Incapacitating and prevents normal everyday activities 
 A Serious Adverse Event is  any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, 
side effect or precaution, and includes any experience which: 
 is fatal or life-threatening 
 is permanently disabling (i.e., incapacitating or interfering with the ability to resume 
usual life patterns 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
 is a secondary cancer, or an overdose 
For HylaCare
TM, potential adverse events might include an allergic reaction. Although this has 
not been observed in other clinical trials of hyaluronan-based agents, this product is hyaluronan 
derived from a biological source; hence, the Investigator should be aware of the possibility that the material theoretically could cause an allergic reaction.  Any Serious Adverse Event Form should be faxe d, then emailed immediately to Hylaco  
(Janet L. Denlinger PhD, Chief Scientific Officer [PHONE_3974]/[EMAIL_3645]) and 
Jean Wu ([PHONE_3975]/[EMAIL_3646]). Any death or serious or unusual 
reaction is to be reported promptly (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_186155]. Denlinger ([PHONE_3976]) or, in her absence, to Morgan Hare ([PHONE_3977]) , even though it may not appear to be related 
to HylaCare
TM. 
All adverse events will be reviewed at the monthly radiation oncology research meeting which 
includes radiation oncologist not adhering to the protocol. 
 Any preliminary telephone report of a serious adverse event is to be followed by a detailed 
written report summary within three working days and must include copi[INVESTIGATOR_186142]/office records and other documents when applicable. An additional follow-up written report summary is
 
to be forwarded to Hylaco within 10 days of the adverse event. The Investigator will also notify 
his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of any deaths, serious or unexpected reactions. 
 
Follow-up of all adverse events will be continu ed until the overall clinical outcome has been 
ascertained. All deaths, serious and non-serious adverse events will be summarized in the report prepared for Hylaco after the conclusion of the study.  
UTSW IRB: SAEs will be collected from the time consent is given, throughout the           
treatment period, and until subject’s participation in the trial has ended or participants 
death.    
Investigators and other site personnel must inform the UTSW IRB, of any serious 
or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting 
obligations of [ADDRESS_219941].  All SAEs will be documented.  The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  
Non-serious adverse events will be collected  from the time consent is given, 
throughout the treatment period and up to and including the [ADDRESS_219942] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution.  All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded 
(if SAEs they must be reported to the UTSW IRB).  All study-related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 
 
All serious adverse events must be reported to the  UT Southwestern TELEPHONE 
LINE: ([PHONE_3978] within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the occurrence of the event.  All safety reports shall be faxed to ([PHONE_3979] or e-mail to the attention of the project manager. 
 
The following events meet the definition of UPR: 
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), 
which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_89644], 
involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the research procedures. 
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk. 
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research subject. 
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, 
updated sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research. 
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or 
others. 
  
9.   DATA MONITORING  
 9.[ADDRESS_219943]  physical examination, radiation therapy treatment/dosimetry data. 
Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block. There will be no stratification. Patients will be randomized to receive the investigational product to be applied to either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) portion of the breast, a placebo product will be used 
on the other side. Patients and clinical investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments. 
The primary efficacy variables are the Physici an's Follow-Up Evaluation, to be performed at 
each visit, and the Physician's Global Assessment, to be performed at the end of radiotherapy and 2 (two) weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. The key component of the Physician's 
Follow-Up Evaluation is the grading, on an ordinal scale (0 to 5) NCIC-CTC, as well as the Investigator Grading  Scale of the irradiated area of the breast. The data collected from the 
Physician's Follow-Up Evaluation will be grouped into two parts, those data collected during 
radiotherapy and those data collected following the completion of radiotherapy. For each patient, the difference between the HylaCare
TM treated side and the control side will be 
determined at each visit during radiotherapy. These differences will then be averaged for each patient. The significance of the mean difference among the patients will then be determined 
using a paired t-test or Wilcox on signed-rank test. The data obta ined during the period following 
radiotherapy will be analyzed in this manner. The analysis of the Physician's Global 
Assessment will also be performed separately at the completion of radiotherapy and at the end of the follow-up period. The comparison of the groups will be based on a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A secondary analysis will be performed to examine the possible 
influence of body habitus (BMI- breast size) and radi ation hot spots  on the effectiveness of the 
HylaCare
TM prophylaxis. All efficacy analyses will be based on a modified intent-to-treat patient 
population. This population will be defined as all patients who commence radiotherapy and who 
have at least one on-treatment visit. 
 The secondary efficacy measure is the patient's  assessment of the tolerance to radiotherapy. 
These data will be collected at the end of radiotherapy and at the end of the follow-up period. At each time point the patient will be asked three questions and will respond to each question by [CONTACT_186156]. For each question the analysis will compare, among those patients who have a preference, the percent who prefer HylaCare
TM to the percent who prefer the control. The comparison will be based on an exact 
Binomial test of the hypothesis that the percent who prefer HylaCareTM is 50%, the percent that 
corresponds to the patient having no preference between HylaCareTM and the control. 
 The evaluation of photos taken during the course of radiotherapy represents the third efficacy 
measure.  These will be evaluated in a blinde d manner by [CONTACT_186157] (which 
may consist of breast surgeons, plastic surgeons, or medical oncologists) after the last patient 
completes post-treatment week 2 follow-up and photo 
 Safety will be assessed through the recording of responses and other adverse events. All patients who undergo prophylaxis will be included in the analyses. The adverse events will be classified using the NCIC-CTC version 4.0. 
 All computations will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software.

 The monitor will pay site visits to review each patient's Case Report Forms to help ensure completeness and accuracy of data entry specified in the Protocol. As required by [CONTACT_186158], clinical records will be reviewed to confirm that: (1) the case report forms are consistent with the Investigator's clinical records; (2) background clinical and laboratory data and concomitant medications are recorded on the case report forms; (3) there is an accurate 
account of test and control article use; and (4) there is timely, appropriate reporting of any adverse events.

All patients who meet the selection criteria will be considered evaluable for efficacy and safety. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all patients complete the required follow-up visits. 
Those not appearing will be telephoned and/or contact[CONTACT_186159]. The reason for all dropouts is to be specified by [CONTACT_186160].  
 
9.5  Discontinuation of Patients From Study 
Participation in this study may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
 adverse events 
 severe inter-current illness 
[ADDRESS_219948]   administrative reasons 
 patient's voluntary decision to discontinue participation 
 Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_59689]'s best interests to continue 
 
Any patient discontinued because of an adverse event will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_219949] and control products  as directed for more than 5 days  during radiation will be  removed fr om the study for noncompliance. 
  10.  PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY 
Confidentiality of each patient's identity will be maintained. A subject number consisting of the 
patient’s initials and a random number will be assigned to each patient upon study entry and that 
number will be used to identify that patient for the duration of the st udy. Only the patient's initials 
and numbers will be used on case report forms as well as any study-related correspondence. 
 
 11.  PROTOCOL ADMINISTRATION 
 
11.[ADDRESS_219950] (IRB). No ch anges that relate 
to the safety or welfare of patients may be made to the consent form unless they are approved by [CONTACT_186161].  All major amendments to the Protocol and case r eport forms must also be 
approved by [CONTACT_186162]. 
 
11.4  Reporting of Data 
All information required by [CONTACT_186163], or an explanation given for omissions. 
All case report forms (CRFs) must be made available as soon as they are completed in order 
that the Study Monitor may verify the validity and completeness of those forms and permit 
transmittal of the data to the Sponsor.  All data and information on these CRFs are to be neatly recorded in type or legibly written in black ink for ease of duplication, interpretation and analysis before submission to Hylaco. All 
corrections on the CRFs should be crossed out neatly with a single line, and the new entry 
initialed and dated by [CONTACT_186164]'s staff making tile correction. Prior to forwarding the CRFs to Hylaco, they should be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and legibility by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_186143]. He/she will indicate by

lotions;  
Study Medication/Intervention 
You will be provided with the study products to  apply three times a day to each side as 
designated according to your random assignmen t. Please be sure to wash your hands 
before and between each application of product/cream.  The creams/products will be 
labeled with your Subject Number.   Products will be supplied by [CONTACT_456].  This part of the study will be blinded, that is, both products will be packaged identi cally by [CONTACT_186166] A 
and product B so that neither you, nor the inve stigator, nor the research team will be 
able to distinguish which Product is a pplied to areas of radiation exposure.. 
[ADDRESS_219961]   
Procedures and Evaluati ons during the Research 
 
     Study Visits  
 Every week during your radiation treatment you will be assessed by [CONTACT_39595].  
 The Investigator will evaluate the status of  your skin, comparing the medial (inside) 
to the lateral (outside), a nd determining an overall assessment of your  skin’s 
tolerance to the radiotherapy. 
 At your first visit, and during Week 5, and 2weeks post-radi ation treatment, 
photographs will be taken.  
 On your last day of radiation, both you and your radiation oncologist will be asked to 
complete an assessment of your skin, giving you an opportunity to report how you 
felt the creams worked, and if the skin on one  side of your breast fared better than the 
other side 
 
Study Visit 9: ([ADDRESS_219962] radiotherapy)

(2  weeks after completion of RT). 
Please make an overall global  assessment of the effect iveness of radiation skin 
tolerance of both sides of the irradiated breast tissue.  Based on your judgment and 
past experience, compare the skin appearance and patient’s reported symptomatology for each side of the breast, and for each breas t (test substance-treated and vehicle 
control-treated) with the normally expected degree of radiation damage for similar body 
sites.  Grade your overall impression as:   0 = poor (worse than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139])  1 = fair (equal to, or slightly  better than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139]) 
 2 = good (moderately better than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139])  3 = excellent (markedly bette r than typi[INVESTIGATOR_186139])

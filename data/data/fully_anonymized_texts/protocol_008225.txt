STUDY  DESIGN  
 
An open- label switch study will be conducted in virologically -suppressed, HIV -1 positive participants. The 
switch regiment will be: 1) Stribild®; elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; E/C/F/TDF) to  Genvoya;  elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 
mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg; E/C/F/TAF OR 2) Complera (Emtricitabine/Rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979]/Tenofovir Disoproxil 
Fumarate Tablets)  to ODEFSEY (25 mg rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979] + 200mg emtricitabine + 25mg tenofov ir alafenamide 
fumarate)  OR 3) TRUVADA (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) + any other combination of antivirals 
to  Descovy (200 mg emtricitabine + 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) . 
 
Major eligibility criteria for study participants will be  age > 18 years old, any CD4 T cell count, viral load <50 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or undetectable on E/C/F/TDF for the previous [ADDRESS_99616] three clinical visits: one at baseline prior to the TDF to TAF 
switch, and follow up visits at 2 and 6 months after the switch. We will also include the option to switch ANY 
HIV-infected person who meets the inclusion criteria and not on an antiretroviral regimen other than Stribild 
[(Elvitegravir (ELV)/cobicistat CO)/emtricitabi ne (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF)] to switch to Stribild for 3 months. This 
will allow for future switch (after these 3 months) from Stribild to GENVOYA. This approach can expedite 
recruitment since we can switch HIV infected persons to Stribild and then do another  switch from Stribild to 
GENVOYA as per study protocol. In addition given the known clinical benefits (less toxicity) of Stribild and 
Complera compared to older antiretrovirals (such as protease inhibitors)[ Patient Prefer Adherence. 2015; 9: 
1213– 1218.; J  Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2014 Mar 1; 65(3):e118 -20; Lancet. 2012 Jun 30;379(9835):2439 -
48; J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2014 Mar 1; 65(3):e121- 4; AIDS. 2012;26:2315– 2326; J Infect Dis. 
2015;212(3):345– 354] and  the known clinical benefits of TAF compared to TDF (less bone and kidney toxicity) 
these ART switches are beneficial for the participant and they also allow us to study differential effects of TAF 
 vs TDF on mitochondria. The participants who will undergo any ART switch will have a clinic visit or a phone 
call 1 -2 weeks after the ART switch to check for side effects/tolerability of the new regimen and all subjects will 
have a clinic visit with blood tests to check viral load and safety labs (complete metabolic panel and complete 
blood count) within 2 month s after any switch. Then after informed consent has been obtained ART will be 
switched as per protocol.  
 
During visits  at baseline, month 2, 6, blood will be obtained for isolation of PBMC (measurement of 
mitochondrial function). This study design w ill account for confounders that may affect mitochondrial function 
among different subjects (given the intrinsic heterogeneity of mitochondria). All study participants will be 
recruited in outpatient clinics within UCLA. All HIV -1 infected participants wil l be recruited within the UCLA 
Center for AIDS Education and Research (UCLA CARE) Center which provides HIV care to over 1000 patients 
with HIV in Los Angeles and is regarded as one of the premier HIV care providers in the country. We anticipate 
recruiting 60 (30 HIV -1 infected and 30 uninfected) persons in total for all outlined experiments .  
 
 
STUDY  POPULATION  
HIV-1-infected participants  in the Los Angeles area will be recruited voluntarily through a UCLA IRB -approved 
protocol at UCLA Center for AIDS Research and Education (CARE).  
 
Enrollment will be open to men and women from all socioeconomic strata and all race and ethnic groups. We 
anticipate enrolling 30 HIV -1 infected individuals in total .

months (swit ch from TDFTAF). 
 
Entry /Day 0 
 
 Follow- up phone call  
 2 weeks after the Entry visit, a brief phone call  from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_90345].  The following questions will be asked:  
• Are you tolerating the new medication okay? 
• Have you experienced any new symptoms since you started the new drug? (expected side 
effects from switching antivirals should have already been addressed at the initial study visit).  
• Have you been taking all your pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]?  
• Do you have any questions we could answer for you?   
  
If new symptoms appear, the participant will be instructed to schedule a visit with their care provider 
for standard evaluations.

100 ml of blood will be drawn per visit/phlebotomy. Out of this volume standard tubes for the standard clinical 
 labs (fasting lipid profile, complete metabolic panel, HIV RNA P CR, CMV antibody, T - cell subset) will be sent 
to the clinical laboratory as per standard clinic procedure. The rest of the whole blood will be placed in EDTA or 
green top tubes and will be shipped to Kelesidis lab via courier. It is expected that 1 million cells will be 
obtained per ml of whole blood and cells will be isolated and cryopreserved at Kelesidis lab.  
 
ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
 
Adverse Event Reporting and monitoring.  
 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the conduct of the study  REGARDLESS of the attribution 
(i.e., relationship of event to medical treatment/study product/device or procedure/intervention). This includes 
any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition.  
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading 
Table), corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, must  be used for grading the adverse events in this protocol and is 
available on the DAIDS RSC Web site at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research- sites/saf ety-reporting/daids -
grading- tables . 
 
The AEs/SAEs should immediately be reported to the Principal Investigator. All events should be reported to 
the local IRB if they are reportable per the local IRB’s reporting criteria.  
This study will be internally monitored biannually.  
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board is not needed for this single- center open- label Phase I clinical trial (safety 
related to mitochondrial toxicity) since the local investigator will have access to all data. Dr . Kelesidis will be 
available to provide direct evaluation of any c linically -related concerns that might arise during the study. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_90347] (mitochondrial toxicity) and make recommendations for conti nuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348]. It is important to emphasize that the clinical safety of the described antiretrovirals has already been 
established within large scale clinical trials. This exploratory study will investigate subtle molecular readouts of 
mitoch ondrial toxicity that have been associated with adverse clinical outcome in some settings (e.g. diabetes). 
However the exact clinical significance of the findings from this small exploratory study will need to be 
validated in further larger scale trials. Thus, given the nature and scope of this study we do not anticipate any 
major clinical side effects and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90349].  
 
 
CLINICAL  MANAGEMENT  
Not Applicable.   
 
Criteria  for Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], OHRP, or other government agencies when 
necessary to ensure the protection of research subjects.  
Completion of study  product(s)/intervention(s)  as defined in the protocol   
 
Criteria  for Premature  Study  Discontinuation for an Individual  Participant  
• Participant  repeatedly  non-compliant  with study  product/intervention  as prescribed 
• Pregnancy  or breastfeeding   
• Request  by [CONTACT_90353]  
• Participant  judged by [CONTACT_90354]  
• Participants will be taken off of study in the event of virologic failure or in the event of grade 3 or higher 
adverse effects or intolerable grade 2 adverse effects  
  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
Study  Endpoints  
 
Primary  Endpoint  
Cellular oxygen consumption (COC) : From all the measures of mitochondrial function cellular oxygen 
consumption (COC)  will be considered the “gold standard” given it is a measure of the most important 
mitochondrial function (oxidative phosphorylation) that relates to clinical outcome. It i s accepted that two 
independent measures of mitochondrial function can more reliably predict mitochondrial dysfunction compared 
to each one of the measures separately. Thus, given the uncertainty of what measure of mitochondrial function 
can best predict N RTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity, comparison of relative fold induction of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in PBMC compared to baseline measurement will be done.  
Primary endpoint is continuous variables (measured in pmoles O2/min) and it will be compared  
 between the 2 groups on different antiretrovirals (TAF based vs TDF based) cross sectionally using unpaired 
t-test. Changes in primary outcome within the same person will be determined by [CONTACT_54959] t -test (baseline and 
after switch). Statistical p v alue <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

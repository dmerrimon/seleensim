Rhinosinusitis Without Polyps  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
February 17, [ADDRESS_661424], [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary  
After patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) undergo sinus surgery, they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_511419]. However, there is limited data to 
suggest this is a beneficial practice, and oral steroids have been shown to have significant and 
unpleasant side effects. This study will investigate whether there is truly evidence based utility to 
the use of steroids after sinus surgery  
 
b. Objectives  
Chronic rhinosinusitis is a disease that affects an estimated 13% of the adult population. Patients 
with this disease suffer from reduced quality of life,  impaired sleep, fatigu e, acute infections, and 
chronic pain. Healthcare expenditures for CRS are estimated at $8.[ADDRESS_661425] the efficacy of of a medication in individuals with CRS, which 
is not a disease known to be accurately du plicated in any other model.  
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  
Screening: Patients who have been recommended to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery by [CONTACT_511437]-operatively. SNOT22 
scores (a quality of life survey well established in Rhinology) and Lund -Kennedy endoscopic 
exam scores (an quantitative clinical assessment of disease severity) will be recorded in their 
medical records. This is the same protocol p erformed for all patients seen in our clinic regardless 
of their enrollment in the study. Randomization and Treatment Groups: The patients that wish to  
participate will be randomized into two treatment arms by [CONTACT_511438] a 
random numbe r generator. They will receive one of the following post -operative regimens: 1) 
oral steroid (treatment) + steroid spray (treatment) 2) oral placebo (control) + steroid spray 
(treatment) These medications will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_511439], and prescribed by [CONTACT_511440]. 
Patients will begin their therapy on the first post -operative day. All oral steroid regimens will be 
given in our institution's standard [ADDRESS_661426] already trialed these medications as part of 
their pre -operative medical therapy. Surgery: Routine endoscopic sinus surgery will be 
performed per our institution's standard protocol. In this step there will be no difference in 
treatment from those patients not enrolled in the study. Post -Operative Care: At this point, 
patients will begin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511420] e been randomized. 
Study patients will attend post -operative appointments at identical time points to non -study 
patients. These will take place at the following intervals: Post -operative visit 1: [ADDRESS_661427] -
operative visit 2: [ADDRESS_661428] -operative v isit 3: [ADDRESS_661429] -operative visit 4: [ADDRESS_661430] of 
care that is being withheld from patie nts in any group.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
Yes, patients will stop all experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511421] [ADDRESS_661431] -operative regimen, which includes a nasal steroid spray and twice daily saline 
irrigations. They will continue to be followed in our clinic after the 4 week mark, and their 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511422] t he endoscopic appearance of the nasal cavity.  
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
Currently, our post -operative protocol dictates that patients will be seen in clinic at [ADDRESS_661432] Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
Currently, the preferred treatment regimen for patie nts with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with 
and without polyps after endoscopic sinus surgery involves a nonstandardized combination of 
oral steroids and antibiotics. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 
offers guidelines for surge ons in the appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511423]. The use of oral steroids in CRS is associated with level IV 
evidence and a category C recommendation, indicating a lack of randomized controlled  data to 
February 17, 201 5  Page 4 of 10 support its use (1). Therefore, this almost universal current practice is perpetuated by [CONTACT_511441][INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Furthermore, systemic steroids are associated with known significant 
side effects and potential drug interactions. These ma y be severe and include but are not limited 
to high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and diabetes, adrenal suppression, weight gain, glaucoma, 
osteoporosis, fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and mood changes (2). Thus, oral 
steroids potentia lly pose a significant risk, have unproven benefit, and are not appropriate for 
repeated or longterm use – an unfortunate obstacle in treating a chronic disease. Recently, 
steroids dissolved in a saline irrigant have been increasingly used and proven to be  effective in 
the routine management of CRS. Furthermore, several studies have suggested the utility and safe 
side effect profile of these medications; however, the data supporting their use as a perioperative 
treatment is  distinctly lacking. While the dat a to support the utility of topi[INVESTIGATOR_511424], relatively few groups have explored topi[INVESTIGATOR_511425] a peri -operative intervention. Fandino et al conducted a meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_661433] -intervention, suggesting the in tra-nasal delivery method to 
carry less risk than the oral version (3). Snidvongs et al conducted a study with 111 patients and 
reported significant improvement in symptom scores and endoscopy scores over those who did 
not receive postoperative topi[INVESTIGATOR_470326] (4). Jang et al retrospectively evaluated 60 patients 
postsurgically who were treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_511426] a significant decrease 
in quality of life and endoscopy scores after patients stopped their treatments (5). In summary, 
the data supporting the use of steroids in patients with CRS immediately after endoscopic sinus 
surgery is sparse. We, therefore, seek to more definitively elucidate the role and utility of steroid 
treatment in the peri -operative period. Furthermore, per ou r review of the literature, there has 
been no direct comparison of the traditional oral regimen to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] (nasal spray). Could 
these be proven equally effective, topi[INVESTIGATOR_511427] a 
replacement for systemic steroids . This would represent a significant shift and improvement in 
the current post -operative management of CRS. Patients would avoid the innumerable side 
effects of oral steroids, which are detailed above. Furthermore, while oral steroid usage is often 
limited  by [CONTACT_418809], a topi[INVESTIGATOR_511428] a prolonged period as 
a maintenance therapy if symptoms necessitate.

5. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned Enrollment  
Based on a current rate of [ADDRESS_661435] been 
recommended and consented for endoscopic sinus surgery. These participants will be used 
because they suffer from the specific disease for which we endeavor  to research alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background  
We will recruit patients >[ADDRESS_661436] be evaluated by [CONTACT_511442]. If, based on that evaluation,  endoscopic sinus 
surgery is recommended to them and they meet inclusion criteria, they will then be informed of 
the study and its purpose and importance. After this has been discussed, patients will be invited 
to participate if they so choose. Our nurse p ractitioner performs all study introductions and 
obtains consent. If there are any questions, Rhinology providers are always available for 
consultation. We do not intend to advertise to nor recruit within the general public. There will be 
no recruitment ma terials.  
h. Eligibility Criteria  
i. Inclusion Criteria  
Age > [ADDRESS_661437], we will not continue with the enrollment

therefore, will defer to studies in which patients are already enrolled.  
k. Payments to Participants  
NA 
l. Costs to Participants  
The participant will accrue identical costs to any patient being evaluated and treated for chronic 
rhinosinusitis, which will vary tremendously based on insurance policies. During the process, 
costs that may accumulate include: clinic appointments, prescribed medications, surgical 
intervention, specialty evaluation. No additional costs will be c harged based on participation in 
this study.  
m. Planned Duration  of the Study  
The study duration is anticipated to be [ADDRESS_661438] -operative visit. 
Organization and a nalysis of the data will require 2 -4 weeks.

February 17, [ADDRESS_661442] of care in the management of CRS patients with and without nasal 
polyposis after endoscopic sinus surgery involves a non -standardized regimen of antibiotics and 
systemic steroids. However, the use of oral steroids in this period is based on anecdotal evidence 
and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] (level IV evidence). Given the known risks of oral steroid use, it is important 
to definitively establish their utility and to investigate al ternatives. Our study first seeks to more 
clearly define the role of steroids, both oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, 
we intend to establish topi[INVESTIGATOR_511435] a safer but equally effective therapy. This information 
will be inva luable to the field and practice of Rhinology. There is a great need for additional 
investigation to determine whether steroids truly have a beneficial role in post -operative CRS 
patients. We endeavor to provide randomized, controlled data on which clinici ans may base their 
therapeutic decisions. In addition, the introduction of topi[INVESTIGATOR_511436] -operative 
care would fundamentally change current clinical practices, and may even influence future 
guidelines. For patients, this may transform t heir post -operative care into one that is more easily 
tolerated with less detrimental effects on health.

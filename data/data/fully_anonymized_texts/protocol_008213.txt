Synopsis  
 
Title:  Evaluation of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_726616]:  Single -center, cross -sectional study  
 
Subject population:  Adult emergency department (ED ) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients (both 
males and females without regards to ethnic and racial backgrounds) who meet 
the following eligibility criteria will be recruited.  
 
Inclusion criteria  
• Individuals 18 years of age or older  
• Patient s who present to the ED  or who are admitted to the ICU of North Shore 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (NSUH) 
 
Exclusion criteria  
• Pregnant  
• Prisoners  
• Finger, hand or forearm anatomical anomaly or disease that may interfere with 
attaching a pulse oximeter sensor  
• Patients ’ deemed clinically unstable by [CONTACT_726646]:  Total number of subjects is up to 60.  
 
Study duration:  • Expected duration of each subject participation is approximately 15 minutes.  
• The duration of subject recruitment is anticipated for 6 months.  
• The total duration of the study (including data collection and analysis) is 
approximately 1 year.  
 
Investigational device: This study will use a non- significant risk  combination of two components  to 
measure Capi[INVESTIGATOR_726617] (CRI) : 
• Non-FDA-cleared pulse oximeter (OLV -4201A, Nihon Kohden Corporation, 
Tokyo, Japan): OLV -4201A pulse oximeter is intended for use in monitoring 
SpO 2 and pulse rate (PR) using a finger sensor. It conforms to the safety 
standard of IEC  [ZIP_CODE]- 1:2005+A1:2012, and the electromagnetic 
compatibility standard of IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1- 2:2007 and ISO [ZIP_CODE] -2-61:2011  
(clause202). The CRI measurement function is embedded in OLV -4201A.  
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 4 / 38 
 
• FDA- cleared SpO 2 sensor probes (TL- 271T3, Nihon Kohden Corporation, 
Tokyo, Japan ): The sensors are disposable and intended for single patient 
use. 
 
Note:  the pulse oximeter is a class II device and is not used for life support or as 
a life sustaining device, thus the risk of this investigational use is considered 
extremely low. Furthermore, the device will not be used for any clinical diagnoses and any data obtained from the device will be blinded from the treating physicians and thus will not have any impact on the patient ’s clinical care. Therefore, the 
investigational device qualifies as a non- significant risk (NSR) device  and 
does not require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval  from 
the FDA.  
 
Objectives:  (1) Primary objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the capability of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_726617] (CRI)  
measured by [CONTACT_726647][INVESTIGATOR_726618] (CRT)  test. Predictive capability of 
CRI needs to be assessed to achieve a goal to provide clinicians with an 
alternative method to the traditional CRT test.  
 (2) Secondary objective(s)  
The secondary objective is to assess the correlation between CRI and CRT 
values. Although both CRI and CRT reflect time required for reperfusion of 
fingertip after the compression, measured absolute numerical values will be 
different since the mechanisms to assess peripheral perfusion are different 
between CRI and CRT.  
 
Endpoint (s): (1) Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on CRI values to predict the altered 
peripheral perfusion determined with the CRT test. A specific cutoff value for CRI has not yet been determined, then the AUC value will be used to summarize comprehensive capability of CRI to detect the altered peripheral perfusion.  
 (2) Secondary endpoint(s)  
The secondary endpoints include the followings:  
• Sensitivity and specificity of CRI in differentiating altered peripheral perfusion 
determined with the CRT test. An optimal cutoff value for CRI will be 
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 5 / 38 
 
determined with the ROC analysis for the primary endpoint.  
• Pearson’ s or Spearman’ s correlation coeffici ent to assess the correlation 
between CRI and CRT values.

1.1 I ntroduction  
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_95155] (CRT) test is a simple and noninvasive method typi[INVESTIGATOR_726621]. CRT is defined as the time required for a distal capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996] (e.g., fingertip) to regain its color after having received enough compression to cause blanching [1]. A prolonged CRT (e.g. over 2 seconds) suggests a decrease in peripheral perfusion and is used to identify  hemodynamically compromised 
patients in the critical care setting. Several observational studies have reported the clinical usefulness of CRT and the relevance between prolonged CRT and critical conditions. In intensive care patients, prolonged CRT was as sociated with diminished tissue perfusion as well as an increase in organ dysfunction with high blood 
lactate levels [2]. Prolonged CRT was also associated with the development of severe complications in patients following abdominal surgery [3]. However, the conventional CRT test has limitations in objectivity given that the measurement depends on clinicians ’ subjective visual assessment. Since the repeatability and inter -rater 
agreement of the CRT test has been questioned over the last few decades [4, 5], there is great demand for the creation of objective methods to assess peripheral blood perfusion [5, 6].  
 We developed a new analytic method to assess peripheral blood perfusion quantitatively using pulse oximetry waveforms to provide clinicians with an alternative method to the traditional CRT test. The method calculates the time it takes for blood to return to the fingertip after release from compression by [CONTACT_726650] a normal pulse oximeter sensor attached to a patient ’s fingertip [7,8]. Since the 
mechanisms to assess peripheral blood perfusion are different from the traditional CRT tests, we differentiate the calculated number by [CONTACT_726651][INVESTIGATOR_726617] (CRI). The CRI measurem ent 
function is embedded in our investigational device OLV -4201A pulse oximeter.

2 Investigational device 
2.1 Summary description of the investigational device and its intended purpose 
This study will use a non- significant risk  combination of two components:  
• Non-FDA-cleared pulse oximeter (OLV -4201A , Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan): See Attachment 
1 Operator ’s Manual of OLV -4201.  OLV-4201A pulse oximeter is intended for use in monitoring SpO 2 and 
pulse rate (PR) using a finger sensor. It conforms to the safety standard of IEC60601 -1:2005+A1:2012, and 
the electromagnetic compatibility standard of IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1- 2:2007 and ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2- 61:2011 (clause202). 
See Attachment 2 and 3 Certificate of Safet y/EMC Test.  
• FDA- cleared SpO 2 sensor probe (TL -271T3, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; K151080, K120888, 
K080342, K001693, K946175, K945578, K043517, K082785) : See Attachment 4 Operator ’s Manual of 
SpO 2 sensor probe. The sensor is  disposable and intended for single patient use.  
 
The investigational device passes light of two wavelengths (red: 660 nm, infrared: 940 nm) through the fingertip and measures the light intensity at each wavelength, allowing it to determine the different concentrations of two  
types of hemoglobin (oxy -hemoglobin and deoxy -hemoglobin). The CRI measurement uses a wavelength of 
infrared (940 nm) to trace change of blood volume in the fingertip. To measure CRI, a patient ’s fingertip with a 
pulse oximeter sensor probe attached is briefly compressed by [CONTACT_726653]. The light intensity transmitted through the fingertip increases during compression as blood, which is the major absorber of the light, is squeezed out of the fingertip. The compression phase is followed by [CONTACT_726654]. The curve describing the recovery phase of the intensity waveform is modeled as an exponential decay using the least squares method. The time for returning to a predetermine d level of the intensity is calculated as CRI (Figure 1). The detailed operation of the CRI function 
of OLV -4201 A is described in Attachment 5 Operator ’s Manual of the CRI function.

Note:  the pulse oximeter is a class II device and is not used for life support or as a life sustaining device, thus 
the risk of this investigational use is considered extremely low. Furthermore, the device will not be used for any 
clinical diagnoses and any data obtained from the device will be blinded from the treating physician and thus will not have any impact on the patient ’s clinical care. Therefore, the investigational device qualifies as a non-
significant risk (NSR) device and does not require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval  
from the FDA.

There is no medical nor surgical procedure involved in the use of the investigational device.  
 
3 J ustification for the design of the clinical investigation 
3.1 Evaluation of the results of the relevant pre-clinical testing/assessment carried out to justify 
the use of the investigational device in human subjects  
OLV-4201A Pulse Oximeter  conforms to the safety standard of IEC60601- 1:2005+A1:2012, and the 
electromagnetic compatibility standard of IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1- 2:2007 and ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2- 61:2011(clause202). See 
Attachment 2 and 3 Certificate of Safety/EMC Test . The part of the investigational device that will be in contact 
[CONTACT_726657] -cleared T L-271T3 SpO 2 probe. There has been no issue regarding 
biocompatibility of the material of the SpO 2 probe described in the section 2.7. Therefore, the use of the 
investigational device in human subjects in this clinical investigation is considered to be justified. 
 
3.2 Evaluation of clinical data relevant to this clinical investigation  
Attachment 6  is a report of a previous clinical study conducted at the ED of NSUH.  In this preliminary clinical 
study, the term “Blood Refill Time (BRT) ” was used, which is the same as CRI, and a protot ype device was used 
to measure BRT.  The prototype device is a non -FDA- cleared pulse oximeter (OLV -3100, Nihon Kohden 
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) which is a previous model of OLV -[ADDRESS_992349] whether  the visual CRT was 
greater than 2.0 seconds was 0.84 (95% CI 0.70- 0.98).  There was a strong correlation between BRT and CRT  
(r=0.723, p<0.001). The results suggest that BRT measurements with the prototype device successfully 
identified subjects with altered peripheral perfusion determined by [CONTACT_726658] . 
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 14 / [ADDRESS_992350] since the applied part of the investigational device (TL-271T3 SpO
2 sensor probe) is equivalent to standard pulse oximeter sensors and has a FDA approval . A well -
known potential adverse effect of pulse oximeters is thermal injuries due to temperature rise at the applied part  
of the sensor.  
 
4.3 R esidual risks associated with the investigational device identified in the risk analysis  
There is no residual risk associated with the investigational device  which is judged unacceptable.  
 
4.4 R isk associated with participation in the clinical investigation  
There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality, which will be minimized by [CONTACT_726659] 8 “ Data management ” of this CIP. 
The study procedures are no greater than minimal risk.  The pulse oximeter is a class II device and is not used 
for life support or as a life sustaining device, thus the risk of this investigational use is considered extremely low. Furthermore, the device will not be used for any clinical diagnoses and any data obtained from the device will be blinded from treating physician s and thus will not have any impact on the subject ’s clinical care . The 
application of the senso r probe on the subject ’s finger is not expected to cause pain. If the study procedure 
becomes too uncomfortable, the procedure will be stopped immediately. The investigator (qualified ED physician) will assess the clinical status of the subject prior to enrollment to determine eligibility when the subject is recruited.  
 
4.5 Possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments  
There is no possible interaction with concomitant medical treatments.  
 
4.6 Steps that will be taken to control or mitigate the risks  
All data and records generated during this study will be kept confidentially in accordance with policies  of the 
study site(s)  and HIPAA on subject privacy, and the investigator and other site personnel will not use such data 
and records for any purpose other than conducting the study. All subjects will be given a unique study number.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_726623]. The study team will report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726624] , and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726625] . 
Thermal injuries which are the potential adverse effect of the pulse oximeter will be assessed after the measurements with the investigational device.  
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 15 / [ADDRESS_992351]. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
will be performed and area under the curve (AUC) will be calculated for this objective. An optimal cutoff value 
for CRI will be determined with the ROC analysis and the sensitivity and the specificity in differentiating altered peripheral perfusion will also be calculated.  
 
5.1.2  Secondary objective(s)  
The secondary objective is to assess the correlation between CRI and CRT values. Although both CRI and CRT reflect time required for reperfusion of fingertip after the compression, measured absolute numerical values will be different since the mechanisms to assess peripheral perfusion are different between CRI and CRT. Pearson ’s correlation coefficient will be calculated to assess the correlation between CRI and CRT 
values. If the values are not normally distributed, Spearman’s correlation coefficient will be used instead.

cutoff value for CRI has not yet been determined, then the AUC value will be used to summarize comprehensive capability of CRI to detect the altered peripheral perfusion. Procedures of the measurement of CRI and CRT, and statistical methods are described in the section 6.4 " Procedures ” and the section 7 
“Statistical considerations ”, respectively.  
 
(2) Secondary endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include the followings:  
• Sensitivity and specificity of CRI in differentiating altered peripheral perfusion determined with the CRT 
test. An optimal cutoff value for CRI will be determined with the ROC analysis for the primary endpoint.  
• Pearson’ s or Spearman’ s correlation coefficient to assess the correlation between CRI and CRT values.

The comparator is the visual CRT, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_726626].  
The CRI measurement has been developed to assess peripheral blood perfusion quantitatively as an 
alternative method to the visual CRT test.  Therefore, comparisons between CRI  and CRT need to be 
performed.

• Room temperature  
 
The surface temperature of the patient ’s hand will be measured by a non- contact [CONTACT_548264]. To 
address the reliability of the subjective assessment of peripheral perfusion by [CONTACT_74169], we will also 
measure forearm -to-fingertip skin temperature difference (Tskin- diff), as well as central -to-fingertip 
temperature difference (Tc -diff). The Tskin- diff will be obtained from the index/middle finger temperature and 
the temperature on the radial side of the forearm, midway between the elbow and the wrist.  
 The CRT and the CRI measurements will be conducted with following methods for each subject in a relaxed position (seated or lying down) with relaxed hands. The subject ’s most accessible hand (right or left) will be 
used. Each measurement will be performed alternately and will be repeated three times each for a total of six compressions per subject. If the subject is wearing nail polish, the investigator will measure CRI/CRT aft er 
removing the subject ’s nail polish. If the subject is wearing a ring on their finger, CRI/CRT will be measured 
after removing the ring(s).  
 Visual CRT measurement using a stopwatch  
An investigator (an ED physician) will compress the fingertip of the su bject ’s index or middle finger for five 
seconds, signaled by “ start compression ” and “release compression ” beep sounds. When the fingertip is 
released from the compression, the investigator will begin the visual CRT measurement. The investigator will hold a stopwatch in the hand that does not perform the compression and use this stopwatch to measure CRT.  
 CRI measurement by [CONTACT_726660]

by [CONTACT_093]’ s finger as same way of the traditional CRT test. The sensor is flexible and thus, the 
investigator is able to compress the fingertip by [CONTACT_726661] (Figure 2) . The compression will be 
performed with signals from the device, and then the device will measure CRI.

 All subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. The investigators will immediately discontinue any procedures and remove any research instruments from the subject. Data collected until the subject ’s point of withdrawal from the study will be analyzed. The estimated duration of the 
subject ’s participation is approximately 15 minutes in total.

values for each subject.  
 The primary and secondary endpoints are described in the section 6.1.3. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be performed and area under the curve (AUC) will be calculated to demonstrate capability of CRI to predict altered peripheral perfusion determined with the CRT test. An optimal cutoff value for CRI will be determined with the ROC analysis and the sensitivity and the specificity in differentiating altered peripheral perfusion will be calculated. Pearson’ s, or Spearman’ s correlation coefficient will be calculated to assess the 
correlation between CRI and CRT values.

 24 / [ADDRESS_992368]. Sample size for subjects with altered peripheral perfusion required to obtain desired AUC is calculated with the following equation [9]:  
 
𝑛𝑛=  𝑍𝑍𝛼𝛼
22×𝑉𝑉(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 )
𝑑𝑑2 
 where, Z is the standard normal deviate determined with probability of type I error: α, d is the desired width of 
one-half of the confidence interval (CI), and V(AUC)  is variance of AUC which is derived from the following 
equation [10]:  
 
𝑉𝑉(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 ) = (0.0099 ×𝑒𝑒−𝑎𝑎22⁄) ×{(5𝑎𝑎2+ 8)+ (𝑎𝑎2+ 8)/𝜅𝜅 } 
 where,  𝑎𝑎 =𝜑𝜑
−1(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 ) × 1. 414; 𝜑𝜑−[ADDRESS_992369] cumulative normal distribution; and 𝜅𝜅 is the ratio 
of the number of subjects without the altered peripheral perfusion to the number of subjects with the altered peripheral perfusion. Based upon our preliminary data:  
• The prevalence of the subjects with altered peripheral perfusion is expected to be 30 %, and then 𝜅𝜅 
is 2.33. 
• We hypothesize that the AUC will be 0.84, and then 𝑎𝑎=𝜑𝜑
−1(0.84)× 1. 414 = 1. 406.  
 Therefore, V(AUC)  can be calculated as follow:  
 
𝑉𝑉(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 )=�0.0099 ×𝑒𝑒−1.[ZIP_CODE]⁄�×{(5 × 1.4062+ 8)+ (1.4062+ 8)/2.33 }= 0.[ADDRESS_992370] 0.70 which is considered as fair  [11], one-half of the CI: d  should be 0.14 with the 
hypothesized AUC of 0.84. At the significance level of 5% (probability of type I error: α = 0.05), the number of 
subjects with altered peripheral perfusion is derived as:  
 
𝑛𝑛=  𝑍𝑍𝛼𝛼

 The total number of required sample size given by 𝑛𝑛(1 +𝜅𝜅) is 54. Considering possible early withdrawals of 
subjects, we plan to recruit up to 60 subjects to achieve 54 evaluable subjects (1 0% of drop- out rate).

7.4 Expected drop-out rates  
Although the drop -out rate for this study is  unknown,  relatively high drop- out rate can be expected since the 
study site is the ED and the subjects may need early withdrawals due to disposition (admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_726628]). Therefore, we use 10% of drop -out rate and will recruit up to [ADDRESS_992371] s to achieve 5 4 evaluable 
subjects . 
 
7.5 Pass/fail criteria to be applied to the results of the clinical investigation  
The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that CRI is capable to detect subjects with altered peripheral 
perfusion determined with the CRT test, as described in the section 5.2.  A criterion to accept the hypothesis is 
that the AUC  value described in the section 6.1.3 (1) “Primary endpoint ” is at least 0.70 which is considered as 
fair [11].  
 
7.6 Provision for an interim analysis

serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
 
(2) Serious adverse device effect (SADE)  
Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
 
(3) Unanticipated serious adverse device effects ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
Serious adverse device effect which by  [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has not been 
identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.  
 NOTE: anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  
 
14.4 D efinition of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents such as the 
IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
14.5 T ime periods for reporting adverse events and device deficiencies  
(1) Notifying the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726635] a serious adverse event or a serious adverse device effect, and any 
type of unanticipated adverse device effect, regardless of seriousness or severity, must be reported immediately to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726636] [ADDRESS_992382] the understanding of 
the event.  
 
(2) Notifying the IRB  
The Northwell Health IRB requires the investigators to submit reports of the following problems within 
5 working days  from the time the investigator s become aware of any adverse event that occurs any  
time during or after the study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_726637]: 
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 34 / 38 
 
• Unexpected  (An event is “ unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent doc ument 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND  
• Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_726638], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_485915].)  
The above is required regardless of whether the event is serious or non- serious, on -site or off -site. 
 
All unanticipated adverse device effects and all serious adverse device effects reported by [CONTACT_726666] s ponsor must also be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but within 5 
business days . 
 
14.6 Process for reporting adverse events  and device deficiencies  
(1) Notifying the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726639], the investigator must seek information on adverse events including 
adverse device effects by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events including adverse device effects must  be recorded immediately in the source 
documents, and also in appropriate adverse event case report forms. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source documents, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 The clinical course of each event must be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events and serious adverse device effects that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse device effects that occur after the study period must be recorded and reported promptly.  
 The minimum initial information to be captured in the subject ’s source documents concerning the 
adverse event includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study s ubject number  
• Model and serial number/lot number of the investigational device  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study procedure/treatment  
• Current status  
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 35 / 38 
 
• Whether study procedure/treatment was discontinued  
• Whether the event is serious and reason for classification as serious  
 
(2) Notifying the IRB  
The investigators should report unanticipated problems to the Northwell Health IRB using the form: 
“Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable Adverse Events ” or 
as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding i ts 
fulfillment of the above criteria, follow- up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other 
study documentation).  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_726640]’s study file. 
 <Other Reportable events > 
For clinical studies with an investigational device, the following events are also reportable to the 
Northwell Health IRB:  
• For device studies that include the delivery of investigational drugs, any adverse experience 
that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected adverse event that is rare 
in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome).  
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the protocol or the informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_116628].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
o An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
o Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent 
than initially expected.  
o A paper is published from  another study that shows that an arm of your research study 
is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used 
in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol  taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard 
to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
 Clinical investigation plan CS -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 36 / 38 
 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], 
or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_992383] since the applied part of the investigational device ( the 
sensor probe) is equivalent to standard pulse oximeter sensors. A well -known potential adverse effect of pulse 
oximeters is thermal injuries due to temperature rise at the applied part of the sensor.

14.9 Information regarding the data monitoring committee 
Not applicable. There is no data monitoring committee for this study.  
 
15 V ulnerable population 
Not applicable. The population for this study is not  considered as a vulnerable population.  
 
16 S uspension or premature termination of the clinical investigation 
16.1 C riteria and arrangements for suspension or premature termination  
The sponsor may suspend or prematurely terminate either a clinical investigation in an individual investigation 
site (if applicable)  or the entire clinical investigation for significant and documented reasons. A principal 
investigator, IRB, or regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate participation in the  clinical 
investigation at the investigation sites for which they are responsible.  
 If suspi[INVESTIGATOR_168343], or when so instructed by [CONTACT_100958], the sponsor shall suspend the clinical investigation while the risk is assessed. The sponsor shall terminate the clinical investigation if an unacceptable risk is confirmed.  The sponsor shall 
consider terminating or suspending the participation of a particular investigation site (if applicable) or investigator 
in the clinical investigation if monitoring or auditing identifies serious or repeated CIP deviations . 
 If suspension or premature termination occurs, the terminating party shall justify its decision in writing and promptly inform the other parties. The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_726641] -011-004 Ver.3.1 
 37 / [ADDRESS_992385] of safety, the sponsor shall inform all other  investigators  of other investigation 
sites (if applicable).  
 
When the sponsor concludes an analysis of the reason(s) for the suspension, implements the necessary corrective actions, and decides to lift the temporary suspension, the sponsor shall inform the principal investigator, the IRB, and where appropriate, the regulatory authority of the rationale and provide them with the 
relevant data supporting this decision. Concurrence shall be obtained from the IRB and, where appropriate, regulatory authorities before the clinical investigation r esumes.  
 
16.2 C riteria for access to and breaking the blinding/masking code in the case of suspension or 
premature termination of the clinical investigation  
Not applicable. The blinding in this study is used only when CRI and CRT measurements are performed at t he 
bed side as described in the section 6.1.2: the investigator who will measure the visual CRT will be blinded from the CRI values measured with the investigational device.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_992386] be presented to the sponsor well in advance of any publication or presentation, time for the sponsor to respond to the data is encouraged and allowed per the publication policy.

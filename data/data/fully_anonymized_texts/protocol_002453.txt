Protocol Version # 1    1.0 Specific Aims and Major Rational  
 
The primary aim of this  mechanistic, double -blind, placebo -controlled proof -of-concept clinical 
trial is to demonstrate that preemptive oral administra tion of cocoa flavanol  for five days before 
surgery (equivalent to 50 grams of dark chocolate per day) will attenuate the surgery -evoked 
increase of HMGB1 in blood plasma and NFkB signaling in innate immune cells shortly after 
surgery. The H MGB1 -NFkB signaling axis is a major pro -inflammatory axis that is activated in 
response to tissue trauma. Preemptive attenuation of this axis in multiple animal injury models is 
associated with reduced tissue damage and increased survival. A secondary aim is to capture  
preliminary patient -centered outcomes data including postsurgical pain and daily functioning for 
six weeks after surgery , and relate these outcomes to the intake of oral cocoa flavanol  and 
surgery -evoked activation of the HMGB1 -NFkB signaling  axis. 
 
The protocol for this trial is embedded in previous studies by [CONTACT_6283]. Angst and Gaudillie re that 
examined  immune cor relates of surgical recovery in  patients  undergoing major joint 
replacements .1,[ADDRESS_198796] up to 30% of patients 
and leads to impaired daily functioning, delayed return to work, decreased quality of life, and 
major socioeconomic costs.6-8 Reducing “loss of productivity” by [CONTACT_169919] $[ADDRESS_198797] -effective focus on 
postoperative recovery pays tribute to three goals of health care: Improving patients’ 
experience, improving health, and constrain ing per capi[INVESTIGATOR_169912].[ADDRESS_198798] that is equivalent in dose to the amount of cocoa flavanol contained in about 50 
grams of dark chocolate d ecreases plasma levels of HMGB1 . HMGB1 is an archetypi[INVESTIGATOR_169913], i.e., an endogenous mediator that is released upon cellular stress and injury. HMGB1 
triggers a pro -inflammatory cascade by [CONTACT_169920] -like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune 
and other cells, which results in activation of pro -inflammatory transcription factors (e.g. NFkB) 
and the subsequent release of major pro -inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF ). The prominent 
role of the HMGB1 -TLR axis in inflammatory disease states including surgery, trauma, stroke, 
and myocardial infarction has recently been highlighted.16-[ADDRESS_198799] in preclinical injury models has been shown to improve outcomes.20-22  
 
Page 4 
Protocol Version # [ADDRESS_198800] implicated in aggravated tissue 
damage and delayed healing/recovery, the use of broader and less specific anti -inflammatory 
interventions in the perioperative period including non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and 
corticosteroids is common clinical practice.  
 
Preliminary data  
Drs. Angst and Gaudillie re have 
studied immune correlates of 
clinical recovery in patients 
undergoing hip replacement 
surgery.1,[ADDRESS_198801] 
successfully implemented mass 
cytometry at the “bedside” to 
characterize the immune 
response to surgery close to in-
vivo conditions in peripheral 
whole blood of patients.[ADDRESS_198802]. Goodman (co -
investigator). In close 
collabor ation with [CONTACT_169928] (co -investigator), 
the team of investigators has developed computational algorithms that allow extracting 
biologically meaningful and actionable immune parameters from generated high -dimensional 
data sets.26 
 
Pertinent to this application are data demonstrating that exaggerated signaling in innate immune 
cells downstream of toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) shortly after surgery predicts delayed functional 
recovery and resolution of pain in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (Figure 1).1,[ADDRESS_198803]. Sloan (co -
investigator) demonstrate that oral 
administration of a high-dose (1,000 mg) 
versus a very low dose (10 mg control) of 
coco -flavanol  (CocoaVia) in 24 healthy 
adults (age 50 -70 years) significantly 
suppressed plasma levels of HMGB1 
(Figure 2).  
 
Taken together the preliminary data support 
the main hypothesis that the preemptive 
administration of cocoa flavan ols in patients 
undergoing surgery will decrease plasma 
Signaling change downstream of 
TLR4 (CREB) 4 hours after surgerySignaling change downstream of 
TLR4 (NFkB) 4 hours after surgeryFigure 1:  Exaggerated signaling downstream of TLR4  in innate immune 
cells 4 hours  after surgery strongly correlated with the speed at which 
patients resolved postoperative pain and regained function of the operated 
hip. Seventy four percent  of patients remained mil dly impaired at the end of 
the s ix-week study period, while 10% remained moderately impaired.

4.0 Materials and Methods  
 
 The proposed study is designed as a randomized, controlled, and double -blind study comparing a 
daily dose  of cacao flavanol  versus  placebo. Cocoa flavanol is  commercially available as a 
nutrient  (CocoaVia ), manufactured by [CONTACT_169922]. CocoaVia is supplied in 125 mg capsules 
Page 6 
Protocol Version # 1    contain ing 15% epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], the active anti -inflammatory ingredient. Based on our preliminary 
data a daily oral dose of 1,[ADDRESS_198807] completed the informed consent process they will be ra ndomized to on e of 
two treatment groups - half to group A and half to group B. Group A participants will r eceive a 
daily oral dose  of 1,000  mg cocoa flavanol  (CocoaVia®) for [ADDRESS_198808] as foll ows:  
 
Questionnaires:  Before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169915] (patient expectations), stress level (perceived stress scale), pain and 
function (WOMAC ), anxiety (POMS -anxiety scale), and  baseline fatigue and functional 
impairment (surgical recovery scale; SRS ). Participants will complete SRS and WOMAC scales 
daily while they are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and weekly following discharge to track recovery over a six -
week course .  
 
Objective measures of function:  Physical function will also be measured objectively by [CONTACT_169923] a wearable  device (ActiG raph)  providing measurements for 
physical activity/function and sleep. Participants will be asked to wear the device beg inning 1 
week before surgery through postoperative week 6.  
 
Blood draws:  Blood will be drawn at 4 time points; once before administration of the study 
intervention (40ml), 1 hour before surgery (30ml), 1 hour after surgery (30ml), and on post -op day 
1 (30 ml). Blood will be processed for analysis of cell signaling with mass cytometry (NFkB in 
innate immune cells), HMGB1 plasma concentrations , and epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] (flavanol) plasma 
concentrations . Blood samples will be identified using a study code, and will be a nalyzed in labs 
at Stanford University and Stanford Health Care (Stanford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 
Additional data to be collected will be demographic and socioeconomic information, medical 
history including co -morbidity prior to surgery, and recent medication history . During 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169916], pain level, details of surgery and anesthesia, 
incidence of complications , and time to "discharge ready" will be recorded.  
 
5.0 Statistical Measures  
 
5.1 Outcome Measurements  
The p rimary outcome is the cumulative NFkB  signal  in innate immune cells 1 and 24 hours after 
surgery .  
 
Secondary outcomes include  HMGB1 plasma levels,  functional recovery trajectories (measured 
objectively with ActiG raph and subjectively with WOMAC function sub -scale ), postope rative pain 
resolution (measured with WOMAC -pain subscale), and postoperative  resolution of fatigue  and 
resulting impairment of daily activities (measured with SRS ). Trajectories will be reflected by [CONTACT_169924], the tim e to resolve pain to mild levels, and the time 
to resolve fatigue to 50% of maximum postoperative fatigue.

outcome.  
 
5.3 Sample size  
Based on data from previous studies of surgical patients receiving an active ( arginine nutritional        
supplement) v ersus a control treatment , it is reasonable to assume that intervention -related 
effect sizes (changes in signaling activity) are about twice as large as pooled standard 
deviations. This has been noted  for signaling molecules  downstream of TLR4 in response to 
arginine supplementation.  TLR4 -signaling (NFkB) is the primary outcome of this proof -of-
concept  study. A sample size of 16 patients per group should therefore provide ~80% at p<0.[ADDRESS_198810] , will review the data and participant safety in real time; 
reviewing each subject during active participation when in dicated. Given the nature, safety, and 
scope of this study a Data Monitoring Committee is not required and will not be established.

5/1/[ADDRESS_129315] probiotic use in children greater than 12 months -36 months over a 27 -38 day period.  
 
Background and Significance  
Acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_76133] (URIs) are a common, important and expensive clinical problem. The acute URI is the most frequent infection experienced by [CONTACT_115850].  URI is frequently 
complicated by [CONTACT_115851], acute sinusitis or pneumonia especially in children. Furthermore, the practitioner, uncertain about the role of bacteria in URI, often feels compelled to 
prescribe antibiotics.  The use of antibiotics for both imagined and actual complications of URI contributes 
greatly to local and global problems of antibiotic resistance.  In addition, viral URI may be the most important 
trigger for acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_115828].
[ADDRESS_129316] of $[ADDRESS_129317] in the use of probiotics to 
prevent URI and/or to shorten the duration of symptoms across all age groups.    
  
There is evidence that probiotics prevent and ameliorate URI: Various probiotics have been studied in the prevention of URI in children. Several studies have shown a decrease in the number of URIs
2-[ADDRESS_129318] a day and fewer numbers of days absent from 
school/work or day care.[ADDRESS_129319] L actobacillus  acidophilus  NCFM and B ifidobacteria  animalis Bi-07 in children 3 to 6 years 
of age.  They reported a 34 % risk reduction of fever, duration of coughing and rhinorrhea as well as reduced 
antibiotic use and days absent from group child care and work (for parents).11 These results strongly influenced 
our selection of probiotic.  
 
The mechanisms by [CONTACT_115852].   There is evidence that probiotics enhance immune function in children and that this 
enhancement may account for the decrease in frequency and severity of viral URIs observed in children 
receiving probiotics ( L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis  Bi-07) in comparison to those receiving placebo.18-24  
To date, the underlying  immune mechanism(s) that account for this protective health benefit has not been 
clearly delineated.  However, the most likely mechanism is via their impact on various immune cell numbers and function.
24 Probiotics are known to regulate the balance between pro and anti -inflammatory cytokines and 
the activation of Treg cells and the resultant skewing of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell activities. For example, 
Ghadimi et al demonstrated in an in vitro assay (using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM Cs)) of allergic 
and non- allergic patients that incubation of PBMCs with various lactic acid producing bacteria decreased the 
presence of Th2 cytokines (IL- 4 and IL5) and enhanced the production of IFN -γ (known for its antiviral effect).25  
In a series of clinical studies performed by [CONTACT_79416], healthy adults were randomized to receive 
probiotic or placebo for several months.19,23 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_115829]

 those who received probiotic and significantly higher levels of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and monocytes 
were demonstrated in the probiotic -treated group. Furthermore, there have been numerous studies in the 
murine model showing that probiotics are effective in preventing influenza in those infant rodents fed a variety of lactic acid producing bacteria.
26-28  
 The immune assays used in this study are similar to those  currently being used in a large NIH -funded birth 
cohort (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_115830], Co- I: Seroogy) aimed at determining the impact of environmental exposures on immune 
maturation and protection from severe viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711] (Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort; WISC).  Interim analysis from the WISC project (first 38 study subjects) demonstrates qualitative differences in the anti -
viral responses of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC)s in the cord blood of infants born into farming 
environments (manuscript in preparation) vs those born into non -
farming environments (figure 1).   
 We are currently in the 4
th year of a large NIH funded observational 
study (Wald – PI, DeMuri Co -I) to determine the viral and bacterial 
antecedents of acute bacterial sinusitis in children 4- [ADDRESS_129320] shown that there are signi ficant 
differences in the composition of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiome 
in children with frequent URI vs those with no URIs. Figure 2 shows 
the differences in Faith’s Diversity Index, an indicator of a robust microbiome, in children with no URIs during the [ADDRESS_129321] 
the hypothesis that  probiotic supplementation will lead to an increase in the number and enhanced antiviral 
functi on of both pDCs and Treg cells.

Specific Aims/Study Objectives 
 
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115831] a combination probiotic ( L.acidophilus  NCFM  and B. 
lactis  Bi-07) supplement daily. Children ages >12-36 months will receive probiotic orally for 30 days.  The 
qualitative and quantitative response of innate immune cells stimulated with various toll like receptor (TLR) agonists and human rhinovirus and quantification of T regulatory cells (Treg) will be determined in study 
subjects at initiation and conclusi on of the study ( baseline and at 30 days) using an optimized multi -parameter 
flow cytometry assay. We hypothesize that probiotic supplementation will lead to an increase in the 
number and enhanced antiviral function of both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pD C) and Treg cells.   We 
also hypothesize that probiotic supplementation will lead to changes in the nasopharyngeal microbiome.  
 
Specific Aim 1: 
To determine the impact of probiotic supplementation on immune cell function through 
the assessment of quantitat ive responses of whole blood immune cells  stimulated with various toll like 
receptor agonists .and 
 
Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the nasopharyngeal (NP)  
and fecal microbiome .  
  
 
The study duration is  1 year.

 • Any antibiotic treatment in the last 2 weeks  
• Conditions which might interfere with dispersion of the probiotic after oral administration such as short 
gut or anomalies of the digestive tract  
• Concurrently  participating  in another  clinical study,  in which  the child has been or will be 
exposed  to an investigational  or a non-investigational  product  (pharmaceutical  product  or device).  
 Up to [ADDRESS_129323] inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and a brief synopsis of study participation.  
 
During the visit, the clinic staff or pediatrician will ask the family if they are interested in learning more about the 
study. If yes, the study nurse will be summoned at the end of the clinic visit to discuss the study with the family.  
 
All children will receive a daily dose of probiotic (10
⁹ cfu of L.acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis , Bi-07), a 
commercially available probiotic. The product is stable at room temperature for 6 months. L. acidophilus  NFCM 
and B. lactis -07 are classified by [CONTACT_4760] a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) food ingredient . This 
particular combination probiotic was chosen because it has shown efficacy in published clinical trials for URI in 
children and adults. Parents will give probiotic in 1 ounce of milk  or water  once a day for 3 0 days in an open 
label fashion.  
 A baseline blood sample (5- 10 ml) will be obtained for immunologic studies (see below).  If the child is having 
standard of care lab work done, the research staff will accompany the family to the lab with t he research kit. 
Parents will be texted ev ery week to determine if any illnesses have occurred in the interval and if the child has 
received any antimicrobials.  In addition, a daily diary will be completed recording the presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_115832]. This will suffice to 
record illness events or any adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_3038].  
Repeat blood testing for immunologic studies will be performed after the child has taken probiotic for at least 
30 days. Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_115853].  
Note that each child will serve as his/her own control.  The baseline sample wil l serve as the control sample.  
We have not included a placebo- control group at this time due to funding limitations in this exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].  If our pi[INVESTIGATOR_115833] a significant effect of probiotic , this study will be expanded to include a control 
group. We are aware tha t there may be changes in immune function in the [ADDRESS_129324] efficient use of limited resources  for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834] .  
For the microbiome analysis NP swabs and stool samples will  be obtained at study entry and at 30 days.

a) Visit 1 .  The table above shows procedures according to visit. At enrollment , a blood sample and 
nasopharyngeal swab and stool sample will be obtained. The following data will be collected:  age, previous 
illnesses, immunization status, number of siblings (and their health status), attendance at daycare (defined as [ADDRESS_129326] time/week), parental age and health status, address and size 
of dwelling, pets in the home and dietary intake. Diaries  will be distributed to parents to track administration of 
the probiotic . Probiotics will be given to the family with instructions on daily administration.  A container and 
“toilet hat” (for toilet trained children) will be provided to parents to collect stool samples. The family will either 
return the stool sample to clinic or it will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_115835]. If the parent does not collect the sample or 
the sample is not usable study staff will encourage the parent to re- collect. If this is not possible the patient will 
not be used in final analysis of stool microbiome.  
 
c) Visit 2. We will review the medical history for any changes that may have occurred from the last visit.  We 
will obtain a blood sample, a nasopharyngeal swab and stool sample.  We will collect the used probioti c box. 
We will review the d iary card and inquire about any symptoms the child may be experiencing.  
 d) Weekly Text Message 
Parents will be texted ever y week to determine if any illnesses have occurred in the interval and if the child has 
received any antimicrobials. The text will contain a link to UW’s REDCap so that they can complete a short 
survey. Detailed instructions will be provided to the parent by [CONTACT_464].     In addition, a daily diary will be 
completed recording the presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_115836]. Study nurses will review each weekly report on 
REDCap and will report adverse events to the investigators. These will be documented in REDCap and 
followed- up on by [CONTACT_3476].   This will suffice to record illness events or any adverse events experienced 
by [CONTACT_3038].  
 
 
Probioti cs 
L. acidophilus  NFCM and B. lactis -07 are classified by [CONTACT_37368] a Generally Recognized as Safe 
(GRAS) food ingredient. Furthermore, B. lactis  and L. acidophilus have been present in human food for 
decades and are listed in the Inventory of Microorganisms with Documented History of Use in Human Food 
29. 
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also added these species to the Qualified Presumption of Safety 
list 30. No harmful or toxigenic activities are associated with B. lactis or L. acidophilus . Furthermore, Bi -07 and 
NCFM can be geneticall y identified on species and strain level 31,32. 
 
An overview of the safety of probiotics was reported in 2011.33 Although 622 studies  were included in the 
review, only nonspecific safety statements were made in 235 studies; 387 reported the presence or absence of 
specific adverse events. The authors concluded that the available evidence in randomized controlled trials 
does not indicate an increased risk. The two probiotics to be used in this study ( L. acidophilus  NFCM and B. 
lactis  – 07) have been used singly or in combination, in several published studies encompassing [ADDRESS_129327] and al, an 
exceptionally thorough safety and tolerability analysis was conducted for NCFM&Bi -07.[ADDRESS_129328], probiotics are routinely added to commercial infant formulas  (Gerber 
Good Start Protect Plus,  Nutramagen with Enflora and o thers)  and are marketed toward children of all ages.  
 
5/1/[ADDRESS_129329] will be supplied by [CONTACT_115854]™ Danisco® in individual sachets containing of [ADDRESS_129330].  
 
Laboratory Testing 
Blood samples: All subjects will undergo blood draws at Visits 1 and 2 . The pediatric research staff will obtain 
the blood either at a clinic visit or a home visit. The tubes will be transported by [CONTACT_115855] ([CONTACT_115868]’s Lab). Total blood volume will be between 5- [ADDRESS_129331]. 
Seroogy’s lab. Cytokine analysis will be measured fee -for-service by [CONTACT_115856] (Austin,TX).  
 
Nasopharyngeal swabs: All subjects will have a nasopharyngeal swab obtained at Visits 1 and 2.  The swabs 
will be placed into RNA Later medium and frozen within 7 days of collection in the pediatric - 80C freezer 
located in H4/4. Nasopharyngeal swab samples for assessment of the nasopharyngeal microbiome will be 
collected at enrollment  and at the follow -up visit.  (Copan Diagnostics,  Inc. Murrieta [LOCATION_004]). The soft strands 
of nylon on the swab result in tremendously improved patient comfort and efficiency in specimen collection. The velvet brush- like texture collects liquid by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_115837], providing an 
optimal approach to sampling for this study. The  swab is inserted into the nostril along the floor of the nasal 
cavity until the posterior wall is reached. The swab is held in place for [ADDRESS_129332]. Lynch’s laboratory at University of [LOCATION_004]- San 
Francisco for analysis.  [CONTACT_115869]’s lab will be preforming a service of doing 16s sequencing for microbiome 
analysis. NP and stool samples wil l not be banked.  
 
 
 
  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
[CONTACT_115870] and Dr. DeMuri are board certified infectious disease pediatricians. [CONTACT_115868] is board certified in 
pediatric allergy and immunology. All are experienced researchers. All will be available to the study staff and to 
families to address any concerns or unanticipated problems.  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115838].  Based on published data, there are very minimal if any adverse events expected in 
children receiving probiot ics.
40  In addition the number of subjects is small and will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_58860].  
 
 
5/1/[ADDRESS_129333] occurred in the interval and if the child has 
received any antimicrobials.  The text will contain a link to UW’s REDCap so that they can complete a short 
survey.  Detailed instructions will be provided to the parent by [CONTACT_464].  In addition, a daily diary will be 
completed recording the presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_115839].  Study nurses will review each weekly entry to  
REDCap and will report adverse events to the investigators. These will be documented in REDCap and 
followed- up by [CONTACT_3476].  This will suffice to record illness events or any adverse events experienced by 
[CONTACT_3038].   
 
Any unexpected or unanticipated event will be reported to the IRB  and DuPont per policy.   
 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the impact of probiotic supplementation on immune cell function  
 
Quantitative response of innate immune cells stimulated with a toll like receptor (TLR) agonist and other 
stimulants will be determined in study subjects at initiation and conclusion of the study ( baseline– before 
probiotic and 3 0 days after the initiation of probiotic supplementation) . Thus each subject will serve as their 
own control.  
 
Method:   
Immunoprofiling of antigen stimulated blood . The TruCulture system(Myriad RBM)  will be used to assess 
immune function pre and post probiotic supplementation.[ADDRESS_129334] of TLR7 and TLR8.  In addition a control (null) tube will contain 
only cell culture medium.  One ml of whole blood will be mixed with medium in each tube and incubated at 37 
C in a dry heat -block for 24- 48 hours. After incubation, cells are separated by a valve separator component.  
The supernatant is stored at - 20 C until analysis. The cellular component will be banked for future studies.  
Cytokine levels on supernatants will be sent to and m easured by a commercial laboratory (RBM Myriad-  
Austin, TX).  Measured cytokines will include GCSF, IL -2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8,IL-10, MIP -[ADDRESS_129335]. Seroogy’s lab will perform i nitial 
processing of blood specimens. Cytokine determination will be performed fee- for-service by [CONTACT_115856] 
(Austin,TX).  
 
 
 
Data analysis, interpretation, and expected outcome: The primary endpoint for this aim is determination of 
quantitative responses o f whole blood leukocytes  to varied agonists. We expect that probiotic exposure will be 
associated with enhanced production of IL-10TNFα and IFNα.   The changes found will be attributed to the 
probiotic intervention since precision testing using this assay by  [CONTACT_115857]43. 
  
Specific Aim 2:  To demonstrate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the NP and fecal 
microbiome.   
The impact of probiotic consumption on the NP and fecal microbiota will be determined by [CONTACT_115858] . We hypothesize that the administration of 
probiotic will be associated with an increase in the richness and diversity of the microbiota after 1 month  of probiotic supplementation as measured by [CONTACT_115859]- Weiner and unweighted UniFrac 1 
indexes.   
 
Methods:  NP and stool samples will be collected immediately and stored at  −80 °C until analysis. 
Total bacterial DNA will be extracted from stool  and NP samples  as described.44,45 The 16S V1 -V2 
region will be amplified using primers  containing sample- specific barcodes and sequenced.   This 
analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_115860].  
 
 
5/1/17

 Data analysis, interpretation, and expected outcome:  Data analysis will be performed in QIIME 
with Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) chosen based upon 97% sequence similarity. Statistical 
differences between treatment arms and between samples collected pre-  and post -administration of 
probiotic will be examined using the Monte- Carlo test in R with the Benjamini -Hochberg procedure 
applied to control the false discovery rate.46 We hypothesize that  the administration of probiotic will be 
associated with a significant increase in the richness and diversity of microbiota as measured by  
[CONTACT_115859]- Weiner and unweighted UniFrac 1 indexes.   
 
 
Statistical Considerations (Aim 1 and 2) : Endpoints : The primary outcome will include innate immune cell 
function parameters, adaptive and NK cell function parameters, and Treg cell number/function parameters.  
 
Sample Size and Power Calculation: A sample size of [ADDRESS_129336] 
sizes for evaluating differences in the primary monocytes and mDCs parameters between various subgroups 
ranged from 0.52 to 1.68. The proposed sample size of 30 subjects is adequate for detecting anticipated  moderate (0.5 -0.8) to large (>0.8) effect sizes for the changes from the baseline to the one month  follow -up 
assessment in the primary innate immune cell function cell function parameters with sufficient power. The 
following table shows that attainable power levels for detecting moderate effect sizes (ES) ranging form 0.[ADDRESS_129337] with a false -discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, assuming a sample size of 30 
subjec ts with an attrition rate of 10%  and a panel of 30 target  parameters where the true mean differences (D) 
exceed the effect size in K=10 to 20 parameters.

sample size of [ADDRESS_129340] this in a large r controlled trial.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan : All outcome parameters will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics in 
terms of means, standard deviations, medians and ranges. Absolute and percentage changes from the 
baseline to the month [ADDRESS_129341]. The Benjamini -Hochberg method will be utilized to control the false discovery rate.  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_115861] (at leas t 50%, 75% or 90% compliant). Pearson or 
nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation analyses will be conducted to evaluate associations of changes between outcome parameters. These analyses will be considered exploratory.

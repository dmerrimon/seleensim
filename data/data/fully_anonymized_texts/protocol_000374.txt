Up to 50% of patients do not take their cardiovascular medications as prescribed, resulting in [ADDRESS_660152] produced 13 
mixed results —some demonstrating benefits, but many produc ing small to negative results. [ADDRESS_660153] been limited by 1) includ ing adherent patients who may not ne ed 15 
an intervention; 2) resource -intensive approaches involving pharmacists; and 3) lack of attention [ADDRESS_660154] been incorporated into health interventions to “nudge” people to  19 
achieve improved health outcomes. A behavioral nudge is a small change in framing choice that 20 
alters people’s behavior in a predictable way. A prior study test ing financial incentives through 21 
elimination of copayments for cardiovascular medications in the year after acute myocardial 22 
infarction improved adherence from 4% to 6% ; however, financial incentives are not 23 
generalizable and are unlikely to be sustainable. Behavioral nudges such as commitments ( e.g. 24 
asking patients for demonstrated commitment to change through a pledge), norms (using 25 
examples of others who take action), and salience (making information or recommendations 26 
resonant through use of stories) build on a well-evidenced body of behavioral science theory [ADDRESS_660155] yet to be tested to improve medication adherence. 29 
30 
Mobile and digital technologies for health promotion and disease self -management 1-3 offer an 31 
intriguing and as of yet untested opportunities to adapt behavioral ‘nudges ’ using ubiquitous cell 32 
phone technology to facilitate medication adherence.  33 
34 
The objectives of our two-part, multi-center study are as follows over the course of 4 years: 35 
Aim 1: Conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve 36 
adherence to chronic CV medications. The primary outcome will be medication adherence 37 
defined by [CONTACT_510591] (PDC) using pharmacy refill data. Secondary 38 
outcomes will include intermediate clinical measures (e.g., BP control), CV clinical events (e.g., 39 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), healthcare utilization, and costs. 40 
Aim 2: Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and applying the RE-AIM 41 
(reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, 42 
assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and 43 
modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention within the 3 HCS more broadly and 44 
nationally.  45

BACKGROUND  AND SIGNIFICANCE  47 
Patients commonly fail to adhere to cardiovascular medications, resulting in an increased risk of 48 
adverse outcomes. Pharmacy refill data is routinely used to describe the prevalence and 49 
outcomes of medication non-adherence using one of two measures, the proportion of days 50 
covered (PDC) or the medication possession ratio (MPR). Both measures are calculated by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_660156] adherence. Non-adherence is commonly defined as a PDC or 53 
MPR <0.80. Prior work has found 20% to 50% of patients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. 54 
hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease) have poor 55 
medication adherence.  For example, in our prior work, over a quarter ( 28%) of patients were [ADDRESS_660157] oral anti-coagulant that is intended to reduce the risk of 57 
thromboembolic events among patients with atrial fibrillation. In the same study, we 58 
demonstrated poor adherence was associated with increased risk of mortality or stroke (HR 59 
1.13, 95% CI 1.07 -1.19 per 10% decrease in adherence as measured by [CONTACT_510592]). A similar 60 
association between medication non-adherence and adverse outcomes has been demonstrated 61 
for other classes of medications including anti -platelet medications, B-blockers, ACE inhibitors 62 
or ARBs, oral diabetes medications, and statins, all of which are used to treat cardiovascular 63 
diseases. The accumulated literature has shown that medication non-adherence to CV 64 
medications is common and results in suboptimal outcomes; thus effective interventions are 65 
needed to improve medicatio n adherence. 66 
Mobile telephone text messaging interventions , a form of mHealth technology , may be 67 
promising in improving medication adherence. Mobile telephones and text messaging are 68 
ubiquitous - this technology is increasingly used regardless of age, socioeconomic class and 69 
primary language. A recent meta-analysis of mobile telephone text messaging medication 70 
adherence interventions for chronic diseases demonstrated that text-messaging interventions 71 
approximately double the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into 72 
adherence rates improving from 50 .0% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic 73 
disease) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%. Another meta-analysis of text messaging [ADDRESS_660158] of generic vs. tailored approaches, optimal message timing and intensity and 79 
whether bi-directional messaging is useful. Authors of both reviews concluded the results should 80 
be interpreted with caution given the short duration of studies and reliance on self-reported 81 
measures . The se preliminary data on the influence of text messaging interventions are cause 82 
for optimism. However, it is not yet known how this type of interventio n might be optimized at 83 
scale and whether doing so will improve outcomes.  84 
Behavioral “nudges” from the fields of behavioral economics and cognitive psychology have the [ADDRESS_660159] theory 91 
(two of the foundational theories suppor ting Dan Kahneman’s 2002 Nobel prize in economics), [ADDRESS_660160] to cognitive biases that cause decision-making to deviate 93 
from the normative or rational. The Dual-Pro cess Theory of decision making states that people 94 
make decisions e ither ‘intuitively,’ quickly drawing on emotion and past experiences or 95 
3 ‘reasonably’ using a thoughtful, analytic approach. Nudges take advantage of the intuitive 96 
aspects of decision-making. A nudge is defined as a small change in choice framing or choice 97 
architecture that “alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or 98 
significantly changing their economic incentives.” A technology -delivered nudge should 99 
positively i nfluence individuals’ behaviors through the use of non-intrusive education, social 100 
norm setting, and reciprocity expectation.  101 
There are thr ee types of nudge interventions strongly supported by [CONTACT_510593] 102 
feasibly implemented as text messages within the context of medication adherence:  103 
1)Communicating social norms:  Social norms can activate and guide behavior in positive ways [ADDRESS_660161] been shown to improve healthy food choices, physical activity, everyday health 107 
behaviors (e.g. using the stairs vs. elevators) and even reduce home energy use. However, 108 
little or no research has tested the influence of social norm communication via text 109 
messaging to improve medication adherence. 110 
2)Behavioral commitments:  A behavioral commitment is something like committing to filling 111 
one’s prescription. Prior research has demonstrated a strong desire among individuals to act 112 
consistently with their prior commitments, and eliciting commitments to engage in a specific 113 
behavior has been shown to be effective at improving a  range of behaviors, including 114 
judicious use of antibiotics among clinicians.  Commitments to fill one’s prescription could be 115 
elicited via text messaging and may lead to greater concordance between individuals’ 116 
commitment and their behaviors. 117 
3)Narrative Stories:  Narrative stories are increasingly recognized as an important way to 118 
increase vividness and comprehension of medical outcomes. One issue underlying 119 
medication non-adherence is likely a failure to recognize or understand the potential 120 
negative consequences t he behavior, e.g. , stroke, heart attack, or even death. Narrative 121 
interventions —particularly ones that describe stories of negative outcomes —may be 122 
particularly effective at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_510578]- 123 
adherence, spurring them to take action (improving medication adherence) to prevent [ADDRESS_660162] to influence medication 126 
adherence,1-4 such messages are not theoretically informed to influence social norms, 127 
behav ioral commitment and/or use narratives. 128 
PREVIOUS WORK 129 
Through out 2018, we established the procedures and start-up necessary to initiate this four- 130 
year study successfully with an informed approach (COMIRB # 18-0630). We have developed a 131 
message library, and vetted and developed through a series of N of 1 trials and stakeholder 132 
panel input. IT infrastructure has been developed across three healthcare systems (see below 133 
for additional details).  [ADDRESS_660163] also pi[INVESTIGATOR_510579], opt-out methods, and the 135 
text messaging intervention through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (in progress at this time ). 136 
SETTING 137 
The proposed study setting includes  Denver Health, UCHealth, and the Denver VA healthcare 138 
systems (HCS ). 139 
APPROACH  140 
4   Over the next four years, we propose conducting a patient-level, randomized pragmatic trial 141 
testing a variety of strategies “nudging” patients  through text messages to encourage 142 
medication adherence to already-prescribed cardiovascular medicines .  143 
Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria  [ADDRESS_660164] within the 100 days prior to the cohort build date.  149 
There will be minimal exclusions criteria: 1) patients who have neither a landline or cellphone; 150 
or 2) enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36015]; or 3) Non-English or Spanish speaking; 4) residing [ADDRESS_660165] year utilizing pharmacy refill data will 153 
be eligible to receive nudges . We will specifically target patients from the following patient 154 
groups: 1) Age > and <= 65 years of age; 2) Male and female patients; 3) one versus multiple [ADDRESS_660166]; and 4) English and Spanish speaking patients.  [ADDRESS_660167]  158

Opt-out Consent Process [ADDRESS_660168], materials will be sent in English only at the VA. All materials will be sent on 170 
letterhead and branding appropriate and specific to each HCS. The letter will be signed by 171 
either the primary care provider for the patient or the site principal investigator. 172 
5 Should an opt-out packet be returned by [CONTACT_510594] (USPS) due to an [ADDRESS_660169] address, etc, a member of the study team will call the potential participant no more 174 
than two times to verify their address; should they not hear from the participant the patient will [ADDRESS_660170] not opted-out will be randomized accordingly. Signed and returned 177 
opt-out forms will be securely stored in a locked filing cabinet (returned opt-out forms for VA 178 
patients will be securely stored at the VA). [ADDRESS_660171] already developed algorithms that queries pharmacy data for a defined medication 187 
refill gap based on the date that the medication was supplied and the number of medication 188 
days supplied. This algorithm is in use for a medication adherence study currently. We will apply 189 
this algorithm across the 3 HCS to identify non-adherent patients.  190 
Pharmacy data from UCHealth and Denver Health will be accessed through both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- 191 
specific pharmacy data and Surescripts, a network with existing relationships with both HCS 192 
that provides pharmacy refill data from over 95% of US pharmacies. Daily pharmacy data via [ADDRESS_660172] 12 months 200 
of patient follow-up to assess for non -adherence. 201 
202 
Mobile Messenger  203 
Mobile Messenger (Upland Communications, Austin, TX) is an online platform specializing in [ADDRESS_660173] been created to ensure each HCS 205 
data are stored separately; protected health information (PHI) between sites will never be [ADDRESS_660174], the researcher will identify the patient has a 211 
listed cell phone. Upon confirming the phone number, the patient will be entered into the 212 
appropriate study arm. Message schedules and example messages (attached) are available in [ADDRESS_660175] subsequent refill gaps.  221 
1)Usual Care: This group will not receive an intervention. We have included a usual care [ADDRESS_660176] demonstrated small to 224 
negligible effects. 225 
2)Generic nudge : A generic reminder text will be delivered to patients to refill their [ADDRESS_660177] another 229 
opportunity to opt out of the study with text such as “text STOP if you wish to withdraw from 230 
this study.” The texts will stop once a patient has filled their medication. 231 
3)Optimized nudge: A behavioral nudge text will be delivered to patients to remind them to [ADDRESS_660178] another opportunity to opt out of the study with text such as “text STOP if you wish to 236 
withdraw from this study.”  The texts will stop once a patient has filled their medication. The 237 
content of the behavioral nudge text messages will vary with each text and will be derived from 238 
the text message library built during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_510581] (COMIRB #18-0630) 239 
4)Optimized nudge plus AI Chat Bot: A behavioral nudge text will be delivered to patients [ADDRESS_660179] another opportunity to opt out of the 242 
study with te xt such as “text STOP if you wish to withdraw from this study.” The texts will stop [ADDRESS_660180] interactive chat via a chat bot to assess bar riers filling the medication 245 
as described in Aim 1 above. 246 
The AI Chat bot will assess for common barriers to medication adherence 1) socioeconomic 247 
factors, 2) provider-patient/health care system factors; 3) condition -related factors; 4) therapy 248 
related factors and 5) patient-related factors using a developed script that we are currently [ADDRESS_660181] 256 
difficulty remembering what medications to take and when to take them; those that do would 257 
be asked if using a medication diary, involving a caretaker, or setting an alarm on their phone 258 
would help. Patients would be asked if they would like to try one of these strategies; for those 259 
that agree and identify a strategy, the AI chat program will include an algorithm to check in one 260 
week later to see how this strategy is going. Those who do not agree and/or identify a strategy [ADDRESS_660182]. Bull has programmed libraries very 267 
similar to this AI Chat bot approach and utilized them for behavior change in prior interventions. 268 
Patients will be followed for up to 24 months.  They will remain in the same study arm for the 269 
duration of the study and receive the same intervention for subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_113018]- 270 
adherence. 271 
272 
Plan for responding to text messages from patients 273 
a)If a patient text s “stop” to unsubscribe, the patient is automatically withdrawn from 274 
receiving the intervention (messages). Patients may also text m isspellings of the word 275 
"stop”  (such as “tsop,”  etc.), or send a message indicating the patient  would like to be [ADDRESS_660183] of care 277 
data from these patients. 278 
In the initial version of the consent form, we described a “stop ” response as a way to 279 
“fully  withdraw”  from the study. These patients  were opted  out from the study entirely, [ADDRESS_660184] hit "st op" in the original cohort, 282 
researchers will call the patients  (please find script) to obtain verbal consent to collect [ADDRESS_660185]. Patients from this original cohort that hit "stop" in the future 286 
will be flagged and the calling process will be implemented. 287 
b)Should a patient  respond “done”  to indicate they have already filled their prescription or 288 
a physician has cancelled their medication, we will stop sending patients  any further 289 
text messages about  refilling the medication in which they had a delay  until their 290 
medication is again  due for a refill (i.e. 30 – 90 days in the future) . We will immediately 291 
remove the patient  from further  text messages for this instance of medication non- 292 
adherence. 293 
Misspellings of “done”  or messages indicating they have already filled their prescription 294 
or that a physician cancelled their medications will be treated  as if they responded 295 
“done.”  If a physician has stopped their medication, we will no longer  monitor for 296 
medication refills for that specific medication. For other  medications, we will resume 297 
following the other  medication refills. If the patient  has a refill gap for the same or for 298 
other medications again, we will start delivering text messages within the same arm 299 
that they had been previously randomized to. 300 
c)Patients may request Spanish messages at any time via text. We will start to deliver [ADDRESS_660186]. If the patient  meets additional criteria for 302 
texts during the duration of the study, they will receive Spanish language  texts. 303 
d)There will be text messages that do not fall into any of the categories above. A 304 
Research Assistant will monitor these responses and will triage the messages 305 
depending  on the content of the messages. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], some patients  sent 306 
responses to the text messages that (a) requested additional  information about  the 307 
study and/or  (b) requested more detail  on the specific medication that required a refill, [ADDRESS_660187] number they can call for more information. This 312 
webpage will include  a “Frequently  Asked Questions”  (FAQ) about  the Nudge Study, [ADDRESS_660188] responses to anticipated questions (e.g. Does my provider know about  314 
this study?; How did you get my cell number?; What  if I don’t want to participate?; etc.).   [ADDRESS_660189] the patient’s  PCP to make them  aware of the issue.   [ADDRESS_660190] information on the study website. In cases where the patient  still has not 325 
refilled their medication after 5 days of their reply “done”,  a research assistant on the study [ADDRESS_660191] the patient  to see if he or she is 328 
having issues with refilling the medication and try to resolve any issues  with the patient.  329 
330 
In addition,  we will update  the patient’s  care provider on a regular basis about  medication gaps  [ADDRESS_660192] a 7-day gap in any prescribed CV medication 341 
refills, they will be randomized to one of four arms, described in Intervention below. 342 
Randomization will be stratified within each of the eight clinics, and within strata defined by 343 
number of other CV medication classes that are prescribed at randomization (1-4), using blocks 344 
of 4 patients to ensure balance within clinics over time. Thus, within each clinic and number of 345 
other medication stratum, each set of 4 consecutively enrolled subjects will be randomized to 346 
the four study arms. Treatments will be initiated immediately upon randomization, in response to 347 
the 7 -day gap.  348 
349 
The primary outcome is adherence to CV medications as measured by 12-month proportion of 350 
days covered (PDC).  There are several complications in using this outcome, including a) a 351 
need to account for periods when subjects are not at risk of depleting their medication supply 352 
(see below for details), b) defining PDC when considering five medication classes 353 
(antihypertensives, statins, oral hypoglycemics, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants), c) accounting 354 
for number of other prescribed CV medications (more opportunities to miss days, and more 355 
opportunities to receive reminders), d) modeling the non-normal bounded distribution of PDC, 356 
and e) a desire to express results on a PDC difference (not risk ratio or odds ratio) scale. 357 
Analyses accounting for these complications are described below.  Secondary outcomes 358 
include clinical events (e.g., event times for stroke, MI, mortality), utilization of care (e.g., 359 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510582]-related reasons), and costs of the interventions and of [ADDRESS_660193] more than one year of 362 
follow-up (up to 3 years depending on when they are enrolled during years 2-3) will continue to 363 
be followed for secondary outcomes.   364 
9 365 
Ascertainment of Outcomes 366 
Data for the primary outcome PDC will be obtained using pharmacy records from each of the 367 
healthcare systems during the 365-day follow-up.  To address complications a and b above: a) [ADDRESS_660194] depleted their 371 
supply, and will exclude days following death.  Inpatient days will not be considered in the 372 
calculation.  Note that at-risk days is medication specific, as medications may change during the 373 
one-year assessment period.  b) We will consider three definitions of PDC: i) Medication- 374 
specific PDC: calculate PDC for each class of medication a patient is prescribed, ii) All- 375 
medication PDC: calculate PDC requiring all prescribed and at-risk medications be available on 376 
a day, and iii) Average PDC: calculate the average PDC across medications the patient is at risk [ADDRESS_660195] one 378 
medication. 379 
380 
Secondary outcomes for clinical events and utilization of care will be captured from the 381 
electronic health records (EHRs) at each of the three health care systems.  Several sources of [ADDRESS_660196] data will be used. To capture costs of development, implementation and maintenance of 383 
the intervention, we will develop instruments (e.g. time logs) and procedures to prospectively [ADDRESS_660197] of implementing the intervention excluding research and development costs. 387 
Medical care costs will be estimated using a resource-based method previously developed to 388 
assign costs to encounter data. Inpatient utilization will be measured using diagnostic-related 389 
groups (DRGs), outpatient utilization using relative value units (RVUs), and cost of pharmacy 390 
utilization using the midpoint between the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and the National [ADDRESS_660198] (NADAC). Inpatient costs will be estimated by [CONTACT_510595] 392 
payment weights to DRGs, outpatient costs by [CONTACT_2931] a national conversion factor to RVUs, 393 
and pharmacy costs as the median between the FSS and NADAC.  394 
395 
Planned Analysis 396 
Analyses will be based on the intent to treat principle, using all patients who were randomized. 397 
398 
Descriptive analyses  399 
Descriptive analyses will be used to describe the cohort and to check for balance across study 400 
arms within strata (clinics and number of other medications prescribed).  Primary outcome PDC 401 
will be calculated during the one-year period following treatment initiation.  Simple descriptive 402 
estimates of each patient’s PDC on each medication will be used for descriptive analyses.  403 
404 
Modeling PDC 405 
Formal analyses will be based on daily data, using a binomial-type model with logistic link for 406 
the number of days covered by [CONTACT_12617], which will be 365 but excluding days not at risk of 407 
depleting as described above.  We will model the three definitions of PDC described above:  408 
409 
i) Medication-specific PDC:  For a given medication class, the model will include fixed effect [ADDRESS_660199]’s tendency to have higher or [ADDRESS_660200] 414 
enough pi[INVESTIGATOR_510583]. 415 
All covariates included in outcome models will also be included in imputation models (see 416 
10 below). The analysis will be carried out using daily data to account for the differing numbers of 417 
at-risk days across patients, and the possibility that the number of other prescribed CV 418 
medications may change during the one year PDC modeling period.  The parameter being 419 
modeled is the probability that a given day is covered, conditional on fixed and random effects.  420 
This approach will account for complications a) varying numbers of at-risk days for different 421 
patients and different medication classes, b) defining PDC when considering multiple 422 
medication classes, c) adjusting for number of other CV medications prescribed, and d) the non- [ADDRESS_660201], the 424 
binomial assumption will not hold and inference will need to be carried out using bootstrap or 425 
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as described below. 426 
427 
ii) All-medication PDC:  Each day for each subject will be coded as whether they have all 428 
prescribed and at-risk medications available or not.  The same modeling process described 429 
above for medication-specific PDC will be used. 430 
431 
iii) Average PDC:  Medication-specific PDC models will be estimated as described above, and [ADDRESS_660202] indicated expressing results on a linear scale (PDC 437 
differences), as opposed to odds ratios or risk ratios, will be most appropriate for interpretation.  [ADDRESS_660203] are estimated from the relevant averages of probabilities.  For example, the estimated 446 
probability of medication availability for a given medication on a given treatment is the average 447 
of all estimated probabilities for all exposed days across all subjects assum ing they received the 448 
specified treatment and were prescribed the specified medication, regardless of which treatment 449 
they actually received and which medication(s) they were actually prescribed.  Contrasts of [ADDRESS_660204], etc.  Similar 459 
standardization methods allow results to be expressed on interpretable scales such as risk 460 
difference.  Data will be analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R software. 461 
462 
Missing data:   Patients with missing data in covariates, treatments (unlikely) or outcomes will be [ADDRESS_660205], and will be used as a 467 
variable in the imputation.  When outcome data cannot be obtained, every effort will be made to 468 
11 document reasons for these missing observations. We will carry out the recommended 469 
sensitivity analyses based on pattern mixture models, by [CONTACT_510596] 470 
in means between observed and unobserved data and assessing differences in model 471 
conclusions. 472 
473 
Secondary analyses of primary outcome:   We will consider several sensitivity analyses.  First, 474 
an alternate estimation appr oach using MCMC instead of maximum likelihood will be considered. 475 
This approach would eliminate the need for bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and would also allow imputation 476 
during the model estimation by [CONTACT_510597] 477 
Bayesian model and estimation.  Second, we will fit mixed linear regression models to the 478 
binary 0/[ADDRESS_660206] several 482 
secondary analyses evaluating a) predictors of patients having an initial gap of at least [ADDRESS_660207] risk for non-adherence; b) predictors of subjects having a [ADDRESS_660208] 7 days whi le enrolled in the study; c) PDC for the individual medication that [ADDRESS_660209] (HTE) by 487 
drug class; and d) analysis of alternate definitions of primary outcome, including time to first gap, 488 
PDC below 0.8, and number of 7-day gaps, during the one year follow-up.  We will also carry 489 
out an analysis to estimate possible HTE between the three health care systems, using an 490 
interaction of treatment arm with health care system. 491 
492 
Health system costs:  This analysis will examine intervention costs and incremental medical [ADDRESS_660210] data will be analyzed using the same methods 494 
described above with factors for study arm and health care system/clinic strata, using [ADDRESS_660211] estimated sample size required to achieve 80% power for the desired change in the 502 
primary outcome, then used current data to show we will be able to achieve this sample size. 503 
504 
Power and sample size:  Required sample size was estimated for the primary outcome PDC 505 
during the 12 months following randomization. Preliminary data from the VA were used for these 506 
estimates.  We made the following assumptions:  a) Significance using two-sided level 0.05 507 
tests, b) Power at least 80%; c) Difference between treatments in PDC of 10 percentage points; 508 
d) Bonferroni adjustment for the 6 pairwise comparisons among the 4 study arms, resulting in 509 
adjusted level 0.05/6; e) Analysis stratified by [CONTACT_510598]; and f) Within-system and [ADDRESS_660212] deviation of 12 month PDC equal to 0.247 (mean 0.771), 511 
obtained by [CONTACT_227976] 594,466 veterans during the period 01/01/2010 – 09/30/2012 who were 512 
prescribed CVD medications. The large SD is due to a highly left-skewed PDC distribution.  (We [ADDRESS_660213] estimates of quantities needed to carry out power simulations.  We may be able to 515 
obtain data for the PDC outcome for a set of baseline patients, in which case we will consider a 516 
refined power analysis.)  Using these assumptions and estimates, and comparing any two [ADDRESS_660214] deviation of PDC, we estimate 518 
using sample size functions in R that we will need N=154 subjects per treatment arm, total 519 
12 across the three health care systems, for a total of 616 subjects to be randomized across the 520 
three health care systems.  521 
522 
Available sample sizes:   We obtained data from each of the three health care systems on the 523 
number of patients at the eight specific clinics (VA, 2 clinics; UCHealth, 4 clinics; DH, 2 clinics) 524 
to be included in this study. Figure 1 below shows estimated numbers of patients seen, 525 
numbers with CVD conditions and prescribed CVD medications, and numbers with 7 day gap.  526 
These patients will be invited to participate, and assuming 80% agree to participate, and 90% of [ADDRESS_660215] ample subjects (about 529 
seven times as many as needed) to achieve the necessary power for the primary analysis of 530 
PDC.  Additional subjects will provide power for secondary analyses, and for analyses of 531 
secondary outcomes. 532

Covid Messaging 536 
537 
On April 6, 2020, the Nudge Study started to send Covid messages to patients enrolled in the 538 
study (Amendment PAM006-1, approved March 18, 2020). 539 
540 
This study plans to scale the concept of the Nudge Study to other applications in the future. We 541 
propose pulling data regarding Covid testing of patients sent messages after April 6, 2020  to 542 
compare with Arm 1 (non interventional arm).   [ADDRESS_660216] in learning more about who is opting out of our study, as well as who 547 
is opting in. 548 
549 
Our study plans to compare the demographics of patients (race, age, ethnicity, gender) that [ADDRESS_660217] opted in vs opted out of our study. This requires pulling data from Electronic Health 551 
records to compare both cohorts.  552 
553 
We propose (12/1/20) to retrospectively pull demographic data from the EHR for patients that [ADDRESS_660218] opted out of the study (race, age, ethnicity, gender) to compare these data with patients [ADDRESS_660219], we  will include a statement in the opt out 556 
packet ( Information Sheet, v 12/1/20 ) to inform potentially-eligible patients that  receive an opt [ADDRESS_660220] conducted similar interviews with patients 563 
following adherence interventions. These interviews will help inform further refinement of the 564 
interventions65 as we plan for broader dissemination of the intervention (if demonstrated to be 565 
effective) to more clinics and patients with other chronic conditions. 566 
Text message survey 567 
We will random ly sample 150 patients across the three sites to participate in a voluntary survey 568 
about their experience with the intervention over the University-hosted Qualtrics platform 569 
13 (https://ucdenver.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5jBlah5rV7tcSoK). The survey will not collect 570 
or solicit any PHI (see Attachment – Satisfaction Survey v 9.23). The sample will be stratified 571 
evenly across patients who received one of the three intervention arms. 572 
Mailed survey 573 
If the response rate of the text messaged surveys is below 20%, the surveys will be mailed out 574 
to patients who previously received the survey via text but did not respond. A $2 incentive will 575 
be included in the mailed packet to encourage responses. An information sheet will be 576 
included to explain the survey and incentive to the patient (Attachment – Information Sheet 577 
v2.23). [ADDRESS_660221] them via telephone to get 582

broadly disseminate the intervention, if effective. PRISM considers important implementation 611 
concepts from Diffusion of Innovations, the Chronic Care Model, the Model for Improvement, 612 
and the RE-AIM framework and highlights four components that influence implementation 613 
success: 1) organizational and participants characteristics; 2) intervention characteristics from 614 
the organizational (health care system and providers) and partici pants’ perspectives (i.e., 615 
patients); 3) implementation and sustainability infrastructure (training and support); and 4) 616 
14 external environment. These four elements will be assessed in a formative manner and will be 617 
critical to understanding how to further disseminate the intervention if demonstrated to be 618 
effective. PRISM also identifies a set of important outcomes from the RE-AIM model (i.e., 619 
Reach and Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) for evaluation. We will 620 
incorporate the assessme nt of the 4 components that influence implementation success into 621 
our evaluation and this will be further discussed in the implementation evaluation section below 622

Stakeholder Panel 651 
Stakeholder engagement in research is an important and challenging task. On one hand, we 652 
want to avoid tokenism and want stakeholders to be as involved as they would like to be. On the 653 
other hand, meaningful engagement can require a substantial time commitment . In a previous 654

changes to the original Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) involve the method used to  model  the 7 
primary PDC outcome, detailed specification of adjustment covariates, and adjustment for 8 
differing lengths of follow -up due to death, chang es in prescriptions , or external disruptions.   No 9 
changes to primary or secondary  outcomes are proposed.   The changes of substance occur  10 
only in Section s 3.1.a-e. 11 
 12 
1. Study summary  13 
 14 
The primary outcome will be medication adherence defined as the proportion of days covered 15 
(PDC) in the [ADDRESS_660246] randomization.  This will be a composite measure across a 16 
patient’s multiple medications and will be assessed using pharmacy refill data. Secondary 17 
outcomes will include intermediate clinical meas ures (e.g., BP control), CV clinical events (e.g., 18 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510587]) and procedures (e.g. PCI), medication -associated 19 
clinical events (e.g., syncope in patient on anti -hypertensive therapy), healthcare utilization, and [ADDRESS_660247] and utilization also 21 
assessed for specific components as described below.  22 
 23 
Study description: This individually randomized three -center trial will compare three behavioral 24 
nudges based on text and chatbot messaging with usual care to improve adherence to 25 
cardiovascular medications.  26 
 27 
Setting:  The study will  be conducted in 17 primary care clinics within 3 health care systems 28 
(University of Colorado Health, VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System, and Denver Health 29 
Medical Center).  30 
 31 
Design: The study will be a n individually  randomized controlled study with four treatment arms  32 
(details of interventions below) .  Patients become eligible for the study when  identified through [ADDRESS_660248] a 7-day gap in any prescribed CV medication refills . Eligible 34 
patients  will be randomized to one of four arms.  Randomization will be stratified within each of 35 
the clinics, and further stratified within clinics  by [CONTACT_23270] 1 -2 vs 3 or more active CV 36 
medi cation classes at baseline , and using blocks of 4 patients to ensure balance within clinics 37 
over time. Thus, within each clinic and number of other medication stratum, each set of 4 38 
consecutively enrolled subjects will be randomized to the four study arms. Treatments will be 39 
initiated im mediately upon randomization, in response to the 7 -day gap.  40 
 41 
Intervention: The four treatment arms will be 1) usual care (control); 2) generic text message 42 
reminder; 3) text message behavioral nudges only; or 4) text message behavioral nudge plus a 43 
pre-programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to identify and resolve barriers to medication 44 
refill and adherence.  45 
 46 
Delivery of treatments will be as follows:  47 
For patients randomized to one of the three active intervention arms:  48 
- If a patient gaps on a medicati on at baseline, they receive a text to refill that medication.  49 
- If a patient gaps on multiple medications at baseline, they receive only one text about all 50 
of the medications they gapped on.  51 
- If a patient later gaps on any study medication, they will receive  a reminder, regardless 52 
of whether they had gapped on or been prescribed the medication at baseline.  53 
- If a patient is removed from a medication, no further texts are sent for that medication.  54 
Patients randomized to the control arm receive no texts  or other reminders . 55 
 56 
2. Study outcomes  57 
 58 
Primary and secondary o utcomes: The study outcomes have been selected based on input 59 
directly elicited from patients and other stakeholders. The primary outcome is adherence to CV 60 
medications as measured by 12 -month composite  proportion of days covered (PDC).  61 
Secondary outcomes include alternate measures of CV medication adherence, clinical events 62 
(e.g., event times for stroke, MI, mortality), utilization of care (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510588] 63 
for CV -related reasons) , and costs of healthcare utilization. Subjects will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_660249] 65 
more than one year of follow -up (up to 3 years depending on when they are enrolled during 66 
years 2 -3) will continue to be followed for secondary outcomes.   67 
 68 
Ascertainment of Outcomes: Data for the primary outcome PDC will be obtained using  69 
pharmacy records from each of the healthcare systems during the 365 -day follow -up. The 70 
medication refill d ata needed to assess PDC is routinely collected in the pharmacy databases of 71 
each of the participating sites.  72 
 73 
During the UG3 phase, the data management workgroup developed definitions and 74 
specifications for the secondary outcomes that will be captured fr om the EHR at each of the 75 
three healthcare systems.  International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth 76 
Revision  (ICD 9 and 10), CPT and DRG codes identifying CV clinical events, CV procedures, [ADDRESS_660250] also been standardized 79 
using NIH Collaboratory definitions for these standardized EHR data elements ( Appendix V) . [ADDRESS_660251] data will be used. To capture costs of development, implementation and 84 
maintenance of the intervention,  we will develop instruments (e.g. time lo gs) and procedures to [ADDRESS_660252] of implementing the intervention excluding research and development costs. Costs 89 
associated with healthcare utilization  will also be estimated using a resource -based method 90 
previously developed to assign costs to encounter data. Inpatient utilization will be measured 91 
using diagnostic -related groups (DRGs), outpatient utilization using relative value units (RVUs), [ADDRESS_660253] of pharmacy utilization using the midpoint between the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) [ADDRESS_660254] (NADAC). Inpatient costs will be estimated by [ADDRESS_660255] error estimation and associated inference based on weighted G eneralized 108 
Estimating Equations (GEE) , e.g. Robins et al., 1995; Preisser et al., 2002 .  In more detail and 109 
with rationale:  110 
Outcome distribution :  Since data are in the form of a discrete proportion, our original 111 
proposal was based on Bernoulli/ binomial models.  However, treatment -blinded examination of 112 
a sample of outcome data show ed that the binomial assumption will not apply due to spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988] 113 
caused by [CONTACT_510601]  (e.g. 30 and 90 days) , and strong overdispersion or 114 
equivalently lack of independence of daily outcome data over time.  We considered alternative 115 
approaches such as Poisson with offset for number of observation days but similar challenges 116 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], overdispersion and lack of indepe ndence remain.  Ultimately, w ith the large number of 117 
subjects available for analysis ( ~10,000 ) and the bounded distribution of PDC (between 0 and 118 
1), central limit theorem arguments make standard linear modeling valid  in this situation  (e.g. 119 
Lumley et al.,  2002 ), and robust inference methods described below provide additional 120 
assurance of valid inference even with heteroscedastic variance in the outcomes . 121 
Missing and truncated follow -up:  Missing data and truncated follow -up for PDC have [ADDRESS_660256]  medications supplied by [CONTACT_941] 123 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510589]’t deplete their own supplies , so such days are omitted from both [ADDRESS_660257] etely at random  (MCAR) , however this is 135 
likely not true for the other cases of early termination of PDC observation .  Further examination 136 
of the treatment -blinded outcome data showed a n increasing trend over time  from time zero  in 137 
PDC during periods shortly after randomi zation, due to the initial gaps.  This together with early 138 
termination could result in biased estimation.  139 
Longitudinal models  and GEE :  To account for the situations of shortened PDC observation [ADDRESS_660258] and likely conservative (Hernán  et al., 143 
2002) estimation using empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477] (sandwich) variance estimates, but  is valid only for MCAR 144 
data.  However,  use of weighting can extend GEE  to data missing at random (MAR) .  In this 145 
approach, observation -specific weights are equal to the inverse pr obability that the longitudinal 146 
value was observed.  Probability of observation will be estimated by a logistic regression model 147 
for whether the value was observed (y/n) , with  covariates listed in section 3.1.c below.   Weights 148 
greater than the 95th percentile of weights will be set to the 95th percentile weight.  These 149 
methods can be implemented for example in SAS PROC  GEE (Lin & Rodriguez, 2015)  or R 150 
package wgeesel  (Xu et al., 2018) .  We will use multiple imputation to impute missing 151 
covariate dat a.  We will carry out the recommended sensitivity analyses to the MAR assumption 152 
using methods based on pattern mixture models  and imputation , by [CONTACT_7702] a range of  153 
perturbations of imputed values and  assessing differences in  model conclusions  (e.g. White et 154 
al., 2011; Fiero et al., 2017 ). 155 
Treatment comparisons :  Discussions with clinicians have indicated expressing results on a 156 
linear scale (PDC differences), as opposed to odds ratios or risk ratios, will be most appropriate [ADDRESS_660259] expected PDC treatment differences .  The estimand 160 
comparisons will be 12 -month PDC, calculated by [CONTACT_476186] 12 monthly longitudinal 161 
parameters, which incorporate the adjustments  for early termination of some subjects using the 162 
weighted GEE approach.  Primary hypotheses involve pairwise comparisons between each of 163 
the four study arms, and will be conducted using a  multistage gatekeeper approach to account  164 
for the multiple treatment comparisons. In stage 1 of this approach, each of the three active 165 
intervention arms is compared with the control arm using significance level 0.05/3. In stage 2, if 166 
any of the three stage 1 tests is significant, the three pairw ise comparisons among active 167 
intervention arms are tested with the Holm method using significance level (R/3)*(0.05/3), where 168 
R is the number of stage 1 tests that were significant  (Dmetrienko et al., 2008 ).  169

3.1.b Defining composite PDC for multiple medi cations  171 
There are 13 CV medication  classe s considered in this study, and t he primary outcome is 172 
composite PDC across medications a patient is prescribed.  There are several considerations in 173 
defining composite PDC, including which of a patient’s medications to include in the composite 174 
PDC calculation , and calculation of composit e PDC with  differing lengths of follow -up for 175 
different medications.  176 
Medications to include in composite PDC:   We have  consider ed three ways of selecting 177 
medications to include in the primary PDC outcome: PDC1) all medications on which a patient 178 
gapped at baseline, PDC2) all medications a patient ever gaps on, calculating PDC from the 179 
time of gap, and PDC3) all medications a patient  was prescribed at baseline.  Medications 180 
prescribed after the baseline gap and enrollment will not be included in any of these definitions 181 
of PDC, though they will be considered in secondary analyses.  Each definition (1 -3) has [ADDRESS_660260] shown that many patients who gap in a medication and are 184 
randomized also gap in another medication shortly thereafter.  Specifically, preliminary data 185 
indica te that ~16% of patients gap on an additional medication within 30 days of baseline and 186 
~37% within [ADDRESS_660261] effects of reminders, but risks inflating PDC and diluting intervention 191 
effects by [CONTACT_510602].  Our primary analyses will use 192 
PDC1, while PDC2 and PDC3 will be considered in secondary analyses.  193 
Composite PDC with differing lengths of follow -up:  In ge neral, PDC is the sum of 194 
observation days covered divided by [CONTACT_510603].  Due to variations from the 195 
planned 365 days of assessment, t here are several ways of calculating composite PDC for 196 
multiple medications.  Information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509], and on medication changes and 197 
cancellations, will be available from the patient’s electronic health record. Note that at -risk days 198 
is medication specific, as medications may change during the one -year assessment period.  Our 199 
primary PDC calculation will be PDC -C1 = (sum of numerators of medication -specific PDCs) / 200 
(sum of denominators of medication -specific PDCs).  This can also be viewed as a weighted 201 
sum of medication -specific PDCs with weights equal to the proportion of the 365 target days for 202 
which PDC was observed, and equally weights each day on each medication.  PDC -C1 will be 203 
the outcome  definition  in the longitudinal models described in section 3.1.a.  As a sensitivity 204 
analysis w e will also consider an alternate definition, PDC -C2 = average of medication -specific 205 
PDCs, which equally weights medications regardless of their length of observation.  When all 206 
medications are observed for 365 days these definitions are equal.   For the longitudinal 207 
analyses planned, these definitions will  be applied within each longitudinal interval.   We will 208 
carry out the recommended sensitivity analyses based on pattern mixture models, by [CONTACT_7702] 209 
various values for difference in means between observed and unobserved data and assessing 210 
differences in mod el conclusions.  211 
 212 
3.1.c Adjustment /propensity  covariates  213 
The linear weighted GEE model for PDC and the logistic model for propensity of observation will 214 
each contain terms for randomization stratification variables health care system (VA, Denver 215 
Health or CUHealth), number of CV medications prescribed at baseline (1 -2 or 3+), calendar 216 
month of randomization ; treatment arm, follow -up month from randomization in longitudinal 217 
analysis , and treatment by [CONTACT_6492] -up month interaction ; patient demographic s age, rac e, 218 
ethnicity, insurance status, and marital status;  and comorbidity variables  hypertension, 219 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, chronic 220 
kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, prior myocardial inf arction, prior revascularization, 221 
depression, PTSD, and substance abuse.  222 
 223 
3.1.d Alternate  measures of medication adherence  224 
We will consider several alternate analyses  for medication adherence .   225 
Alternate definitions of PDC:   Alternate definitions PDC2 and PDC3  and alternate composite [ADDRESS_660262] effects of treatments, 228 
and of effects of treatments on all medications a patient is prescribed.    229 
Sensitivity to inactive medications :  Among medications gappi[INVESTIGATOR_510590], we will  repeat [ADDRESS_660263] . 234 
Medication -specific adherence:   We w ill calculate and analyze PDC for each medication [ADDRESS_660264] (HTE) by [CONTACT_156276] .  Multiple 236 
comparisons will be adjusted for separately for each analysis using the gatekeeper approach 237 
described abov e. 238 
Medication gaps:   We will consider alternate ways of describing medication adherence 239 
behavior,  including length of initial gap, time to subsequent gap, average length of gaps, and 240 
number of 7 -day gaps . 241 
 242 
3.1.e Secondary examinations of medication adherence  243 
In secondary analyses we will examine several other questions related to medication 244 
adherence, including:  245 
Predictors of medication gaps:   We will examine predictors of patients having an initial gap [ADDRESS_660265] 7 days while enrolled in the study . 249 
Mechanism of treatment effects:   We will carry out  analyses examining mechanisms or [ADDRESS_660266] reminder to refill, and measures of patient engagement, e.g. number of patient text  252 
responses to reminders (intensive text and chatbot arms only).  [ADDRESS_660267] :  We will carry out analyses examining HTE, specifically i) 254 
HTE between the three health care systems, and ii) HTE for patient characteristics or subgroups [ADDRESS_660268] estimate sample size required to achieve 80% power for the desired change in the 260 
primary outcome, then used current data to show we will be able to achieve this sample size.  261 
Power and sample size:  Required sample size was e stimated for the primary outcome PDC 262 
during the 12 months following randomization. Preliminary data from the VA were used for these 263 
estimates. We made the following assumptions:  a) Significance using two -sided level 0.05 264 
tests, b) Power at least 80%; c) D ifference between treatments in PDC of 10 percentage points; 265 
d) Bonferroni adjustment for the 6 pairwise comparisons among the 4 study arms, resulting in 266 
adjusted level 0.05/6 (a conservative alternative of the sequential gatekeeper approach to be 267 
used in the final analysis as described above, to simplify the calculation of power); e) Analysis 268 
stratified by [CONTACT_510598]; and f) Within -system and within -treatment residual standard 269 
deviation of 12 month PDC equal to 0.22 (mean 0.732), obtained by [CONTACT_510604] 2,859  veterans 270 
during the period 01/01/2017 – 12/31/[ADDRESS_660269] in 271 
this study. The large SD is due to a highly left -skewed PDC distribution.  (We base sample size [ADDRESS_660270] estimates 273 
of quantities needed to carry out power simulations. We may be able to obtain data for the PDC 274 
outcome for a set of baseline patients, in which case we will consider a refined power analysis.)  [ADDRESS_660271] deviation of PDC, we estimate using sample size 277 
functions in R that we will need N=119 subjects per treatment arm, total across the three health  278 
care systems, for a total of 476 subjects to be randomized across the three health care systems.  279 
Available sample sizes:   We obtained data from each of the three health care systems on 280 
the number of patients at the seventeen specific clinics (VA, 4 clinic s; UCHealth, 5 clinics; DH 8 281 
clinics) to be included in this study. Figure 1, which we believe to present conservative 282 
estimates of enrollment, shows estimated numbers of patients with CVD conditions and 283 
prescribed CVD medications across the 3 HCS. Patient s will be sent a letter with the opportunity 284 
to opt -out. In addition, care providers will be provided lists of their patients who are potentially 285 
eligible for the study to see if there are patients that they feel should not be included in the 286 
study. Assumi ng that 75% of patients have a gap, another 15% of patients opt -out of the study 287 
following randomization, and 10% of patients do not have usable outcome data, we expect to [ADDRESS_660272] usable outcome data for about 7,740 patients across the four study arms.  289 
Plann ed enrollment:   In the patient accrual proposal sent to NHLBI (March 20, 2019), we [ADDRESS_660273] ample subjects (nearly 293 
ten times as many as needed) to achieve the necessary power for the primary analysis of PDC. 294 
Additional subjects will provide power for secondary analyses, and for analyses of secondary 295 
outcomes.  296 
Achieved sample sizes 3/[ADDRESS_660274], etc. Standardization methods allow results to be expressed on interpretable scales such 306 
as risk difference (e.g. Sjolander, 2016).22  Data will be analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 307 
Cary, NC) and R software. In the table below, we provide an estimate of the secondary [ADDRESS_660275] (DH)  Outcomes of

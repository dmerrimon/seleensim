Document Dat e: August 20, [ADDRESS_1219202] causes of perinatal  
morbidity and mortality (ACOG 2013 ). Consequences of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include 
placental abruption, intrauterine growth restriction, seizures, and maternal and infant  death . These 
conditions affect 6 -10% of all  pregnancies, and the rate has increased substantially  over the past several 
decades (James and Nelson -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_5784] 2004 , Kintiraki, Papakatsika et al. 2015 ). Rates of recurrence of 
hypertensive disorders in subsequent pregnancies may be as high as 94%, depending on the type, timing, 
and severity of hypertension in prior pr egnanc ies (Hjartardottir, Leifsson et al. 2006 ). 
Once hypertensive disorders develop, treat ments are limited to watchful waiting, antihypertensive 
medications, or ultimately, early delivery.  Antihypertensive medications may cause drowsiness, risk for 
postpartum depression, and intrauterine growth restriction  (James and Nelson -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_5784] 2004 ). Thus, 
initiating antihyperten sive m edications for mild -moderate hypertension in pregnancy (>140/90 mmHg) 
is controversial as the maternal benefits may not outweigh fetal risks (Scantlebury , Schw artz et al. 2013 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_872806], there are currently no alternatives to pharmacological interventions to 
prevent hypertensi on rec urrence in pregnancy. Thus, non -pharmacological approaches to prevent 
recurrence are sorely needed.  
Mindfulness interventions hold great potential to prevent recurrence in pregnant women with a 
history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Results from p revious RCTs conducted in other 
populations show that mindfulness interventions are significantly more effective at reducing blood  
pressure in patients with pre -hypertension (Hughes, Fresco et al. 2013 ) and hypertension (Nejati, 
Zahiroddin et al. 2015 ) than other stress management interve ntions  (e.g., yoga, progressive muscle 
relaxation). The evidence is more limited among pregnant samples. There is some  evidence that higher 
mindfulness skills are associated with lower blood pressure in healthy pregnant women (Braeken, Jones 
et al. 2017 ). However, traditional mindfulness  training (MT) interventions, requiring 2.[ADDRESS_1219203] udy is to determine if phone -delivered 
MT is feasible and acceptable among pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy.  
In this exploratory cl inical trial we will randomize 3 0 pregnant women  at risk for hypertensive 
disorder s to a n 8-week  phone -delivered MT intervention (N= 15) or treatment as usual (N= 15). All women  
will undergo 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before and  after the intervention. Our 
interdisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to execute the prop osed s tudy given our complementary 
expertise in mindfulness interventions, perinatal mental health, and obstetric medicine.  
The specific aims of the study are:  
Specific Aim 1: To test feasibility and acceptability of phone -delivered mindfulness 
training fo r preg nant women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.  30 
pregnant women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will be recruited and randomly 
assigned to MT (N= 15) or to treatment as usual (N= 15). Primary outcomes are feasi bility  and acceptability 
(>75% attend at least 4 sessions; > 20 on the client satisfaction questionnaire). We will explore 
preliminary effects (not powered for efficacy) of group differences in ambulatory blood pressure  (average 
daytime, nighttime, and diu rnal s ystolic, diastolic blood pressure, hyperbaric index, blood pressure 
variability, and dippi[INVESTIGATOR_21550]). We will also examine  rates of hypertensive disorder recurrence that will 
be fully tested in a future fully -powered RCT.    
Specific Aim 2: Conduct a qualit ative analysis of feasibility and acceptability of phone -
delivered mindfulness training for pregnant women with a history of hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy.  Following the mindfulness intervention, we will conduct individual 
qualitative interview s to s olicit feedback on participants’ treatment satisfaction, motivation for 
 [ADDRESS_1219204].  
Specific Aim 3: To examine differences in pathophysiological mechanisms of 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among women receiving mindfulness training vs. 
usual care . We h ypothesize that pregnant women receiving  mindfulness training will display reduced 
inflammation, improved uterine perfusion and fetal growth, and reduced blood pressure, and these 
mechanisms will in turn reduce risk for hypertensive disorder recurren ce. 
Anticipated Outcomes. Results from this developmental clinical trial will 1) provide  evidence on the 
feasibility and acceptability of delivering phone -delivered mindfulness training for pregnant women at  
risk for hypertensive disorders, 2) evaluate if a prel iminary signal of change in maternal blood pressure is 
detected between groups, 3) evaluate if a preliminary signal of change in pathophysiological mechanisms 
of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is detected  over the course of the study, and 4) sol icit f eedback 
from participants on how to improve the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in future trials. 
These results  will be used to inform a future fully -powered RCT. The results of this line of research are 
significant because MT could  serve  as an effective non -pharmacological preventive intervention for 
hypertensive disorders. Effective preventive interventions hold great promise to reduce the burden of 
disease to individuals and society.  
 
Research Design & Methods  
Phase 1: Recruit Par ticipa nts and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_872807].   Participant recruitment for this study 
will leverage the established infrastructure at the Women’s Medicine Collaborative Research Department. 
The Research Department has 4 research assistants who currently recru it par ticipants for ongoing 
perinatal studies at OBGYN offices throughout Rhode Island that service over 5,000 pregnant 
patients/year. Given that approximately [ADDRESS_1219205] a history of hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy, and we a im to recruit 10% of these women for the current study, we are confident 
that we will be able to enroll N=3 0 pregnant women at risk for  hypertensive disorders of pregnancy for 
this study. The rationale for recruiting pregnant women at risk for  hypertensive  disor ders is based on the 
high rate of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in subsequent pregnancies  (Zhang, Troendle et al. 
2000 ), the high degree of diagnostic overlap among these conditions, and the common medical 
interventions that women with these conditions typi[INVESTIGATOR_128788].  
 
Participants assigned to the MT interven tion w ill receive [ADDRESS_1219206]. Elena Salmoirago -Blotcher, a faculty member in the Brown Center for Mindfulness, 
a certified mindfulness instructor, and an expert in mind -body approaches for cardiovascul ar hea lth, 
developed this intervention. The MT intervention is based upon the curriculum of the Mindfulness -Based 
Stress Reduction program (including practices such as awareness of breath, awareness of body sensations 
(“body scan”), awareness of sounds, em otions , and thoughts, open awareness, as well as cultivating 
mindfulness throughout daily activities). Participants will be asked to practice the mindfulness exercises 
for 15 minutes a day using audio recordings developed by [CONTACT_27156]. Our team has success fully delivered 
this intervention in a sample of pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery.  
 
Phase 2: Quantitative Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability.  Measures of feasibility will include 
recruitment and retention rates, as well as adherence to the in tervention. Specifically, we will measure the 
number of participants screened and eligible to participate, the number and reasons for refusal, the 
number and reason for dropout, and the number lost to follow -up. We will also measure the number of 
MT sessio ns attended and the minutes spent listening to the guided mindfulness practice recordings. The 
study will be considered feasible if > 75% of participants complete > 4 sessions and practice mindfulness 
exercises for 15 minutes a day for > 4 days a wee k. Acc eptability will be measured using the Client 
satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8 (Larsen, Attkisson et al. 1979 )). Scores on the CTQ -8range from 8 -32. 
The study will be co nsider ed acceptable if > 75% of participants report a score of > 20.  
 
SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC.  Secondary Outcome Measurement.  Blood pressure 
will be assessed using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  (ABPM, ScottCare device). This validated 
device (Zawadzki, Vandekar et al. 2013 ) can measure BP eve ry 30 minutes for 24 hours. ScottCare 
 4 
software automatically scores blood pre ssure readings to calculate average daytime, nighttime, and 
diurnal systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, hyperbaric index, blood pressure variability, and dippi[INVESTIGATOR_872808] (BP fa ll > 10% from daytime levels). Prior research demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity of 
ABPM (specifically the hyperbaric index, an index of BP load on organs, blood pressure variability, and 
dippi[INVESTIGATOR_21550]) in the early detection of hypertens ion. Peripheral blood will be collected via venipuncture 
before and after the 8 -week mindfulness or treatment as usual interval. Samples will be de -identified and 
stored for future research purposes. (Participants will c onsent to the collection and banking  of bl ood using 
a separate consent form.) Research u ltrasonography assessments will also be performed before and after 
the [ADDRESS_1219207] linear mixed effects models to evaluate changes in blood pressure 
(dependent variable) according to time, group, and time x group interaction (independent variables).  
 
Phase 3: Qualitative Evaluation of Feasibilit y and Acceptability.  Following the intervention, women will 
be asked to complete in -depth qualitative interviews to solicit feedback on the intervention. Feedback 
from qualitative interviews will be used to identify patterns and themes in participants’ res ponses  that will 
then be used to further tailor and refine the phone -delivered MT intervention for pregnant women with 
histories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in preparation for a future fully -powered RCT.  
 
Recruitment.  A sample of 30 preg nant wo men, a ges 18 -40, before 20 weeks’ gestation  will be recruited 
into the study. Pregnant women from OBGYN  clinics and practices will be recruited through identification 
of eligible women through chart review. Women will also be recruited through placements o f post ers and 
brochures. Other recruitment sites are: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872809], various community sites and community 
groups, community health care groups and community -based newspapers. Interested participants will be 
contact [CONTACT_872822].  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria:  > 18 years old, singleton pregnancy, English speaking, <20 weeks’ gestation 
at enrollment, history of a hypertensive disorder, and no current engagement in min dfulne ss training 
(defined as weekly yoga, mindfulness exercises (including on -line), or meditation). Women will be asked 
to complete a baseline visit  remotely  to obtain background information on maternal characteristics and 
medical conditions in pregnancy . Foll owing the baseline session, women will be randomized to phone -
delivered MT intervention or to treatment as usual. Randomization will be stratified based on 
antihypertensive medication use (yes/no), if necessary.  
 
Procedures  
Initial  Telephone Screeni ng. Interested pregnant women  will complete a telephone screen including 
questions to assess inclusion/exclusion criteria. Visit  1 will then be scheduled with interested participants 
who meet initial inclusion criteria.  
 
Baseline Assessment : NO IN -PERSON RESEAR CH ACTIVITIES WILL TAKE PLACE 
DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC.   Interested and eligible participants from the phone screen will 
be invited to complete the Baseline Assessment  by [CONTACT_165164] . The first session wil l take place 
remotely by [CONTACT_162520] o r video call  and will include informed consent , interview , and self -report 
questionnaire measures . The electronic consent procedure and questionnaires will be performed by [CONTACT_872823], through Lifespan. Paper -forms will always remain an opt ion fo r every participant. All 
the remote research interactions will be completed by [CONTACT_872824], phone calls and secure Redcap based platform. A link to the electronic  consent form , or the 
paper form,  will be e-maile d/mailed  to a participant prior to the phone/ video visit . The consent can then 
be returned by [CONTACT_2319], by [CONTACT_6968], or in person at a later date.  During the COVID19 pandemic, 
participants will complete questionnaires remotely via  paper (mailed in advance o f 
sess ion) and/or  via REDCap  survey .  
 
 [ADDRESS_1219208] messages for them.  In addition, we will obtain information regarding 
two “locato rs,” o r friends or family members wh o will know how to reach the participant. If the interviews 
indicate that the participant is ineligible for continuation in the study, the session may be ter minated at 
that point in time. Women who endorse severe depress ive sy mptoms or psychosis will not be eligible to 
complete the mindfulness intervention, and referrals will be provided . Severe depression or psychosis will 
be defined as the following: Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale score of >25 indicates severe 
depressi on and “threshold” score on one re more on items [ADDRESS_1219209]  approximately 1 hour.  Participa nts wi ll receive $50 for completing the interviews and self -
reports.   
 
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring.  SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC.  
Following the baseline visit, all eligible and enrolled participants will be instructed to complete 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for 24 hours.  Blood pressure will be assessed using ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring  (ABPM, ScottCare device). This validated device (Zawadzki, Vandekar et al. 
2013 ) can measure BP every 30 minutes for 24 hours. ScottCare software automatically scores blood 
pressure readings  to ca lculate average daytime, nighttime, and diurnal systolic, and diastolic blood 
pressure, hyperbaric index, blood pressure variability, and dippi[INVESTIGATOR_21550] (BP fall > 10% from daytime 
levels).  Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_1219210] 10mL (< 1 tablespoon) of blood  collected via venipuncture at Lifespan Laboratories. Blood 
samples will be identified only by [CONTACT_872825] -80° C at the RISE building (TMH) for 
later analysis. Participants will not receive the results of the blood draw. This information is included in 
the informed consent form.  
 
Research Ultrasound.  SUSPENDED DURING COVID [ADDRESS_1219211] their clinical 
anatomy s can. B efore each research ultrasound, participants will be read a “script” that emphasizes that 
research ultrasounds do not take the place of clinical ultrasounds. For research ultrasounds , participants 
will be placed on the ultrasound bed  onto their back in a s emi‐recumbent position, slightly tilted toward 
their left side . For the research studies, we will use ultrasound devices currently in use for clinical 
evaluations.  We will record fetal heart rate, fetal position, placental position and size, and amn iotic fluid 
index according to standard clinical protocols. Next, we will record fetal biometric parameters and 
Doppler measurements of maternal and fetal blood vessels. If the following abnormal findings are 
detected on the research ultrasound, the OB/GYN  provi der will be notified: 1) fetal anomalies, 2) 
estimated fetal weight below 10%, 3) abnormal umbilical blood flow, 4) abnormal levels of amniotic fluid, 
and 5) absent fetal heart rate. Participants will not receive the results of the research ultrasoun ds. Th is 
information is included in the informed consent form.  
 
Randomization.  All participants will receive usual prenatal care, which may include intervention to 
prevent or treat hypertension during gestation.  Following the completion of the baseline ses sion , 
participants will be randomized to  treatment group ( mindfulness t raining  + treatment as usual , or 
treatment as usual ) using a stratified randomization approach  (stratified by [CONTACT_872826]) .  
 
Mindfulness T raining I ntervention  + Treatme nt as Usual . Interested and eligible participants 
from the Baseline Assessment  will be invited to take part in an [ADDRESS_1219212] approximately 30 minutes (4 hours of total intervention) and will be scheduled for a time 
that is convenient for the participant. Mindfulness training sessions will occur once per week. Sessions 
 [ADDRESS_1219213] the same instructor 
throughout the intervention. The 30 minutes will include  20 minutes of intervention  and 10 minutes for 
addressing participants’ questions and scheduling subsequent sessions. Mindfulness training modules 
will i nclude awareness of breath, body scan meditation, and sitting and movement meditation s. Women 
will be provided with recordings of mindfulness exercises to use for practice between sessions . Women 
will be asked to practice mindfulness activities daily  in be tween sessions. Women will be provided with 
audiotapes that will guide their mindfulness exercises. We will ask that women practice for [ADDRESS_1219214] been  to any  prenatal care appointments , and if so, the number and length of time sp ent at  each .  
 
Repeat Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring.  SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 
PANDEMIC . All participants will repeat the 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring after approximately 8 
week s from enrollment  or following completion of the mindfulness interve ntion,  if applicable . The 
procedures for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are identical to those that were completed prior to 
randomization (see above).  Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_1219215] DURING 
THE COVID19 PANDEMIC.  At the follow -up visit  we will ask women to complete same self -report 
measures that were completed at the Baseline Assessment . During the COVID19 pandemic, 
participants will complete ques tionna ires remotely via  paper (mailed in advance) and/or  
REDCap.  We will also obtain updated information about participants’ health throughout the pregnancy, 
including emerging medical conditions and new medications  (“Pregnancy Context_ Follow -Up”) . At the  
final  session, women will be asked to provide feedback about the intervention in individual interviews. 
Interviews include  open questions and learn directly from our participants’ experience. In particular, at 
the follow -up assessment we will ask women about their overall satisfaction with the program, the 
acceptability of the length of sessions, the frequency of sessions, the number of sessions, and the content 
of sessions . This interview session will last  approximately 1 hour.  Participants will be compen sated $50 
for their time.  
 
Peripheral blood draw and specimen banking.  SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 
PANDEMIC.  After the 8 -week mindfulness training +  usual care, or usual care only  interval s, women 
will be asked to provide a peripheral blood sample for specime n bank ing. Participants who consent to 
specimen collection and banking will have 10mL  (< 1 tablespoon) of blood collected via venipuncture at 
Lifespan Laboratories. Blood samples will be identified only by  [CONTACT_872825] -80° C at 
the RIS E buil ding (TMH) for later analysis.  
 
Research Ultrasound.   SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC.   After the 8 -week 
mindfulness training + usual care or usual care only intervals , research ultrasound procedures identical to 
those prior to randomization will be per formed . We will again make every effort to time the research 
ultrasounds to coincide with clinical ultrasounds. We will only perform a follow -up research ultrasound 
that does not coincide with a clinical ultrasound if the clinical ultrasound is sched uled a t a time when the 
mindfulness intervention is still underway, or if the clinical ultrasound is scheduled for greater than [ADDRESS_1219216] pregnancy -specific  problems (i.e., gestational diabetes, cervical insufficiency), maternal infection, 
and medications in pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and previous experience with mindfulness and/or 
stress management interventions. Pregnancy Context_Follow -Up: At the fol low-up visit participants will 
be asked to provide updated information on their pregnancy including new diagnoses and medications.  
Health Behaviors:  Women will provide information on weekly cigarette and alcohol use by [CONTACT_872827] -back I nterview (Sobell and Sobell 1992 ). Preeclampsia symptom screen:  Particip ants will 
be asked to report if they have experienced symptoms of preeclampsia at each study visit and each 
mindfulness session.  Self-Report Measures:  Women will be asked to report on past experiences of 
childhood trauma ( MACE ) at the baseline sessio n. Wom en will be asked to complete self -report measures 
of stress (Perceived Stress Scale), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Pregnancy -Specific 
Anxiety), and Mindfulness ( Five Facets of Mindfulness  Scale , Multidimensional Assessment of 
Interocep tive A wareness ) at the baseline session and following the intervention. We will also ask women 
to complete a measure of perceived sleep quality (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]) , quality of life (Quality 
of Life Measure), and PCL -5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM -5) at the baseline and follow -up sessions. At the 
follow -up session we will ask women to provide feedback about the intervention ( Intervention  Satisfaction 
Questions).  See Table [ADDRESS_1219217] of measures and tim ing of administration.

Risk of discovering symptoms consistent w ith a psychiatric disorder.   Because we are asking women to 
complete questionnaires regarding depression and anxiety symptoms, we may be more likely to discover a

Indices of abnormal fetal growth  may be detected at ultrasound sessions.  
SUSPENDED DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC . Risk of research ultrasound.  Ultrasound imaging is 
based on mechanical sound waves (non -ionizing radiation) so it doesn’t have the same risks as X -rays or 
other types of imag ing sy stems such as MRI. Ultrasound imaging is generally considered safe when used 
prudently by [CONTACT_872829]. Ultrasound energy does have the potential to 
heat tissues slightly or produce small pockets of gas in body fluids/t issues  and corresponding bioeffects 
have been described in animal models. No bioeffects have been reported in humans or in human fetuses, 
however, when exposures are be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).

SUSPEND ED DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC . Discovery of elevated blood pressure. If 
elevated blood pressure readings (> 140 /90) are recorded during in-laboratory or ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring, the participant’s prenatal care provider will be notified imme diatel y after the study 
team is aware of the elevated reading(s) . If blood pressure measurements are 160/110 or higher, 
participants will be instructed to go to the emergency room.  Participants would also be instructed to go to 
the emergency room i f the ob /gyn p rovider advises it. Participants will be aware that elevated blood 
pressure readings will be communicated to their prenatal care provider. This information is included in 
the informed consent form.  
 
Detection of symptoms consistent with preeclampsia . Wome n will be asked to report on 
symptoms of preeclampsia at each study visit as well as at each phone -delivered mindfulness session. If a 
participant endorses PEC symptoms , their provider will be immediately notified by [CONTACT_648]. The trained 
research assis tant a nd mindfulness instructor will indicate that they are calling on behalf of the 
 9 
participant due to a medical emergency. The participant will also be instructed to call their provider. If 
neither the participant nor the research staff are able to speak  with a provider, the participant will be 
instructed to go to an emergency room for evaluation.  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent. Written informed consent (including a description of the 
nature, purpose, risks, and benefits of the study) will be obtained from i ndividuals who express interest in 
participating. Participants will also provide release of information from medical records for the purpose of 
determining birth outcomes following delivery. The voluntary nature of the study and the participant’s 
right to withdrawal at any time will be emphasized during the consent process; this information will be 
provided to participants in written form at the time of consent.  
 
Embarrassment from interview or self -report measures:   To ease any potential discomfort, the 
research staff will be trained to interview in a comfortable non -judgmental manner. Additionally, women  
will have the option to stop the interview at any time, or to decline to complete any of the self -report 
measures. Finally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_872811] d any discomfort not be alleviated during or after the 
interview/self -report.   
 
Risk of discovering symptoms consistent with a psychiatric disorder:   Because we are asking 
women to report on symptoms of  depression and anxiety, we may be more likely to dis cover a 
psychologi cal disorder .  For all participants who endorse elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety, the 
RA or [CONTACT_872846] will provide referrals and information regarding treatment options. We will also send a 
note to the participant’s OBGY N to i nform them of the patient’s elevated symptoms. In the event that a 
study participant endorses suicidal ideation,  the interviewer will complete a lethality assessment, will 
consult with [CONTACT_872846] to for mulate a course of action, and will consult wit h the participant’s care 
provider. Appropriate intervention or follow -up care will be arranged with the treating clinician or, if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029], through emergency serv ices. If real risk of harm to self or others is identified, 
we will remain with t he participant until an emergency intervention can be planned and implemented.  
Standard procedures include explaining (and re -explaining) all upcoming procedures to participants and 
conveying a strong attitude of caring, flexibility, and individuali zed at tention to participant. Should a 
subject ask to discontinue participation, or should staff detect an elevated level of distress, ongoing 
procedures will be halted immediately and a decision will be made in conjunction with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_872812] t’s ab ility to continue in the protocol. Subjects are reminded throughout the course of the study 
that they are free to terminate their participation at any time.  
 
Risk of discovering current domestic violence or abuse.  If participants report current dome stic 
violence or abuse , they will be provided with information on follow up testing and medical care (see 
brochure from Day One). They will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_872830], an 
organization that provides treatment, intervention, educat ion, advocacy, and prevention services to 
Rhode Islanders of all ages. They can call the Day One [ADDRESS_1219220] techniques and

Venipuncture will be performed by a phlebotomist, physician or nurse experienced in drawi ng blo od to 
minimize risk of discomfort.  Risk of d etection of abnormal fetal parameters.  Measurements of 
fetal growth and vascular parameters will be collected at  research  ultrasound sessions. If the following 
abnormal findings are detected on the research  ultra sound, we will alert the OB/GYN provider: 1) fetal 
anomalies, 2) estimated fetal weight below 10%, 3) abnormal umbilical blood flow, 4) abnormal levels of 
amniotic fluid, and 5) absent fetal heart rate. The prenatal care provider who will then determ ine wh ether 
follow up with a clinical ultrasound is needed. Ultrasound and Doppler studies are routine clinical tests 
with no significant risks attached to them (Bhid e, Ach arya et al. 2013 ). Moreover,  assessment of uterine  
and umbilical artery by [CONTACT_872831], by [CONTACT_872832] l research 
committees (Khalil, Gordijn et al. 2019 , Myatt, Redman et al. 2014 ), as research  standard an d non -invasive

method to evaluate   placenta function. The reason is that abnormalities of the placenta  and abnormal blood 
flow of the placental vessels usually occur before clinical onset of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction 
(Baschat 2011 , Velauthar, Plana et al. 2014 ).  Normal reference ranges of  fetal and maternal arterial 
Doppler parameters have bee n publ ished, including normal reference ranges of maternal uterine artery 
from  11 to 41 weeks' gestation  (Baschat and Gembruch 2003 , Brown, Di Luzio et al. 1998 , Gomez, 
Figueras et al. 2008 ). 
 
For the research studies, we will use ultrasound devices currently in use for clinical evaluations. Per national 
and intern ationa l guidelines  (Bhide, Acharya et al. 2013 , Holt and Abramowicz 2017 ), when performing 
Doppler, mechanical (MI) and thermal (TI) indices will be displayed on the ultrasound screen. We will 
maintain T1 ≤ 1 and the exposure time will be kept as short as possible (Bhide, Acharya et al. 2013 ). 
Participants will be positioned on their back, leaning to the left, with a wedge or pi[INVESTIGATOR_872814].  
 
With respect to threats t o conf identiality and integrity of the data , the followin g procedures will be in 
place:  
 
Confidentiality Safeguards.   To minimize any risk of accidental disclosure of confidential information 
about the project, all work described herein will be conducted w ith ut most regard to confidentiality. The 
Women’s Medicine Collaborative Research Department , a locked facility where all data entry will take 
place, has instituted a number of plans to safeguard subject confidentiality.  First, all data entry from the 
experimen t will take place directly in our facility . All staff involved with the project will receive training in 
confidentiality, and will sign a work agreement that states that a breach of confidentiality will be grounds 
for immediate dismissal. Second, a l og of participants will be locked in the PI’s research office at the 
Women’s Medicine Collaborative . This log will also be sto red on a computer in a password -protected file 
with access only by [CONTACT_4144].  Otherwise, all  information obtained from  parti cipants  will be 
identified with random research numbers rather than names. All identifying information will be removed 
from the data file after the subject has completed the study (or dropped out from participation).  All data 
materials will be k ept in loc ked file cabinets in the  locked research facility.  The study database will be 
stored on Lifespan  computers with access only by [CONTACT_4144].  Questionnaires and interview 
data will be kept in a locked filing cabinet. Consent forms will be st ored i n a separate locked filing cabinet, 
and will not be linked with subject numbers.  All computers at the research  facility are password protected 
with backup to a secure server.  Data analysis will take place on computers at the Women’s Medicine 
Collab orativ e. All computer files and written reports and papers will not identify subjects or make 
identification possible. We are confident that these precautions effectively minimize the risk of accidental 
or willful disclosure of confidential information.  
 
Potenti al Benefits of the Proposed Research:  
Previous research provides supportive evidence that mindfulness interventions may effectively reduce 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnant women . Therefore, we believe that one benefit of 
partic ipatin g may be that participants who receive mindfulness training could experience fewer symptoms 
of psychological distress.  
 
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained:  
The results of the proposed study will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility a nd acc eptability of 
a phone -delivered mindfulness training intervention for pregnant women at risk for hypertension 
disorders . Results will also provide evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention at reducing 
psychological symptoms of distress in pre gnancy . Finally, results may provide  preliminary  evidence on 
the usefulness of such interventions on reducing rates of hypertension in at -risk women. We expect that 
these benefits will outweigh potential risks to participants.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring P lan:   
[CONTACT_872846] will have primary responsibility for monitoring all participants. Any adverse events, breaks of 
confidentiality, or any other data or safety issues that arise will be immediately brought to th e attention of 
the RIH IRB . [CONTACT_872846] will b e resp onsible for completing an Adverse Events Form should an event 
occur. She will report Se rious Adverse Events to the IRB  within 24 hours of having received notice of the 
event.  Adverse event reports will be reviewed a nnually with RIH  IRB to ensure part icipan t safety. In the 
 11 
event that a study participant endorses suicidal ideation during an interview,  the interviewer will 
complete a lethality assessment, will consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_872815] a course of action, and, with written 
permission, will consult  with the participant’s care provider. Appropriate intervention or follow -up care 
will be arranged with the treating clinician or, if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029], through emergency services at 
Butler , The Miriam,  or Rhode Island hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 12 
Statistical App roach  
 
Randomization.  We will use a stratified randomization procedure to assign participants to 
mindfulness training  vs. usual care based on medications for hypertension. The randomization 
scheme will be generated based on a permuted block randomization p rocedure with small 
random sized blo cks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_872833] (yes/no).   
Sample size considerations.  The proposed sample size was estimated to have sufficient power to 
assess feasibility and acceptability, as well as  to provide a reasonable sample with which to 
estimate effect sizes and confidence intervals for secondary outcome s. We propose to enroll 30 
participants in a 1:[ADDRESS_1219221] more than sufficient power (>80%) to detect acceptability differences in the 
small -medium range, d=0.45/w=.2 .  
Missing data.  All analyses will be on the intent -to-treat sample under various assumptions about 
the missing data mechanism. Sensitivity to t hese assumptions will be tested.  
Blinding.  Study staff conducting the baseline and follow -up evaluations will be blinded to 
women’s randomized group assignment. Pathologist examining placental histopathology will be 
blind to treatment condition.  
Treatmen t Fidel ity. Mindfulness training  sessions will be audiotaped to assess  treatment fidelity. 
Treatment fidelity checklists for each mindfulness session were previously developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Salmoirago -Blotcher and will be used to monitor reliability, validity, an d fidel ity of the 
mindfulness training  intervention.

2. Explanation of Procedures  
If you decide to be part of the study and are selected, you will participate in a study visit in 
which we will ask you some questions about your pregnancy, your symptoms of psychological 
stress before and during pregnancy, and your health. Study procedures  will be done remotely. 
This means that you may be asked to complete some interview questions during a phone call or 
during a video call. You will be asked to complete questionnaires on paper or through an 
electronic survey. Before starting any remote inte raction, a person from the research team will 
explain to you all the details of the remote interaction, such as type of  technology needed and 
will provide answers to all the questions you may have. For the research remote procedures, the 
research team will  use only the technologies approved by [CONTACT_872835]/IT.  
 
After you complete the first study visit, you will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_872836] 8 week phone -delivered mindfulness intervention (in addition to usual prenatal care), 
or to continue to receive your usual prenatal care. This means you have a 50% chance of 
 [ADDRESS_1219224]

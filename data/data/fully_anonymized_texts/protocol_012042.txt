  3 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
Many women fail to return to their pre -pregnancy weight postpartum (i.e., postpartum weight 
retention, PPWR).5-[ADDRESS_158313] PPWR interventions involve high participant burden 
and fail to sufficiently address both the psychological (e.g., low self- efficacy) and material (e.g., food 
insecurity) barriers and needs of low -income, minority women.31-[ADDRESS_158314] and further refine  in a future pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
An estimated 60 -75% of women fail to return to their pre -pregnancy weight (i.e., postpartum weight 
retention, PPWR) and up to 60% of women actually gain weight postpartum.  5-10 PPWR and 
interpregnancy weight gain are important predictors of long -term obesity risk .11-13 Women of lower 
socioeconomic status and from racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected13 and 
represent “priority populations” (i.e., those deserving priority in public health and clinical efforts).48 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_139428],13 Black women are estimated to retain an 
average of 6.4 pounds more and are twice as likely to retain more than 20 pounds at 1 -year postpartum 
compared to their White counterparts.14,15 Additionally, there is evidence of racial/ethnic differences in 
weight trajectories postpartum. On average, Black and White women lose similar amounts of weight across the first 6 weeks to 3 months postpartum, after which Black women exhibit gains in weig ht and 
body mass index (BMI) from [ADDRESS_158315] also been shown to be an increased risk of PPWR.5,7 This is extremely concerning, as excess weight 
retention or weight gain following pregnancy may be particularly harmful, given evidence of preferential 
central fat deposition postpartum.51-53 Visceral adipose tissue, which is associated with several 
cardiometabolic risk factors,54,55 is estimated to increase by 30 -45% in the first year postpartum.51-[ADDRESS_158316] important short - and long- term health implications.51,52,56,57 
PPWR and interpregnancy weight gain not only alter a woman’s future chronic disease trajectory, increasing the risk for new or worsening obesity,
11,12,[ADDRESS_158317] intensive behavioral interventions, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_139429], improving diet, and/or increasing physical activity, have had limited success for PPWR, 
particularly among women with obesity.29-32,60 Based on meta -analyses, <2.[ADDRESS_158318] care.29,30,32 Lifestyle interventions 
for PPWR also show high levels of attrition and poor intervention adherence.29-32,60 The postpartum 
period is important not only for maternal weight management and long -term obesity risk, but also for 
preparing women for healthy subsequent pregnancies as part of preconception planning. Entering 
subsequent pregnancies with excess adiposity  increases the risk for PPWR,10,27 creating a cycle in which 
women accrue additional weight with each pregnancy, leading to new or worsening obesity.27 Exposure 
to maternal overweight/obesity in utero, in turn, increases the child’s subsequent risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_139430],
61,[ADDRESS_158319] postpartum weight management interventions are intensive, comprehensive, and involve high 
participant burden by [CONTACT_139445] (e.g., self-regulation, time, financial means, access to healthy food s).
32,33 Such interventions may not adequately 
address social determinants of health (SDH; e.g., income, education, race/ethnicity, access to care, residential environment) that contribute to disparities in PPWR and obesity in priority populations.
[ADDRESS_158320] PPWR interventions also fail to address psychological (e.g., stress, low self- efficacy) and material 
(e.g., food insecurity, transportation) barriers of low -income and minority women.31-36 Achieving 
meaningful behavior change may be especially challenging postpartum, as women face additional 
stressors and barriers including lack of time for cooking/shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], limited access to healthy food, and 
lack of basic cooking skills.31,34- 36,68- [ADDRESS_158321] more perceived barriers and 
lower self- efficacy to healthy behavior change postpartum.70 A simplified approach targeting a few key 
behaviors may be particularly well- suited for under -resourced  populations.71 Also, postpartum weight 
management strategies are needed that more effectively address insufficient and/or diminished effort and resources, which is particularly relevant for priority populations.  
 Meal delivery overcomes many barriers common to postpartum weight management interventions that disproportionately burden priority populations. The provision of prepared meals to women’s homes offers access to healthy food, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a physical and  financial resource to support healthy 
eating regardless of income, geographic location, or access to transportation. Meal delivery reduces time and effort involved for meal planning, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and preparation and requires less cognitive and 
behavioral self -regulation. In addition, pre -portioned meals modify the home food environment, which 
can support healthy habit formation and improve weight outcomes.

cardiovascular disease).

maternal weight management postpartum to be offered as a covered health care service, thereby [CONTACT_139446].  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
This study involves providing a healthy meal delivery intervention to promote weight loss among  low-
income mothers  who are 5 -45 weeks postpartum. Those with conditions that may put them at increased 
risk or unique nutritional needs that would make the meal delivery intervention inadvisable will be 
excluded.  Although unlikely, participants may experience normal and temporary physiologic reactions or 
weight fluctuations associated with healthy dietary changes, such as flatulence (frequency: rare; severity: mi ld). There is a risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to meals, which is judged to be low as 
participants self-select meals from provided menus with ingredients. Additionally,
 participants will be 
asked to report any food allergies or intolerances at baseline  and the PI (who is a registered dietitian)  
will work with the study’s meal delivery partner to accommodate participant food allergies and intolerances, as needed. Participants will also be provided with m eal plans designed by [CONTACT_978] ( who is a 
Regis tered and Licensed Dietitian ) in accordance with current micronutrient and macronutrient 
recommendations for postpartum women. Participants will be instructed to self- weigh at least once per 
week during the study intervention using a study -provided scale and  will be asked to report their weekly 
weight measurements using a Qualtrics  survey sent via email each week of the study intervention. 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  6 Concerning weight fluctuations (e.g., weight gain) will be reported to and reviewed by [CONTACT_978]. 
Concerning weight fluctuations will be investigated and adjustments will be made to meal plans or study procedures, if necessary. Participants will also be closely monitored for any negative effects relating to the meal delivery intervention. Should it be determined that continued participation is contraindicated 
for a participant, they will be withdrawn from the study. Given that this is a non -invasive meal deliv ery 
intervention for postpartum weight management, we do not anticipate that withdrawals will be 
common. There is a risk of foodborne illness with meal delivery which is judged to be low as  we are 
partnering with an experienced meal delivery company that operates in compliance with local, state, and federal food safety regulations. All meals will be delivered in insulated packaging with frozen gel packs to keep food cold in transit and meal delivery times will be scheduled with participants. In compliance w ith the Alabama Department of Public Health, home -delivered meals can be safely stored 
in the refrigerator for 7 days. Thus, fully prepared, refrigerated meals will be delivered once per week to participants’ homes. All meals will also come with re -heating  instructions. In the unlikely event a 
participant experiences distress from completing any of the self- report surveys, she will be allowed to 
skip items or discontinue the assessment.  There is a low risk of emotional or psychological discomfort 
from participants answering personal questions about their health, eating , and activity behaviors.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_158324] mental and physical health benefits 
postpartum.  
 
Meal delivery may reduce postpartum weight retention and improve cardiometabolic health management, diet quality, food security, stress, and reduce barriers to healthy eating postpartum. This is important give that approximately 60 -75% of women fail to ret urn to their pre -pregnancy weight (i.e., 
postpartum weight retention) and many women gain weight postpartum. Postpartum weight retention and interpregnancy weight gain are important predictors of long- term obesity risk. Postpartum weight 
retention and inte rpregnancy weight gain negatively impact maternal cardiometabolic health and 
increase risk for adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies which are more common among Black women and those of lower socioeconomic status. Black and lower income women are also  
disproportionately burdened by [CONTACT_139447], which further increases the risk for postpartum weight retention, interpregnancy weight gain, and adverse health outcomes. To -date, traditional diet and 
weight management programs for postpartum women have been larg ely unsuccessful. Thus, promotion 
of healthy diet and postpartum weight loss may improve these outcomes. Participation in this study may enhance our understanding of meal delivery as a strategy for improving maternal health among underserved populations. G iven the health risks associated with postpartum weight retention and 
interpregnancy weight gain, and the challenges of successful weight management postpartum, such information is clinically relevant and has potential for public health impact. Ultimately,  results could 
inform public policy to leverage programs and/or modify insurance coverage to promote sustainability, which would have a meaningful public health impact on both short and long- term maternal health.  
  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  7 3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  
This is a single -group intervention trial in which mothers who are 5 -45 weeks postpartum and enroll in 
the trial will receive 10 meals per week for a total of 8 -weeks.  
 Potentially eligible participants will be primarily recruited through the  UAB Center for Women’s 
Reproductive Health (CWRH). CWRH nursing staff will prescreen medical records of participants who 
delivered at UAB. Potentially eligible women will be approached in the postpartum recovery unit following delivery or at their 6 -week postpartum appointment by a CWRH research nurse and told about 
the study. Interested women who meet initial eligibility criteria will be contact[CONTACT_139448] 5 -45 
weeks postpartum to complete a secondary pre- screening via telephone to confirm eligibility.  
Supplemental recruitment will occur via flyers/ads distributed at UAB obstetrics/gynecological offices, UAB pediatrics clinics, UAB lactation centers, UAB Nurse Family Partnership, local day care centers and churches, local breastfeeding and/or parent support groups, and Birmingham neighborhood 
assoc iations. Interested women will respond via phone call or email to the public advertisements and be 
screened by [CONTACT_648].  
 
Interested and eligible women will be scheduled to attend an Enrollment/Baseline Assessment visit during which informed consent  will be completed. Those who consent to enroll in the study will then 
complete baseline study measurements including surveys and anthropometrics.  
 Within [ADDRESS_158325] study meal 
delivery order. All participants will receive the study meal delivery intervention for a total of 8 -weeks.  
During the study intervention, participants will be emailed a weekly Qualtrics survey to complete to 
report intervention adherence.  
 
During the final week of the study meal delivery intervention, participants will complete Follow -up 
(week 8) assessment visit measurements, including surveys and anthropometrics .

4.3 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Interested women  who do not meet study inclusion criteria will be informed of this decision by [CONTACT_139449] . 
 
4.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment will primarily occur through UAB Center for Women’s Reproductive Health (CWRH) 
inpatient research staff. For this, CWRH inpatient clinical research staff will perform chart reviews of women on the postpartum recovery unit (following delivery)  or who are attending their 6 -week 
postpartum checkup (6th floor of the Women and Infants Center). Participants who meet initial eligibility criteria based on the chart review will be approached by a CWRH inpatient research staff member to briefly tell the  potential participant about the study, give them a study flyer, and assess 
initial interest. Because enrollment will not occur until participants are [ADDRESS_158328] -delivery, 
participants who are interested when approached by [CONTACT_139450] H inpatient research staff will be asked to give 
their permission to be contact[CONTACT_139451] 5 -45 weeks postpartum to remind them about the 
study/confirm they are still interested in participating. Participant contact [CONTACT_139452] p articipants who opt -in to being contact[CONTACT_139453] 5 –45-week postpartum 
enrollment window by [CONTACT_464]. When potential participants recruited through the CWRH inpatient 
research staff are [ADDRESS_158329] -delivery, they will complete a sec ondary pre -screening by [CONTACT_139454]. Supplemental recruitment will occur via flyers/ads distributed at UAB obstetrics/gynecological offices, UAB pediatrics clinics, UAB lactation centers, UAB Nurse Family Partnership, local day care ce nters and churches, local breastfeeding and/or parent support groups, and 
Birmingham neighborhood associations. Interested women will respond via phone call or email to the public advertisements and be screened by [CONTACT_648].  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  9 While participants will receive  10 free meals/week for the duration of the 8 -weeks study, we will employ  
strategies (implemented with participants in both intervention arms) that we have found effective for 
retention , including: (1) providing gift cards of $ 40 for completion of baseline and follow -up data 
collection visits , with incentives paid after each assessment; (2) ensuring frequent contacts with 
participants through weekly check -ins to not only obtain meal orders but also  maintain engagement and 
foster open communication; and (3) providing reminder phone calls before scheduled study visits . 
  
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
5.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 After completing baseline data collection , all participants will receive 10 fully prepared  lunch/dinner -
style meals per week for a total of [ADDRESS_158330] meal orders weekly with study staff who will submit orders to the meal delivery partner. During these weekly contacts, trained 
staff also provide brief behavioral support, including evidence -based strategies of problem -solving, 
action -planning, and p rinciples of motivational interviewing to help participan ts identify and navigate 
adherence barriers.
87-91 Staff will document the duration and topi[INVESTIGATOR_139431]. Each week of the 
intervention, participants will be automatically sent an electronic survey to report the number of study -
provided meals consumed by [CONTACT_4317] (versus others in the household  versus thrown out ), as we 
understand meals may be shared in food insecure households. The study coordinator will be available 
when collecting weekly meal orders to help participants navigate these challenges in multi- member 
households. If a participant does not place their weekly order, study staff will select meals based on participant preferences and allergies collected at baseline. Meals will be delivered once per week to participants’ homes, which is in compliance with the Alabama Department of Public Health guidelines.  
 To supplement provided meals, p articipants will be given a study scale and instructed to weigh 
themselves at least once per week and report their weekly weight measurement on an automated weekly electronic survey . The study coordinator will monitor participant weights and report any 
concerning weight fluctuations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63124] a Registered Dietitian and can make adjustments to participant meal plans as needed to support health y weight loss postpartum.  This weight measurement 
will also allow study staff to track participant weight gain  across the intervention as the goal is to 
support participants in los ing 0.5 to 1 kg (or 1 to 2.2 pounds) of weight per week. To support adherence 
to the 0.5 to 1 kg (i.e., 1 to 2.2 pound) per week weight loss, participants will be given a Weight Tracking Sheet handout to help them track their weekly weight loss. Staff will also keep a Weight Tracking Sheet 
for each participant. To support the healthy integration of study meals within participants’ diets to promote 0.5 to 1 kg/week (i.e., 1 to 2.2 pounds/week) weight loss, participants will be given  a variety of 
written meal plans corresponding to their individual calorie goal, as well as relevant tools (i.e., measuring cups, portion size guides) to support use of meal plans, portion control, and appropriate integration of prepared meals into participant’s diets. Calories goals will be calculated using the USDA Dietary Reference Intake Calculator for Medical Professionals

5.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 Participants in the study receive 10 lunch/dinner -style meals per week delivered to their homes free of 
charge for a total of [ADDRESS_158332] meals based on participant  preferences and allergies collected at baseline  to ensure they receive 
meals each week. Each week of the intervention, participants will be automatically sent an electronic 
survey to report the number of study -provided  meals consumed by [CONTACT_4317] (versus others in the 
household  versus thrown out ).

DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 Participants will continue to receive the study intervention for the 8- weeks study . The study 
intervention may be discontinued for a participant if a clinical adverse event (AE) or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study intervention would not be in 
the best interest of the subject.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_158335]  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a subject  from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance

  11 • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
subject  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form, receive the study intervention , and subsequently 
withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the study, will not be replaced.  
6.[ADDRESS_158336]  fails to be available for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact [CONTACT_139455]/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every effort 
to regain contact [CONTACT_1155]  (where possible, [ADDRESS_158337] ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
[CONTACT_9300] ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 All study participants will complete 2 in -person study assessments: 1) Enrollment/Baseline Visit and 2) 
Week 8 Follow- up Visit. During the 8 -week meal delivery intervention, participants will also be sent a 
weekly electronic survey to report adherence with consuming the study meals ( the number of study -
provided meals consumed by [CONTACT_4317] [ versus others in the household  versus thrown out])  and to 
self- report their last weight measurement.  
 
Enrollment/Baseline Visit : This visit will take place when participants are [ADDRESS_158338] -delivery. 
Participants will come to the study laboratory and  the visit will take approximately 2 -2.5 hours. Staff will 
review the consent form in detail with the potential participant and answer all of their questions. After providing informed consent to participate in the study, the Baseline Visit will continue with the 
completion of the following:  
  
Weight and height measurements : Participant weight and height will be measured.  
  
Questionnaires : At the Baseline Visit (i.e., Study Visit 1), participants will complete the following 
questionnaires:

24-hour diet recalls : Participant 24 -hour dietary recalls will be collected using the Automated Self-
administered 24 -hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24). For this, participants will be asked to report 
everything they had to eat and drink during the previous day (from midnight -to-midnight) including 
any dietary supplements. The diet recall will take approximately [ADDRESS_158339] them with completing 2 additional dietary recalls after Study Visit 1. For this, in the 1 -2 weeks following Study

report their weekly wei ght measurement on the weekly Qualtrics survey. As part of the weekly emailed 
Qualtrics survey, participants will also be asked to report intervention adherence (e.g., number of study 
meals they ate versus others  versus that they threw away ), adverse events (e.g., flatulence, new or 
worsening gastroesophageal reflux), and satisfaction with the study meals.  Staff will complete weekly 
calls with participants  to obtain their meal orders  and to complete  a brief check -in to see on how they 
are doing and utilize motivational interviewing techniques to help women who are struggling to comply 
with the intervention to problem -solve and develop weekly goals . Staff will document the duration and

Semi -structured, one -on-one interview : Participants will complete a semi- structured, one -on-one 
interview with a member of the research team. These one- on-one interviews (lasting up to 60 
minutes) will be conducted using an interview guide. Interviews will be audio -recorded, transcribed 
verba tim, and the file will be erased after the transcripts have been verified for completeness. The 
transcription will not have any identifiable data included as participants will use anonymous names 
or nicknames during the  interview sessions. The recording will be stopped at the end of the 
interview.  
 
24-hour diet recalls (Follow -Up): Participants will be contact[CONTACT_8644] [ADDRESS_158343] 2 weeks of the study intervention  (e.g., when 
participants are still receiving the meal delivery intervention) using the same procedures as described for the  Baseline Visit. Briefly, the 24 -hour recalls will either be completed directly by 
[CONTACT_139457]24 system or will be completed over the phone with study staff (and study staff will enter participant recall information into A SA24). Participants will be asked to report 
everything they had to eat and drink during the previous day (from midnight -to-midnight) including 
any dietary supplements. Each diet recall will take approximately [ADDRESS_158344] them on how

7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) , the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious .” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_139458]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR 2025 
  15 • Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset,  or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits or via weekly electronic surveys sent to participants during the study 
intervention which asks participants to report potenti al AEs . 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The Study Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will inquire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_158345] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless t here is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  16 study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_139433]. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
7.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  17 8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of the 
study meal delivery intervention . Hypothesis 1: We will successfully achieve >80% intervention 
adherence, defined as consuming at least 80% of received study meals, during the 8 -week 
intervention.  
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  The secondary aim is to characterize the acceptability of the 
study meal delivery intervention. Hypothesis 2a: We will collect data to characterize study 
participation rate  and achieve <20% attrition. Hypothesis 2b: Participant reported diet 
satisfaction will show improvements from baseline to follow -up. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_158346] estimates 
based on small pi[INVESTIGATOR_139434].
96 Instead, 
we followed recommendations from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) that sample sizes for feasibility studies should be based on “practical considerations including participant flow, budgetary constraints, and the number of participants needed  to reasonably evaluate 
feasibility goals.” With these considerations in mind, the present study aimed to recruit a minimum of 10 participants and up to 20 participants based on the available budget . This was a single -group trial 
with the primary goal being to obtain process data and preliminary data to inform intervention refinements before pursuing funding for subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
 
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
8.3.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
At each time of measurement, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic 
characteristics and process measures , including rates of study participant, retention, and intervention 
adherence . Average  values of outcome measures (e.g., diet satisfaction) will be calculated for baseline 
and follow -up. No formal statistical analyses will be conducted as this was a single group feasibility study 
that was not designed to be powered to detect statistical significance.   
 
8.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
For the primary endpoint of participant intervention adherence, the proportion of weekly study meals  
that participants reported a)they consumed, b) other household members consumed, and c) that were thrown away/uneaten will be calculated based on completed weekly electronic surveys.  
 
8.3.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
For secondary endpoints, study participation rate (p ercentage of eligible subjects who agreed to 
participate out of those who were screened ) and retention rate (percentage  of enrolled participants 
Postpartum Meal Study  Version 1.0 
 10 APR  2025 
  18 who complete follow -up) will be calculated and reported. Visual representation of the flow of 
participants through the study will be reported through a CONSORT diagram. Change in participant 
satisfaction with the diet will be reported as the mean total diet satisfaction score, as well as the mean scores on subscales for Cost Factor and Planning & Preparation Factor, at baseline and follow -up will be 
reported.

8.3.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
Rates and severity of adverse events will be summarized using descriptive statistic s. 
 
8.3.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 
At baseline, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics and outcome 
measures by [CONTACT_139459].

9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
subject  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting study screening 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.
 Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. T he 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
proc edures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subjects.  Subject s will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The 
subject s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about 
it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject  will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject s must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the subject s for their records. The informed consent 
process will be cond ucted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form 
signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the 
subject s will be protected by [CONTACT_132441].

Title of Research:Feasibility of a meal delivery intervention for postpartum weight 
management
UAB IRB Protocol #:IRB-300010155
Principal Investigator:[INVESTIGATOR_139440], PhD, RDN, LDN
Sponsor:UAB Obesity Health Disparities Research Center
General Information You are being asked to take part in a research study. This research study is 
voluntary, meaning you do not have to take part in it. The procedures, risks, and 
benefits are fully described further in the consent form.
Purpose The purpose of the study is to test if a meal delivery program helps postpartum 
women like you have healthier diets and lose weight after having a baby.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for up to 11 weeks.
Overview of Procedures This study will include 2 assessment study visits: one at the start of the study 
when you are 5-[ADDRESS_158369]-delivery and another about 8 weeks later. Within 
two weeks of each visit, a study member will call you three times to ask you about 
everything you had to eat/drink the day before to learn about your diet. At both 
visits, you will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about your health, stress, 
activity level, and sleep. Within 1-[ADDRESS_158370] which meals you want from Nourish Kitchen’s weekly rotating menu of meal 
options. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], which is an initial small scale study to understand if the meal delivery program as 
we have designed it is well-liked and works for postpartum women. Therefore, we will also ask you to give us 
your feedback on how you like the meal delivery program and what changes you would like to see us make if 
we do more meal delivery programs like this in the future. You may want to talk about the study with your 
family, friends, or medical provider. If you do not understand parts of this form, please ask questions. This

University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) clinic.
Study Participation & Procedures
If you agree to join the study, you will be asked to complete 2 study visits: 1) at the beginning of the study 
when you are 5-[ADDRESS_158372]-delivery and 2) the second about [ADDRESS_158373] study visit, you will begin receiving 10 study-provided meals per week delivered to your 
home. These meals will be provided to you free of charge and you will get to choose your study meals from 
Nourish Kitchen’s rotating weekly menu. You will receive study meals for a total of 8 weeks. While you are 
receiving study meals, we will send you a brief electronic survey to complete once per week and call you each 
week to check-in on how you are doing and to get your meal delivery order for the next week.  We describe all 
of these components of the study in detail, below.
Study Visit 1: When you are 5-[ADDRESS_158374] study assessment visit. This visit will take about 2 to 2 ½ hours. We will go over the consent form. If you 
agree to be in the study, we will measure your weight and height to be sure you are eligible. You will complete 
a series of surveys asking you about your health, work and education, usual sleep habits and stress, food 
insecurity, diet, and physical activity. You will also be asked to complete 3 diet recalls to tell us about what you 
had to eat the day before: 1 recall will be done at Study Visit 1 and the other 2 diet recalls can be done on the 
computer at home or by [CONTACT_97266] a research staff member in the 1-2 weeks after Study Visit 1. We 
estimate the total time you will spend completing the 2 diet recalls at home will be about 1 to 1 ½ hours.
Study Meal Delivery Program: All 20 women who enroll in the study will receive the study meal delivery 
program. So, if you agree to be in the study, you will begin receiving the study meal delivery program after you 
complete Study Visit 1 (including the telephone diet recalls). You will begin receiving [ADDRESS_158375] information (name, phone number, email address, address where you want your meals delivered) will 
be shared with Nourish Kitchen and their staff so that they can schedule and deliver your study meals to your 
home each week. Nourish Kitchen publishes their menus, which change weekly, with ingredients on their 
website which you can use to help you decide which meals you want each week. Study staff will then place 
your meal order for you with Nourish Kitchen. Study meals will be delivered to you once per week by [CONTACT_139465]. All study meals come with nutritional information and the ingredient list, as well as re-heating 
instructions. Meal expi[INVESTIGATOR_139441]. You will also be given a 
variety of example meal plans to help show you what types of foods you should be eating outside of the study-
provided meals and a weight tracking sheet to help you gradually lose weight postpartum.
Each week of the study meal delivery program, you will be sent an electronic survey to complete to confirm 
you received your [ADDRESS_158376] week’s meals you ate and how much you 
enjoyed them, and to report any issues you think the meals are causing you (for instance, if you feel gassy after 
eating a study meal). At Study Visit 1, you will be given a weighing scale and asked to weigh yourself once per 
week during the study and to report your weekly weight as part of the weekly electronic survey. This is to help 
make sure that you are losing a healthy amount of weight postpartum while receiving the study meal delivery 
program.

FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24Study Visit 2: During the last week of the study meal delivery program, you will be scheduled to come to the 
UAB Medical Towers Building to complete the second (and final) study visit. This study visit will take about 2 to 
2 ½ hours. We will measure your weight and you will be asked to complete a series of surveys (similar to Study 
Visit 1) and to participate in a one-on-one interview with a member of the research team. In the 1-2 weeks 
before your scheduled Study Visit 2, you will be asked to complete 3 diet recalls to tell us about what you had 
to eat the day before. We estimate the time you will spend completing the 3 telephone diet recalls will be

the study meal delivery program, experience in the study meal delivery program, including program 
structure, delivery, and other resources, program engagement, ideas for future improvements, and 
additional information you want to provide that you think would be helpful for us to know. Your 
interview will take about 30-[ADDRESS_158378] of the audio recording will be typed. The written reports from the 
recording will give researchers helpful information to understand your and other participants’ 
experiences in the study meal delivery program and how to improve future meal delivery programs 
like this one. 
Medical Record Data: As part of this study, we will retrieve medical records from your most recent pregnancy. 
The information study investigators will receive from your medical records include the date and your 
gestational age at your first dating ultrasound during your most recent pregnancy; the date and your 
gestational age and weight from your first and last prenatal care visit for your most recent pregnancy; your 
gestational age when you gave birth; your weight at delivery; and information about your pregnancy/birth 
outcomes (including whether you were diagnosed with any medical condition during your pregnancy such as 
gestational diabetes or preeclampsia and whether you baby [CONTACT_139468]).
If you are currently or have used any illicit (street) drug(s) during your most recent pregnancy, we ask that you 
not participate in this study.
Additional Information:
Your de-identified private information (private information with all identifiers removed) may be used for 
future research studies or distributed to another researcher for future research studies without additional 
informed consent. This is only when there are no identifiers associated with the data.
Risks and Discomforts
The risks to you for participating in this study are judged to be low.
While unlikely, you may experience normal, temporary reactions associated with making new healthy 
diet changes, such as gastrointestinal discomfort or flatulence.
There is a risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to meals, but this is judged to be very low since you 
will be selecting your meals each week from menus with ingredients provided by [CONTACT_139469].
Page 5 of 9
FOR206 Version Date: 03/12/24There is a risk of foodborne illness with meal delivery, which is judged to be low as we are using an 
experienced company (Nourish Kitchen) that operates in compliance with local, state, and federal food 
safety regulations. All meals will be kept cold in transit and delivery times will be scheduled with you to 
ensure meals do not sit out too long. Meals also come with reheating instructions and are marked 
clearly with their expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].
Some questions on the study surveys ask about personal information, such as income and information 
about your health.  There is a small risk that you will feel uncomfortable or not want to answer these 
questions.  If this happens, you can choose to skip any questions at any time.
We will have to share your name, phone number, email address, and the address where you want your 
study meals delivered with a private meal delivery company we are contracting to provide study 
meals, Nourish Kitchen. By [CONTACT_4907], your name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_139470]. As such, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality associated with the information we provide to 
Nourish Kitchen. Only necessary information to provide you with the study meal delivery will be 
shared with Nourish Kitchen (this information is limited to your name, phone number, email address, 
and the address where you want your meal delivered). 
There is a risk of potential loss of privacy and confidentiality. This risk is small. We will take precautions 
to minimize this risk and assure confidentiality of data managed and stored at UAB. All self-reported 
questionnaire responses will only be identified by [CONTACT_79166]. All interviews will be audio-recorded and 
transcribed but your name [CONTACT_139477]. You do have the options to choose an 
anonymous name [CONTACT_139478]. All data collected during this study 
will be securely stored as paper records in locked storage cabinets as well as electronic records. All 
electronic records will be stored on a secure, password-protected server. Only staff involved in the 
project will have access to records related to this research study.
Information for Women of Childbearing Potential, Nursing Mothers, and/or Men Capable of Fathering a 
Child
To be eligible to participate in this study, you must have had a baby [CONTACT_139471] 5-45 weeks. The study is 
specifically designed for and targeting postpartum women. The provision of 10 healthy meals per week does 
not cause any extra risk to mothers who may be nursing.
Benefits
You may benefit from participating in this study, as all participants in the study will receive 10 healthy meals 
per week. These meals may make it easier for you to eat a healthier diet and lose weight after having a baby. 
Providing you with 10 meals per week free of charge may help you feel less stress by [CONTACT_139472], grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and preparing meals; giving you access to healthier foods; and improving your 
food security (not having to worry about having enough food). Together, a healthier diet and less stress could 
have some benefits to your mental and physical health postpartum.
Because not much is known about how meal delivery postpartum can benefit mom’s health, your participation 
in this study may provide valuable information to the medical community to help us better understand if meal 
delivery-based programs could be used to improve mom’s weight and health after having a baby.
Alternatives
Your alternative is to not participate in this study.

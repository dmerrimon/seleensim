PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515834] ~16,000 n ewborns /year in the [LOCATION_002] and have  lasting adverse impacts on affected 
children and their families . About 15% of newborns with seizures die, and at least 50% of survivors have one 
or more long -term disability, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]1. Many survivors 
require costly lifelong therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as well as social and academic support. More than 20% develop epi[INVESTIGATOR_408932] f irst [ADDRESS_515835] epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], a history of neonatal seizures is a major risk factor for non -remittance ( lack of 
complete response to medications)4. As such, neonatal seizures have a major impact, not only on the health of 
newborn infants, but also on their long -term neurological morbidity and chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y [Criterion 1].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_193827] -ranging impacts of seizures in the newborn, alarmingly significant knowledge gaps persist 
[RQ-1]. The current management paradigm for neonatal seizures is to treat clinical events, with or without 
confirmation of EEG seizures, which can lead to both under - and over -treatment. Phenobarbital, the most 
commonly prescribed anticonvulsant, is  often maintain ed for several months because of  clinicians’ and parents’  
concern that early discontinuation of medicine might cause seizures to recur5. However, continued exposure to 
phenobarbital is sedating, which may prol ong the time it takes for a newborn  to establish oral feeding, and this 
medicine may have deleterious long -term effects on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]6,7. Preliminary evidence suggests that 
early discontinuation of medication is not harmful,5,6,[ADDRESS_515836], to guide  key decision -
making for clinicians and families of these highly vulnerably 
infants.  This patient -centered approach highlights the main 
concerns of >[ADDRESS_515837] of anticonvulsant treatment on parent/family well -being . A few 
studies have focused on parents’ experience after their infant’s discharge home from the NICU9. Parents of 
preterm and term infants may experience apprehension, lack of confidence, and have a deep sense of 
responsibility for their infant’s medical and developmental care. They are acutely aware of their infant’s special 
needs, but seek to develop a se nse of normalcy for their family and over time gain perspective about their 
experience. However, approximately one -third of parents will experience post -traumatic stress (PTSD) related 
to their child’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and this has a negative impact on the  family10,11. It is unknown whether ongoing 
anticonvulsant treatment contributes to difficulties in parent and family functioning.  
According to the FDA and NINDS, understanding the best  management for neonatal seizures is a priority.  In 
2005 and 2007, the FDA and NINDS sponsored workshops on improving treatment of neonatal seizures. There 
was a consensus that “ high priorities for research included investigations to understand adverse effects of [anti -
seizure medications] and… to determine the relationship between efficacy for seizure suppression and long -
term outcome ”12. Nearly [ADDRESS_515838] failed 
to answer important questions.  In 2009, the NICHD funded a multi -center, randomized, double blind, placebo -
controlled trial  to examine the very question we pose  by [CONTACT_409021] d 
within 7 days to receive phenobarbital or placebo for four months (PROPHENO, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Although 
adequate numbers of potential subjects were identified, a high proportion of parents at every participating 
center refused to consent, and the study was closed early after enrolling only 13 neonates.  We conclude that 
another randomized trial is not feasible. Yet, a well -conceived, large -scale observational study with a “The question of… how long to continue 
phenobarbital after neonatal seizures is one that 
weighs heavily on families.”

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515839]. Guillet (PROPHENO’s PI) is a consultant  for 
our proposal and has endorsed the present study’s sci entific design. The clinical question, family centered 
design, and comparative effectiveness methods that we now propose are well aligned with PCORI priorities.  
The Neonatal Seizure Registry  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_408933]) is an established, multi -center collaborative of top pediatric 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408934] a comparative effectiveness study. The Neonatal Seizu re Registry  was established in 2012 
with seed funding from the Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408935]. Unique among neonatal seizure studies, 
the Neonatal Seizure Registry  is enrolling newborns  at 7 American Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], all of which  have the 
capa bility to perform long -term neonatal EEG monitoring and world -class pediatric neurology follow -up. The 
Neonatal Seizure Registry  has collected data on more than [ADDRESS_515840] personal health information (PHI), or to follow patients prospectively for neurodevelopmental 
outcomes. With funding from PCORI, we will prospectively gather consent from families to  allow collection of 
important PHI, and to initiate standardized follow up including EEG studies, neurodevelopmental evaluations, 
assessment s for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , and measures of parent and family well-being .  
Due to  the dearth of evidence, substantial practice variability continues for neonatal seizures. Among [ADDRESS_515841] two 
main clinical practices: 1) short duration (whereby [CONTACT_409022][INVESTIGATOR_307]); 
versus 2) prolonged d uration (whereby [CONTACT_409023] e first outpatient follow -up, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] 2 -4 months of age). Among the newborns  enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry , 23% had 
medication discontinued prior to discharge (range by [CONTACT_3725] : 3-75%), while 77% continued on seizure medication . 
Phenobarbital  was the most common ly prescribed anticonvulsant (89 % of those maintained on medications). 
Although the Neonatal Seizure Registry  sites are similar in patient acuity and conditions treated, the approach 
to neonatal seizures differs across sites and between  providers at each site. In adjusted analyses that include 
seizure etiology, seizure burden, and maximum phenobarbital levels, the study site  was the only independent 
predictor of discharge to home with continued seizure medication  after resolution of acut e symptomatic 
neonatal seizures  (p<0.001) . The present proposal will take advantage of this heterogeneity in practice to fill 
critical knowledge gaps regarding appropriate treatment duration for neonatal seizures.  
 
B. Significance  
Seizures affect ~16,000 newborns /year in the [LOCATION_002]. Neonatal  seizures can have substantial, lasting 
adverse impacts, not only for the affected children, but also for their parents and siblings. Seizures in neonates 
carry a high mortality rate, and at least 50% of survivor s have one or more long -term disability, such as cerebral 
palsy, intellectual disability, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]1 [Criterion 1]. For any major health condition, understanding the 
correct treatment choice and the ideal length of treatment is critical. Phenobarbital has been the mainstay of 
neonatal seizure  treatment for decades, even though it is incompletely effective and has substantial side 
effects. How long to treat a baby [CONTACT_409024]  [RQ-1], and this leads to 
significant practice variability5. This variability is clearly reflected in preliminary data from the Neonatal Seizure 
Registry  – odds of discharge without medication vary substantially by [CONTACT_3885] (p<0.001).  Animal models and 
observational studies of human neonates raise concern that ongoing seizures harm the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]13. Yet, 
prolonged treatment with phenobarbital may have neurodevelopmental consequences6,7. Our proposal  is 
designed to determine whether the duration of treatment  has an impact on long -term neurodevelopment and 
the incidence of post -neonatal epi[INVESTIGATOR_408936]. The results are expected to bring about 
substantial changes in clinical care, and  will lead to meaningful improvements in healthcare and outcomes for 
newborns  with acute symptomatic seizures. [Criterion 2 ; RQ -3]  
The questions we seek to add ress through this proposal are highly relevant to parents  [Criterion 4] . With 
our collaborators  at Hand toHold .org, our Parent Partner Libby [CONTACT_409025] a survey requesting parent input 
regarding the impact of neonatal seizures , the effect of seizures and their treatment  on families, and research

   4 priorities for neonatal seizures. Within 7 days, 1 53 parents responded. On a scale of 0 to 10 (0= no impact, 10= 
very significant impact), parents responded that neonatal seizures had a major effect on their famili es (mean 
7.8±3.2 out of 10) and, importantly, that medications to treat seizures were almost as impactful as the seizures 
themselves (rated 6.7±3.0). Of 81 parents  who typed in their infants’ treatments, 7 3 indicated their infant 
received phenobarbital. Pa rents indicated major concerns about medication side effects and worries  about 
long term effects of medications on neurodevelopment.  In free text responses,  72 provided feedback on 
priorities for research. M any highlighted the duration of therapy as a  top priority research topic – “Does the 
child need to contin ue on meds and for how long?” “D o transient seizures… warrant the same preventative 
treat ment?” “A re we over medicating these babies to prevent something t hat might never even happen?” “H ow 
fast shou ld medicine be weaned?”  
Furthermore, respondents wrote  that sedating medications have an impact on the whole family. From one 
mother: “ Luckily they took pi[INVESTIGATOR_408937] I was able to see her eyes, but I did not see them 
in person until she reopened them around 1 month… ” [CONTACT_221225] [CONTACT_276453], a Parent Partner  who is both a pediatrician 
in training and the mother of an infant with neonatal seizures, wrote: “ getting home and trying to get into a 
routine of what will become the new normal for our family was definitely important. It's hard to bond with your 
baby (and probably therefore hard to foster his/her development) in a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit].” 
We presented the proposed study to the  Patient and Family 
Research Council at the University of Michigan’s Child Health 
Evaluation and Research Unit (CHEAR, www.chear.org) . The 
council consists of patients and parents of patients with a variety 
of childhood  conditions who review research proposals and 
provide feedback to investigators so that they may incorporate 
patient and family perspectives into their research design. 
Parents and patients were unanimous in their support of the proposed study question, de sign, and outcome 
measures . [Criterion 4]  
 
C. Study Design or Approach  
Specific Aims  
Neonatal seizures that are due to brain injury (acute symptomatic seizures) are difficult to treat, harm the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866], and are associated with long -term neurodevelopmental disabilities, including intellectual 
disabilities, autism, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and cerebral palsy1. Although acute symptomatic seizures are self -limited in the 
neonatal period, ≥20% of patients will go on to develop epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  (the neonatal seizures resolve, but the infant 
develops recurrent,  unprovoked seizures  later in life ) and  the highest risk is in the first year of life. 
Recommendations for immediate treatment of neonatal seizures are based largely on pre -clinical studies which 
show that seizures are  injurious to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_408938], neuronal loss, and 
excitability13-16. Howev er, traditional and commonly used anticonvulsant medications, such as phenobarbital, 
are potentially neurotoxic17 and are associated with lower cognitive scores when used long -term6,7. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
phenobarbital, the most commonly prescribed first line medication18, is often administered for up to several 
months, even without electrographic confirmation of seizures5. A randomized, controlled trial to examine the 
risks and benefits of continued treatment with phenobarbital following resolution of acute symptomatic 
seizures (PROPHENO - [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) failed due to lack of enr ollment. The fundamental management question 
of how long to treat seizures in the neonatal period remains unanswered. Thus, a large -scale observational 
study is urgently needed, to inform the critical decision regarding duration of treatment for acute symp tomatic 
neonatal seizures19.  
Our long -term goal  is to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes following acute symptomatic seizures in 
newborns . The objective of this application  is to examine whether the duration of treatment with 
phenobarbital has an impact on neurodevelopmental and epi[INVESTIGATOR_236733], as well as parent and family well -
being, after neonatal seizures. Our collaborative research team has established the Neonatal Seizure Registry  - 
a multi -center association of institutions across the United S tates - and has partnered with P arent  Partners  and “[The proposed study] allows individual 
doctors and families to make individual 
decisions, and still lets the researchers learn 
the information we need.”

   5 NICU Patient & Parent Advocacy groups  to develop the patient centered questions and outcomes outlined in 
this application.  
We will take advantage of heterogeneity of treatment duration for acute symptomatic seizures within our 
Registry  to determine the co mparative effectiveness  of two common approaches to phenobarbital prescription 
for treatment of neonatal seizures for 300 enrolled neonates: (1) short duration of treatment (discontinuation 
of medication  prior to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and (2) prolonged  duration of treatment (discontinuation of 
medication  at the time of outpatient follow -up, after discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). Importantly, based on specific 
stakeholder feedback, we will also examine parental and family well -being in both treatment plans. The  central 
hypothesis  of this application is th at th e duration of medical management has no impact on 
neurodevelopmental outcome or the development of post -neonatal epi[INVESTIGATOR_408939] c neonatal 
seizures (Aim 1 ) but is associated with NICU length  of stay (Aim 2)  and parent  and family well -being (Aim 3) .  
 
Aim 1 : To determine whether short versus  prolonged phenobarbital treatment affects (a) 
neurodevelopmental outcome, and (b) incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_408940] 24-months.  
Hypothesis : There will be no differences in (a) functional developmental outcome, or (b) incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_408941] ( i.e., seizure medication discontinued prior to discharge 
home ) and prolonged phenobarbital t reatment ( i.e., medication continu ed until the time of the first clinical 
follow up appointment), and results of an electroencephalogram (EEG) during convalescence can be used to 
predict the risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
Approach : Cohort study of 300 neonates with seizures due to acute symptomatic causes ( e.g. hypoxic -ischemic 
encephalopathy [HIE], stroke, etc.), 150 who are newly enrolled and 1 50 who were previously enrolled into the 
Neonatal Seizure Registry  at one of the established sites across th e [LOCATION_002]. We propose a p ropensity 
adjusted, non -inferiority, comparative effectiveness study  of the longitudinal cohort enrolled using (a) the 
Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA FS) - a simple, free, one -page 
assessment to determine functional outcome20 - and (b) a simple questionnaire3 to define incidence and 
modified Engel classification21 to determine severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]; all assessments at 12 , 18, & 24 months of age. 
Functional developmental outcome will be  the primary outcome for this proposal.  
 
Aim 2 : To determine whether duration of phenobarbital treatment  during the NICU admission  affects length 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408942] – a factor highlighted by [CONTACT_409026] -being.  
Hypothesis : Longer duration of inpatient phenobarbital treatment is associated with a longer length of stay.  
Approach : Adjusted linear regression analysis of the cohort enrolled in  Aim 1.  
 
Aim 3 : To determine whether short versus  prolonged treatment affects parent and family well -being . 
Hypothesis : Shorter treatment duration is associated with improved parent and family well -being.  
Approach : For this exploratory parent s takeholder -initiated  aim, we will use a parallel convergent mixed 
methods approach  to compare quantitative  and qualitative data on parent and family well -being between 
groups and over time.  With o ur Parent Partner s, we  selected a set of validated instruments to  measur e parent 
and family psychosocial dimensions, including measures of parent quality of life, anxiety and depression, family 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], parent post -traumatic stress and post -traumatic growth. Our Parent Partners also helped us to design a 
set of open -ended free -text questions to explore the scientific impact of seizure medication on parent and 
family well -being. Data will be collected at four  time points: at discharge , 12 months , 18 months, and 24 
months  after discharge.  
 
  We anticipate that  this proposal will yield the following expected outcomes : Outstanding  data 
with which to develop evidence -based , rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -disseminated  management guidelines that 
address the questions that matter most to parents regarding treatment duration of neonatal 
seizures. These results  will have an important positive impact  on infants with neonatal seizures, 
their families , and providers who care for these patients . If giving more phenobarbital does not 
change the risk of developmental delay  or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and is acceptable to families, then this study 
will provide key evidence that shorter treatment duration  is safe . In that case, a practice change 
to shorter treatment duration will eliminate unnecessary exposure to medication. The data 
generated from this study will , for the first time,  allow clinicians and parents to make evidence -
based decisions regarding duration of treatment.

   6 Research Strategy [Criterion 3]  
Overview of study design . This is a prospective, 
observational cohort study to examine the 
comparative effectiveness of short versus  
prolonged treatment of neonatal seizures due to 
an acute symptomatic cause . To permit causal 
inference with an observational study design, w e 
will use a propensity score analysis approach . 
This will  account for baseline patient 
chara cteristics that influence  treatment duration 
recommendations.  For infants with comparable 
propensity scores, the distribution of observed 
baseline covaria tes will be similar between the 
treatment groups.22,23 
Newb orns and their families will be enrolled  at 
the seven tertiary children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408943] . Preliminary 
data from the Neonatal Seizure Registry indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity in treatment, such that 
som e neonates  with acute symptomatic seizures are treated for a short duration  (seizure medication 
discontinued prior to discharge home) and some neonates are treated for prolonged duration  (medication 
continued until follow up evaluation at 2 -4 months of age or longer), and that this is largely independent of the 
seizure etiology and severity  and most related to study center (p<0.001) . Through this proposal, we will obtain 
consent to study outcomes for 1 50 infants  already enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry  who are still young 
enough to permit prospective 24-month outcome assessment , and will prospectively enroll an additional 150 
newborns  with acute symptomatic neonatal seizures. Thes e infants  will be enrolled prior to discharge from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408944] 2 -4 months and by [CONTACT_409027] -up questionnaires at age 12 , 
18, and 24 months. Validated p arent  and family  well-being instruments will be administered at the time of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408945] 12 -month , 18-month, and 24 -month  follow -ups (Figure 1 ). 
The study team is uniqu ely qualified to conduct cutting -edge comparative effectiveness research for 
neonatal seizures.  The co -PIs are highly respected 
neonatal neurologists with active research programs that 
are directly relevant to the present proposal and a track 
record of high quality multidisciplinary research. They 
have enlisted experienced parent partners and 
stakeh older  collaborators who have both personal and 
professional experience with research and with neonatal 
seizures. The team of co -investigators completes this 
multidisciplinary team, to insure that the work proposed is conducted with the highest level of pat ient-
centeredness, robust study design, and valid statistical analyses.  
Subject identificat ion, selection and recruitment [ PC-2]. Study personnel at each site will review daily 
admissions to the Intensive Care Nursery, Pediatric and Cardiac Intensive Care  Units, as well as records of 
patients monitored with long -term EEG, to identify eligible infants. Neonatal seizures affect newborns of both 
genders and all races and ethnicities. Therefore, no patient will be excluded on the basis of gender, race or 
ethni city. A study investigator will contact [CONTACT_7903]/legal guardians of eligible patients and, using a consent 
form approved by [CONTACT_186616], describe the known risks and benefits of the study. The 
consent teams will include only exp erienced study personnel who are sensitive to the vulnerable nature of this 
population and who will emphasize the voluntary nature of research. All site PIs have extensive experience 
with patient recruitment for clinical trials and cohort studies. We expec t high rates of enrolment based on 
feed back from our P arent  Partners  regarding the importance of the question and the low risk observational 
nature of the study . A representative sample of 150previously enrolled infants who are young enough allow for

participation in this study. Once a family agrees to participate, study personnel will begin data collection. For 
prospectively enrolled infants, p lans for follow -up appointments will be initiated prior to the family’s discharge 
home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Infants at each site are eligible for clinical follow up as outpatients through their 
respective Pediatric  Neurology Clinics and High -Risk Newborn Follow -up Pr ograms, which will help with

Operations, clinical research forms, and consent forms during the first month of the study period. Site 
investigators from participating cen ters and our Parent Partner s will be invited to provide feedback in writing 
and/or during a teleconference, and the PIs will incorporate this feedback prior to finalizin g the documents. For 
the parent and family well -being aim (Aim 3), our co -investigator [CONTACT_409058] will work with our  Parent Partner s 
to refine  the co-developed  protocol for measuring parent and family psychosocial dimensions, including 
administering the validated instruments at the time of i nitial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408948] 12 -month , 18-month,

Selection of comparators [RQ-5]. The primary comparator will be duration of medication use for the treatment 
of acute symptomatic seizures.  
 As described in our analysis below, we will examine duration of phenobarbital as follows:  
o Treatment as a dichotomous predictor (short versus  prolonged, Aims 1 & 3)  
o Treatment as a continuous predictor (Aim 2)  
 
The selected comparators are relevant to clinicians.  The current management paradigm is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_408954], however some clinicians discontinue medication immediately 
after resolution of seizures (typi[INVESTIGATOR_55225] 72 -96 hours). The rationale for early disco ntinuation is based on 
preliminary evidence, which suggests that early discontinuation of medication is not harmful. Furthermore, 
continued exposure to phenobarbital is sedating, which may prolong the time it takes for a newborn  to 
establish oral feeding, and may have deleterious long -term effects on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]5,6,8. Since 85% of 
term neonates with acute symptomatic seizures are discharge d home by 1 month of age ( Neonatal Seizure 
Registry  unpublished data), and follow up is typi[INVESTIGATOR_408955] [ADDRESS_515843] on the whole family. From a parent whose child had 
neonatal s eizures: “The decision about continuing phenobarbital weighed heavily on [our family]… was the 
medicine I was giving my child really for the best?”  The 1 53 respondents to our  online  parent survey 
overwhelmingly indicated concerns regarding immediate side e ffects (especially sedation) and long -term 
outcomes (epi[INVESTIGATOR_408956]) for their children who had been treated for neonatal seizures. This was 
confirmed during  focus group discussions with our Parent Partners.  
 
Preliminary data suggest adequate het erogeneity in clinical practice to examine short versus  prolonged 
phenobarbital duration within our established multi -center registry.  Unpublished data from our Neonatal 
Seizure Registry  indicate heterogeneity for neonatal seizure treatment . Among 306 cons ecutive  newborn s 
enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry  for acute symptomatic seizures who survived to discharge, 2 3% had 
medication discontinued prior to discharge (range by [CONTACT_3725] 3 to 75 %), while 7 7% continued on anticonvulsants.  
In multivariate analyses, treating institution  was the only independent predictor of continued medication after 
discharge to hom e (p<0.001); neither seizure burden nor etiology of acute symptomatic seizures predicted this 
treatment decision (p>0.1) . Pheno barbital was the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsant (8 9% of those

Outcome selection [RQ-6]. Our proposed outcome measures are all highly relevant to parent stakeholders. 
Primary outcome.  After discussion with Parent Partners, we selected t he Warner Initial Developmental 
Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA FS), a simple, free, one -page assessment that will be 
administered by [CONTACT_409029] 12 , 18, and 24 month s to determine functional developmental ou tcome (Aim 
1a).20 In order to administer the WIDEA FS, the examiner (who is blinded to the treatment group) asks the 
parent a series of questions to determine which specific development al milestones have been gained in the 
following domains: Feeding, Dressing, Diaper Awareness, Mobility, Communication, and Social Cognition. The 
results are tabulated and scored against norms for age for children ages [ADDRESS_515844]. Rogers (Co -Preliminary data from the Neonatal Seizure Registry  support two main patterns of treatment, 
which will be our comparators:  
1. Short duration phenobarbital : Discontinuation of phenobarbital for acute 
symptomatic neonatal seizures prior to discharge home.  
2. Prolonged duration phenobarbital : Continuation of phenobarbital for acute 
symptomatic neonatal seizures until outpatient follow -up (age 2 -4 months).

   9 Investigator) – a neonatologist and developmental pediatrician with extensive experience establishing 
neurodevelopmental outcomes from clinical trials – will o versee all aspects of the developmental outcome aim. 
She is trained to use and teach the WIDEA FS, and will train a research coordinator from each site to perform 
the measure.  
 
We have chosen functional developmental outcome as a primary outcome measure because our Parent 
Partners, stakeholders , and survey respondents  have all told us that neurodevelopment and milestones are 
what matter most to parents in the first year of life: “If the patient is taking medications, the parent will want 
to know about the risk and how those risks can impact milestones… We are all consumed, almost to the point of 
obsessed, with milestones early on. Each one that we don’t make is another heart break .” Furthermore, parents 
value outcome measures that are simple and can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_408957].  
 
We hypothesize no difference in developmental milestones , as measured by [CONTACT_409030] , between  infants  
who were prescribed short versus  prolonged duration of phenobarbital. As discussed below, the study is 
powered as a non-inferiority  analysis  to detect  a clinically relevant difference (<7%) on the WIDEA FS. This 
difference is both clinically meaningful and relevant to parents and stakeholders: in the county of  San Francisco, 
which includes one of the study centers, patients must be at least 33% delayed prior to age 24 months to merit 
referral for developmental services26 (e.g. functioning at the level of a 12 -month -old when the child is 18 -
months of age) . Therefore a difference of, at most, 7% would fall well below a clinically relevant threshold.  
 
Secondary outcomes.   
a) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  (Aim 1b) is one of the most dreaded complications after neonatal seizures. The seizures of 
newborns with acute symptomatic seizures resolve, but up to 20% will later develop recurrent unprovoked 
seizures (epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]). This  pattern  is distinct from n ewborns whose  seizures are caused by  [CONTACT_409031] -onset  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (those infants are excluded from this study ). A history of seizures in the newborn is a major risk factor 
for non -remittance of post -neonatal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]4 and many affected children have very difficult -to-treat epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
such as infantile spasms27. Parent survey respondents indicated major concerns about the risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . If 
prolonged treatment of acute symptomatic neonatal seizures was shown to decrease the risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], then 
subtle associated cognitive consequences of the medication might be acceptable to parents, according to our 
Parent Partners . The members of the University of Michigan Patient and Family Research Council also 
highlighted the development of  early, accurate predictors of unfavorable outcomes as priorities for research.  
Therefore, assessment of the incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and potential predictors of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], are priorities for 
this application. As part of the [ADDRESS_515845] -
certified clinical neurophysiologists (Drs. Shellhaas and Wusthoff) who are blinded to the neonatal seizure 
treatment duration will score the EEG  recordings using well -defined, standardized variables ( Appendix 2 ), with 
differences resolved by [CONTACT_21128]. The EEG results will be included in the statistical modeling of potential 
predictors of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. The study investigators who ascertain the epi[INVESTIGATOR_408958].  
 
b) Lengt h of stay  (Aim 2) is an important outcome for parents, clinicia ns and insurance providers. Said  one 
parent: “Every additional minute in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]… feels like an eternity… The sooner you get home, the better.”  
Preliminary data from the Neonatal Seizure Registry  suggest a trend toward longer length of stay among 
newborns who were discharged home with medication  (p=0.1).  
 
c) Parent and family well -being  (Aim 3, PC-3). Our Parent Partner s selected  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408959] 12 , 18, 
and 24 -month instruments during  focus groups co -led by a  study co-investigator who has extensive experience 
in parent engagement in research  ([CONTACT_409058])  and a lead Parent Partner (Libby [CONTACT_276453]) . The Parent Partner s 
discussed the most relevant domains of family well -being , review ed the pertinent validated instruments (e.g. 
measures of quality of life, anxiety and depression, family copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], parent post -traumatic stress and post -
traumatic growth , parenting  confidence and competence, and  family functioning ), and then select ed the most

   10 relevant and valid measures  (see Appendix 5 ). Questions specific to the impact of seizure medication on family 
well-being were developed together by [CONTACT_409032]  (see Appendix 5 ). 
Participants at the Patient and Family Research Council felt strongly that “all of these are important 
outcomes.” Libby [CONTACT_276453], P arent Partner , re-iterated this point: “the developmental outcome matters only in the 
context of epi[INVESTIGATOR_408960]; they are all related and all important.”  
 
Data Analysis [ IR-3]. The centers from the Neonatal Seizure Registry  enrolled 306 consecutive newborns with 
seizures due to acute symptomatic cause, and who survived hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], over our initial 1 2-27 months of 
collaboration (variable timing of initiation of enrollment by [CONTACT_3725]).  We conservatively estimate that we can enroll 
[ADDRESS_515846] personal health information and follow up data, as well as 150 additional 
newborns  over the 18 months proposed, for a total of 300 subjects with outcome measures for all three aims. 
This will require that we enroll ~50% of eligible newborns, a very achievable recruitment goal for an 
observational study.  
 
Sample Size Calculations  
Aim 1a : Our hypothesis is that short duration treatment with phenobarbital will be inferior to long duration by 
[CONTACT_23818] a non -inferiority margin of 7% in our primary outcome (functional developmental outcome, 
measured by [CONTACT_409030]) adjusted for propensity for maintenance of phenobarbital. This margin is well 
below the clinically -significant threshold since a developmental delay of more than 33% is needed before a 
child may access developmental services26. If there is truly no difference in neurodevelopmenta l outcome 
among children who had short versus prolonged treatment with phenobarbital (Aim 1a), and using a [ADDRESS_515847] deviation of 16.5 (Appendix 3), we calculate that 192 subjects are 
required to be 80% sure that the lower  limit of a one -sided 95% confidence interval will be above the non -
inferiority limit of -7. The WIDEA (our primary outcome measure) is also validated for age [ADDRESS_515848] differences between the groups and, using a similar sample size, lower our non -inferiority margin from 
7% to 4.25% for the primary outcome while also increasing accountability for loss to follow -up from 15 to 20%.  
. Ther efore our proposed N=300 newborns, divided into N1 (short duration: phenobarbital discontinued prior 
to discharge) = 90, and N2 (prolonged duration: phenobarbital continued at discharge) = 210, allows us to take 
into account loss to follow -up (conservative ly estimated at 15%) and propensity score adjustment analysis to 
address causal inference (as discussed below), which requires that we inflate the sample size by 9%28. 
Aim 1b : We hypothesize that there is no clinically significant difference in epi[INVESTIGATOR_408961].  If there is truly no difference between short versus prolonged treatment, with epi[INVESTIGATOR_408962] 20%27, then we will have sufficient subjects to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a 
one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two -sided confidence interval) will exclude a 
difference of more than 13% between groups29. The clinical importance of a potential difference of 13% in

results of the primary neurodevelopmental outcome analysis. If developmental outcomes are  not different

epi[INVESTIGATOR_408965].  
Aim 2 : We hypothesize that length of stay is  shorter among neonates who receive a shorter duration of 
phenobarbital  during their initial admission , adjusted for clinical risk factors . Our sample size is based on our 
total enrollment for the proposal (N= 300). Preliminary data from the Neonatal Seizur e Registry show that  the 
distribution of  length  of stay is approximately normal after log transformation, so it will be transformed prior to 
analysis. The standard deviation of the log -transformed length of stay in our preliminary data is 0.71, which 
gives a detectable difference (with 80% power) of 0.28 on the log scale, corresponding to a 32% difference in 
length of stay. The median length of stay is [ADDRESS_515849] ion a difference >4.5 days, 
a duration that is clinically meaningful to families and important for health resource utilization considerations.

   11 Aim 3 : Family well -being measures will be available for the N=150 prospectively enrolled families at the time of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408966] 12 -months , 18-months, and 24 -months  of age. The N= [ADDRESS_515850] already been enrolled in the Registry  will provide 12 -month , 18-months, and 24-month  well-
being data . Summary scores for s tandardized questionnaires will be compared between the short and 
prolonged treatment duration groups . Answe rs to free -text questions will be analyzed separately using 
inductive thematic analysis32 and then compared to determine how they inform, expand on, or c hallenge each 
other to form an integrated understanding of the data30-33. Using the sample sizes of N 1=36 and N 2=84 
(accounting for expected dropout among the prospectively recruited N=150)  for families with both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5517] 24-month outcome data,  we will have 80% power to detect a standardized difference of [ADDRESS_515851] of discontinuation of early discontinuation of 
phenobarbital. Among  newborns  from the co-PIs’ two study centers who had acute symptomatic seizures and 
survived to discharge, 39  were evaluated in follow -up clinics  at age >6 months (31 of the 39  were evaluated at 
age >12-18 months ). These infants met the enrollment criteria for the proposed study.  There was no 
association between short vs. pro longed phenobarbital prescription and outcomes (Table 2).

Statistical analysis a nd addressing causal inference [ CI-1 to 6 ]. We will follow PCORI guidelines for addressing 
causal inference using propensity score adjustment  as a strategy for addressing confounding by [CONTACT_409033] 1a and 1b22,23. Using propensity scores, we will estimate the unbiased effect of short versus  prolonged 
treatment with phenobarbital by [CONTACT_409034].  
Guillet , et al , examined duration of neonatal seizure treatment by [CONTACT_409035]. They concluded that “ the coefficients of variation… were >0.2, which 
supports the notion that there is wide variability i n thinking about actual practices5,” however no measured 
variables (including work setting, training, or geographic location) could account for the inconsistencies. 
Preliminary, unpublished data from the Neonatal Seizure Registry  also suggest sufficient heterogeneity within 
our established group to adequately address the primary hypothesis using propensity scores. Although the 
centers care for similar patient populations (for example the primary cause of s eizures at all centers is hypoxic -
ischemic encephalopathy) and have similar initial management strategies (phenobarbital is, by [CONTACT_187237], the most 
common initial medication in all centers), management decisions regarding whether or not to maintain seizure 
medic ation until the time of outpatient follow -up are very discrepant. Among  newborns  enrolled in the 
Neonatal Seizure Registry , 23% had medication discontinued prior to discharge (range by [CONTACT_3725] 3-75%), while 
77% continued on anticonvulsants. Phenobarbital was the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsant 
(prescribed to 89 % of those maintained on medication).  
We will derive propensity scores by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a regression analysis that includes the major potential 
reasons that treating physicians may decide to contin ue phenobarbital after resolution of acute symptomatic 
seizures and until the time of outpatient follow -up (see list, below). These reasons represent possible sources 
of confounding by [CONTACT_35151]. All variables are currently collected in the Neonatal Seizu re Registry  data base . 
 
Propensity score co -variables (potential confounders)  for Aim 1 : 
- Confirmation of electrographic seizures versus  seizure diagnosis on clinical grounds alone  
- Severity of seizures  (seizure burden)  
- Etiology of seizures

Using a propensity score analysis, we will examine the association between short versus  prolonged 
treatment with phenobarbital, and the WIDEA FS developmental outcome (Aim 1a), as well as the incidence of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Aim 1b). Propensity scoring will allow adjustment for differences in treatment response to 
phenobarbital  and will assure lack of  exposure overlap between groups . Ability of the propensity score to 
balance covariates will be checked by [CONTACT_115822]23. Analyses will be repeated and stratified by [CONTACT_409036]. 
preterm birth to examine diffe rences in treatment response by [CONTACT_58032]. If the  confidence interval for 
the propensity adjusted association is greater than our non -inferiority limit, then we will reject the null 
hypothesis that short duration of treatment is non -inferior to long duration with respect to  
neurodevelopmental outcome or rates of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
For Aim 2, standard linear regression methods will be employed to examine duration of  inpatient  
phenobarbital treatment and length of stay as a log -transformed continuous variable a nd adjusted for the 
potential confounding co -variables listed above as propensity score co -variables (except length of stay).  
For Aim 3, standardized survey results will be compared between the short and prolonged treatment 
duration groups using parametric  and non -parametric bivariate comparison tests as appropriate. Answers to 
free-text questions  will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis32. This  data analysis occurs iteratively and 
simultaneously with data collection33. [CONTACT_409058] will train the research assistants to undertake coding, and will 
supervise them through this p rocess. They will engage in repeated close readings of the responses , searching 
for units of meaning or ‘codes’ that describe the underlying social processes and interactions. Codes will be 
organized into categories that are both highly represented in the data and account for the greatest variation in 
the data35. Open, focused and t heoretical codes will then be developed to describe aspects (dimensions) of 
participants’ experiences. Rigor will be maintained through reflexivity, attention to response  quality, member 
reflection and systematic analysis. We will discuss emerging themes w ith our Parent Partner s, to engage in 
ongoing validation of interpretations and to avoid making assumptions about meaning.   
 
Sensitivity analyses [IR-5]. In order to strengthen causal inference, we will perform a sensitivity analysis using 
institution as an instrumental variable. Institution is a good instrumental variable: preliminary data from the 
Neonatal Seizure Registry indicate that it is associated w ith the use of short versus  prolonged duration of 
phenobarbital in spi[INVESTIGATOR_408967] (including etiology and seizure frequency) are 
similar. We have not yet collected data with respect to developmental outcomes for the Neonatal  Seizure 
Registry , and so we cannot preclude the impact of institution on outcome; however all important procedures 
of care that might actually impact outcomes ( e.g.,  therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic -ischemic 
encephalopathy) are standardized across the centers for excellence that comprise the Neonatal Seizure 
Registry . As such, we expect the entire effect of institution to be mediated through short versus prolonged 
treatment with phenobarbital (after adjustment for potential confounders). Since the use o f an instrumental 
variable analysis does not depend on the assumption unmeasured confounders, this instrument will be a good 
complement to the propensity score matching, which depends on identification of all potential confounders.  
Propensity score and in strumental variable analyses may not estimate exactly the same quantity36.  A 
discrepancy between the analyses may point to differences in the average effect of duration of therapy overall 
(average cause effect or ACE) versus only those who would comply with assignment to short versus long 
duration (local average treatment effect or LATE). In the situation of a discrep ancy between the two analyses, 
the LATE interpretation of the instrumental variable analysis will still be valuable .

   13 Primary outcome:  The WIDEA FS, a simple, free, one -page assessment to determine functional developmental 
outcome  in children. It will be administered by [CONTACT_409029] 12 -months , 18-months, and 24 -month s.20 (see 
Appendix 3).  
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
1) The epi[INVESTIGATOR_408968] 12-months , 18-months, and [ADDRESS_515852] to describe the severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (see  Appendix 4 ).  
2) The parent and family well -being assessment will be conducted in conjunction with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136041] 12 -month , 18-month, and 24 -month  evaluations. Our Parent Partner s arrived at consensus on the 
pertinent domains and selected a suite of  validated questionnaires  (see Appendix 5 ). They also helped us 
to design a set of open -ended free -text questions to explore the specific impact of seizure medication on 
family well -being . These instruments will be available in English and in Spanish.  
The NICU discharge survey will have 63 items (answered on a 4 to 5 point scale ), a 10 item socio -dem ographic 
form , 3 items about the newborn’s seizures and treatment plan, and [ADDRESS_515853] 106 items (answered on a  4 to 5 point scale ), a [ADDRESS_515854] of seizure medications on family well -being . 
The Parent Partner s emphasized having choices  to complete the surveys online  or by [CONTACT_409037]. They were also mindful that the time to complete the survey packet 
be no longer than one hour total, with the option to complete the survey packet in several shorter intervals .  
 
Data source adequacy [IR-1]. Data will be collected and entered into a REDCap database according to policies 
established for the Neonatal Seizure Registry  discussed below.  
Data Accuracy and Editing : The database limits range values for numerical data and will utilize radio buttons or  
drop down lists rather than free text for qualitative data.  
Updating : REDCap automatically creates a historical record of past saved data for each field so that errors can 
be traced.  
Data and Form Checks : Database quality  is maintained through analyses that target anomalies, delinquent data, 
and data entry errors. Along with built -in data validation, the Study Coordinator performs a quarterly check for 
discrepancies in data that includes: incorrect data types, out -of-range  or erroneous data, inconsistent and 
illogical over -time dates, fields on a "completed form" actually not completed; or no reason for missing data is 
provided. Sites are notified of data discrepancies and are asked to verify and correct discrepancies withi n 2 
weeks of notification.  
 
Missing data [ MD-1 to 5 ]. The study coordinator will audit the database every [ADDRESS_515855] <1%  missing data for the following key elements: 
institution, sex, ethnicity, gestational age at birth, delivery mode, Apgar scores, hypothermia treatment, 
indication for EEG, seizure type, primary seizure etiology, disposition and seizure medication prescrib ed at the 
time of discharge.  For Aim s [ADDRESS_515856] conservatively accounted for 15% loss to 
follow -up (the anticipated main source of missing data) and have adjusted our enrollment target accordingly. 
We will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of loss to follow -up: we have extensive 
information about our partici pants and will compare those that are and are not lost to follow -up. We will 
compare our primary analysis (a complete case analysis) with an analysis using multiple imputation using the 
“multiple imputation with chained equations” methodology. This approac h allows us to specify realistic models 
for each variable, such as the ordered categorical for the Engel scale . For Aim 2, we e xpect little to no missing 
data.  Also, for Aim 3, w e will audit the amount of missing data for the open -ended free -text questions  to 
determine if there are patterns and will consult with our Parent Partners about ways to improve response rates 
if needed.

Registry  (from among >300 eligible newborns ; a representative 
sample of the youngest infants at the time of study initiation will be 
approached for consent, to allow for prospective collection of 24-
month outcome data). An additional prospective sample of [ADDRESS_515858]  had 
stable enrollment of 20 -30 newborns /month, >70% of whom have acute symptomatic seizures and would meet 
enrollment criteria for the proposed study. Thus, we expect 250 -375 eligible infants over the 18 month 
enrollment period. We, therefore, will need t o enroll 40 -60% of eligible newborns, which is very conservative 
for a non -intervention study with non -invasive follow -up. We will monitor enrollment monthly and address 
lagging rates on a site -specific basis, as necessary. Given that PCORI requests data w ithin nine months of the 
end of the final year of funding, even if recruitment is slower than anticipated, there is an additional six months 
of recruitment time available to us to meet this deadline .

The study population  will be newborns  with seizures who are admitted at one of the participating children’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and their parents. Study sites were selected based on their enrollment of patients in the Neonatal 
Seizure Registry  and their ability to confirm neonatal seizure diagnoses wi th video EEG monitoring, according to 
the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) guidelines37. 
 
Inclusion  criteria  [RQ-3] 
 Neonates <44 weeks postmenstrual age at seizure onset  
 Seizures due to an acute symptomatic cause (including, but not limited to hypoxic ischemic 
encephalopathy , stroke, or cerebral hemorrhage)  
 Parent(s)  who are English or Spanish literate (with assistance of interpreter)  
Exclusion  criteria   
 Neonates at risk for adverse outcome independent of  seizures and underlying brain injury (including but 
not limited to: inborn errors of metabolism, fetal infection, brain malformation, or genetic syndrome)  
 Neonates with transient cause for seizures ( e.g., mild hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia)

   16  Neonates who do not survive the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
 Neonates will not be excluded based on race, ethnicity, gender or gestational age  
Study population [ RQ-3]. We will recruit 300 newborn infants with acute symp tomatic seizures (including 1 50 
who were previously enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry ). No infant will be excluded based on gender, 
race, or ethnicity. Neonates with seizures are often critically ill, and some do not survive their initial  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517] (16% in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408971] ). We will only enroll newborns  who 
survive to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Inclusion of Women & Minorities.   
Neonatal seizures affect boys slightly more often than girls ( Neonatal Seizure Registry  data: 55% male, 45% 
female), but children of all races and ethnicities are affected. Among the Neonatal Seizure Registry’s  subjects, 
the distribution of race/ethnicity is similar to the American pediatric population. We anticipate a simila r 
distribution for the proposed follow -up study, which will be representative of American children .  
 
Inclusion of Children. All study subjects will be children.  
 
Potential participant subgroups [RQ-4; HT-1 to 4 ].  
Our study is powered to evaluate the primary outcome (development at 24 months) across a wide -ranging 
population of neonates with seizures. This will improve generalizability. We will also have an opportunity to 
perform exploratory secondary analyses for s ome subgroups:  
  EEG confirmed vs. clinically diagnosed neonatal seizures : Although all Neonatal Seizure Registry  sites 
conform to the ACNS Guidelines for neonatal EEG monitoring38, there are occasions in which an at -risk 
infant’s clinical events resolve prior to the initiation of EEG. In the proper clinical context, many such 
newborn s are treated empi[INVESTIGATOR_408972]. In two small studies, the risk for 
subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_408973] -confirmed neonatal seizures than those with 
clinically diagnosed seizures3,39. Therefore, we will evaluate for differences in 24-month outcomes between 
those with clinical versus EEG -confirmed seizures.  
 Gestational age at birth (preterm vs. term) . The long -term  effects of treatment with phenobarbital on 
preterm neonates are not known and the potential variability of individual responses to discontinuation  of 
phenobarbital is a major knowledge gap. Therefore, we will conduct secondary analyses of the effect of 
prematurity on neurodevelopmental, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and family well -being outcomes in the context of duration 
of phenobarbital exposure.  For this secondary analysis, we will use phenobarbital treatment as a 
continuous variable (number of days of treatment), to avoi d overlap between short vs. prolonged 
treatment groups since preterm infants are often cared for in the NICU for weeks or months.  Since just 
15% of the Neonatal Seizure Registry subjects are preterm, conclusions regarding the analyses of this 
subgroup will  be tentative. T he detectable effect size for the full term group (85% of the cohort) will only 
increase by 8% compared to the overall analysis, so the results will be precise and conclusions will be just 
as strong for the term subgroup as for the full sam ple. 
 Gender : To our knowledge, no published study has established whether outcomes after neonatal seizures 
vary according to gender. It is plausible to hypothesize that boys with neonatal seizures are at higher risk 
for adverse neurodevelopmental consequen ces than girls. The Neonatal Seizure Registry , which enrolls 
every  newborn with seizures, confirms that males are more often affected than girls (55% male neonates in 
the first 488 enrolled patients).  Studies of preterm infants have consistently demonstrat ed male sex as a 
risk factor for developmental delay40 and animal models suggest enhanced neuroprotective effects of 
therapeutic hypothermia in female as compared to male rodents after equivalent hypoxia -ischemia41. We 
will, therefore, include gender in our statistical models, to determine whether male sex is a n independent  
risk factor for adverse outcomes after neonatal seizures.  
 Treatment with levetiracetam : There is increasing use of levetiracetam for treatment of acute symptomatic 
neonatal seizures, and maintenance of this medication at the time of discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
Levetiracetam is less sedating than phenobarbital, and may have a more favorable neurotoxicity profile 
 
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515859] recruitment . A study investigator or research coordinator will identify eligible newborns  during the 
neonatal admission at each of the participating study sites. A study investigator will approach the 
parents/guardians of eligible patients and, using a consent form approved by [CONTACT_409040], will describe the anticipated  risks and benefits of the study. The consent team will include only 
experienced team members who are sensitive to the vulnerable nature of this population and who emphasize 
the voluntary nature of research. Since this study will place infants  at no more t han minimal risk, and could 
augment patient care through standard provision of the follow -up EEG, we anticipate excellent consent rates. 
Based on feedback from our Parent Partners , we have also attempted to minimize burden to families, and loss 
to follow -up, through use of a telephone -based follow -up assessment, rather than requiring in -person 
developmental testing.  
Barriers to recruitment . Based on our extensive collective experience with long -term follow -up for neonates at 
risk for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] – for example the PIs’ NIH -supported studies ( 5K23HD068402, K23NS066137) and the 
Prevention of West Syndrome study (funded by [CONTACT_409041]), as well as the UCSF P01NS082330 -01 Repair after 
Neonatal Brain Injury, which has enrolled and followed more than 750 neonates since its i nception in the 1990s 
– we anticipate optimal recruitment when families are approached prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Since some of 
the Neonatal Seizures Registry  sites draw patients from significant geographical distances, families will be 
provided a stipen d to off -set travel expenses associated with the follow -up EEG. The EEG will be paid for by [CONTACT_409042], unless the treating physician orders it on clinical grounds.  
All study participants  will be followed longitudinally per local clinical guidelines t hrough the Pediatric  
Neurology and/or Intensive Care Follow Up Programs. Children meeting study eligibility criteria are routinely 
followed through early childhood because of their risk for neurodevelopmental disability  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . A 
research coordinator  will maintain frequent contact [CONTACT_409043].  
F. Research Team and Environment  
Capabilities of the Research Team  
Study Sites  for the Neonatal Seizure Registry  and for this application were chosen based on the following :  
1) Ability to  perform continuous, video -EEG as recommended by [CONTACT_409044]37 
2) Neurophysiologist(s) with experience interpreting neonatal and pediatric EEG  
3) Technologists with experience in applying the neonatal EEG montage  
4) State of the art neonatal neurology and pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_408974]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408975] U.S.A. These sites provide care to a 
diverse range of children from all races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic strata. Therefore, we are confident that 
the enrolled newborns and families will be representative of the American population and that the treatment 
recommendations derived from the study results will be easy to implement in real -world settings.  
Investigators for this study have been working together for several years, initially as par t of the NEonatal 
Seizure Treatment Trial  (NESTT) group (which was established using seed funding from the Child Neurology 
Foundation), and more recently through the Neonatal Seizure Registry  (which was established using seed 
funding from the Pediatric Epi [INVESTIGATOR_408935]). We have a strong track record of collaborative 
academic accomplishments, including management guidelines and a recent, high -impact original science paper 
in Neurology24,37,43. Furthermore, we have shown that we are capable of enrolling relevant newborns , now with

G. Engagement Plan  
1. Planning the Study.  Stakeholders are fully integrated in all aspects of the proposed study  [Criterion 5] .  
We established several critical partnerships to develop 
this proposal. O ur key stakeholder  group, Hand to Hold , 
is a parent peer group for families whose newborns  
require NICU care ( www.handtohold.org ). Hand to Hold  
connects with NICU families to provide information, 
support , and ongoing education to mitigate the impact of a NICU stay and prepare them to meet the needs of 
their medically fragile child after they leave the  NICU.  More than 19,000 NICU parents sought support from 
Hand to Hold  this year through their Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_408985]. Hand to Hold ’s comprehensive  website  welcomed more than 400,[ADDRESS_515862] . Parents can access 
videos about topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] o f importance to NICU families through their YouTube Channel . Hand to Hold  recently 
launched a new online education series  – NICU 101  – through Facebook which is reaching more than 3,[ADDRESS_515863] ing priorities for neonatal seizure research on the Hand to Hold  
site, personally advised the team about study design, and is committed to continued partnership to support 
the study’s execution and dissemination of results.  
Parent Partners helped to design  the study and selected  the most relevant outcome measures. Since 
newborn infants are unable to act as direct patient stakeholders, parents must serve as proxy stakeholders.  We 
worked with  the CHEAR Patient and Family Research Council to develop the research idea and refine the 
overall study design. We then  recruited 10 parents  of children who experienced neonatal seizures  to form our 
Parent Partner panel  (Table 7). Seven were  recruited from the study sites, to mitigate concern regarding 
exclusion of parent s who are not part of online social media . Three were recruited via their connections w ith 
Hand to Hold and CaseyBarnes.org . They  come from all regions of the [LOCATION_003], have diverse racial/ethnic 
backgrounds, and a range of experiences with neonatal seizu res. Parents  participated in conference calls and 
email discussions to provide input on the overall study design and to select the met hods and measures for Aim 
3. They  were asked open ended questions about major concerns related to their child’s seizure management 
during neonatal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408986]. Major themes  included: uncertainty  about prognosis , treatment variability,  and long -term 
impact on the family. Parent Partners were  fully supportive of the plan s for Aims 1 & 2. They also confirmed 
the pertinence  of the outcome measurement time points  (NICU discharge  and when the infant is  24 months of 
age). Parents  discussed  the pros and cons of different surveys , agreed that no single instrument measured all 
the necessary topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102],  and arrived at consensus on the domains and validated questionnaires  selected for Aim 3.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515864] with the following:  
1) Development of study -related documents ( e.g. consent forms, brochures, etc.)  
2) Provision of guidance on optimal recruitment and retention practices  
3) Optimization of study procedures  
4) Review of study results  
5) Implementation of the plan to disseminate key findings to professiona l and parent/family stakeholders 
 
3. Disseminating the study results . Parent stakeholders will be central  in the dissemination of results:  
1) Announcements and updates to social media platforms, including the Hand to Hold  website and 
Facebook pa ge. 
2) Presentation of results, together with PIs, at Departmental Grand Rounds and Society Meetings. For 
example, annual meetings of the American Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408987].  
3) Developi[INVESTIGATOR_408988] s detailing the results of the study to be sent to participating families.  
 
Patient Advocacy Groups and Profes sional Societies will be engaged  in dissemination of results:  
1) Kelli Kelley, director of Hand to Hold , has pledged to use her organization’s wide network of more than 
250,000 parents and professionals to help promote this research and disseminate key findings.  She, 
and members of the Hand to Hold staff , are also available to participate in collaborative presentations 
at local and national meetings of physicians and parent stakeholders.    
2) Both the Child Neurology Society  and the American Academy of  Pediatrics  have agreed to review 
evidence based guidelines based on this study’s results  (see letters of support) . Such guidelines would 
be made widely available to professionals and parents through publishe d articles and online resources.

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515865] agreed  to participate in monthly research team meetings  (by [CONTACT_577])  to be updated on the 
project’s progress, to approve of all major decisions, and  to participate in planning the dissemination of 
findings.  The PIs and Parent Partners  have already established a pattern of discussion and partnership for 
decision -making for this proposal. As outlined elsewhere in this submission , the Parent Partner  Advisory Panel , 
in collaboration with [CONTACT_409058], and in consultation with the PIs, have b oth an overall study advisory role and a 
specific role in the development of Aim 3. The Parent Partner s have  been  instrumental for decision -making 
regarding design  of the study protocol (Table 8).  
 
Table 8 : Parent Partner Advisory Panel Timeline.  
 
 
Colearning. Parents and s takeholders have already engaged in frequent, open dialogues with the PIs regarding 
the study design. The PIs have been teaching the  parents and other  stakeholders about the scientific evidence 
and options of research protocol design. The PIs have participated in PCORI webinars and have discussed the 
project with a PCORI ambassador. The Parent Partners focus groups contained a specific educational segme nt 
on patient -centered research and PCORI.  
Meanwhile, the stakeholders have been critical in informing the PIs about parents’ priorities and the best 
assessment in struments for use in the parent and family well -being outcome assessments.  Together with 
Marty Barnes and Kelli Kelley, [CONTACT_116044] composed the parent web survey that was posted to the Hand to Hold 
website and inquired about families’ experiences with neonatal seizures and their treatment. Data generated 
from that survey were critical for informing  the design of this proposal.  
Additional opportunities for reciprocal relationships and co -learning include:  
 Monthly teleconferences for project updates and mutual decision -making.  
 Development of publications  and presentations  for dissemination of study results to parent groups.  
 
Partnership. Parent Partners  will be compensated for their time. Our Parent Partners  have shown a clear 
commitment to engaging with us. We will offer financial compensa tion to each of our Parent Partners  to 
participate in monthly telephone conference calls and focus groups.  Parents of children with special needs, 
especially those with seizures, are busy people. They balance multiple childcare, healthcare, and professional 
commitments. We have speci fically discussed the level of commitment required, and compensation available,  
for the present proposal with each of our stakeholders  and partners , and th e proposal and budget reflect the 
results of those discussions. Each Parent Partner has agreed to the commitments outlined above .

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515867], Transparency,  and Honesty. From its conception, this study has included both clinicians and parent 
stakeholders (who must serve as proxies since newborn infants are unable to serve as direct pati ent partners ). 
We have worked in close collaboration with our Parent Partners  to create a proposal that serves: 1) the infants 
who are treated with medicine for seizures; 2) the clinicians who must make treatment decisions in the 
absence of scientific evid ence; and 3) the parents of affected infants, who must nurture these children and live 
with the day -to-day impact  of the seizures, their treatment, and their neurodevelopmental consequences.  
As a fully integrated study team, we are committed to continued t rust, transparency, and honesty about 
study design, implementation, and result reporting. Our stakeholders and Parent Partners have shown their full 
commitment to this work, through multiple in -person and telephone meetings, as well as frequent electronic 
mail correspondence.  
The physician investigators and stakeholders remain committed to sustained parent and stakeholder 
integration throughout the study’s planning, implementation, and analysis phases. We all look forward to 
communicating this study’s crucial findings rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], broadly, and in a clinically useful manner . We aim to 
disseminate our findings to  families and their clinical care teams  through traditional scientific papers, online 
posts on websites and social media, and will work with the Chil d Neurology Society and the American Academy 
of Pediatrics to produce practice guidelines based on this PCORI -funded research.
 
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515868] has great potential for rapid dissemination and implementation in clinical and community practice, 
as outlined below.  
Management Guidelines and Scientific Manuscripts: The investigators of this application are lead ers in the 
field of neonatal neurology and neonatal seizures, and together have published dozens of manuscripts on the 
subject of neonatal seizures in high quality journals, including the nationally recognized guidelines for 
monitoring neonatal seizures24,37, and a recent, high -impact manuscript on monitoring and seizures in 
neonates43. These important manuscripts resulted from the collaborative efforts of many members of the 
study team.  
 
It is our intention to d evelop the proposed study’s research findings into a high -impact clinical practice 
guideline related to the optimal duration of treatment after neonatal seizures. We have already been in 
discussions with the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society (CNS) and the American Academy of 
Pediatrics Section on Neurology (AAP SoN) and both  national organizations  have provided letters indicating 
their strong support for this application . Both the CNS and AAP SoN agree t hat the proposed study  will 
generate critical, clinically relevant data, and they are committed to assisting the study team with 
dissemination of the results. In addition, we will  apply to the American Academy of Neurology and the 
American Academy of Pedia trics for consideration of this guideline. We selected these organizations as they 
reach the most relevant clinicians (neurologists, child neurologists, pediatricians, and neonatologists) and have 
a track record of creating high -quality patient education m aterials based on their published guidelines.  
 
Society Meetings:  The investigators are the former and/or current leaders of Special Interest Groups in 
Neonatal Neurology (Child Neurology Society) and Neonatal Seizures (American Epi[INVESTIGATOR_312888]), and serve  on 
the Scientific Planning Committees for the Pediatric Academic Societies and Child Neurology Society annual 
meetings. We are, therefore, well positioned to quickly disseminate results to more than 10,000 neurologists, 
neurophysiologists and neonatologis ts within a year of completion of our study. In order to achieve quick 
dissemination, we will submit abstracts and propose scientific symposia at multiple meetings.  
 
Educational Programs: The Investigators of this application are invited lecturers for multiple national and 
international educational programs, including teaching  at both the American Academy of Neurology and the 
American Academic of Pediatrics annual “Neonatal Neurology” sessions, as well as the IPOKRaTES Foundation 
seminars in neonatology  and the International Conference on Brain Monitoring & Neuroprotection in the 
Newborn . Results of this study will be directly relevant to these audiences  of all levels of training, and can be 
quickly incorporated into presentations for these high -impact v enues, which target trainees and faculty in 
neonatology, pediatrics, and neurology. Furthermore, [CONTACT_116044] is well positioned to create educational materials 
that can be widely disseminated to residents in Pediatrics.

Parent Support and Advocacy Group: Our key stakeholder partner, Hand to Hold , is a premier parent peer 
support and advocacy group for families with children who required neonatal intensive care . The group has an 
important online presence (handtohold.org ) and a network  of 250,[ADDRESS_515869] social media network, as well as local state, national, and international family 
groups. Our results will be highly relevant to parents of neonates with seizures, who will be empowered to ask 
for discontinuation or continuation of anticonvulsant medications based on the results of our study.  
 
B. Describe possible barriers to disseminating and implementing  the results of this research  in other 
settings.  
Dissemination:  As discussed above, we are poised to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_408989]. Development and publicati on of clinical practice 
guidelines will be a longer process, but we and our sponsors at the relevant national societies are committed to 
completing this larger, high -impact manuscript.  
 
Implementation : Potential barriers to implementation of the results in  routine clinical practice may include 
inertia, unwillingness to change clinical practice, and fear of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_133527]. Centers that are unable to 
perform continuous video -EEG monitoring may be unable to confirm presence and termination of 
electrograp hic seizures and may, therefore elect to continue medications. We will explicitly address these 
concerns in our dissemination products  and have planned a subgroup analysis for newborns with clinical -only 
seizures . We are also planning to collaborate with D r. Hill (pediatric resident and parent partner ) to develop 
educational materials for trainees in Pediatrics, in order to provide optimal education for the next generation 
of clinicians who will care for and treat newborns with seizures.  
 
C. Describe how you w ill make study results available to study participants after you complete your 
analyses.  
Participating families will be notified of the study results via email or post (depending on parent preference) in 
the form of a newsletter that outlines the research  questions and results. The Parent Partner  Advisory Panel 
will be responsible for drafting the newsletter to ensure that it is parent friendly. Participants in the CHEAR 
Patient Family Research Council specified that “ humanizing the results… in English, no t in medicalese ” and 
including family narratives are priorities for dissemination of results.  
 
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR : [INVESTIGATOR_408931], Renée A.  
PCORI Research Plan version 2 8/1/[ADDRESS_515870] to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408990], as there may be some 
concern that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408991] a specific participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This data set will be 
prepared within nine months of the end of the final year of funding. The data will then be available to PCORI 
representatives, and to any other interested party on an as needed basis. For those who are not PCORI 
representatives (for example, other investigators or agencies), we will accept requests to be reviewed by [CONTACT_409045], co -investigators, and Parent Partner  Advisory Panel, and will release the data as deemed appr opriate. We 
will ask for a data use agreement such that the data will only be used for the purposes of the request and not 
made publicly available.  
 
C. Propose a budget to cover costs of  your data -sharing  plan , if requested.   
No budget has been requested for data -sharing. One advantage of the REDCap system is that it is very easy to 
create de -identified records, which can be circulated using common file extensions for statistical software 
program ( e.g.,  SAS, Stata), as needed.

PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Describe the protection of human subjects  who will be  involved in your research.  
This Human Subjects Research meets the definition of “Clinical Research.” We plan to study 300 human 
newborns  (<44 weeks gestational age at the time of seizures) who are enrolled at one of the participating 
centers of the Neonatal Seizure Registry .  
 
Potential Risks  
We do not anticipate any significant risks to participants, as the study is observational in nature. 
Participating families may face some risk for loss of privacy or confidentiality, which will be mitigated as 
detailed below.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Because we are working with a vulnerable population of infants who 
cannot give informed consent, and parents who are faced with difficult medical decisions regarding health care 
for their children, our consent teams will incl ude only experienced personnel who are sensitive to these ethical 
issues, and who emphasize the voluntary nature of research.  Families will be advised that they may stop 
participation at any time. All research staff will undergo appropriate human subjects research training 
through the CITI program and/or equivalent local institutional training. Parents of eligible neonates will be 
identified by [CONTACT_409046]. 
After initial perm ission to make contact, research staff will describe the purpose and design of the study, 
the potential risks and benefits of study participation, the procedures in place to protect against risk to 
participants, and the available levels of participation. W e will make sure to be sensitive of the needs of 
families, noting at multiple occasions that the study is voluntary and that participants can request to stop 
being part of the study at any time.  
Loss of Privacy : All participants  will be assigned a study -identifier number. The list of names and 
corresponding study ID numbers will be stored on a secure computer server in a separate password -
protected location from the study data. Contact [CONTACT_409047], since this information is necessary to enable [ADDRESS_515871] -protected. The REDCap program, a secure, web -based data capture system 
(https://redcap.ucsfopenresearch.org ) will be used for data entry and data export . The data collected by [CONTACT_409048]. Datasets used for presentation or publication will contain no personally 
identifying subject information.  
EEG: There are no known risks related to recording routine EEG, a side from a slight risk of transient redness of 
the scalp. In order to minimize skin breakdown, technicians trained in neonatal/infant EEG will apply the leads 
for all studies.  
 
Potential Benefits to Participants  and Others  
The infants  will potentially benefit from early detection of seizures or delayed developmental milestones, 
which may allow early start to epi[INVESTIGATOR_32566], physical therapy and /or occupational therapy. The follow -up 
EEG results will be available to the infants’ tre ating clinicians, and could add to medical decision -making.

Patient Follow -up will be at pre -specified ages as outlined in the proposal. The initial follow -up (2 -4 month EEG) will be 
arranged at the time of enrollment  for the N=150 prospectively enrolled infants . The Aim1 12-month , 18-month, and 24 -
month  follow -up assessment s for all participants will be conducted by [CONTACT_409050]:  
- WIDEA FS (functional neurodevelopmental outcome, which is the primary endpo int, Appendix 3 ) 
- Epi[INVESTIGATOR_409013] – (Appendix 4 ) 
 
As requested by [CONTACT_409051], participating families may complete 12 -month follow -up family well -
being assessment for Aim 3 either by [CONTACT_2319] (paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_409014]) or via  online questionnaire 
administration (Appendix 5 ). 
 
The 24-month contact [CONTACT_409052].  
 
Adequacy of Follow -Up Duration: 24-month follow -up is both scientifically justified and practical. By [ADDRESS_515889] -neonatal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], such as infantile spasms, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_409015]’s first birthday. Although more subtle developmental differences may emerge later, in 
school age children, longer follow -up is not feasible within a [ADDRESS_515890] them at a later date for long -term outcome assessment, once additional funding is secured.  
 
Retention and Expected Loss to Follow -Up: We anticipate excellent retention, since all neonates enrolled in this study 
will have close clinical follow -up with the study centers through a high -risk developmental follow -up program, pediatric 
neurology, and/or pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. We have designed the  protocol to avoid unnecessary travel to the study centers. 
The follow -up EEG will be recorded between ages 2 and 4 months, a timeframe during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_409016]. The assessments will be conducted via telephone inter view  (Aim 1), and online or by [CONTACT_2319] 
(Aim 3) , rather than in -person evaluations. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], we have accounted for a 15% loss to follow -up in our analysis 
plan.  
 
Possible biases due to differential loss to follow -up: It is possible that infants who are discharged from the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409017] -up, since they will not need to 
present to a neurology clinic for prescription medication refill s. In our clinical experience, however, these families want 
to return to clinic at least at the [ADDRESS_515891] can evaluate their child’s growth and 
development. If a child is doing well, families who live farther from the study  site may be less likely to follow -up at later 
time points. We have  designed the assessment to avoid this problem  by [CONTACT_409053], online and 
mailed surveys . Even for families who do not complete the assessment s, the medical chart can be reviewed. In cases 
where a family cannot be reached by [CONTACT_756], a diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_409018].  
 
Data Safety and Security: Local Institutional Review Boards approvals for the Neonatal Seizure Regist ry Sites will be 
amended to reflect changes to the study design. Data will be collected using REDCap, an online, HIPAA compliant 
database that is designed for use in health care. Data will be de -identified, with each site maintaining local record of the 
patient medical record number in a secure manner (either on an encrypted and password protected computer that is 
maintained in a locked room, or paper file that is maintained in a locked cabinet in a locked room). Data that were 
collected for the Neonatal Se izure Registry prior to initiation of this proposal will be used only following informed 
consent from families.

Informed Consent: A study investigator will contact [CONTACT_7903]/legal guardians of eligible patients and, using a consent 
form approved by [CONTACT_409054] (Institutional Review Board), describe the known risks and 
benefits of the study. The consent teams will include only experienced study personnel who are sensitive to the 
vulnerable nature of this population and who will emphasize the voluntary nature of research.  
 
Data Quality Assurance  
Data will be collected and entered into a REDCap database according to policies established for the Neonatal Seizure 
Registry .  
 
Training : For the purposes of this proposal, the two study coordinators from the primary institutions will provide 
additional training for coordinators at the other study sites. For the purposes of the Neonatal Seizure Registry, we have 
audited 10 0% of sites and have found very good agreement for the variables that will be included in the proposed 
analysis.  We expect a similar high fidelity for additional data collection.  
Data Accuracy and Editing : The database limits range values for numerical data and will utili ze radio buttons or drop 
down lists rather than free text for qualitative data.  
Updating : REDCap automatically creates a historical record of past saved data for each field so that errors can be traced.  
Data and Form Checks : Database quality is maintained  through analyses that target anomalies, delinquent data, and 
data entry errors. Along with built -in data validation, the Study Coordinator performs a quarterly check for discrepancies 
in data that includes: incorrect data types, out -of-range or erroneous data, inconsistent and illogical over -time dates, 
fields on a "completed form" actually not completed; or no reason for missing data is provided. Sites are notified of data 
discrepancies and are asked to verify and correct discrepancies within 2 weeks of n otification.  
Data Review and Verification Procedures:  Database quality will be maintained through analyses that target anomalies, 
delinquent data, and data entry errors. Along with built -in data validation, the Study Coordinators will perform a 
quarterly c heck for discrepancies in data that includes: incorrect data types, out -of-range or erroneous data, 
inconsistent and illogical over -time dates, fields on a "completed form" actually not completed; or no reason for missing 
data is provided. Sites will be no tified of data discrepancies and are asked to verify and correct discrepancies within 2 
weeks of notification.  
 
Modifications to the Protocol  will be based on consensus of the co -Pis after discussion with Parent Partner Advisory 
Panel . Any changes will trigger an update to the Manual of Operations, which will be sent electronically to every site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_32528]. Changes will be highlighted during conference calls and the main study coordinators will 
communicate directly with each site coordinato r to insure timely and accurate implementation of any change.  
 
Consistent Data Collection: We will use the existing data dictionary for the Neonatal Seizure Registry , which is based on 
recent literature review and widely used definitions. Standard instruct ions and definitions are included in the Manual of 
Operations.  
 
Systematic Patient Enrollment and Follow -up: Every infant diagnosed with neonatal seizures at the participating 
centers will be a potential candidate for enrollment. Only families whose infant s survive to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409019] (~16% in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409020] ). This will avoid selection bias and allow for the most widely applicable data set. Each site wil l maintain a log of 
families who decline to consent for this study. The log will include gender, race/ethnicity, and the reason for the 
neonatal seizures (these data are already gathered through the Neonatal Seizure Registry) . This will allow for 
prospecti ve identification of any biases in enrollment, so that changes in the consent process may be implemented as 
needed to enhance generalizability of the study sample.

43 Procedures to Monitor and Minimize Loss to Follow -up: Quarterly enrol lment  and follow -up reports will be generated 
for each site, so that the follow -up rates are clear and any center for which the target appears to be in jeopardy can be 
readily identified before the follow -up target is missed. The target is >8 5% follow -up for the 24-month assessments. We 
will prospectively determine the actions to be employed in the event that this target is in jeopardy. At the outset of the 
study , we will develop a patient retention plan that documents when a patient will be considered lost to follo w-up and 
what actions will be taken to minimize such loss.  
 At the time of enrollment , the following data will be collected: Telephone, mailing address, and email address for 
the neonate’s parent/legal guardian, as well as alternate contact [CONTACT_409055]/guardian (e.g. a 
grandparent or close friend’s contact [CONTACT_3031], with that person’s permission).  
 The 2 -4 month follow -up EEG will be planned and scheduled at the time of study enrollment, with every effort made 
to coordinate that appointment with another clinically -indicated appointment ( e.g.,  the pediatric neurology follow -
up clinic visit). This will minimize travel for infant and family and should enhance retention.  
 The family will be given a reminder telephone call several days before the 2 -4 month visit.  
 Contact [CONTACT_409056] 2 -4 month EEG.  
 If a family misses the [ADDRESS_515892] ed via telephone call within 3 days of the missed 
appointment. If there is no response, then an email will be sent after 5 -7 days and/or a telephone call will be placed 
to the alternate phone number. The EEG will be rescheduled if at all possible.  
 When the infant  reaches 11 months, a letter will be mailed and/or emailed to the  family, to remind them of the [ADDRESS_515893] them via telephone and/or email to confirm an appointment for the follow -up assessment.  
 In the event that an enrolled infant dies, the site’s electronic medical record will be updated per local protocol. 
Many of the sites utilize an electronic medical r ecord that automatically notifies a study team of a  participant’s  
death. The site study coordinators will verify that the patient is listed as living prior to extending an invitation for 
follow -up. If the patient is listed as deceased, the family will not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 If a family withdraws from the study, the coordinators will attempt to document the reason for withdrawal so that 
issues can be identified and addressed.  
Data Collection to Address Confounding: We will prospectively collect data for potential  confounders to allow for the 
planned propensity scoring analysis, including:  
 Term versus  preterm at birth  
 Confirmation of electrographic seizures versus  diagnosis on clinical grounds alone  
 Severity of seizures  
 Etiology of seizures  
 Number of seizure medica tions during the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Highest recorded phenobarbital level  
 Abnormal neurological examination (consciousness, tone, or reflexes) at the time of discharge  
 NICU length of stay  
 Institution

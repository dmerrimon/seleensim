Date:  2/19/[ADDRESS_343511]:  Recently there has been compelling evidence that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
subjects, both Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), commonly have disrupted sleep, 
and disrupted sleep correlates with the risk of disease flare.  Sleep/wake cycle, immune function, metabolism and multiple biological processes are all orchestrated by [CONTACT_281858]. Circadian misalignment between the central circadian clock in the brain and environment has been found to contribute to a variety of metabolic and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases.  Yet, the prevalence and impact of circadian misalignment on IBD disease activity and GIT mucosal inflammation have not been established.  The long-term objective of our research is to investigate the hypothesis that circadian malalignment worsens GIT mucosal inflammation and disease course in IBD.  To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective in lab study with human subjects on the impact of circadian misalignment in left sided mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis.  We will perform two circadian measures phase assessments under strictly controlled laboratory conditions at: 1) baseline, and after 2) circadian misalignment after three days of simulated night shifts in both inactive UC patients and healthy control subjects.   To test the hypothesis that UC patients (compared to healthy subject controls) are less resilient to circadian misalignment we will assess: time impact of our protocol on circadian rhythms (Aim 1) by [CONTACT_716]: phase angle of entrainment [time from dim light melatonin onset to sleep onset] (Aim1a);  peripheral circadian rhythms by [CONTACT_281859] a flexible sigmoidoscopy and in subjects peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Aim1b); and colonic clock gene expression and Per2::Luc activity over 24 hours utilizing an in-vitro model of colonic organoids (Aim1c).  Next, we will test the hypothesis that circadian misalignment will increase colonic permeability and mucosal inflammation in UC patients (vs. Controls) (Aim2) through the following: endoscopy score, stool calprotectin, colonic barrier (permeability, AJC proteins), and markers of systemic barrier function and inflammation (Aim 2a); adversely impacting microbial community structure/function (Aim 2b); and use 2D colonic organoid monolayers to explore ex-vivo barrier function by [CONTACT_3252]-culturing with TNF- α/INF-γ (Aim ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/2023 22c).  The results of this innovative proposal will greatly increase our understanding of the 
important role circadian misalignment may have in UC disease activity and colonic inflammation, and identify new circadian regulated targets for treatment in UC.
Objective:  The long-term objective of our research is to investigate the hypothesis that 
circadian misalignment worsens intestinal mucosal inflammation and disease course in IBD.  
Key evidence supporting this hypothesis include that disruption of circadian rhythms in the host impacts the intestinal barrier, microbiota composition, and mucosal/systemic immune function, all critical factors in the pathogenesis of IBD.  Data from rodents generated by [CONTACT_281860]: dark cycle (a model of shift work) or genetic circadian rhythm disruption (of a core clock gene) changes the intestinal microbial community, alters the production of microbial products like short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) resulting in colonic hyperpermeability through disruption of the api[INVESTIGATOR_281828] (AJC) in colonic IECs, increased mucosal inflammation, culminating in a more pro-inflammatory state in the intestine.11,24-27  In humans, shift work increases susceptibility of the colonic barrier to an injurious agent like alcohol and increases systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 β28 
and that chronic alterations in light:dark cycles in mouse models of IBD increase colitis severity and mortality.29,[ADDRESS_343512] shown that a later chronotype (Fig. 2A) and high variability in rest-activity rhythms (Fig. 2B) (both markers of circadian misalignment) are associated with worse IBD disease course, increased colonic permeability, alterations in the intestinal microbiota community (dysbiosis), and reduced colonic circadian clock gene expression.5,[ADDRESS_343513] comprehensive examination of human circadian rhythms in IBD.
Hypothesis:  Circadian misalignment worsens intestinal mucosal inflammation and disease 
course in IBD.
Specific Aims:
- Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that circadian misalignment is more prevalent in UC 
compared to healthy controls and that UC patients are more susceptible
- Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that circadian misalignment increases colonic permeability 
and mucosal inflammation through disrupting the AJC and adversely impacting microbial community structure / function in UC.  
Background:  A.1. IBD is Associated with Sleep Disruption.  Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative 
Colitis (UC), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are two devastating 
chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).  IBD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_281829], has no known cure, and has a chronic relapsing and remitting disease course that includes ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_343514] of $14 to 31 billion (31, 32). IBD has a heterogeneous disease course that commonly has an aggressive phenotype.  Identifying risk factors that can trigger disease flare and aggressive disease course are essential to avoid complications such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281830].  Factors that are associated with a more aggressive disease course include the use of prednisone or inability to wean off prednisone (steroid dependency), early age of diagnosis, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], need for IBD surgery, and the presence of fistulizing/stricturing perirectal disease in CD (33-35). However, these factors cannot fully explain the disease course in many patients.  Recently, there has been an increased awareness of the high prevalence of sleep disruption in IBD.  Our group was one of the first to report a high prevalence of sleep disturbances in IBD, (17, 36) and patients with IBD exhibit disrupted sleep (polysomnography) even when their disease is inactive.  A subsequent prospective cohort showed that ileo-cecal inflammation in CD correlates with poor sleep.16  In essence, IBD patients in clinical remission with poor sleep had higher subclinical disease activity compared to those IBD patients reporting good sleep.16  Thus, disrupted sleep/wake cycles, an important output of the circadian clock, can be one factor that triggers disease flare and promote progressive disease course; yet the impact of circadian rhythm disruption on disease pathogenesis has not been fully evaluated, which is one of the goals of this application.
A.2. Circadian Rhythms are Critical to Health.  Sleep, rest-wake activity, and multiple 
biological processes such as metabolism, (37) cell proliferation, (38) and immune activity39 are orchestrated by [CONTACT_281861] a roughly 24h cycle.  The discovery of the core molecular machinery of the master or central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)40 which consists of a transcription and translation feedback loop of positive factors (e.g., Clock, Bmal1) and negative repressors (e.g., Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2) has led to a number of key mechanistic discoveries regarding the circadian clock machinery and its functions that are critical for normal physiology and behavior.41-43  Synchronization of internal circadian clock with external environmental cues (e.g., light) is critical for good health,44-47 which is not surprising as the circadian clock is known to control the expression of 10-20% of the genes in the human body.48-50  In addition, peripheral clocks that contain the same core molecular machinery as in the SCN are found in cells of every organ in the body, including colonic IECs in the GIT.51,52  The GIT exhibits diurnal rhythms in many physiologic functions such as motility, intestinal transport, and IEC replication53 all of which are governed by [CONTACT_281862].  Circadian misalignment is a mismatch between the environmental cues (e.g., light) and the central clock in the SCN or a mismatch between the central and peripheral clocks which can occur due to shift work or consumption of a high fat diet, respectively (54, 55). Modern 24h society, with increased nighttime light exposure, light pollution, the increasing ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024

Thus, integrity of the intestinal barrier is critical for maintaining good health.  Indeed, disrupted intestinal barrier function (“leaky gut”), endotoxemia (i.e., high levels of systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species are all hallmarks of IBD.[ADDRESS_343517] of these environmental factors in chronic inflammatory disorders like IBD.  The intestinal barrier consists of the api[INVESTIGATOR_281828] (AJC), both tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) proteins, that links the IECs and seals the paracellular space to prevent translocation of pro-inflammatory bacteria and bacterial components such as LPS into the intestinal mucosa.71  IECs turnover every 4-5 days,72,73 replenished by a small population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and IEC regeneration and differentiation are essential to maintain barrier homeostasis.[ADDRESS_343518] both the intestinal barrier and the microbiota; therefore, it is important to determine if circadian misalignment is sufficient to induce changes in the GIT that promote intestinal inflammation and UC disease flare.

Protocol Version Date: 5/1/2023 5A.4. Circadian Rhythms are Critical to Maintain the Intestinal Barrier.  Intestinal barrier 
homeostasis is mediated by [CONTACT_12783]-talk between IECs and the intestinal microbiota.  This cross-talk occurs via multiple mechanisms including interactions with toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the IECs.[ADDRESS_343519] negatively impacts intestinal barrier integrity: (1) alcohol (0.2%) increases the expression of the circadian clock genes Clock and Per2 in a human IEC line (Caco-2 cells), and knock down of Clock or Per2 gene expression by [CONTACT_281863]-induced barrier dysfunction,82 (2) chronic disruption of the central clock by [CONTACT_281864]:dark cycles or a mutation in the core circadian molecular clock (i.e., Clock mutant mice) increases intestinal permeability and endotoxemia,26 (3) healthy night workers who consume alcohol (0.5g/kg daily for 7 days) have increased colonic permeability compared to healthy day workers consuming alcohol, and colonic permeability inversely correlates with decreased plasma melatonin over 24h,28 (4) our lab25 and others13,[ADDRESS_343520] causes microbial alterations with a decrease in bacteria (Firmicutes) that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) like butyrate (Bu),83 and (5) the core clock machinery (Bmal1) regulates IEC cell regeneration and barrier homeostasis.84,[ADDRESS_343521] chronic inflammation in IBD; however, the impact of circadian misalignment in humans with IBD has not been investigated.  Prior work in animal models of IBD by [CONTACT_27156]29 and others30 show that chronic disruption of central circadian rhythms in the host by [CONTACT_281865]:dark cycles causes significantly worse colitis and increases mortality by [CONTACT_281866] (DSS) (Fig. 1) or by [CONTACT_281867]/2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).  In addition, we recently found that an intestinal specific Bmal1 knock out mice develop worse DSS colitis with increased permeability despi[INVESTIGATOR_281831] (Fig. 1C&D) suggesting that influencing circadian rhythms in the GIT are sufficient to impact the barrier and mucosal inflammation.  Furthermore, a Per2 mutant mouse with increased Per2 activity had constitutively high levels of the tight junction proteins (TJP) occludin and claudin-1 in the colon, is resistant to DSS-induced colitis.86  In humans, genetic analysis found an association between polymorphisms in one of the core circadian clock genes Period 3 (Per3) and increased incidence of Crohn’s disease.87  Our group has conducted several studies in humans with IBD to examine the role of circadian rhythms: 1) We examined the association between chronotype (category of circadian timing) and IBD using two validated questionnaires – the Owl and Lark and Munich.  We found that a later chronotype is associated with a worse IBD quality of life, IBD subjects on aggressive medications (biologics) had a later midpoint of sleep, and Crohn’s subjects with increased social jet lag are more likely to have a ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024

are associated with IBD disease phenotype.  2) Our examination of endogenous salivary melatonin secretion in four subjects with inactive IBD, revealed that two of the subjects had low melatonin secretion compared to controls and the one had an arrhythmic profile,89 indicating circadian abnormalities are present in IBD patients.  3) We used wrist actigraphy to identify variations or instability in rest-wake activity that correlate to central circadian rhythms in inactive IBD subjects and found that there was less interdaily stability in IBD subjects with an aggressive disease course (history of fistulizing/stricturing disease in CD and history of surgery, steroid dependence, or biologic use in UC and CD ) and greater interdaily variability correlated with increased colonic permeability (Figs. 2B, 2C).  4) Examination of stool microbiota in inactive IBD subjects reveals changes in the microbiota that were associated with circadian misalignment.  For example, there is a significant decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria (Fig. 2D) and bifidobacterium longum which has been used as a treatment in active UC.90,91  Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that circadian rhythms influence the intestinal barrier and the intestinal microbiota; however, no human studies have comprehensively studied the central or peripheral circadian rhythms in IBD subjects by [CONTACT_281868] (DLMO) while examining subclinical inflammation and colonic barrier function, which is one of the goals of our current study. 
A.6. Importance of the Proposed Research.  There is a clear scientific rationale and crucial need 
to take the next step and more comprehensively assess central and peripheral circadian rhythms in IBD in order to determine the impact of circadian misalignment in IBD on colonic mucosal inflammation, subclinical systemic inflammation, barrier function, and intestinal microbiota.  In the proposed study, we will determine if patients with inactive UC have circadian misalignment of central and/or peripheral circadian rhythms and if they are more susceptible to circadian misalignment after a simulated night shift (Specific Aim 1) and determine if circadian misalignment impacts colonic barrier integrity and intestinal microbiota (Specific Aim 2).  We selected UC as a model of IBD because: (1) it always affects the rectum/sigmoid, thus it is relatively easy to access and obtain the required colonic intestinal tissue through sigmoidoscopy, (2) microbiota-directed interventions like fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appear to be more promising in UC than in CD,92,93 and (3) our data support that circadian misalignment has a substantial impact on the colonic barrier in UC subjects.  The knowledge gained from the proposed studies is likely to lead to the identification of new mechanisms of how circadian misalignment promotes chronic inflammation in IBD, and allow for the study of new chronobiological therapeutics in IBD that target circadian misalignment such as bright light therapy, exogenous melatonin, or other molecular targets associated with circadian misalignment induced in IBD.ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/2023 7Research Design:  40 human subjects will be recruited into this proposed study: 20 Healthy 
Controls and 20 UC subjects with left sided inactive disease (Mayo Score ≤ 2) on stable 
medications. All subjects (UC and HC) will undergo a full medical history and physical examination including a blood draw for the screening visit. A urine drug screening will take place on the subject’s first day at the sleep laboratory. Subjects who wish to participate will have the study explained by [CONTACT_281869] a Rush IRB-approved informed consent. All UC subjects will complete a validated questionnaire regarding disease-specific symptoms (Mayo Score) to determine they are inactive and may be enrolled in the study.
In addition, subjects will provide basic demographic data, UC history if appropriate, UC 
disease activity status as detailed further above, and the Munich Chronotype questionnaire. All subjects will complete a validated 3-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to collect dietary information (1). 40 participants (Specific Aims 1-2) will be enrolled for the within-subject prospective in-laboratory study protocols. Participants will be young (18-50 y), healthy, non-diabetic, non-obese, Caucasian/African American/Asian and non-Hispanic/Hispanic in ratios consistent with the population of Chicago, and without medication use (excepting oral contraceptives) for HC. HC and UC subjects will be matched according to age (  3 years), sex, 
race, and BMI (  3 kg/m2).  UC subjects will be on stable medications with no recent use of 
prednisone or antibiotics for the last [ADDRESS_343523] will fill out questionnaires ), start a food diary, and sleep diary, and have [ADDRESS_343524] actigraphy before their seven-day in lab session in the Clinical Chronobiology Center (CCC).

Sample Size Analysis:  All power estimates were computed using R package pwr, and we 
assume a Type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_343527] for all analyses.  Power estimates were 
derived from the data from my prior K grant.  The primary endpoints of this study will be phase angle/DLMO (Aim 1) and colonic permeability (13-24h urinary sucralose) (Aim 2).  For Aim 1, we found a ~2h phase advance in DLMO in NW compared to DW at -0.2 (SD=2.1) compared to -4.34 (SD=3.8), respectively.

Of those remaining individuals, 33% pass the medical and psychological screening (described below), and of these, 70% complete the study.
In this study we will recruit 40 Human Subjects in the following two groups:
1) Ulcerative Colitis (UC) (n=20). 2) Healthy Controls (HC) (n=20).  
Each potential subject will undergo an extensive screening procedure prior to 
participation in the study. The procedure begins with a telephone screening, involving a series of questions from a preliminary screening questionnaire and answering any questions potential subjects may have about the study. If the original preliminary telephone screening questionnaire reveals no grounds for exclusion (see "Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria" below), then potential subjects are asked to come to our clinic for a physical examination. These patients will all be interviewed by [CONTACT_281871] a full physical exam by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_63124] a licensed Gastroenterologist. Potential subjects will also complete several questionnaires to determine their suitability for study.  Each potential subject is given a tour of the Clinical Chronobiology Center (CCC) in which they will live during the temporal isolation portion of the study. Every attempt will be made to acquaint each prospective subject with all of the procedures involved in this study in order to minimize the possible effect of uncertainty about the experimental procedures on the results. Written informed consent on an RUMC IRB-approved form will be obtained from each subject before his/her study begins. Each subject will be told that they will be free to discontinue participation in the experiment at any time and that the investigators also reserve the right to discontinue the study for medical or other reasons at any time.ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/2023 11Early Withdrawal:  Participants may withdraw at any time.
Procedures:   After consenting for the study all subjects: 1) Will be interviewed by a study 
coordinator and fill out detailed questionnaires so that we can collect demographic data, 
medical history, data on disease status and research questionnaires; 2) Will supply blood and urine samples (to assess the inclusion/exclusion criteria and to obtain baseline biological markers; 3) Will undergo an exam by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ali Keshavarzian to assess the inclusion/exclusion criteria and to obtain baseline UC disease characteristics and have initial blood drawn/urine sample. 4) After interviews and exam and blood/urine analysis, as part of the screening process, eligible patients will be asked to continue participation and will be re-informed about the study.
All experimental procedures will commence after admission to the CCC for a [ADDRESS_343533] Day 1 (TD1, Baseline alignment), at 0900h all subjects will have a unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) with rectal biopsy collection (19 biopsies, ~15 cm from the anal verge), after which intestinal permeability will be assessed (24h urine collection after ingestion of a sugar cocktail: sucrose, mannitol, lactulose, sucralose103), and every 2 hour blood sampling during/surrounding standardized meals (primary and secondary outcomes for Specific Aims 1 & 2).  During the last 8h of the phase assessment, subjects will be exposed to a background illumination ~3 lux to assess the endogenous circadian phase through hourly plasma melatonin (dim light melatonin onset, DLMO).  On Protocol Day 3, subject behavioral cycles will be shifted by 12h, and this schedule will be maintained until Protocol Day 7.  Following the short 4h sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_281834] 3, subjects will have 3 “night shift” days (Days 3-5).  The 12h shift on Day 3 will be achieved by [CONTACT_281872] 8h wake epi[INVESTIGATOR_36192] a 4h sleep opportunity, thereby [CONTACT_281873]-to-wake ratio (1:2).  The rationale for the 12h inversion of the sleep-wake timing is that we previously found that the influence of circadian misalignment on physiological variables are maximal when the sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycle was shifted by ~12h relative to the endogenous circadian timing system.19,[ADDRESS_343534] Day 2 (TD2, Circadian misalignment), all subjects will have all the identical tests conducted as described on TD1; however, the FS and start of repeated measures will be at 2100 h – matched to the sleep/wake cycle and not clock time to isolate the impact of circadian misalignment.

Blood draw.  Blood (30 cc) will be drawn in endotoxin free tube and serum then 
immediately separated and stored in -80ºC freezer until measurement for Serum endotoxin 
(END). Blood will also be drawn for CBC, comprehensive biochemical profile [CMP that includes ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024

additional 10 ml will be collected from patients on biologics, to evaluate antibody levels. 
All subjects will complete an IBDQ, FFQ, BDI, STAI, PSQ, Munich Chronotype, IRLS, 
Demographic Questionnaire, Mayo Score, CSD-C  (Consensus Sleep Diary), and Berlin 
Questionnaire. All information collected from subjects will be used for research purposes only.  
All the procedures in the study (blood draw, stool samples, urine samples, sigmoidoscopy with 
biopsies and questionnaires) are well-established and considered routine tests in clinical practice (including flexible sigmoidoscopy).
Diet Assessments:  Meal habits will be recorded during screening.  All subjects must eat 
breakfast (>200 kcal) at least 5 days a week, and subjects unusual diets by [CONTACT_281874] (vegan or gluten 
free) will be excluded due to impact on microbiota. For two weeks prior to each inpatient laboratory stay, all subjects will undergo ambulatory monitoring of their general activity using a small wrist activity monitor for ensuring compliance with the sleep-wake schedule. In addition, subjects will be provided meals for the last [ADDRESS_343538] or present psychopathology. Finally, a clinical interview will be carried out on all potential subjects to determine their suitability for the study and their ability to tolerate the conditions of the simulated night shifts environment (with regular contact [CONTACT_281875]). All volunteers selected must be drug-free with only moderate or no use of caffeine, alcohol, or other compounds by [CONTACT_969], which will be verified during the screening process by [CONTACT_281876]. Caffeine, alcohol, or other compounds (including herbal medications/remedies) will not be permitted for three weeks immediately prior to admission to the Clinical Chronobiology Center (CCC), and a urinary comprehensive toxic analysis will be carried out upon admission to ensure compliance. Prescribed medications are also prohibited with some exceptions.
Sleep Assessment:  We will use a structured sleep questionnaire, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_281835], to access sleep habits.  In addition, a Beck's depression index will be completed 
to evaluate a common confounder in sleep, depression.  [ADDRESS_343539] actigraphy monitor (Actiwatch-L, Spectrum, Bend OR).  
Phlebotomy:  There may be some discomfort or bruising on the initial insertion of the 
catheter into a vein, but wearing the catheter should not be painful. Occasionally,  mild  
discomfort  may  occur from  the catheterin  the  vein.  If this happens, it can  be repositioned or removed, asking the subject's permission before any subsequent reinsertion.  To help keep ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024

Saliva Collection:  Participants will be asked to produce a saliva sample on days 2-6 at 7 
am and 7 pm. They will be provided a conical tube to spit into.  A minimum of 2 ml is needed. To minimize contamination, participants will be instructed to not brush their teeth, use mouthwash, eat, or drink anything (except water) at least [ADDRESS_343541] 500ul of saliva + 500ul of Zymo DNA/RNA 2x solution. The second cryovial will be 500ul of saliva flash frozen. These samples will be used for analysis of inflammatory cytokines and 16S sequencing. Core temperature device: On Day 2 and 5 participants will be given a Core device, a non-medical device that will measure their body core temperature. Body temperature will be used to measure the central circadian rhythm. The device will be programmed with the participant’s study unique ID and it will be secured on their chest via medical grade adhesives when they get their catheter inserted on day 2 and 5.  After activation, the device automatically collects and transmits core temperature data to our database. Once the day is completed the device will be removed from the participant’s chest, the adhesive patches will be tossed out and the device will be disinfected.  
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy:  At two points in the study subjects will have an unprepped 
limited flexible sigmoidoscopy by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Keshavarzian and sigmoid mucosal samples will be 
collected:19 endoscopic pi[INVESTIGATOR_281836]: (a) two formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded for histology, (b) two OCT fixed for immunohistochemistry of AJC proteins, (c) two RNA Later for RT-PCR of AJC protein mRNA expression, (d) five snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blot assessment of AJC proteins, (e) two snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for microbiota interrogation, and (f) six fresh samples to generate colonoids.   Frozen samples will be transferred from liquid nitrogen tank to -80ºC freezer within 8-12 hours.ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024

Study Outcomes:  
Primary outcome measures:
-Aim 1  – Circadian Misalignment of central clock: Phase Angle will be measured as the 
difference between circadian clock (dim light melatonin onset) and behavior cycle (sleep onset)
-Aim 2  – Barrier Function: Mayo Endoscopic Score and Intestinal permeability will be 
measured including 12-24-h urinary sucralose (primarily representing colonic permeability)
Secondary outcome measures:-Aim 1  – Circadian Misalignment of peripheral clocks: Clock gene expression (CLOCK, 
BMAL) in PBMCs during each phase assessment and in colonic biopsies
-Aim 2  – Barrier Function: Colonic mucosal AJC proteins (E-cadherin, occludin, 
claudin2,3,4), stool calprotectin and mucosal and stool microbiota composition and function. Studies will include serum markers of intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP)]; serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid protein; immune changes (serum interleukin-6 as proinflammatory marker and soluble CD14 as marker of macrophage/monocyte ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/2023 16activation); and stool and serum metabolomics: short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and 
Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and TMA.
Exploratory Outcome Measures:•Aim 1 – Colonic clock gene expression and Per2::Luc activity in colonic organoids over 24 
hours in both groups and each condition
•Aim 2 – RNA seq of colonic organoids every 2 hours for over 24 hours to identify key 
molecular and inflammatory pathways under circadian regulation
•Aim 3 :  Use body temperature to measure central circadian rhythm to see if it correlates 
with melatonin levels at baseline and after misalignment

Safety and Adverse Events:  We have identified five key potential risks to human subjects in this 
study:
1. Risk to Confidentiality and Record-Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_281839] (PHI).
2. Risk of potential side effects associated with Phlebotomy (blood draw).3. Risk of potential side effects associated with Sigmoidoscopy and Colonic Biopsy.4. Risk of potential side effects associated with completion of the Questionnaires.5. Risk of potential side effects associated with in lab study
Minimizing Risk:
1.Maintenance of Confidentiality and Record-Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Subject confidentiality will be 
protected by [CONTACT_281880] a double lock and kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Electronic records are within the RUMC firewall and password protected. Data of subjects will only be associated with a coded identification number, having had all identifying information removed. Patient PHI information will be available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_281840].
2.Minimize the risk of potential side effects associated with Phlebotomy.  Blood will be 
drawn over two [ADDRESS_343547]'s permission before any subsequent reinsertion.  To help keep the venipuncture site clean, we may ask permission to shave the forearm hair of the subject prior to insertion of the IV.  There is a rare possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a small blood clot, inflammation, or local infection around the vein where the catheter is inserted, or in rare cases a generalized infection spread through the bloodstream as a result of the IV catheter.  Occasionally, there is a black and blue mark at the site of the IV insertion, which may last a couple of weeks; and, rarely, a small scar may remain permanently at the venipuncture site.  A standard laboratory protocol for surveillance for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia will be followed during the protocol. This consists of monitoring the subject’s platelet levels at baseline and every 2 days, when signs of any heparin-induced thrombocytopenia would be expected to appear. ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_343548] dermatitis.  The IV catheter insertion site will be checked every 24-36 hours for signs of infection by [CONTACT_281881]. The IV catheter dressing, the IV bag/bottle, the IV tubing and manifold and the antibacterial ointment will be changed every 24-[ADDRESS_343549]’s vital signs will be checked at least once per day. This will include pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
3.Minimize the risk of potential side effects associated with Sigmoidoscopy.  The primary 
risk for most subjects undergoing sigmoidoscopy and biopsy is minimal discomfort during sigmoidoscopic examination. Risks include discomfort from air being added into the colon, bloating much like gas pain, possible irritation and a small amount of blood loss.  On extremely rare occasions (1 in 17,000), the procedure can cause a tear or hole in the lining of the colon or significant bleeding.  This may require surgery to repair.  The PI (GS), who will perform all sigmoidoscopic examinations, is an experienced gastroenterologist with extensive experience in endoscopy over the last 10+ years. He has never experienced any subject complications while performing thousands of sigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, these sigmoidoscopic examinations will be limited to the most distal 15 to 20cm of the rectum and sigmoid rather than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], routine examination that requires advancing the scope to 45 to 60 cm (this shorter advancement of the scope is adequate to determine whether there is active disease and to obtain biopsies). Thus, discomfort and risk will be markedly lower than routine testing.  Thus, unlike in routine sigmoidoscopy, we will do the procedure without any colon preparation (eliminate discomfort associated with laxative) and to a more limited extent. This limited procedure is not associated with any significant discomfort (no need to negotiate colon flexures that is the main source of discomfort associated with endoscopic procedures) and significantly decreases (and in fact eliminates) the tiny risk of perforation (< 1/10,000) associated with routine sigmoidoscopy. This opi[INVESTIGATOR_281841]’s 30+ years of experience performing limited sigmoidoscopy in research subjects in our sections and also based on personal experience—the PI (GS) has been a “healthy control” subject in several prior studies and has undergone this limited sigmoidoscopy and biopsy.  The biopsy procedure is routine and painless with a tiny risk (< 1/10,000) of significant bleeding. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_281842]: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_343550] 10+ years.  The expertise and experience of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_281843]. Plan to deal with complications. Subjects with possible complications will be seen by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_97318] (within a few hours), regardless of the time of day. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_281844] 24/7.  These subjects will be evaluated, and if necessary, will undergo additional testing, such as CBC and KUB.  If there is evidence of bleeding or perforation, the subject will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281845]. As stated above, we do not expect any complications such as bleeding or perforation. Subjects will have blood tests, including prothrombin time and platelet count, to avoid biopsy procedures in those with a bleeding disorder.  
4.Minimize the risk of potential side effects associated with completion of the 
Questionnaires.   We have taken steps to reduce the risk of discomfort associated with 
answering medical/personal questions by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_281846]’s responses completely confidential (including not sharing an individual’s responses with their physician), allowing participants to leave blank any questions that may make them uncomfortable on any of the forms, and providing brief assessment/counseling by [CONTACT_281882] [INVESTIGATOR_281847]. If a participant appears to have difficulty reading, they can choose to have the questionnaires read to them.  
5.Minimize the risk of potential side effects associated with in lab stay.   The subject may 
become sleepy during some segments of the study. The subject will be asked to remain awake during the entirety of their scheduled wake times. Should the subject feel that he/she is unable to remain awake, he/she is free to withdraw his/her consent to participate in this experiment and then go to sleep.  At the end of the study, the subject may have difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_281848]. It may take several days to readjust to their regular routine. This experience is similar to jet lag, and may be associated with upset stomach, insomnia, irritability, or excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The protocol is designed so that changes in circadian phase are minimized. Subjects may not sleep as well in the laboratory as they do when at home. This may be exacerbated during the simulated night shift when subjects remain continuously awake. Nevertheless, short term partial sleep loss has never been shown to be directly deleterious to health although sleep loss can cause drowsiness and increase the risk of accidents. While dangerous accidents are unlikely in the controlled environment of the laboratory, we have less control when subjects leave the laboratory. Thus, we will ensure that the subject fully appreciates this risk and they will be given the opportunity ORA: 19051402-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 7/31/2023   Amendment Date: 2/21/2024
Protocol Version Date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_343551]:  Although the study physician and coordinators will evaluate a 
participant’s comfort level prior to the participant staying in the sleep lab and during their in-
person stay, the study will have a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. The board will convene every six months to evaluate the study data for participant safety, study conduct, and progress, and make recommendations if applicable. This will ensure that the study participant’s safety is always being evaluated and improved.

Title of Study: 
A Randomized Parallel -Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Tolerability of Two Dosing 
Regimens of CTP -543 in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Alopecia Areata  
Study center(s):  Multi center study; approximately  10 sites; Canada  and [LOCATION_002]  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: Q2 [ADDRESS_1015610] patient completed: Q1 2020 Phase of development: 2 
Objectives: 
The overall objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 24 mg total daily 
dose of CTP-543 utilizing two different dosing regimens in adult patients with chronic, moderate to 
severe alopecia areata.  
The secondary /exploratory  objectives of the study are to assess the proportion of patients achieving 
defined  threshold reductions in SALT score,  and for patients to assess their eyebrows , hair coverage 
and hair coverage quality .    
Methodology: 
This is a  randomized,  multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two dosing 
regimens of CTP-543 (12 mg BID vs 24  mg QD), in adult patients with chronic,  moderate to severe 
alopecia areata.  Patients will be between 18 and 65 years of age  (inclusive),  and experiencing an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_742891] [ADDRESS_1015611] 50 % hair 
loss as measured by [CONTACT_742909], and are not concurrently being treated for 
alopecia areata with other treatments that might affect hair regrowth or immune response .  Up to 
approximately 75% of alopecia areata patients with al opecia totalis or universalis, and no more than  
10% with only alopecia ophiasis will be enrolled.   
Subjects will be s creen ed up to 28 days prior to initiation of study drug .  The Treatment Period is a 
24-week dosing period where patients will be randomized  to receive either  CTP-543 12 mg BID  or 
CTP-543 24 mg QD  and will be an alyzed for the primary endpoint  of the study.  To minimize bias in 
the evaluation of study endpoints , patients , investigators,  and site personnel will be made unaware  of 
the active drug dosing regimen by [CONTACT_17801] 2 x 12 mg tablets and 2 x placebo tablets 12 hours 
apart from each other for the 24 mg QD study group .

Study Design  
Patients will provide informed consent prior to initiating  any screening procedures.  Patients meeting 
screening criteria will continue to the Day 1 Randomization Visit for review of eligibility and 
baseline assessments, including SALT assessment, physical  examination, clinical laboratory 
assessments, vital signs, and electrocardiogram , Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for eyebrows , Clinic al 
Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S), Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S), and Patient 
Satisfaction questions . Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1 of 2 CTP -543 
treatment arms.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_742910]: 1) alopecia areata, 2) alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, or 3) 
alopecia ophiasis.   
Patients will take the first dose of study drug in the clinic on Day 1.   Patients will be instructed to take 
study drug every [ADDRESS_1015612] 24 weeks to assess  CTP-543 dosed BID vs CTP -543 dosed QD.  
Assess ment of treatment response with SALT for efficacy will occur at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks.   
Upon completion of the 24 -week Treatment Period , patients will be eligible to either complete 
treatment and exit the study  following the safety follow -up visit , or roll -over into a an open -label 
extension study.

NTRODUCTION 
4.1. Overview of Alopecia Areata 
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder characterized by [CONTACT_580359]-scarring alopecia 
affecting scalp and body hair.  Alopecia areata is clinically heterogeneous, affects men and 
women, and has a prevalence rate of 0.1% to 0.2% of the [LOCATION_002] population [ Safavi 1992]. 
The
re is no preventative therapy or cure.  Alopecia areata often presents as a cyclical disorder 
marked by [CONTACT_742916], and variation in the 
degree or pattern of hair loss gives rise to different subtypes of alopecia areata, such as patchy, 
ophiasis, totalis, or universalis.  Approximately 7% of patients have severe disease with almost 
complete hair loss and little or no regrowth [ Villasante Fricke 2015].  Onset can occur at any age 
a
nd affects both men and women over the course of their lifetime. Approximately 80% of 
alopecia areata patients experience the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_580329] 40 years of age and 40% by 
20 years of age [ Villasante Fricke 2015].  Alopecia areata can have a psychological impact with 
hig
h rates of depression [ Sellami 2014 ] and anxiety reported, particularly in children and 
a
dolescents [ Bilgic 2013], and therefore, psychological counseling is often recommended as part 
of 
the standard of care [ Al-Mutairi 2011].  
A c
ause for alopecia areata has not yet been identified, though as in other autoimmune disorders, 
genetic susceptibility and a wide array of environmental triggers are thought to be involved. 
Presently, treatments for alopecia areata include moderately effective intralesional corticosteroid 
injections or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], or aesthetic disguises such as makeup and wigs.  Currently, no existing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580330] (FDA), indicating a significant unmet medical need.  
4.2. Rationale for the Study 
4.2.1. S cientific Rationale 
CTP-543 is a deuterated form of ruxolitinib (Jakafi), a selective JAK inhibitor that modulates 
im
mune response through reduced intracellular JAK1 and JAK2 signaling.  There is growing 
evidence that hair loss in AA may be mediated by [CONTACT_28746] T cell attack of the hair follicle after 
loss
 of immune privilege, and that this process may be regulated by [CONTACT_742917] 
(Xing, 2014 ).   
The JAKs are intracellular tyrosine kinases that play a central role in the signaling of cytokine 
and growth factor receptors (Ghoreschi, 2009).   Cytokine-induced receptor conformation 
c
hanges activate the JAKs and trigger phosphorylation of the 6-member signal transducers and 
activators of transcription (STAT) protein transcription factor family.  Upon phosphorylation, 
S
TATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580331], psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple 
JAK inhibitors are in development for autoimmune disorders such as atopic dermatitis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus and others  (L evy, 2015 ). 
In nonclinical pharmacology testing, it was confirmed that CTP-543 inhibited cytokine-
stimulated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins in 
human cells, suggesting that suppression of JAK/STAT signaling is the primary mechanism of 
action for CTP-543.  In in vitro  kinase inhibition assays, the target potency and selectivity profile 
of CTP
-543 for the JAK kinases JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 was as shown in Ta ble 2.

Based on the data for CTP-543 summarized above, and published clinical data for other JAK 
inhibitors, including ruxolitinib, baricitinib and tofacitinib ( Xing, 2014;  Craiglow, 2014 ; 
Ma
ckay -Wiggan, 2016 ; Jabbari et al, 2015 ; H arris 2016 ; Crispin, 2016 ; Liu, 2018 ), JAK 
inhi
bition may represent a viable therapeutic approach to treating AA, thus supporting Concert’s 
development of C TP-543 as a potential oral treatment for AA.  
Concert Pharmaceuticals is currently conducting a  Phase 2 study  CP543.2001 , “A D ouble- Blind, 
Randomized, Placebo Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CTP -543 in Adult 
Patients with Moderate to  Severe Alopecia Areata ”.   
Study CP543.2001 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 125 
adults with moderate- to-severe alopecia areata.  Patients were sequentially randomized to receive 
one of three doses of CTP-543 (4, 8, 12 mg twice daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. 
Dos
ing Regimen and Dose Selection Rationale 
Analyses sugges t that across acute and c hronic disease states, reducing dosage frequency from 
multiple dosing to QD dosing may improve
 adherence to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742896] , and may 
re
sult in subsequent decreases in health care costs  (S rivastava , 2013) .  Therefore, Concert will 
explore further the tolerability and efficacy of BID versus QD dosing with CTP -543.   
The selection of the 12 mg BID and 24 mg QD dose of CTP-543 for this study is supported by 
[CONTACT_742918]-543 observed in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy 
volunteers as well as safety and efficacy data from an ongoing Phase 2 study in patients with 
moderate to severe AA.  
In the MAD study, doses of CTP-543 up to 16 mg BID and 32 mg QD were administered for 7 
consecutive days and appeared to be generally well-tolerated.  The MAD study, along with the 
pre
clinical safety package for the compound, supported the advancement of CTP-543 into an 
initial Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AA (CP543.2001).   
CP543.[ADDRESS_1015635] been 
reported for the 4 mg BID and 8 mg BID cohorts.   
The primary efficacy endpoint in the 8 mg twice-daily cohort was met with 47% of patients 
achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in their overall SALT score from baseline compared to placebo 
(p<
0.001).  In the 4 mg twice-daily cohort there was a 21% response; however, this was not 
significantly different from placebo.   
CTP-543 25 July 2019 
Protocol CP543.2003 Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 25 An inde
pendent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) was chartered for this study to routinely 
assess accumulated safety data.  The DMC met at predetermined intervals, to review existing 
unblinded safety data and to make recommendations whether to continue the existing protocol as 
planne
d and proceed to the next cohort or to modify the protocol based on the accumulated 
safety data.  Following a review of accumulated safety data for the 4 mg BID and 8 mg BID, the 
DMC were requested to review the available safety data to-date to determine if the safety data 
support the addition of an additional cohort of subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 
12 mg BID dose of CTP-543.   Based on a review of the accumulated safety data to-date, the 
DMC 
made the recommendation th a t escalation from the 8 mg BID cohort to the 12 mg BID 
cohort was warranted.  Subsequently, the CP543.2001 clinical protocol was submitted to the 
Food and Drug Administration (F
DA).  Consequently, agreement to include an additional Cohort 
of subjects for the evaluation of a [ADDRESS_1015636] meeting of the 12 mg BID cohort to review 
a
ccumulated safety data to-date and agreed that the study should proceed as planned with no 
modifications to the protocol.  To-date, the 12 mg BID dose appears to be generally well 
tolerated with no dose interruptions due to hematologic abnormalities.  
The purpose of this current proposed study is to compare efficacy and safety of a 12 mg BID vs 
24 mg CTP-543 administered once daily. There is evidence with ruxolitinib (the non-deuterated 
form of CTP-543) in healthy volunteers that even with greater overall drug exposure, QD dosing 
may be better tolerated than BID dosing as evidenced by a higher maximum tolerated dose (Shi, 
et al, 2011). Therefore, given the approval of the DMC to study the 12 mg BID dose in the 
ong
oing Phase 2 study and no safety data to date suggesting dose intolerability, there is 
reasonable justification to study 12 mg BID and the daily equivalent dose of 24 mg QD in this 
study.

stud
y was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CTP-543 in 
healthy volunteers.  A total of 82 subjects were planned for the study; 32 subjects in 4 cohorts 
randomized at a ratio of 3:1 CTP-543 to placebo for the single ascending dose part (Part A), and 
ther
eafter, 50 subjects in 5 cohorts randomized at a ratio of 4:1 CTP-543 to placebo for the

tiple ascending dose part (Part B). The doses studied in the single ascending dose study were 
8 mg
, 16 mg, 32 mg, and 48 mg. The doses studied in the multiple ascending dose study were 8 
mg once daily, 8 mg twice daily, 24 mg once daily, 32 mg once daily, and 16 mg twice daily, 
dosed for 7 consecutive days. 
The second clinical study CP543.1002, also performed in healthy volunteers was a single dose 
cross-over study to assess safety and tolerability and to compare the metabolite and 
pharmacokinetic profiles of CTP-543 versus ruxolitinib. A total of 12 subjects were enrolled in 
the stud
y; 2 groups of 6 subjects each were dosed with either 15 mg of ruxolitinib (1 x 15 mg 
tablet) or 16 mg of CTP-543 (2 x 8 mg tablets) in period 1 who then crossed over to the alternate 
treatment for period 2.

DY OBJECTIVES 
The overall objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 24 mg total 
daily dose of CTP-543 utilizing two different dosing regimens in adult patients with chronic, 
moder
ate to severe alopecia areata. 
The secondary/exploratory objectives of the study are to assess the proportion of patients 
a
chieving defined threshold reductions in SALT score, and for patients to assess their eyebrows, 
ha
ir coverage and hair coverage quality.

.3 Study Design 
This is a randomized, parallel group multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 
two dosing regimens of CTP-543 (12 mg BID vs 24 mg QD), in adult patients with chronic, 
moderate to severe 
alopecia areata.  Patients will be between [ADDRESS_1015640] 50% hair loss as measured by [CONTACT_742909], and are not 
concurrently being treated for alopecia areata with other treatments that might affect hair 
regrowth or immune response. Up to approximately 75% of alopecia areata patients with 
alopecia totalis or universalis, and no more than 10% with only alopecia ophiasis will be 
enrolled.  
Patients may be screened up to 28-days prior to initiation of study drug.  The Treatment Period is 
a
 24-week dosing period where patients will be randomized to receive either CTP-543 12 mg 
B
ID, or CTP-543 24 mg QD and will be analyzed for the primary endpoints of the study.  To

DY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
The schedule of assessments and procedures is presented in Table 1 should be referenced for 
de
tails regarding the collection of each assessment at each visit. 
9
.1. Demographic Characteristics and Medical and Surgical Histo ry 
Demographic characteristics (i.e., sex, ethnic origin, date of birth) will be collected at the 
S
creening Visit, between Day -28 and -1, and detailed on the eCRF.  
The
 patient’s alopecia areata will be classified by [CONTACT_742923]: 
1) Alopecia areata: patchy type hair loss, 
2) Alopecia totalis or universalis: complete hair loss on the scalp with or without body hair 
loss, 
3) Alopecia ophiasis: band-like hair loss limited to the periphery of the scalp along the back 
of the hair line in the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_742905]. 
Key criteria that distinguish alopecia areata from other forms of hair loss may include abrupt 
onset of disease, a history of recurrence and spontaneous remission, response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_742906], and distribution of hair loss pattern. Care must be taken during the 
evaluation to assess for other causes of hair loss such as trichotillomania, or scarring alopecia 
and other forms of non-scarring alopecia. Evidence of thinning hair should be distinguished from 
pa
ttern hair loss or telogen effluvium and evidence of inflammation should be investigated to 
rule out infection, as appropriate. 
Thorough medical history , including current me dications, nail and facial hair involvement, co-
morbidi
ties, serious infection history and exposure risk, including HIV, as well as history or 
va
ccination against herpes zoster will be collected at the Screening Visit, and at the 
R
andomization Visi
t on Day 1. 
Medical history should be thoroughly probed for potential exposure to serious infections such as 
HIV, history or vaccination against herpes zoster, as well as cancer risk due to the potential 
immunosuppressive properties of CTP-543 and known adverse events associated with JAK 
inhibitors. 
9.2. Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) 
The SALT score was introduced as part of investigative guidelines published by [CONTACT_580376] [ Olsen 2004].  The SALT is a measure of hair absence that 
qua
ntifies the amount of scalp surface without hair in a pre-specified quadrant of the scalp (right 
side, top, left side, back), that is further summed after applying a quadrant-specific multiplier 
indicative of scalp surface area contribution, to provide an overall score of total hair loss.  The 
S
ALT assessment will occur via live examination of the patient by [CONTACT_742924].   
SALT will be used to determine efficacy for the study.  To reduce variability, one rater, 
whe
never possible, should perform the SALT assessment for the patient for the duration of the 
stud
y.  All investigators using the SALT should be trained prior to use.  Please consult the 
associated Site Study Manual for additional details regarding SALT scoring and training

.3. Photographs 
Sites may take photographs of their patient’s scalps to provide visual support of Baseline 
a
ssessment of SALT as well as potential changes in SALT scores throughout the study. No 
a
nalyses of photographs will occur.  The photographs will correspond to the 4 defined quadrants 
of
 the SALT assessment and will be taken when SALT assessments are performed.  
F
or those patients with eye and nail involvement in their alopecia areata phenotype, a photograph 
of the eyes and hands for eyelash/eyebrow and nail involvement, respectively, may be taken to 
document potential changes throughout the study compared to Baseline. No formal analyses of 
photographs will occur.  
9.4. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Eyebrows 
The visual analog scale is a scale of continuous measure initially developed for pain that has 
been used in a variety of clinical settings where the endpoint of interest is based on a subjective 
perception.  The visual analog scale is a distinct 100 millimeter line anchored on the left end at 
full degree of impairment and on the right end at no degree of impairment, where indication of 
the degree of impairment perceived at the time of assessment is captured by [CONTACT_742925]. The measured distance of the mark 
from the left anchor will be recorded in millimeters.  
As specified in the Schedule of Events, patients will rate his/her eyebrows on the patient VAS. 
The left and right anchor points for the patient’s eyebrow VAS are “None” and “Full”, 
respectively.  The patient VAS for eyebrows will measure the patient’s eyebrows at the time of 
c
ompletion.  An example of the patient VAS for eyebrows is provided in Appendix  16.3.

.5.  Global Impression Scales 
The Global Impression Scales are measures commonly used in clinical trials to allow integration 
of se
veral sources of information into a single rating of the patient’s condition. The Global 
Impression Scales employ a Likert scale measuring either disease state severity or improvement 
after treatment. 
In this study, the Global Impression Scales of Improvement and Severity will be performed by 
[CONTACT_17588] t
he clinician and the patient at selected times during the study as indicated in Table 1 . The 
Globa
l Impression of Severity should consider the condition of the patient at the time of the 
assessment. The Global Impression Scale of Improvement will consider the condition of the 
patient at the time of the 
assessment compared to Baseline. 
9.5.1  Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI- I) 
The
 Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement will be assessed by [CONTACT_742926]’s perceived change of the patient’s alopecia areata at the time of 
the assessment compared to Ba
seline.  The Investigator may select one of seven numeric choices 
representi
ng “Very Much Worse” to “Very Much Improved”. To reduce variability, one rater 
should perform the CGI-I assessment for the patient for the duration of the study. An example of 
the CGI-I is provided in Appendix 16.4.1.

9.11. Unscheduled Visit 
In addition to regularly scheduled protocol visits, an Unscheduled Visit may be conducted to 
e
nsure appropriate safety monitoring or follow-up of the patient, at the discretion of the

interruption or resumption of dosing thereafter, or for other clinical signs, symptoms, or 
c
onsiderations that warrant additional safety follow-up. Only those criteria requiring additional 
mon
itoring should be performed at an Unscheduled Visit. An Unscheduled Visit will not replace 
re

during the course of a study.  It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant 
illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient’s health, including laboratory test 
values, regardless of etiology.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an adverse event.  A 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than the 
individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. A worsening of the condition under 
study, alopecia areata, will not be reported as an adverse event.  
All patients will be monitored for adverse events during the study.  Assessments may include 
monitoring of the following parameters:  the patient’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, physical 
examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. 
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug (i.e., 
Day 1), will be considered a pretreatment adverse event and will be captured on the eCRF.  
Adve
rse events will be considered treatment-emergent if the onset is after the first dose of study 
drug or if an ongoing Adverse Event worsens after dosing is initiated.   
L
aboratory results deemed Abnormal and clinically significant by [CONTACT_742932].   
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.   
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the adverse 
event.  If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not 
sim
ply as an abnormal laboratory result (e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased 
plate
lets). 
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/intensity, 
re
lationship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.   
10.2.1.
 Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that 
fulf
ills the following criteria: 
Is fatal (results in death);
Is life- threatening (Note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that
could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
CTP-543 25 July 2019 
Protocol CP543.2003 Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 47 R
esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the
patient's ability to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or
Constitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the patient or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
Events not considered  to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
A pr
ocedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., sampling for laboratory,
pharmacokinetic, and pha
rmacodynamic tests).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159074] a complication of such procedures remains a reportable
serious adverse event.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social
reasons, in absence of an adverse event.
A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on study);
must
 be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159074] a complication remains a reportable serious adverse
event.
An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing medical condition
that does not worsen.
Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission,
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an adverse event is considered serious, the adverse event eCRF must be completed. 
For each serious adverse event, the Investigator  will provide information on severity, start and 
stop dates, relationship to investigational product, action taken regarding investigational product, 
and outcome. 
Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will be handled through the electronic data capture 
s
ystem or other appropriate means.  Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be 
ha
ndled by [CONTACT_756]. 
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity 
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the 
se
verity/intensity of the event.  
T
he National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) 
Version 4.0 should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events.  These criteria will be 
provided in the Site
 Operations Manual.  If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the Investigator 
shoul
d grade the severity according to the following criteria:  
Grade 1 (mild ): does not interfere with the patient’s usual function
CTP-543 25 July 2019 
Protocol CP543.2003 Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 48 Gr
ade 2 (moderate) : int erferes to some extent with patient's usual function
Gr
ade 3 (severe) : interferes significantly with patient's usual function
Grade 4 (life-threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating disability
Grade 5 (death): results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
10.2.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event 
based on currently available information.  Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as 
additional information becomes available.  Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_324552]: 
Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].  The event resolves or improves upon withdrawal 
of drug (de-challenge).  The event would be considered as definitely related to the study drug 
upon results of a positive re-challenge procedure. 
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
withi
n a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication).  However, the influence of 
other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other 
c
oncurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is unlikely, and the event follows a 
c
linically reasonable response upon withdrawal of drug (de-challenge).   
P
ossibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable ti
me after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concurrent 
disea
se, concomitant medications or events).  
Unlikely Related : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did 
not occur within a reasona
ble time after administration of the trial medication) and in which 
other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s 
c
linical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
Not related : The adverse event is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370]. 
10.2.4. Duration 
For all 
adverse events whether or not considered serious, the Investigator will provide a record of 
the sta
rt and stop dates of the event. Every effort should be made to resolve all adverse events 
CTP-543    25 July 2019 
Protocol CP543.2003  Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_1015661] as a result of an 
adverse event or s
erious adverse event on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, or 
int
erruption of investigational product, as appropriate) and record if concomitant and/or 
additional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome 
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., 
re
covered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered, or death (due to the adverse event).   
10.3. Follow-Up  
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug, including clinically significant laboratory 
tests, electrocardiograms, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event 
resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, 
whichever comes first.     
Adverse events a
ssessed as related to study drug and serious adverse events will be followed for 
as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, is 
otherwise explained, death occurs, or the patient is lost to follow up.  If resolved, a resolution 
da
te should be provided.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any 
suppl
emental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the adverse 
event.  This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.  
10.4. Pregnancy 
The Sponsor must be informed within 24 hours upon learning that a patient, or male patient’s 
partner, has become pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_1015662] dose of
 study drug. The Pregnancy Notification eCRF should be used to report the pregnancy 
to 
the Sponsor or its designee.  Patient pregnancies (or pregnancy of a male patient’s partner) 
must be followed until termination of pregnancy or the birth of the child.  The Pregnancy 
Outcome eCRF should be used to report information regarding the status of the infant. 
I
f a female partner of a male patient taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
patient taking the investigational product should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. 
10.5. Recording Adverse Events 
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from 
the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study visit are to be recorded in the 
eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry.  The Investigator will 
provide
 information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, action(s) taken, 
outcome, and relationship to the study drug. All adverse events should be documented in the 
pa
tient’s source documents.

possibility, the event must be documented and reported through completion of the adverse event 
eCRF. 
10.6.2. Reporting Urgent Safety Issues 
If the study site staff becomes aware of an actual or potential urgent safety issue, then the 
Sponsor and Sponsor’s designee (Medical Monitor) must be immediately contact[CONTACT_742933].  An urgent safety issue is defined as:  
 An imm ediate hazard to the health or safety of patients participating in a clinical 
study 
 A se rious risk to human health or potentially a serious risk to human health 
An urgent safety issue may include: (1) issues with an investigational drug or comparators; 
(2) study procedures; (3) inter-current illness (including pandemic infections); (4) concomitant 
medic
ations; (5) concurrent medical conditions; or (6) any other issues related to the safe 
conduct of the study or that pose a risk to study patients. 
In exceptional circumstances of imminent hazard and in order to safeguard the health or safety of 
individuals, the Investigators may take urgent safety measures before informing the Sponsor, but 
the Sponsor must be informed immediately after the hazard has resolved.

Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific 
study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  All amendments to the protocol will 
be written by [CONTACT_1034].  The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without 
prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201].  Except for 
administrative amendments, Investigators must await IRB approval of protocol amendments 
before implementing the change(s).  The Sponsor will ensure submission of any protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research 
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the study.  However, a protocol change 
intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients should be implemented 
immediately, and the IRB notified within 5 days.   
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB, the Investigators, and/or the Sponsor, 
the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential 
risk to the patient, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification.  In such 
cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained from patients enrolled in the study before 
continued participation under the new amendment. 
12.5. Audits and Inspections 
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct audits at the study site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to:  drug supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, laboratory specimen processing, and comparison of eCRFs with 
source documents.  The Investigator agrees to cooperate with audits conducted at a reasonable 
time and in a reasonable manner. 
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also audit the Investigator during or after the study.  The 
I
nvestigator should contact [CONTACT_76631], and must fully cooperate with 
the a
udits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner. 
The Investigator is required to make all study documentation promptly available for inspection, 
review or audit at the
 study site upon request by [CONTACT_2728], its representatives, or any appropriate 
regulatory agencies. 
12.6. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_580395].   
A quality control and quality assurance plan addressing aspects of the study that may impact data 
int
egrity or the protection of human subjects may be instituted for this study.  All audit findings 
will be summarized and placed on file with appropriate documentation of response/resolution.

ATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
13.1. Confidentiality 
All information disclosed or provided by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee), or generated or produced 
during
 the study including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the Investigator’s 
Brochure, and the results obtained during the course of the study, are confidential.  The 
Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose 
t
he information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
Submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB is expressly 
pe
rmitted, IRB members having the same obligation of confidentiality.  Authorized regulatory 
off
icials and sponsor personnel (or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the 
records.  The copi[INVESTIGATOR_324499].  Study drug, patient bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be 
used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_742945](s) or regulatory authorities. 
Patients’ names may, however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized 
off
icials in the event of inspections.  Documents containing the full name [CONTACT_580400].  This information will not be 
transferred to the Sponsor nor be contained in regulatory filings.   
13.2. Patient Data Protection 
Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates 
must also provide all authorizations required by [CONTACT_1769] (e.g. , protected health information 
authorization).  
Patients will be identified only by [CONTACT_742946].  The patient will not be identified by [CONTACT_71403], in any study samples or 
stud
y reports.  All data generated in this study is for research purposes only.  The Sponsor, its 
pa
rtner(s) and designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of 
this study.  Every effort will be made to keep the patient’s personal medical data confidential.  
The Sponsor will protect individual patient information to the fullest extent possible during this 
study.  At no time will a patient become identified in any publication or presentation.  However, 
the patient may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit or 
inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to patient information is at the 
discretion of the Sponsor and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as 
determined solely by [CONTACT_324568]. 
13.3. Data Collection 
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will use an 
electronic data capture system.  Data reported in the eCRFs should be consistent with and 
substantiated by [CONTACT_102]’s medical record and original source documents.  Any discrepancies 
must
 be explained.   
Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a Delegation of Authority 
form (Site Signature [CONTACT_53633]), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individuals who are 
authorized to make or change entries on eCRFs.

CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 59 1
3.4. Case Report Form Completion 
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate according to the 
Moni
toring Plan.  Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while monitoring.  
Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately.  Additionally, the 
Sponsor’s designee and the Sponsor may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which 
could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution.  The completed eCRF for 
each patient must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_580350]. 
13.5. Database Management, Data Clarification, and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor’s designee (i.e. , a designated Contract Research Organization) will be responsible 
for
 data management.  Data Management will develop a Data Management Plan (DMP ) 
document, and provide it to the Sponsor for approval.  The DMP document will define all 
activities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed DMP will be based on the 
protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data-flows, eCRFs, data cleaning procedures, 
other
 supporting documents, and data management standards and practices. 
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data 
Manager after entry.  The sites will respond to the data queries in a timely manner. 
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated 
Contract Research Organization standard operating procedures. 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.  Any 
changes to the database after that time will only be made by [CONTACT_580397], Statistician, Data Manager, and Quality Assurance Auditor according to designated 
standard operating procedures of the Contract Research Organization. 
13.6. Inspection of Records 
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the Sponsor or designee must verify data entered in 
the eCRF entries against the source documents. The objective of source document verification is 
to compl
y with GCP and international regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud.  
Source document verification means ensuring that source documents are an accurate and 
c
onfirmable reflection of the patient’s evaluations during participation in the study and that all 
relevant information recorded in the source document is accurately entered into the eCRF. All 
sourc
e documents should be correctly labeled and filed and associated with a single, verifiable 
patient. 
All data required for this study should be captured in source notes.  No data obtained by [CONTACT_941] 
I
nvestigator or other study personnel should be captured directly in the eCRF.  All source 
doc
uments pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_742947].  If electronic progress notes and other electronic source 
documents are not compliant with applicable regulatory guidance, they are not considered a valid 
source for this study.  All patient progress notes must be dated and signed at the time of the visit.  
The
 Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply 
orig
inal source documentation for this clinical study. 
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the eCRF the following information: 
CTP-543 25 July 2019 
Protocol CP543.2003 Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 60 I
nformation to confirm that the patient exists (e.g., initials, date of birth, and sex);
C
onfirmation that the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria;
Confirmation that the patient is taking part in the clinical study;
Confirmation of the informed consent process;
Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures;
Information concerning all adverse events;
De
tails of concomitant and investigational medications.
Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical study monitoring, the purpose of 
whic
h is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the eCRF has been fully and 
accurately completed, source document verification has been carried out, and the study timelines 
a
nd enrollment goals and requirements have been met. 
[ADDRESS_1015673] retain study records for a period of 
2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for 
whic
h it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is 
notified, or local regulations will be applied, whichever retention period is longer.  
The Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, and take measures to 
prevent accidental or pre
mature destruction of these documents. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study essential documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform the Sponsor.  The relevant 
re
cords shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.

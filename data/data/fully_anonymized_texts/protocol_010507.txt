Bipolar I disorder is a lifelong epi[INVESTIGATOR_848521] b y manic and depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Psy chotic s ymptoms (ie, delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders) often 
accompan y the manic phase of bipolar I disorder.  The lifetime prevalence of bipolar I 
disorder is estimated to be 0.4% to 1.6% with a mean age of onset for first manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_848522] y 20s.[ADDRESS_1179828] -line treatment for acute mania 
across multiple [LOCATION_002] (US) and international treatment guidelines based on 
established evidence.2,3,4,5  Although the availability  of newer at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_848523] I disorder, there still remains a need for safer and more effe ctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_846454] .6
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] ( also referred to as OPC -[ZIP_CODE] and L u AF41156) is a novel aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_848524] s ynthesized by  [CONTACT_848561] b y Otsuka and L undbeck.  
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) is currentl y approved in Canada and the US as monotherap y 
for the treatment of schizophrenia and the US for use as an adjunctive therapy  to 
antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  While the precise 
mechanism of action of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) in treating psy chiatric conditions is 
unknown, the pharmacology  of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) is believed to be mediated b y 
a combination of high binding affinity  and functional activities at multiple 
monoamine rgic receptors.  I t has modulatory  activity  at the serotonin (5 -HT) and 
dopamine sy stems that combines partial agonist activity  at serotonergic [ADDRESS_1179829] activity  at serotonergic 5 -HT2Areceptors, 
with similar high affinities at all of these receptors (K i: 0.1 -0.5 nM).  Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) also shows antagonist activity  at noradrenergic α 1B/2C with affinity  in the 
same subnanomolar K i range (K i: 0.2 -0.6 nM). The 5 -HT1A/D2receptor partial agonist 
activity  in combination with 5 -HT2Aand α 1B/2C receptors antagonism of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) may correlate with antipsychotic and antidepressant efficacy , reduced 
impulsive behavior, and cognitive improvement.[ADDRESS_1179830] [ZIP_CODE].1 Nonclinical Data
A complete description of the available efficacy  and safet y pharmacology data from 
nonclinical studies, including pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology  studies in different 
animal species can be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .7
1.2 Clinical Data
Currently , brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) is approved in the US for use in adul t patients as 
an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD and in Canada and the 
US as monotherap y for the treatment of schizophrenia.  In addition to the proposed trial 
in the treatment of bipolar I disorder,  the current brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34770] e clinical development 
program includes ongoing investigations in the following indications:  adjunctive 
treatment of adult attention -deficit h yperactivity disorder (ADHD) coadministered with 
marketed stimulant therapy ; treatment of agitation associated wi th dementia of the 
Alzheimer’s ty pe; and adjunctive treatment of adult post- traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) coadministered with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) .7
As of 17 Apr 2016, the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC-[ZIP_CODE]) clinical development program 
consisted of a total of 65 clinical trials conducted in North America, Latin America, 
Europe, and Asia (53 completed and 12 ongoing).  This includes 59 trials conducted 
under US Investigational New Drug Applications (I NDs) (47 completed and 12 ongoing) 
for schizophrenia, adjunctive treatment of MDD, adjunctive treatment of ADHD, 
agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s t ype, or PTSD; and [ADDRESS_1179831] ed in health y subjects and 
subjects with schizophrenia.7
Please refer to the IB for more detailed information.7
1.3 Know n and Potential Risks and Benefits
Phase 1 data indicated that bre xpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) demonstrated good safet y and 
tolerability  when administered to health y volunteers at single doses of 0.2 to 6 mg and at 
a repeated dose of 2 mg/day .  Data from completed repeated dosing trials in the US 
indicate that brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC-[ZIP_CODE]) demonstrated good tolerability  when 
administered to subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at doses of up to 
12 mg/day ; when administered to subjects with MDD at doses of up to 4 mg/day in 
combination with a marketed antidepressa nt; as adjunctive therap y in elderly subjects 
(70-85 years of age) with MDD up to 3 mg/day ;and when administered to subjects with 
ADHD at doses of up to 4 mg/day  in combination with a marketed stimulant.

Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) is a novel atypi[INVESTIGATOR_848526] a serotonin -
dopamine activity  modulator and is indicated in the US as monotherapy  for the treatment 
of schizophrenia in adult patients (2 -4 mg/day ) and as an adjunctive therapy  to 
antidepressants for the treatment of MDD (2 -3mg/day).[ADDRESS_1179833] demonstrated effica cy across the indications of schizophrenia , 
MDD, and bipolar I disorder, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]’s (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) spe cific receptor activity  
profile likely correlates with its established efficacy  in schizophrenia and MDD, and may 
also prove to be an effective target for the treatment of the acute mania of bipolar I 
disorder.  This 26-week, multicenter, open -label trial will be conducted to evaluate the 
long-term safet y and tolerability  of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) for the treatment of 
subjects with bipolar I disorder.
2.2 Dosing Rationale
The dosing paradigm of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) t o be used in Trial 331 -201-[ZIP_CODE] 
has been determined based on the current approved dosing ranges and phase 3 trial results 
across related ps ychiatric indications (MDD and schizophrenia) and on dosing paradigms 
used in the development of other at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_848527] I disorder .  In 
general, for most at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], the recommended dosing range and maximal 
doses tend to be comparable for subjects with either schizophrenia or bipolar I acute 
mania.7  
The dosing paradigm is within the currentl y approved recommended dose range for 
schizophrenia, ie, 2 to 4 mg/day , but with a more rapid titration schedule.  A higher 
starting dose and faster titration for acute mania is proposed to reach the target dos e 
quickly , without resulting in undesirable side effects.  This decision is consistent with 
clinical trial programs and labeling for other aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_34922], where similar 
differences are seen between schizophrenia and acute mania dosing paradigms wi th

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179834] to the starting doses and recommended dose ranges.  In addition, this is consistent 
with previously  tested dosing paradigms for brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_848528].  This 
includes trials with higher starting doses without titration (up to 12 mg/day ), and with 
more rapid titration schedules (Trials 331 -07-203, 331 -08-205, and 14644A).
  
2.3 Trial Objectives
The purpose of this trial is to assess the safet y and tolerability  of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) in the treatment of subjects with bipolar I disorder.    
3 Trial Design
3.1 Type/Design of Trial
This is a multicenter, open- label trial designed to assess the safet y and tolerability  of oral 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) (2-4 mg/day ) as treatment in adults with bipolar I disorder.  
The trial will be conducted on an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into the trial will be drawn 
from eligible subjects who will include subjects who completed the 3 -week treatment in 
the double -blind, phase 3 efficacy  trials (ie, Trial s 331-201- [ZIP_CODE] or 331- 201-[ZIP_CODE]) 
and, in the investigator’s judgment, could potentially  benefit from treatment with oral 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) for bipolar I disorder .  In the event the s ponsor determines 
that the enrollment rate of rollover subjects will not be sufficient to meet the target 
completion of approximately  [ADDRESS_1179835] sites . The e nrollment of de novo subjects at an y site will not be permitted until 
initiation and notification by [CONTACT_456].
The trial will be organized as follows:
Rollover Subjects:
Screening/Baseline:   Subjects who completed Day [ADDRESS_1179836] visit of the double -
blind trial (ie, Week 3 [Day 21] visit of Trial s 331-201- [ZIP_CODE] or 331-201- [ZIP_CODE]).  
Subjects will sign a separate informed consent form (I CF) for participation in 
Trial 331-201- [ADDRESS_1179837] 2017Open -label Treatment Phase (Phase B):   Eligible subjects from Trials 331- 201-[ZIP_CODE] or 
331-201- [ZIP_CODE] will receive 26weeks of dail y treatment with open -label brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) (2-4 mg/day ) in Phase B of Trial 331-201- [ZIP_CODE], as described in
Section 3.2.  Visits will occur at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 26.  
Follow -up:  Subjects will be followed up for safety via telephone contact [CONTACT_238244] 
21 (± 2) day s after the last dose of open- label investigational medicinal product (IMP).
De Novo Subjects (The e nrollment of de novo subjects at an y site will not be permitted 
until initiation and notification by [CONTACT_456] ):
Screening:   Subjects will enter a pretreatment screening phase that will range from a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1179838] with a signed ICF.  Subjects with a lapse in antipsy chotic 
treatment (“lapse” defined as > 7 consecutive day s without oral antipsy chotic medication) 
will proceed directl y to the baseline of the open -label treatment phase (Phase B) after 
completing screening assessments, provided that all eligibility  criteria are met, including 
washout of all prohibited medications.  All other subjects will undergo conversion to oral 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_848529] (Phase A).
Conversion Phase (Phase A):   Any subject receiving antips ychotic treatment(s) at the 
initial screening visit will undergo cross -titration to oral brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) for 
4weeks in Phase A, as described in Section 3.2.  Those subjects on mood stabilizers and 
antipsy chotics will need to be on monotherap y brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) by [CONTACT_848562].  Visits will occur at the end of Conversion Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 during 
Phase A.  The goal in Phase A is for the de novo subjects to achieve a brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) target dose of 2 mg daily  by [CONTACT_848563] 4 visit, which will also 
be the baseline visit of Phase B.  Therefore, the assessments from the Conversion Week 4 
visit of Phase A will serve as the baseline measures for Phase B.
Baseline and Open- label Treatment Phase (Phase B):   After completing baseline 
assessments (Phase B baseline visit for subjects entering Phase B directl y from screening 
or Conversion Week 4 visit of Phase A for subjects who participated in Phase A), eligible 
subjects will receive daily treatment with open -label brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) in 
Phase B, as described in Section 3.2.  Subjects will receive 26weeks of open- label 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) (2-4mg/day) in Phase B.  Visits will occur at the end of 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 26.  
Follow -up: Subjects will be followed up for safety via telephone contact [CONTACT_238244] 
21(± 2) day s after the last dose of open- label medication.

3.2.1 De Novo Subjects
The enrollment of de novo subjects at any site will not be permitted until initiation 
and notification by [CONTACT_456].
[IP_ADDRESS] Conversion Phase (Phase A )
For de novo subjects, Conversion (Phase A) applies only to subjects who are receiving 
antipsy chotic medication(s) when being considered for entry  into Trial 331-201-[ZIP_CODE].  
All other de novo subjects will enter the trial at Phase B ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) after 
comple ting screening assessments.  The purpose of Phase A is to cross- titrate de novo 
subjects from current antipsy chotic treatment(s) to monotherapy  with brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]
(OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) 2 mg/day  over a 4- week period to minimize the possibility  of rebound (eg, 
choline rgic or histaminergic) from abrupt changes in antipsy chotic medication.  The 
procedure as it pertains to this protocol is summarized in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1.

cMonotherapy with brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day will begin at the Conversion Week 4 visit/b aseline of 
Phase B which will occur the day after discontinuation of all other antipsychotic treatment(s).
The scheme in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1represents the optimal approach for conversion of subjects 
from other antipsychotic(s) to brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_848531] y recommended for use in this 
trial; however, the investigator may  adjust the dose(s) of other antipsychotic(s) during the 
4-week cross -titration as deemed appropriate for individual subjects.  The d ose of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) can increase during cross- titration, but cannot decrease.  
Subjects must achieve a monotherap y dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) 2 mg/day  at 
the Conversion Week 4 visit/ baseline of Phase B in order to progress to Phase B.

some assessments performed during screening.
bIf a subject discontinues early before Week 4, procedures noted for Week 26/ ET must be completed at the ET visit.  Attempts should be made to complete 
ALL evaluations, particularly efficacy assessments for the Week 26/ET visit prior to the administration of any ne w psychotropic medications.  However, if 
the subject receives a new antipsychotic prior to ET procedures, no efficacy assessments should be done.  Any prohibited medi cations started before the 
end of the trial assessments should be documented as a protocol deviation in the source notes.
cInformed consent must be obtained before any trial -related procedures are performed.
dWashout of prohibited medications begins after signing the ICF.  Details of medications requiring washout are provided in Section 4.1.  Prohibited and 
restricted medications are also provided in Section 4.1.  In addition, all antipsychotic medications used within [ADDRESS_1179872] dose of IMP will be 
recorded.

circumference and a review of the following bod y systems: head, ey es, ears, nose, and 
throat; thorax; abdomen; urogenital; extremities; neurological; and skin and mucosae.  
Height will be measured with a stadiometer, measuring stick, or tape.  Waist 
circumference will be measured with each ph ysical examination.  The following 
procedures will aid in the standardization of these measurements:
The subject should be minimally  clothe d (ie, lightweight clothing; no heavy  
overgarments).
Until the information herein is released by [CONTACT_35010], the contents of this document are Otsuka 
confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179888] 2017Waist circumference should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  
the same time at each visit.
The waist circumference measurement will be accomplished by [CONTACT_848568] d the top of the right iliac crest and placing a weighted measuring tape in a 
horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level of the crest.  Before reading the tape 
measure, the assessor should assure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the 
skin, and is parallel to the floor.  The measurement is to be made at the end of a 
normal exhalation.16
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her appointed designee is primarily  responsible to 
perform the ph ysical examination. I f the appointed designee is to perform the phy sical 
examination, he/she must be permitted b y local regulations and his/her name [CONTACT_846576] (FDA) Form 1572.  Whenever possible, 
the same individual shou ld perform all ph ysical examinations.  Any  condition present at 
the post -treatment ph ysical examination that was not present at the baseline examination 
should be documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Measurement of Vital Signs
Themeasurement of vital signs will include body  weight, bod y temperature, systolic 
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate.  The following 
guidelines will aid in the standardization of body  weight measurements:
The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible.
Scales should be calibrated and reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh- in session.
A subject should void prior to being weighed and be minimally  clothed (ie, no shoes 
or heav y overgarments).
Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  the same 
time at each visit.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_572577] [ADDRESS_1179889] followed b y standing.
Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension (screening DBP > 95 mmHg in any  position) or 
symptomatic hy potension are excluded from the trial as are subjects with orthostatic 
hypotension defined as a decrease of ≥ 30 mmHg in SBP and/or a decrease of 
≥ [ADDRESS_1179890] 3 minutes standing compared to the previous supi[INVESTIGATOR_657481] (see Table 3.4.3-1 ).  In addition, subjects

investigator’s judgment, is medically  significant in that it would im pact the safet y of the 
subject or the interpretation of the trial results.  However, an y abnormal screening vital 
sign result(s) considered to be clinically  significant should be repeated to confirm the 
finding(s) before excluding the subject from the tria l.  Appendix 6is included to assist 
investigators in their assessments of results that may  be potentiall y medically significant, 
depending on the subject’s medical h istory  and clinical presentation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments
All ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_178664] 5 minutes.  Additional 12 -lead ECGs may  be obtained at the investigator’s 
discretion and should alway s be obtained in the event of an ET.  Electrocardiogram 
results will be evaluated at the investigational site to determine the subject’s eligibility  
and to monitor safet y during the trial.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_848547], sign, and date each ECG reading, noting whether or not any  abnormal results 
are of clinical significance.  The ECG will be repeated if an y results are considered to be 
clinically  significant.  A central ECG service will be utilized for reading all ECGs in
order to standardize interpretations for the safet y analysis.
If, according to the investigator's judgment, an y abnormal ECG finding is deemed 
medically  significant (impacting the safety  of the subject and/or the interpretation of the 
trial results) or me ets an exclusion criterion (see Table 3.4.3-1), the subject should be 
excluded from the trial.  Abnormal results for ECGs should be repeated once at screening 
with [ADDRESS_1179892] based on the criteria noted above.  Each ECG recording should be 
taken approximately  5 minutes apart (the ECG result reported will be evaluated at each 
time p oint).  The central ECG service will provide the corrections for the 3 ECGs 
performed.  Based on the QT interval corrected for heart rate by [CONTACT_6550]’s formula 
(QTcF) reported b y the central service, a subject will be excluded if the corrections are ≥ 
450 msec in men and ≥ 470 msec in women for 2 of the 3 time points of the ECGs done, 
unless due to ventricular pacing.  If onl y 1 ECG time point has a QTcF of ≥ 450 msec in 
men and ≥ [ADDRESS_1179893] 2017criteria for subjects who are alread y enrolled in the trial.  Please consult the medical 
monitor in case of questions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety  Assessments
It is required that a trained and experienced clinician adminis ter the safet y assessments, 
  The number of raters 
within each trial center should be kept to a minimum.  All efforts will be made to ensure 
that the same clinician administers the scales for a give n subject.  Notations in the

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Discontinuation
After starting open -label IMP, a subject may  stop treatment permanentl y for a variet y of 
reasons.  Treatment discontinuations may  be initiated by  a subject who is not satisfied 
with treatment or may  become medicall y necessary due to AEs, required treatment with a 
disallowed medication or therap y, or other issues, as determined b y the investigator.  
However, each investigator must comprehensivel y review the circumstances and offer the 
subject options for continued treatment to the degree possible as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Documenting Reasons for Treatment 
Interruption/Discontinuation
A subject may  temporarily  interrupt or discontinue I MP for a number of reasons 
including those listed below:
Reasons related to AE:
Subject decides to discontinue because of anno yance or discomfort due to a 
non-serious AE which is not otherwise determined to be an undue hazard
Continuing I MP places the subject at undue riskas determined b y the investigator 
(eg, a safet y concern t hat is possibly , probabl y, or likely related to IMP)
Serious adverse event (SAE) 
Other potentially  IMP-related safety  concerns or AEs
Death
Reasons unrelated to medical condition (provide detail and review AE history with 
subject)
Withdrawal of informed c onsent (complete written withdrawal of consent form)
Lost to follow -up
Pregnancy  (see Section 5.5)
Termination of all or part of the trial b y the sponsor

or other trial personnel, will make every  effort to follow the event until it has resolved or 
stabilized.  Follow up procedures in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be followed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent from further participation in the trial 
at an y time without prejudice.  Subjects cannot withdraw consent for use of data alread y 
collected as part of the trial, but only  for future participation.  The investigator can also 
discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at any  time if medicall y necessary.  
Unless the subject provides their written withdrawal of consent or there is other written 
documentation by  [CONTACT_444470]’s verbal intent to completely  
withdraw from the trial, subjects should be followed for all protocol -specified evaluations 
and assessments, if possible .
Complete withdrawal of consent requires a subject’s refusal of ALL of the following 
methods of follow up (these methods of follow up will also be noted in the trial I CF):
Participation in all follow -up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in-clinic, 
by [CONTACT_756], or by  [CONTACT_28920] -home visit).
Participation in a subset of protocol specified follow -up procedures (by  a frequency  
schedule and method, as agreed b y subject and staff) .
Contact [CONTACT_81835] b y trial personnel, even if only  by [CONTACT_97535] e, to assess current 
medical condition ,and obtain necessary  medical or laboratory  reports relevant to the 
trial’s objectives.
Contact [CONTACT_308705](s) who have been designated in source records as being 
available to discuss the subject’s medical c ondition, even if onl y by [CONTACT_756], mail ,
or e-mail (eg, famil y, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).
Access to medical information from alternative sources (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialysis, transplantation or vital 
registries, social media sources). 
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with 
the same degree of importance and care as is used in initially  obtaining inform ed consent.  
The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely  understood, 
documented ,and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity  of the trial.  
A subject may  initially  express their desire to interrupt or discontinue IMP 
administration, which is not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of consent for further 
participation (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] andSection [IP_ADDRESS]).  A subject may , however, indicate

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179898] 2017that further trial participation is creating a burden on their work or social schedule.  
Therefore, the investigator sh ould follow the procedures outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] to 
determine if the subject can continue participation in the trial if modifications to his/her 
treatment and/or schedule of assessments can be accommodated.  Onl y subjects who 
withdraw their permission for all of the above degrees of follow -up are considered to 
have completel y withdrawn their consent to participate in the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures to Encourage Continued Trial Participation
In all cases of impending I MP discontinuation or consent withdrawal, investigators will 
be given instructions to meet and discuss with the subject their options of continuing in 
the trial, preferabl y on therapy .  The investigator should ensure understanding and

documented in writing (i e, subject signs an ICF), but who is not started on treatment, 
whether through ran domization or open assignment.
Subjects who sign an ICF but who are not started on treatment are permitted to be 
rescreened.  In the event that the subject is rescreened for trial participation , and the 
rescreening is not completed within the original screening window, a new ICF must be 
signed .
3.10 Definition of Completed Subjects
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary  and/or secondary  objectives of the trial irrespective of whether or not the subject 
actuall y consumed all doses of the IMP.  Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers.  For purposes of this 
trial, subjects who complete the Week [ADDRESS_1179900] a known reaso n for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or 
AE),and for whom a survival status at the end of the trial cannot be determined will be 
classified as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation. Survival status can be 
determined from a variety o f sources, either by  [CONTACT_788495] (ie, death certificate, medical records, public records, statement b y a family 
member or primary  care phy sician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179901], 
statement by  a famil y member or primary care physician, or public records).
The site will make [ADDRESS_1179902] via certified mail or an alternative similar method, where appropriate , before 
assigning a “lost to follow -up” status .
3.[ADDRESS_1179903] Compliance 
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]).  Accountability  and 
compliance verification should be documented in the subject’s trial records.  Subjects 
must be counseled on the importance of taking the I MP as directed at all trial visits.  I f 
poor compliance continues (eg, multiple missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall 
compliance at an y point in the trial), discontinuation of the subject from the trial should 
be considered.  Subjects who habitually  miss visits or habitually  attend visits outside of 
the protocol -defined visit window are also noncompliant and should be considered for 
discontinuation.  The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_444466] a subject's lack of compliance merits discontinuation from the trial.
3.13 Protocol Deviati ons
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or 
mistak e (eg, violation of informed consent process, I MP dispensing or subject dosing 
error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibi lity criteria or 
concomitant medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_772994].  The investigator and sponsor will come as 
quickly  as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the trial.  
This decision will be documented by  [CONTACT_31376], and revi ewed b y

are prohibited unless explicitly  authorized by  [CONTACT_7195].  During the washout 
period, the prior use of other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_846508].  In countries where lorazepam is not commercially  available, the use of oral 
oxazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, or clonazepam is only  acceptable with prior 
authorization from the medical monitor.  The following guide should be used to 
determine approximate lorazepam equivalents: 1 mg lorazepam = 15 mg oxazepam = 
0.5 mg alprazolam = 5 mg diazepam = 0.5 mg clonazepam.  The prescribed

Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_34875] [ADDRESS_1179912]’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre -existing or that develop during the trial (intercurrent illness or 
AEs).  The investigator should examine the acceptability  of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly  prohibited.  I n order to ensure that appropriate concomitant t herap y is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take an y medications (either 
self-administered non -prescription drugs or prescription therapy  prescribed by  [CONTACT_3213]) without prior consultation with the investigator.  In particular, the investigator 
should caution the subject about concomitant use of the following during the trial:
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or other drugs that interfere with 
coagulation since the combined use of ps ychotropic drugs tha t interfere with 
serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding.20
Triptans (eg, sumatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, rizatriptan, ele triptan, 
and zolmitriptan), linezolid, and methy lene blue since there have been rare post -

medications, if needed .
[ADDRESS_1179914] and unintended 
response to an IMP related to any  dose administered .
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
IMP caused the A E.For the purpose of IND safety  reporting, “reasonable possibility ” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certaint y about causality .
AnSAE includes an yevent that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening ; ie, the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  I t does not include an event 
that, had it occurred in a more s evere form, might have caused death.
Persistent or significant incapacity /disability or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions.
Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] .
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_740879] s hould not be reported as an SAE; whenever possible the 
reason for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92657] .

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179915] 2017Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92658] (ie, those 
required for reasons of convenience or other non -medical need) are not 
consi dered SAEs .
Congenital anomal y/birth defect .
Other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above ; eg, alle rgic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, 
blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Nonserious adverse events are all AEs that do not mee t the criteria for a "serious" AE.
Immediately  Reportable Event (IRE):   
Any SAE.
AnyAE related to occupational exposure.
Potential serious hepatotoxicity (see Section 5.4).
Pregnancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, it 
will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on the clinical trial 
pregnancy  and breastfeeding form, or other designated form, to the sponsor. 
Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE ePlatform if there is an 
abnormality  or complication.
Clinical L aboratory  Test Value Changes :  It is the investigator’s responsibility  to review 
the results of all la boratory  tests as they  become available.  This review will be 
documented b y the investigator’s dated signature [CONTACT_444495].  For each 
abnormal laboratory  test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinicall y significant) change from baseline for that individual subject. This 
determination ,however, does not necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed.  The investigator may  repeat the laboratory test or request additional 
tests to verify  the results of the original laboratory tests.  I f this laboratory  value is 
considered medicall y relevant b y the investigator (subject is sy mptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory  value leadsto 
discontin uation ,and/or fulfills a seriousness criterion , this is considered an AE. 
Severity :  Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on 
the ePlatform .  The intensity  of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity .

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-201-[ADDRESS_1179916] [ZIP_CODE] = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y.
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity .
IMP Causalit y:Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related : There is a reasonable possibility  of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Not Related : There is no temporal or causal relationship between the I MP and 
the AE .
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs.  T o avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non-leading question: “ How have you 
felt since your last visit ?”  All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by  [CONTACT_848571].  Serious AE collection is to 
begin after a subject has signed the ICF.  
Use medical terminology in AE reporting.  Adverse events should be reported as a single 
unify ing diagnosis whenever possible or , in the absence of a unify ing diagnosis, as 
individual signs or sy mptoms .  Exacerbation or disease progression should be reported as 
an AE onl y if there are unusual or severe clinical features that were not pr esent, or 
experienced earlier, or not expected based on the course of the condition.
In addition, the sponsor must be notified immediately  by [CONTACT_756] ,fax, or e -mail of an y 
IREs according to the procedure outlined below ,in Section 5.3.  Special attention should 
be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34910].

courier to the sponsor .  (Please note that the IRE form is NOT the AEePlatform .)
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically  until their health has returned 
to baseline status, or until all parameters have returned to normal or have otherwise been 
explained.  I t is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate

limit of normal ( ULN), a total bilirubin level should also be evaluated. If the total 
bilirubin is [ADDRESS_1179920], complete an IRE form with all values listed and also 
report as an AE on the ePlatform .
5.5 Pregnancy
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) are defined as female subjects for whom 
menstruati on has started and who are not documented as sterile (ie, have had a bilateral 
oophorectom y and/or h ysterectom y or who have been postmenopausal for at least 
12months).
For WOCBP and for men who are sexually  active, t here must be a documented 
agreement tha t the subject and/or their partner will take effective measures 
(ie,double -barrier method) to prevent pregnancy during the course of the trial and for 
30days after the last dose of IMP.  Unless the subject is sterile (ie , women who have had 
a bilateral oophorectom y and/or hysterectomy  or who have been postmenopausal for at 
least 12 consecutive months; or men who have had a bilateral orchidectomy ) or remains 
abstinent, [ADDRESS_1179921] be used: vasectom y, tubal ligation, vaginal 
diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control depot injection, birth 
control implant, condom with spermicide, or sponge with spermicide.  An y single method 
of birth control, including vasectom y and tubal liga tion, may  fail, leading to pregnancy .  
The contraceptive method will be documented at each trial visit.
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review the below 
guidelines about trial participation with all WOCBP.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_848556] y 
include:
General information
Informed consent form
Pregnancy  prevention information
Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives
Contraceptives in current use
Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy

mentioned risk factors and the consequences were discussed with her.
A urine and/ or serum pregnancy  test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed 
at screening on all WOCBP.  If a urine test is performed and is positive, the investigator 
will follow up with a confirmatory  serum test .
During the trial, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_92704] (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy  tests are available.  If the 
pregnancy  is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolled in 
the trial.  If pregnancy  is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be 
withheld immediately  (if reasonable, taking into consideration any  potential withdrawal 
risks) until the result of the pregnancy  test is known.  If pregnancy  is confirmed, the IMP 
will be permanentl y discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary  for subject safety ) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial.  
The investigator must immediately  notify  the sponsor of an y pregnancy associated with 
IMP exposure during the trial and for [ADDRESS_1179923] 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) for monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy . 
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies).  Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered, if indicated.  In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor , on appropri ate Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1179924] will

Source documents and source data will be c aptured electronically  in this trial, and will 
meet the same fundamental elements of data quality  (eg, attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and accurate) as paper records.  These data will be collected 
into a sy stem that is fully validated.  C hanges to the data will be captured by  [CONTACT_740900].
The trial site will be given a tablet to directl y record subject data and clinical 
observations on electronic forms.  Designated trial site staff will not be given access to 
the sy stem until they have been appropriately  trained.  Information to be originall y 
captured and reviewed electronicall y shall include details of the subject visit and the 
protocol -required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history , AEs, 
and concomi tant medications.  Because this trial is using an electronic source record as 
the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry  step for the trial site for 
data collected directl y into the application - rather, the electronic source rec ord directl y 
populates the trial database.
Some data may  be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource system.  These 
and an y other data treated in this manner will be source data verified b y the trial clinical 
research associate, and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local 
electronic s ystem) will be documented before the trial star t.  Any  changes to information 
in paper source documents will be initialed and dated on the day  the change is made by  a 
trial site staff member authorized to make the change.  Changes will be made by  [CONTACT_2724] 
a single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearl y 
entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data).  If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation 
by [CONTACT_15370].
Another ex ception will be safet y laboratory  data, where the official source documentation 
will be considered the report issued by  [CONTACT_92720] .

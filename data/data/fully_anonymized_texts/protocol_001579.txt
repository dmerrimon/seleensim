AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  10 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
AMC -084: Screening HIV- Infected Women for Anal Cancer Precursors  
DESIGN:  Prospective cohort study  
DURATION:  Up to 2 years  
SAMPLE SIZE:  300 
POPULATION:  HIV-positive females 18 and older without previously 
diagnosed high- grade intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] (HSIL) of the anus 
or anal cancer  
REGIMEN:  All participants will undergo anal cancer screening with anal 
cytology and several different anal HPV testing modalities 
every 6 months for up to 2 years while on study. All participants 
will undergo High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) evaluations at 
baseline/Visit 1, Month 12/Visit 3, and Month 24/Visit 5. 
Standard screening procedures involving HRA for all abnormal 
anal cytology tests will also be performed for the interim visits. If diagnosed with HSIL (as defined by [CONTACT_729626]) at any scheduled study visit, p
articipants will 
discontinue the  study  early . 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  1) To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing 
using different methods of detection, including HPV 
Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), HPV mRNA assays (APTIMA) and Arbor Vita  OncoE6 HPV test 
and whether they 
improve the screening performance of routine anal cytology for the detection of anal HSIL when measured 
against the gold standard, biopsy-proven HSIL. 
2) To determine the prevalence and risk factors for prevalent HSIL in HIV -positive women. 
3) To determine incidence and risk factors associated with HSIL and anal HPV over 2 years among HIV positive 
women undergoing semi -annual anal evaluations.  
EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:  1) To evaluate the acceptability of anal cancer screening 
among HIV-positive women.  
2) To collect data on quality of life and health car e costs 
(including non- direct health care costs and time costs) for 
an economic evaluation of the cost -effectiveness of anal 
cancer screening strategies in HIV -positive women.

with men (MSM);[ADDRESS_996497]- cART era from 0 between 
1980 and 1989 to approximately 11 per 100,000 in the years between 1996 and 
2004. In addition, our research demonstrated that in the cART era, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) increased significantly among 
women and the disease increased most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_729598].
7 Thus 
SCCA remains a growing problem for HIV -positive women, who in the United 
States are primarily African American (67%) and Latina (13%).  
1.1.2 Anal HPV, AIN, and anal c arcinoma  
SCCA shares biologic similarities with cervical cancer, including detectable precancerous lesions and high- risk (HR) human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597]  (HPV) infection. 
HPV has been detected in 99% of cervical cancers and 80 to 90% of anal cancers, with HPV types 16 or 18 detected in about 70% of cervical and 80% of anal cancers.
8 It is likely that the pathogenesis of anal cancer is similar to that of cervical 
cancer: that is, anal HPV infection, in conjunction with other yet to be determined factors, leads to the development of anal high -grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_241087] ( HSIL ), a likely precursor to anal cancer.
9,10 It also has been shown that the 
rate of progression from anal dysplasia to invasive SCCA is high. Among immuno-competent individuals, the rate of progression from anal intraepi [INVESTIGATOR_28601] 
(AIN) to invasive SCCA has been reported as approximately 10% over a median 
time of 5 years.
11,12 In a recent study of HIV -positive MSMs, 7% of 156 individuals 
who had HSIL of the anus developed invasive cancer over a median period of 8.6 months. The authors noted that all of the individuals diagnosed with invasive cancer had previously refused therapy for anal dysplasia.
13 Because of the high rate of 
progression from high-grade anal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (AIN 2,3) or HSIL14 to 
invasive SCCA, the significant morbidity and mortality associated with SCCA, and because SCCA shares many biologic properties with cervical cancer, several research and practice groups have recommended anal  cancer prevention strategies 
for both HIV-positive men and women.
15 
1.1.3 Anal Cancer Screening Guidelines  
There is no consensus regarding the optimal anal c ancer screening strategy among 
HIV-positive individuals, particularly HIV -positive  women. Prior to the 
introduction of cervical cytology screening programs, the incidence of cervical cancer in the U.S. was 40- 50/100,000. Largely due to the success of cervi cal 
cytology screening, in which high- grade cervical squamous intracellular lesions 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  13 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  (HSIL), or cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN)14 is detected and treated before 
progression to cancer occurs, the incidence of cervical cancer has declined to 8 -
10/100,000. Indeed, screening with cervical cytology is considered to be one of the 
most successful cancer prevention programs.[ADDRESS_996498], the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections 
among HIV -positive individuals states “… studies of screening and treatment 
programs for AIN 2 or 3 should not be implemented before definitive recommendations for anal cytology screening can be made.”

directed biopsy in HIV -positive  men. The SNs ranged from 69% to 93%, and the 
SPs ranged from 32% to 59%.
22,[ADDRESS_996501] high- grade anal neoplasia was 
87% and in HIV -negative MSM it was 55%. Other studies have shown that among 
HIV-positive individuals the SN and SP of anal cytology is dependent on the 
percentage of anal can al involvement.[ADDRESS_996502] performance characteristics in 
HIV-positive women is necessary.  
1.1.5 Anal HPV and anal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_729599] -positive 
women  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996503] only been 4 studies describing the prevalence of HPV infection and anal inf ection among HIV -positive women.
27-30 In these studies the rates of 
anal HPV varied dramatically from 16% -90% and the prevalence of anal cytologic 
abnormalities varied from 17% -39%. The variance in HPV prevalence is likely due 
to differences in the type of test performed and possibly the transport medium of the test. There are even less data rep orted regarding anal histologic diagnoses. 
Among those studies where HRA and biopsy were performed,
27-28 histology results 
were only available in a small percentage of their population. Additionally, only one longitudinal study has been published describing incidence of anal HPV 
infection, and the cohort for this study was recruited in the pre -cART/early cART 
era.
[ADDRESS_996504] characteristics of U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA) -approved and experimental HR HPV testing for anal 
cancer screening among HIV -positive women. Among HIV -positive MSM, it has 
been shown that HPV testing adds little information to anal cytologic testing because of the very high prevalence of anal HR HPV prevalence (in most populations > 90%).
[ADDRESS_996505] a 
lower rate of anal HR HPV infection; therefore, HR HPV testing may improve the SN and SP of anal cytology. T here have been no studies evaluating HR HPV test 
characteristics among HIV -positive women, using either the FDA -approved Hybrid 
Capture 2 (HC2) test (Qiagen Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD), the APTIMA HPV test (GenProbe Corp, San Diego, CA), or the Onco E6™ test ( Arbor Vita , Fremont , 
CA), a test that is currently in development. 
1.1.6 Hybrid Capture2 (HC2) HPV t est 
In [ADDRESS_996506] to cervical cytology screening for women aged 30 years and over. HC2 
detects 13 of the HPV types (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). The benefits of adding HC2 testing include: 1) having a sensitive and readily reproducible measure of the risk of disease and 2) having a high negative predict ive 
value with a single test. The combination of the HC2 assay and cytology is also used in the triage of women with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_145582] (ASC -US) cervical cytology results, with an SN of 99.2% (95% 
confidence interval (CI):  97.4- 100%) and an SP of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.2- 90.4%) to 
detect CIN2 or worse.
[ADDRESS_996507] detects messenger RNA (mRNA) for HPV proteins E6/E7 in [ADDRESS_996508] has 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996509] to significantly improve the specificity of detecting CIN2+, thereby [CONTACT_729629] “false positive” HPV tests compared to HC2. The test may be m ore predictive than the detection of HPV DNA alone 
because upregulation of mRNA from the oncogene region of the HPV genome (E6 and E7) likely predicts which HPV infections are more likely to persist and progress to a high- grade lesion and cancer. The performance characteristics of APTIMA 
HPV were compared with HC2 for the detection of CIN2+ in specimens collected from women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal cytology. APTIMA HPV had an SN of 95.2% and an SP of 42.2%, compared with HC2, which had an SN of 99.6% and an SP of 28.4% when used without concurrent cytology.

1.1.8 ArborVita  OncoE6™ HPV test 
The Arbor Vita  Onco E6TM Cervical Test (E6 Test) is an immunochromatographic 
test applying the lateral flow format (“strip test,” conceptually similar to over -the-
counter pregnancy tests) to detect elevated levels of the HPV E6 oncoprotein from a cervical cytology  specimen. As no w demonstrated from the outcome of a clinical 
study

sandwich principle. The E6 Test can be performed from a “dry” cervical polyester tipped (Dacron) swab, or from PreservCyt solution. The E6 Test can be performed and interpreted upon short training by [CONTACT_729630] y 
skills. Briefly, the cervical specimen is subjected to a simple two step lysis procedure, followed by a short centrifugation for lysate clearance. An aliquot of this lysate is allowed to run up the strip driven by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_729600], and if E6 oncoprotein was present in the sample, a capture mAb / E6 / detector mAb complex 
will be formed at the HPV16 and/or HPV18 test lines, respectively. The run up step is followed by a wash step and a development step, and then by [CONTACT_729631]. The time from sample collection to result is approx. 2.5 hours. The appearance of a control line on the strip assures proper function of the reagents, and a positive control (mixture of recombinant HPV 16 and 18 E6 protein) is part of the Onco E6

1.2 Rationale 
The current state of anal cancer screening recommendations is similar to the state of cervical cancer screening recommendations in the 1960s, prior to the era of evidence -based 
medicine. Although screening for anal ca ncer among HIV -positive individuals has been 
endorsed by [CONTACT_729632], the available information has critical gaps that we will be able to address in our study:  
1) Anal cytology and HPV test characteristics: What are the screening test characteristics of anal cytology and commercially available or soon -to-be commercially available 
HPV tests in HIV -positive women using HRA and biopsy as the gold standard? 
2) Anal HSIL in HIV -positive women: What is the prevalence of histologically -verified 
anal HSIL? What is the incidence of anal HSIL and HPV infection?  
3) Predictors of anal HPV and HSIL in HIV -positive women: Does cervical HPV, 
behavioral, and/or immunologic characteristics, such as cART adherence and nadir CD4 count risk identify women at risk for anal HPV and HSIL?  
4) Poor documentation of Cost -effectiveness: What is the cost -effectiveness of anal 
cancer screening strategies in the U.S. for HIV -positive women?

sampling procedures may be omitted at the preference of the participant and the provider, and cervical cytology procedures may still be performed if required for 
the participant ’s medical care. Participants will resume all visits and procedures 
after resolution of the pregnancy. Any visits or procedures that are missed for this 
reason should be reported as missed visits and/or forms in AdvantageEDC, as appropriate. 
4.4 Pathology Review 
4.4.1 Initial pathology r eading:  
The specimens will first be sent to the local site’s pathology department for processing and pathology interpretation. Each cytology and histology specimen 
will be assigned a unique accession number in the GlobalTrace
SM specimen 
tracking system for data reporting purposes and for subsequent consensus pathology assessments.  
Anal and cervical cytology specimens will be assigned a reading according to the 
current Bethesda System terminology:  
• Negative for intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_729604] (NILM) 
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_145582] (ASC- US) 
• Low-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (LSIL)  
• High -grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (HSIL) 
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_679050], cannot exclude HSIL  (ASC -H) 
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_729605] (AGC)  
• Cancer, specify squamous cell or adenocarcinoma  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996528] terminology  
• Benign/Reactive:  squamous metaplasia; etc  
• LSIL (condyloma OR AIN1) 
• HSIL (AIN2, AIN2/3, or AIN3) 
• Cancer, specify squamous cell or adenocarcinoma  
Cytology and histology readings from the local cytopathology laboratories will be 
reported in the appropriate CRF in AdvantageEDCSM. 
4.5 Consensus Pathology Review 
All anal histology  slides taken during Visits 1 -5 will be submitted to the AMC 
Biorepository for central pathology review. See Appendix VI  for details . 
4.6 Follow- up for Abnormal Results  
Clinical management for all study participants will be based on the local pathology  
interpretation. However, if the consensus pathology review is significantly different from 
the local pathology review, that information will be communicated to the clinical site to 
aid in patient management.  
Anal 
• If the anal cytology shows HSIL or ASC -H and no corresponding anal or perianal HSIL 
was found on HRA, then the participant should undergo another HRA in 3-6 months. 
• Further evaluation and/or treatment recommendations will be made according to HRA 
findings (See Appendix IX for recommendations regarding further evaluation and/or 
treatment).  
Cervical  
• Participant s with abnormal cervical cytology should be referred  for colposcopy as per 
ASCCP management guidelines (See Appendix IX ). 
STUDY VISITS: (i.e., 6 month visits) participants will remain on schedule for data 
collection regardless of any interval visits for HRA, colposcopy, or treatment procedures 
(e.g., for symptomatic condyloma or HSIL of the cervix, CIN2 , 3). 
Results from any abnormal follo w-up and any interval treatment procedures will be 
recorded in the CRF at the subsequent scheduled study visit. 
4.7 Early Study Discontinuation Procedures  
An Early Discontinuation form will be completed for all early study discontinuations to document the reason for early discontinuation.  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  26 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  5.0 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION 
5.1 Early Study Discontinuation

visit). Only participants  with benign or LSIL diagnoses on ALL anal biopsies at each 
visit will be allowed to continue in the study. Participants who have only cytologic 
HSIL diagnoses are permitted to continue on study as long as histology results do not show HSIL.  
• Request by [CONTACT_729635].  
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he thinks the study is no longer in the best 
interest of the participant. 
• The participant  is judged by [CONTACT_729636].

AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  27 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  6.0 ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The 
following list of AEs ( Section 6.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 6.2 ) 
will determine whether the event requires routine reporting (via AdvantageEDCSM). 
The CTEP Version 5.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTEP Version 5.0 of the CTCAE is 
identified and located on the CTEP website at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP Version 5.0 of 
CTCAE.  
6.1 Expected Adverse Events Related to the Study Procedures  
Anal cytology collection, HRA , and anal biopsy 
• Participant s will likely experience pressure and urgency to defecate during the anal 
cytology collection and HRA. Participant s may experience discomfort during the 
injection of local anesthetic (if used). There may be mild to moderate intra - and post - 
procedural pain for up to [ADDRESS_996529] longer than 2 weeks. 
• Mild bleeding and discharge is relatively common after the procedure and may occur 
up to [ADDRESS_996530] -procedure that is severe enough to prompt an evaluation at the 
emergency room.  
• There is a slight risk (<1%) of infection or abscess post -procedure requiring antibiotics.  
6.2 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_729637] R elationship  
6.2.1 Adverse Event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to th e 
medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). 
6.2.2 Life-threatening Adverse Event: Any AE that places the participant  or participant , 
in view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from th e reaction.  
6.2.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disa bility/ 
incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6.2.4 Please note for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) for medical events equivalent to CTCAE Grade 3, 4, [ADDRESS_996531] be reported regardless of the requirements for Phase of study, expected or unexpected, and attribution. For example, do not report an admission for pharmacokinetic sampling, but do report an admission for a myocardial infarction. 
6.2.5 Toxicity: Toxicity is a term NOT clearly defined by r egulatory organizations. 
Toxicity has been described as an AE that has an attribution of possibly, probably 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  28 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  or definitely related to investigational treatment. To minimize confusion the NCI 
would recommend that the term toxicity NOT be utilized for AE repo rting 
purposes. The CTCAE continues to use the term ‘toxicity’ because of familiarity. 
6.2.6 Unexpected Adverse Event: Any AE that is not listed in available sources including the package insert, the Investigator’s Brochure, or the protocol. 
6.2.7 CTEP Adv erse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ): An electronic system for 
expedited submission of AE reports. 
6.2.8 Attribution: The determination of whether an AE is related to a medical treatment or procedure. Attribution categories: 
Definite – The AE is clearly  related to the investigational agent.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the investigational agent.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the investigational agent.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent. Unrelated – The AE  is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent.  
6.3 Routine AE Reporting  
All adverse events (AEs)  of Grade 3 or greater severity  that are possibly, probably, or 
definitely attributed to the study procedures will be recorded on the Adverse Event Form  
in AdvantageEDC
SM. Only adverse events of Grade 3 or greater severity are required for 
safety monitoring and study analysis. Adverse Event Forms will not be required for Grade 
1 and 2 AEs; these events will only require recording in source documents. Participant s 
withdrawn from the study due to AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_415172], when appropriate, additional written reports and documentation will be provided. 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  29 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Sample Size  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the 
following methods for the detection of HSIL of the anus (as determined by [CONTACT_729638]): anal cytology, HPV hybrid capture 2, HPV mRNA assays (APTIMA) and Arbor Vita OncoE6 HPV test. Note that throughout this section, HSIL (of the anus) is 
defined as the local or consensus pathology interpretation of any anal biopsy . At the initial 
visit, all women will undergo an HRA -directed biopsy to determine if they have HSI L. 
Since HRA is considered the “gold standard,” the findings on HRA will determine whether a woman is classified as having HSIL or not.  HSIL may be under -diagnosed due to operator 
error, thus the diagnosis of HSIL will be based on the procurement of at least [ADDRESS_996532] or the consensus pathology on any anal biopsy at a given visit. Based on 
previous reports,
41 it is anticipated that approximately 10% of w omen will have HSIL. The 
prevalence of HRA -proven HSIL can be estimated with a 95% confidence interval of +/ - 
3.3%. 
For each of the methods of detection, the null hypothesis that the sensitivity is 50% can be 
tested against the alternative that sensitivity  is at least 75% at the one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_996533] results from 
all three tests -APTIMA, HC2, and HPVE6E7-are all dichotomous, i.e., reported as either 
positive or negative (or unevaluable). With 270 women who are negative for HSIL on HRA, the null hypothesis that specificity is 50% can be tested against the alternative hypothesis that specificity is at least 65% at the one -sided 0.05 significance level with 
power of 0.99. 
The novel methods of  detection (HPV hybrid capture 2, HPV mRNA assays (APTIMA) 
and Arbor Vita  Onco E6 HPV test ) will be evaluated to determine if they improve 
sensitivity or specificity compared to routine anal cytology using McNemar’s test. With 30 
HSIL women, a 20% increase in sensitivity with 25% of participant s with discordant results 
can be detected at the one -sided 0.05 significance level with 78% power. With 270 women 
negative for HSIL, a 20% increase in specificity with 25% of participant s with discordant 
results can be detected at the one- sided 0.05 significance level with 99% power. Positive 
and negative predictive values will be assessed for each method of detection.  
To determine incidence of HSIL, we will use the information from the women whose initial HRA examinat ion is negative for HSIL. If these women are followed for an average of 1.[ADDRESS_996534] 1.8 x 270 = 486 person- years of follow -up. The table below 
shows the 95% Poisson confidence intervals for two levels of the underlying incidence of HSIL wit h 486 person-years of observation: 
  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  30

interval (per 100 person -years)  
2.06 (1.11, 3.82)  
3.09 (1.86, 5.12)  
7.2 Primary Statistical Analyses 
7.2.1 Primary analyses  
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each of the methods of detection, the 
binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be used. Among participant s who are HRA positive for HSIL, McNemar’s test will be used to 
compare routine anal cyt ology with each of the other methods of detection to 
determine if sensitivity in the diagnosis of HSIL is improved with the other methods. Similarly, among participant s who are HRA negative for HSIL, 
McNemar’s test will be used to compare routine anal cyto logy with each of the 
other methods of HPV detection to improve specificity. Positive and negative predictive values will be estimated for each method of detection.  
The prevalence of HSIL will be estimated as the proportion of women who are HRA positive for HSIL at entry and its 95% confidence interval. Logistic regression analyses will be used to evaluate the association of potential risk factors (cervical HPV, abnormal cervical cytology, behavioral, and immunologic characteristics, such as plasma HIV -1 RNA, current and nadir CD4 count) with diagnosis of HSIL.  
To estimate the incidence of HSIL among women who were HRA negative for HSIL at study entry, the Poisson rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated from the number of HSIL cases detected d ivided by [CONTACT_729639] -up across these cases. Behavioral risk factors will be assessed by [CONTACT_729640]. Included in these risk factors is the risk of ongoing sexual exposure to HPV in the study population. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate potential risk factors for incidence of HSIL.  
To estimate the incidence of anal HPV among women who were negative for anal HPV at study entry, the Poisson rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated from the number of anal HPV cases detected divided by [CONTACT_729641] -up across these cases. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate 
potential risk factors for incidence of anal HPV.  
Analysis of the results of the Arbor Vita assay will be delayed after the primary analysis is performed using the results of the Hybrid Capture 2 and Aptima Assays, if the Arbor Vita assay is optimized to yield sufficient results from anal cytology specimens in the future. 
7.2.2 Exploratory a nalyses  
We will evaluate the acceptability of anal cancer screening based on survey responses regarding participant  satisfaction at each study visit ( Appendix XIII
 and 
XV) and phone call surveys ( Appendix XIV ) administered after study visits 1, 3 , 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  31 
NCI Version Date  21MAR2018  and 5. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize participant s’ acceptability 
of undergoing anal screening with cytology/HPV and HRA throughout the study to 
evaluate ch anges in perceptions. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be 
used to assess acceptability over time adjusting for intrapatient variability.  
Acceptability will be correlated with clinical and behavioral risk factors, e.g., history of sexual assault,  depression, anxiety, medication compliance, sexual 
behaviors using GEE methods. 
A fully de -identified dataset from the study, which will include data obtained on 
quality of life, anxiety, costs, and procedures, will be made available to [CONTACT_729662] ntor, MD Anderson, for an economic evaluation of cost effectiveness 
modeling of anal cancer strategies in HIV -positive women.

8.[ADDRESS_996535] study evaluation. At all reviews, careful consi derations should be given to the 
following items: 
Prevalence and incidence of HSIL. The sample size calculation was done using a 
prevalence of 10%. Substantial differences in prevalence in this study may require recalculation of the sample size and length of follow -up. 
Number of missing visits and number of early study discontinuations, and their effects on the length of intervals and loss to follow up. 
Reported adverse events.  
The protocol team members noted above will review these items and determine whet her 
any modification to the study is required. If consensus about study modification or 
restarting the study is not reached among these members, then the issue will be referred to 
the AMC Executive Committee for a decision.  
The protocol chairs will monitor  the quality of HRA data on a per -site basis. Only the HRA 
results for the enrollment visit (V1) will be reviewed. Specifically, the protocol chairs will review the proportion of participants with HSIL at each site, stratified by [CONTACT_729643] (normal vs. abnormal). It is anticipated that the proportion of participants with HSIL to be at least 30% in those with abnormal cytology. The median number of biopsies performed

NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX III: ANAL SAMPLING PROCEDURES  
All anal cytology specimens will be examined at the local institution.  
The participant  should undress from the waist down, and either bend over the exam table or lay on 
their side in the fetal position. The examiner should use one hand to spread the buttocks and expose 
the anal verge.  
Procedure for obtaining an anal swab specimen 
A Dacron swab moistened in tap water will then be inserted as far as is comfortable into the anus, a minimum of [ADDRESS_996554] specimens collected 
in the order “local,” “thinprep”, and “lysis ” at all visits, whereas participant 2 may be designated 
the order “thinprep,” “lysis,” and “local” at all visits, etc. The three swabs collected are:  
• Dacron Swab “local” [Identified as “Dacron Swab (local cytology)” in the swab sequence 
assignment at enro llment]. This swab will be placed in the cytology medium required for local 
processing for anal cytology. 
• Dacron Swab “thinprep” [Identified as “Dacron Swab (ThinPrep HPV)”]. This swab will be placed in a 20 mL ThinPrep (PreservCyt) media vial (for research anal HPV analyses) and 
stored in a refrigerator (2 -8° C) as soon as possible after collection. 
• Puritan Medical Products Dacron Swab “lysis” [Identified as “Swab for Arbor Vita ("lysis" tube)”]. This swab will be placed in a tube provided by [CONTACT_729646] (a.k.a., “lysis” tube) 
immediately after collection. The swab stem will be broken to deposit the entire swab head so that the cap will fit on the tube.  Instructions on isolating the swab head in the lysis tube can be 
found on the AMC AIDS Malignancy C onsortium website at www.amcoperations.com . Anal 
swabs placed in the Arbor Vita -supplied tubes should be frozen immediately at -80° C. The 
sites may batch ship these specimens EVERY 3 months. 
Note: While the anal specimen collected for Arbor Vita will be stored “dry,” the swab may be pre -
moistened with tap water before the sampling procedure for patient comfort.  
Sites are strongly encouraged to implement local processes to ensure that the assigned anal 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996555] be documented in the source for each anal sampling procedure. A 
sample source document for this purpose is provided on the AMC AIDS Malignancy Consortium 
website at www.amcoperations.com .Sites will be r equired to report the actual sequence of 
swab collection in the data entry system. 
The Puritan swab will be provided by [CONTACT_229345], and the “lysis” tube for the Arbor Vita swab will 
be provided by [CONTACT_729646]. The ODMC will place all orders for the Puritan swabs and collection tubes for the dry swab specimen on the site’s behalf. All requests for supplies may be placed with the AMC ODMC via email ([EMAIL_1741]) or fax (240 -238- 2842). This request may be 
made using the attached AMC -[ADDRESS_996556] Form can be found on the AMC AIDS Malignancy Consortium website at 
www.amcoperations.com.  
Arbor Vita:  Use the Puritan™ Polyester -Tipped Applicator to obtain the anal specimen and then 
place the swab in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube (lysis tube) and store the lysis tubes at -80oC. Site will 
then batch ship the lysis tubes on dry ice to the AMC Biorepository every 3 months. See the AMC -
084 MOP for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  46 
NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX IV: HIGH RESOLUTION ANOSCOPY (HRA) AND ANAL BIOP SIES  
Procedure for performing HRA 
High resolution anoscopy should only be done after the specimens for anal cytology and HPV 
testing are collected. The patient will already be positioned for anal evaluation. A mixture of a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (e.g. , 2% lidocaine jelly or EMLA ointment) and water -soluble lubricating jelly 
should be used as a lubricant. A digital anal/rectal exam should be performed noting any masses or areas of induration. The procedure for HRA is as follows: 
1) Insert the plastic disposable anoscope, remove obturator, and place a cotton swab wrapped in 
gauze soaked in 3 -5% acetic acid into anus.  
2) Remove the anoscope over the swab and leave in place for 1 to 2 minutes. 
3) Remove the swab and re- insert the anoscope. Carefully examine the anal canal with a 
colposcope. 
4) Re-apply acetic acid as necessary to ensure adequate detection of lesions.  
5) If acetowhitening is noted, note vascular characteristics, if present.  
6) Lugol’s solution (iodine) may be used to aid identification  of possible AIN near the 
squamocolumnar junction. 
7) Biopsy up to six of the most abnormal appearing areas  (directed biopsies) clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_729616]. Local anesthetic (e.g., 1% lidocaine with or without epi[INVESTIGATOR_73803] .5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_9360]) 
may be used at the provider’s discretion prior to biopsy. 
8) Each study participant will have at least  two biopsie s. If fewer than two directed biopsies are 
taken  from two different quadrants, then random biopsy /biopsies will be done such that there 
will be at least  two biopsies from at least  two different quadrants . 
9) Attain hemostasis prior to removal of the anoscope (with pressure, Monsel’s solution, or silver nitrate) . 
10) An external genital exam should be performed to note the presence of condyloma and other abnormalities.  
11) Apply acetic acid to perianal area and examine carefully with colposcope.  
12) Biopsy any external (perianal) areas clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_406965], using a local anesthetic 
(e.g., 1% lidocaine with or without epi[INVESTIGATOR_73803] .5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_9360]) prior to biopsy. 
13) Participant s with signs or symptoms consistent proctitis or sexually transmitted infections 
other than HPV should be referred for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  47 
NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX V: CERVICAL/VAGINAL  SAMPLING PROCEDURES  
Procedure for obtaining cervical/vaginal cytology samples 
The participant should undress from the waist down, and lay on her back on the exam table. The 
examiner should follow standard pelvic exam procedures. Collection for two cervical* specimens will be collected. The cervical cytology specimen (using the “broo m”, cytobrush, and/or spatula) 
will be collected first, and will be placed in the standard liquid -based cytology media at each local 
institution (e.g., ThinPrep or SurePath). The second specimen will be collected by “broom,” 
cytobrush, and/or spatula  and dispersed in a 20 ml vial of ThinPrep (PreservCyte) to be used for 
all three HPV analyses.  
See Appendix VI
 for local processing of the first sample for cytology. 
See Appendix VI I for processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_729617]. 
*If the participant has had a hysterectomy, then the specimens should be collected from the vaginal apex instead of the cervix.

NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX VI: PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING LOCAL CYTOLOGY/ 
HISTOLOGY SPEC IMENS AND CENTRAL PATHOLOGY REVIEW  
Local cytology/pathology specimen processing 
1) Local cytology  reading: Run the liquid cytology sample (ThinPrep or Surepath) as is, per 
protocol at the local institution. The reading from the cytopathology lab will be submitted in 
the appropriate eCRF in AdvantageEDC. The study investigators will have access to the 
cytopathology reading via the AMC Operations web site (secure access).  
2) Residual specimens: If the participant  consented to donate residual study specimens to the 
ACSR for future testing, the residual liquid cytology medium after performing the local anal and cervical cytology readings will be sent to AMC Biorepository within 4 weeks of specimen 
collection (see Appendix XI
 for labeli ng and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_29356]). 
3) Histology:  Process as per protocol at the local institution. The reading from the pathology lab 
will be submitted in the appropriate eCRF in AdvantageEDC. The study investigators will have access to the cytopathology reading via the AMC Operations web site (secure access).  
Suggested p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for local pathologists 
1) To differentiate between  the H&E morphologic diagnosis of precancer ( –IN 2 or –IN 3) and a 
mimic of precancer (e.g., processes known to be unrelated to neoplastic risk such as immature 
squamous metaplasia, atrophy, reparative epi[INVESTIGATOR_241194], tangential cutting). Strong and diffuse block-positive p16 results support a categorization of precancerous disease. 
2) To clarify a diagnosis of –IN2 in an H&E morphologic interpretation of –IN 2 (under the old 
terminology), which is a biologically equivocal lesion falling between the morphologic changes of HPV infection (low -grade lesion) and precancer. Strong and diffuse block-positive 
p16 results support a categorization of precancer. Negative or non–block- positive staining 
strongly favors an interpretation of low- grade disease or a non –HPV- associated pathology  
Central pa thology review 
• Please review the MOP for central pathology slide shippi[INVESTIGATOR_729618].  
For quality control, each site will submit all baseline histology study slides  used for screening 
evaluation, including any stained slides, collected from the first six months after enrollment of 
the first study participant at a given study site.  These slides should be batch shipped to the 
AMC Biorepository as soon as possible up to [ADDRESS_996557]. Teresa Darragh at UCSF for review, an d will ship all slides originating from UCSF to Baylor College of Medicine for

NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX VIII: AMC DATA AND SAFETY MONIT ORING PLAN 
(Version 6.0   March 17, 2017) 
 
Monitoring the Progress of Trials and the Safety of Participants  
All AMC protocols that collect safety data follow the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/guidelines/index.html). All adverse events that meet the NCI’s expedited reporting requirements are reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) web application. All expedited adverse 
event reports are also required to be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the reporting institution. If NCI holds the IND or no IND is required for a study, the AMC site reports 
serious adverse events directly to the AMC Operations and Data Management Center (ODMC) via CTEP -AERS; expedited reporting via AdvantageEDC/Advantage eClinical may be permitted for 
select commercial agent studies per protocol requirements. In some instances, the AMC sites may 
report serious adverse events directly to a commercial sponsor holding the IND, who will then report the event to the AMC ODMC. Most AMC protocols require sites to report all serious adverse events via CTEP -AERS and the AMC ODMC to forward a copy of the report to the 
sponsor. The AMC ODMC also distributes all IND safety reports to all investigators upon receipt, and makes these reports available on the password -protected section of the AMC Operations web 
site. Unless an AMC protocol specifies an alternate plan for the review and submission of serious adverse events, all serious adverse events received by [CONTACT_729647]. For protocols for which the IDB does not have an assigned drug monitor to review serious adverse event reports, in the event of disagreement between the reporting physician and the AMC Medical Monitor regarding the attribution of the event to the investigational agent(s) (i.e., determination of whether the relationship is unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite), the AMC Medical Monitor will provide the final determination of the relationship. 
The AMC ODMC provides listings of all reported adverse events and serious adverse events to 
the Protocol Chair and Co- chair(s) for review on a regular basis. The AMC ODMC compi[INVESTIGATOR_406993] a tabular format and posts them on the password-protected section of the AMC web site where these reports are updated nightly. The AMC web site is accessible to all AMC investigators, co-investigators, and their staff. Email notification that this information is available on the web 
site will be sent to all site PIs. It is the responsibility of each site to provide this information to their respective IRBs, if required by [CONTACT_11577]. For blinded studies, the serious adverse events are reviewed and tabulated without treatment assignment. The AMC Medical Monitor will review listings of all reported adverse  events on a quarterly basis for safety concerns.  
Accrual summaries for each AMC trial are updated nightly on the password -protected section of 
the AMC web site. The progress of each AMC trial is reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_86988]- oriented Working Group during scheduled conference calls. 
For phase I dose escalation trials, dose escalation (or dose de -escalation) is based on the rules in 
the protocol and the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and Group Statistician determine 
whether these criteria have been met. For phase II trials, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241198], or suspending enrollment pending observation of responses in a multi -stage phase II trial, is based 
on meeting criteria stated in the protoco l, and the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996560] (DSMB). Voting members of the DSMB are 
physicians, a statistician, and a patient advocate. All voting members are from outside the AMC. Nonvoting members are the AMC Group Statistician, the protocol statistician, an AMC Operations Center staff member, two representatives (normally a clinician or statistician) from the Office of HIV AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) or from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The DSMB reviews  
AMC phase III studies in accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring. Confidential reports of all phase III trials are prepared by [CONTACT_729648]. A written report containing the current status of each trial monitored, and when appropriate, any toxicity and outcome data, are sent to DSMB members by [CONTACT_729649]. This report addresses specific toxicity concerns as well as concerns about the conduct of the trial. The report may contain recommendations for consideration by [CONTACT_407063], report the results, or continue accrual or follow-up. 
The results of each DSMB meeting are summarized in a f ormal report sent by [CONTACT_729650]. The DSMB report contains recommendations on whether to 
close each study reviewed, whether to report the results, and whether to continue accrual or follow -
up. A primary recommendation (e.g., continue with no change; recommended or required modification; stop) must be included in the document. The Group Chair is then responsible for notifying the Protocol Chair and relevant Disease -oriented Working Group Chair before the 
recommendations of the DSMB are carried out. In the unlikely event that the Protocol Chair does not concur with the DSMB, then the NCI Division Director or designee must be informed of the reason for the disagreement. The Study Chair, relevant Disease- oriented Working Group Chair, 
Group Chair, DSMB Chair, and NCI Division Director or designee will be responsible for reaching a mutually acceptable decision about the study. CTEP approval of a formal amendment will be required prior to any implementation of a change to the study. 
Following a DSMB meeting, a summary of the serious adverse events reported to the DSMB is 
posted to the AMC web site. It is each site’s responsibility for conveying this information to its IRB.  
Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of Adverse Events (AE) 
For trials monitored by [CONTACT_6812]’s Clinical Data Update System (CDUS), adverse event 
information is transmitted electronically to NCI on a quarterly basis. For trials monitored by [CONTACT_12134]’s Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS), adverse event information is transmitted electronically to NCI every two weeks.  
The Protocol Chair, AMC Group Chair, and the AMC ODMC share responsibility in assuring that participating investigators comply with the protocol requirements for adverse event reporting. All AMC investigators certify compliance with NCI and FDA requirements for adverse event reporting by [CONTACT_407065], the protocol signature [CONTACT_241335], and Form FDA -1572 for CTEP investigator registration 
and IND studies sponsored by [CONTACT_407066]. Investigators are responsible for identifying and reporting all adverse events to the AMC ODMC, CTEP -AERS, and/or sponsors according to 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  53 
NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  the protocol requirements, and assuring compliance with reporting to the local IRB. Protocol 
compliance with adverse event reporting requirements is assessed by [CONTACT_729651]’s source documentation.  
The data entry system used for AMC studi es, AdvantageEDC/Advantage eClinical (a web -based 
data entry and enrollment system), is programmed to notify the site investigator, protocol chair, 
AMC Medical Monitor, and AMC ODMC via email in the event that a site reports an adverse event that meets exp edited reporting criteria to NCI and/or FDA. If the site does not follow with 
an expedited report, the AMC ODMC contacts sites to request compliance with reporting requirements. Additionally, the protocol chair, AMC ODMC, and the AMC Medical Monitor review  reported adverse events on a routine basis to identify adverse events reported by [CONTACT_729652]. The Protocol Chair, AMC Group Chair, and IND sponsors have general oversight for assuring that routine and expedited adverse reportin g requirements are met 
by [CONTACT_241321]. 
Plans for Assuring that any Action Resulting in a Temporary or Permanent Suspension of 
an NCI -Funded Clinical Trial is Reported to the NCI Grant Program Director Responsible 
for the Grant  
In the event that  termination of the trial or major modification to the protocol is under 
consideration, the Protocol Chair will convene the AMC Data Coordinator and Disease -oriented 
Working Group Chair by [CONTACT_407069]. For phase I and II trials, the 
Protocol Chair also has the option of asking the DSMB to review the study. The AMC ODMC will inform the CTEP Protocol Information Office (PIO) when studies are temporarily or permanently closed. The Cancer Treatment and Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the  National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) must approve all protocol amendments prior to distributing to the AMC sites. 
Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance 
All study data for AMC clinical trials are entered directly by [CONTACT_729653]/Advantage eClinical. During data entry, the system performs validation checks on 
many fields and performs consistency checks between select fields. Range checks are placed on each field to eliminate entry of out-of- range values. Edit check programs are run on the database 
on a set schedule to identify and resolve inconsistencies between forms or data collected at different points in time. AMC ODMC staff routinely interacts with site staff to resolve any data problems. 
In accordance with NC I guidelines, the AMC ODMC conducts audits at the AMC sites to evaluate 
compliance with regulatory issues, and to review data for specific cases by [CONTACT_407071]. These reports are sent to the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241202]. In the event 
that major violations are identified, sites are asked to provide a written corrective and preventative action plan to correct deficiencies. If needed, a repeat site audit is conducted. In the event that a site does not correct deficiencies in a pre-determined time frame, the AMC Executive Committee has the option of taking action against the site. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, suspending enrollment of new patients to AMC trials until deficiencies are corrected; recommending a decrease in funding to the site; and requiring specific training for site investigators or staff members.

NCI Version Date 21MAR2018  APPENDIX XII: INFORMED CONSENT FOR OPTIONAL ACSR DONAT ION  
Study Title for Study Partici pants:  Collecting Blood and Tissue Sample Donations for 
Research for HIV/AIDS -Related Cancers  
Official Study Title:  Biospecimen Collection and Donation to the AIDS  
and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR)  
What is the usual approach to donate blood and/or tissue to the ACSR?  
You are being asked to donate blood and/or tissue for research. You are being asked to take part 
in this study because you have HIV infection and have been offered participation in an AMC clinical trial. The AMC works with the ACSR to c ollect donated samples from persons with HIV 
infection for research studies. People who do not take part in an AMC clinical trial can also donate samples to the ACSR.  
What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study? 
It is your choice to donate or not donate your blood and/or tissue samples. You may still take part 
in the AMC clinical study if you choose not to donate blood or biopsy samples. You may also choose to donate: 
• Blood but not tissue, or  
• Tissue but not blood. 
What is the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR)?  
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has set up the ACSR. The ACSR is a biorepository (bank) 
that collects human biological specimens (biospecimens) from persons who have HIV, HIV -
related conditions, or AIDS -related cancers. Th e ACSR stores the samples and some of the donor’s 
medical information for use in future research studies. 
The ACSR has an independent research panel that approves researchers’ study plans to use the 
ACSR’s stored samples. The ACSR only gives samples and medical information to researchers after approving their projects. Researchers may use the biospecimens to study cancers and other diseases associated with HIV disease. This information may help us learn more about the causes of treat HIV -related diseases an d cancers and to develop better ways to screen, diagnose, and treat 
them.  
Why is this study being done?  
The purpose of this study is to collect biospecimens for the ACSR. Researchers may study samples from the ACSR in combination with hundreds or thousands  of other samples to explore how 
genetic factors may be related to HIV -related diseases and cancer. The information might help 
doctors in the future to identify who will or will not benefit from treatment. The samples may be used to learn more about how HI V-related diseases and cancers develop. The samples may also 
lead to new tests or discoveries.  Finally, scientists may use the samples to study the genetic 
material from your cancer tissue and compare it to the material from your normal tissue (blood) to try to find the differences that exist.  These studies could make it possible  to identify many of the 
changes that are associated with diseases such as cancers. It may also help us tailor treatments to a patient's unique genetic make-up and/or to the genetic markers of the tumors.  
  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996567] if I take part in this study?  
1) If you agree to donate blood, the medical team will draw about 2 tablespoons of blood to give 
to the ACSR. This takes about 10 minutes. 
2) If you agree to donate tissue, your leftover tissue biopsy material will be donated to and stored 
by [CONTACT_635032]. If it turns out that your study doctor needs more of your tissue for additional studies, the ACSR will return all of your tissue back to your study doctor. 
3) Some of your clinical information will be released to the ACSR and entered into their database. 
The information given to the ACSR will not include your name [CONTACT_635056].  
No extra biopsies will be collected for the ACSR . We will only give tissue that is left over after 
making decisions about your treatment or diagnosis to the ACSR. The study doctor will not take any extra biopsies just for the ACSR. 
We cannot tell you right now what future research these samples would be used for. Instead, we 
are asking that you give approval to give your samples for future testing without contact[CONTACT_635033]. The results of whatever research is done on your samples will not be told to you or your 
doctor. The results of the tests will not be placed in your study records. 
How long will ACSR keep my samples?  
Your blood and/or tissue sample will be stored until it is used for research. The samples may be stored indefinitely. 
What possible risks can I expect from taking part in this study?  
• Blood Draw: The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, 
bruising, and, rarely, infection. 
• Biopsy : The risks of biopsy include possible need for stitches depending on the size of the 
biopsy. There may be swelling, slight pain and a small amount of blood loss. There is also a 
chance of infection at the site of the biopsy.  
• Confidentiality : While the ACSR and researchers who study ACSR samples will have no 
information that could identify you, there is a risk that someone could use information from 
genetic studies to trace your samples back to you. The researchers believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small, but the risk may change in the future as people come up with new ways of tracing information. In some ca ses, this information could be used to 
make it harder for you to get or keep a job. There are laws against misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. The researchers believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but cannot promise that they will not occur. 
• There can also be a risk in finding out new genetic information about you. New health 
information about inherited traits that might affect you or your blood relatives could be found 
during a study. 
Let your study doctor know of any questions you have about these possible risks. You can ask 
the study doctor questions about side effects at any time.  
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996568] from taking part in this study?  
This study is unlikely to help you. This study may help us learn things that may help people in the 
future.  
The information may help to identify those who are at increased risk and those who may benefit from targeted treatment and screening. In turn, these studies could help find ways to prevent or improve treatments for HIV -related diseases and AIDS -related cancers.  
Can I stop taking part in this study?  
Yes, you may withdraw your samples from the ACSR at any time while you are taking part in the main study. We will not keep information that links you to your samples after the main study is over. After the study is over, the AMC and the ACSR will not be able to identify your specific samples. Contact [CONTACT_729655]. The coordinator can ask the ACSR to remove your sample and clinical information from the ACSR. 
However, if any research has already been done using some of your samples, the data will be kept and analyzed as part of those studies. 
What are my rights in this study? 
Taking part in this study is your choice. No matter what decision you make, and even if your 
decision changes, there will be no penalty to you. You will not lose medical care or any legal 
rights.  
For questions about your rights while in this study, call the ________________________ (insert 
name [CONTACT_29094]) Institutional Review Board at __________________ (insert telephone number). 
(Note to Local Investigator: Contact [CONTACT_539052] a local institution who are not on the IRB or research team but take calls regarding clinical 
trial questions can also be listed here.) 
What are the costs of taking part in this study? 
There will be no cost to you for donating your samples to the ACSR. You will not be paid for 
taking part in this study.  
What happens if I am injured or hurt because I took part in this study?  
If you are injured or hurt as a result of taking part in this study and need medical treatment, please tell your study doctor. The AMC will not offer to pay for medical treatment for injury. Your insurance company may not be willing to pay for study -related injury. If you have no insurance, 
you would be responsible for any costs. 
If you feel this injury was a result of medical error, you keep all your legal rights to seek payment 
for injury even though you are in a study. 
Who will see my medical information? 
Your privacy is very important to us and the researchers will make every effort to protect it. Your 
information may be given out if required by [CONTACT_2371]. For example, certain states require doctors to report to health boards if they find a disease like tuberculosis. However, the researchers will do their best to make sure that any information that is released will not identify you. Some of your 
health information, and/or information about your specimen, from this study will be kept in a 
central database for research. Your name [CONTACT_122541] [CONTACT_305352]. 
 
AMC #084 (Version 6.0) 21MAR2018  [ADDRESS_996569] your records. These organizations are required to make 
sure your informati on is kept private, unless required by [CONTACT_139207]. Some of these 
organizations are: 
• The AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) 
• The Institutional Review Board, IRB, is a  group of people who review the research with the 
goal of protecting the people who take part in the study. 
• The Office for Human Research Protections and the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. 
To protect your privacy, the AMC does not keep identifying information that links study 
participants to specific samples. As a result, the  AMC and ACSR will not be able to link the results 
from studies that use your samples back to you. Thus, information, including genetic information, that researchers may obtain in studies that use your biospecimens may not be directly linked to you and will not be placed in your medical record. However, some clinical and basic information obtained confidentially from the AMC will be attached with these data. It is possible that findings may one day help, for example, people of the same race or sex as you. I t also is possible that 
genetic factors might come to be associated with people who have HIV and cancer through these kinds of studies. 
Where can I get more information?  
You may visit the NCI Web site at http://cancer.gov/ for more information about studie s or general 
information about cancer. You may also call the NCI Cancer Information Service to get the same 
information at 1 -800-4- CANCER (1 -[PHONE_421]).

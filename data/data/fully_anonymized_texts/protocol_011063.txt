2. Objectives  
Goal:  Determine the value of PneumoniaCheck specimens for diagnosing SARS -CoV-2 infection and 
assessing disease state and understanding pathogenesis of disease.  
 
Aim 1: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SARS- CoV-2 RNA in cough -generated 
droplets captured with the PneumoCheck ™ 
 
Aim 2: Determine the value of detecting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and other biomarkers 
in cough -generated droplets with PneumoniaCheck in evaluating disease in COVID -19 patients.  
 
3. Background  
A novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) was detected in association with cases of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_458687] (COVID -19) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019(1). The virus  
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from

 subsequently spread widely throughout China and globally. As of June [ADDRESS_586049] been reported globally and over 1,700,000 cases and 100,000 deaths in the [LOCATION_002](2). Addressing this unprecedented global pande mic is requiring all available tools to diagnose 
infection, manage ill patients, understand disease pathogenesis and virus transmission to guide efforts 
to decrease transmission and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_458688] -viral drugs and vaccines. We propose to use the 
Pneum oniaCheck ™, a device developed collaboratively by [CONTACT_458704] (GA Tech) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help address these 
issues. This device, non -invasively, captures coughed droplets onto  a filter with minimal contamination 
from upper airway secretions(3, 4). In preliminary studies in cystic fibrosis, mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) patients and control patients, we detected bacterial DNA by [CONTACT_954], inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines by [CONTACT_458705], surfactant by [CONTACT_283371] (EIA), and amylase by 
[CONTACT_458706]. These data show that this device can provide high quality specimens from the lung 
with minimal risk to the patient and healthcare provider and much lower risk t han invasive procedures 
such as bronchioloalveolar lavage. In addition, with this device, we can acquire specimens from patients who do not have a productive cough (dry cough), a commonly reported symptom for COVID -19, and 
specimens with minimal upper resp iratory contamination unlike a sputum specimen. Thus, this device 
can provide lung secretion specimens to improve detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (lung specimens are 
better for detecting virus than upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458689]) and detect inflammatory and  other 
biomarkers  to explore pathogenesis  of disease,  identify  inflammatory  processes that might  be amenable 
to intervention, and identify biomarkers of disease severity for patient management and evaluation of vaccines and anti -viral drugs. We propose to determine how PneumoniaCheck ™ can help diagnose, 
manage, and understand pathogenesis of disease and transmission risk of  COVID -19. 
 
The PneumoniaCheck uses fluid mechanics to preferentially eliminate upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458690] -generated droplets from the lung onto a filter. The device, illustrated in Figure 1, 
is designed to prevent upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458691], to direct residual upper airway (dead space) that may contain upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458692] a balloon, and to direct 
coughed air from the lung through a filter. Once the balloon is filled with dead space air, air from the lung is diverted through the filter and the droplets captured onto the filter. DNA or RNA from bacteria, viruses, etc., or proteins and other molecules present in these droplets can be detected by [CONTACT_458707] (EIAs) for cytokines, chemokines, or other molecules. The ability to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA and biomarkers indicative of in flammation and active disease should 
help  physicians  manage  COVID -19 patients  and researchers  understand  the disease  process  and possibly 
transmission risk. This study will develop data on detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and lung biomarkers 
with this device in  COVID -19 patients.

4. Study  Endpoints  
Aim 1. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SARS -CoV-2 RNA in cough -generated  
droplets captured with the  PneumoCheck ™. We have captured real time PCR detectable bacterial DNA 
from the lung with PneumoCheck ™ in the lung of adults with cystic fibrosis at a rate similar to that 
reported for detecting bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens by [CONTACT_921](3). Since 
high levels of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_586050] ( Table ). We now propose 
to detect biomarkers of inflammation in coughed specimens from patie nt with COVID -19. We 
hypothesize that biomarkers of inflammation from the lung will indicate disease activity, inform 
pathogenesis of COVID -19 disease.

 Table 1. Pathogen detection and specimen 
quality determination. PneumoniaCheck 
specimens were collected in 9 CF patients and 2 non -CF control patients by 5 different 
collections of 10 coughs with each collection separated by > 1 hour. The device was stored 
at -80
oC until processing. The specimen was  
eluted from the filter and tested for Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseud A), and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep Pn) DNA by [CONTACT_954], surfactant A (Surf A) by [CONTACT_191117], and amylase (Amyl) by [CONTACT_458709]. Neg = negative by [CONTACT_954]. Values are PCR CT values except for Amyl/SurfA which is the ratio of Amylase concentration over surfactant A concentration. Note  the much higher Amyl/SurfA ratio for the sputum 
compare to PneumoniaCheck specimens ind icating much lower or negligible levels of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458694].  
 
5. Study Intervention/Investigational  Agent  
Description:  The PneumoniaCheck is a device uses fluid mechanics to preferentially eliminate 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458695] -generated droplets from the lung onto a 
filter. The device, illustrated in Figure 1 above.  
Device  Handling : The patient  will be given  the PneumoniaCheck  device  with  a sterile  ziplock  bag 
and cooler  with  cold  packs  to keep  the device,  shown  a video,  given  verbal  guidance  for collecting 
the first set of coughed specimens, and asked to do 4 additional sets of 10 coughs into the same 
device. The device will be stored in the ziplock bag in the cooler between  collections.  
6. Procedures  Involved:  
Patients seen at Emory COVID -[ADDRESS_586051] will be reviewed for age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, their SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_586052] operating procedures for specimen transportation to the laboratory. In the laboratory, in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet with BSL2+ conditions, the PneumoniaCheck will be double bagged for storage at - 80
oC. Later the specimen is 
processed  and tested  for SARS- CoV-2 RNA  by [CONTACT_458710] a multi plex Luminex  assay 
and mass spectrometry. Each specimen will be given an identification number, without personal identifying  information,  which  will be used  to link laboratory  results  to clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_458696].  
 
 
 
Specimen Processing  
In the laboratory, in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet, with BSL2+ conditions, the PneumoniaCheck will be processed according to Biosafety approved processes.  
 
For processing, the filter is removed from the device (see Figure 1 for location of the filter) and capt ured 
coughed droplets eluted from the filter as described in Attachment 1. The 300ul of specimen containing elution buffer will be divided in 3 aliquots (RNAZol will be added to one aliquot) for storage at - 80
oC until  PneuCk 7  neg 30.08  neg 517.6

 testing. The Spin -X colu mn and filter will also be stored at - 80oC. The vials will be sprayed with 70% 
alcohol to inactivate any contaminating virus before storage.  
 
Specimen testing . The RNAZol containing specimen will be tested with the CDC SARS -CoV-2 N1 and N2 
primers accordin g to the CDC online protocol. One of the other aliquots will be thawed and tested by 
[CONTACT_458711] (e.g., the 
Inflammation 20 -Plex Human ProcartaPlex ™ Panel , Invitrogen ™, Waltham, MA, [LOCATION_003]) and enzyme 
immune assay for surfactant A (Human surfactant Protein A ELISA Kit, Abbexa Ltd [LOCATION_006]) according to the 
manu facturer’s instructions. The specimens will also be tested for amylase by [CONTACT_458712]’s instructions. Before biomarker testing, SARS -CoV-2 will be inactivated 
with an Environmental, Health and Safety Office approved met hod (e.g., heat -inactivation at 56oC for 30 
min. protocol) and for novel biomarkers by [CONTACT_450].  
 
7. Data and Specimen Banking  
Data will be analyzed based on specimen identification number and group (e.g., COVID -19 patient, non - 
COVID -19 acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_458697],  control).  Participants  will be consented  for future  contact  [CONTACT_458713]/or specimens. At the completion of this study, we will store any remaining samples for possible  future  use. The remaining  samples  may  be stored  indefinitely  and may  be used  for future  studies 
of genetic  causes  of the disease.  The samples  will be stored  at Emory  Children’s  Center  and Emory  Labs.  
The sample will be given a unique identification number and stored without participant name [CONTACT_39648]. Only the investigator will have a list to know which sample is linked to which 
patient and this list will be kept confidential in a secure location. If the investigator distributes these samples for research into the causes of the disease, it will be released with the unique identifier, but without any names or medical record numbers.  
8. Sharing of Results with  Participants  
In general, we will not give any individual results from the study of the samples. If we find something of urgent medical importance, we will inform the participant or the participant’s primary care physician, 
although we expect that this will be a very rare occurrence.  
 
9. Study  Timelines  
Patients who consent to participate in the study will be instructed on method of c ollection and asked to 
collect [ADDRESS_586053] 5 sets of 10 cough specime ns 
over the next 24 hours with the same PneumoniaCheck device. After specimen collection is completed, the device is transferred to the laboratory and stored for processing. For processing, the filter (see Figure 1 ) with the captured coughed droplets is re moved from the device, captured droplets eluted 
from the filter, and the eluate and filter are stored at - 80
oC for later testing, PCR for SARS -CoV-2 RNA, 
multiplex Luminex and Simoa Quanterix system assays for biomarkers of inflammation, enzyme immunoassay  (EIA)  for surfactant  A, and an enzymatic  assay  for amylase.  The PCR results,  positivity  and 
CT values,  in

spectrometry to identif y novel biomarkers associated with COVID -19 lung disease.  
 
11. Vulnerable  Populations  
The population group for this study is adults age 18 and up. The study will initially be inclusive 
to English as a primary spoken language. At a later point, inclusion to other primary languages will be considered with available resources to that population group.  
 
12. Local Number of  Participants  
Up to 90 total participants will be accrued locally; taking into consideration those that consent but are not able are to provide speci mens. Those that consent and are unable 
to provide specimens will be considered screen failures and not counted toward overall enrollment.  
13. Recruitment  Methods  
Once the ECC -VRC staff learn of a potential participant, they may contact [CONTACT_102]’s 
physician to determine whether the patient is suitable for participation in a research study. The study staff may contact [CONTACT_458714]. The staff may learn of potential part icipants either by [CONTACT_458715] (for example, a positive diagnostic test) or from physician colleagues.  
 
In the case of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], the patients’ physician must be willing to act as the liaison between the patien t, the patient’s LAR and the research team. For outpatients, the primary 
physician may be asked to serve as the contact [CONTACT_458716]. If the patient is ambulatory and has recovered from the illness, such patients may be asked to visit the ECC -VRC 
if they are interested in participating in the study. There will be no monetary incentive for the patient’s physicians to refer patients to this study.  
 
In the case of healthy volunteers, ECC staff will utilize the adult participant database for those who  agreed to be contact[CONTACT_7678].  
 
Research staff will utilize the Emory IRB approved Oral Consent form to prescreen interested participants. If the subject/LAR provides oral consent, the research staff will proceed with a prescreening telephone questionnaire to exchange relevant study information with the subject. Research staff will collect the participant’s name, phone number, email, age, COVID history, respi[INVESTIGATOR_458698]. If the subject/LAR is interested in participation, the first clinic visit will be made 
at which time full written consent or full oral consent (as stated in the consent section of this document) will be obtained prior to the initiation of any research acti vities.  
 
14. Withdrawal of  Participants  
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from  
Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 9 of 12  Protocol Version: v3 10SEP2021   
 Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_458717]. 
Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study at the investigators’ discretion, for example if the investigator thi nks this may affect the subjects’ wellbeing. If a subject withdraws, no further 
data will be collected. If data has been collected, it will not be destroyed.  
 
15. Risks to  Participants  
The most common risks and discomforts expected in this study are:  
• Participants may feel a slight discomfort from coughing repeatedly into the  device. 
The less common risks and discomforts expected are: 
• Loss of confidentiality, all necessary precautions will be in place to reduce breach  of 
confidentiality.  
 
16. Potential Benefits to  Participants  
Taking part in this research study will not benefit participants personally but the research may help learn new things that may help others in the future.  
 
17. Data Management and  Confidentiality  
Data Analysis . Data will be analyzed based on specimen identification number and group (e.g., 
COVID -19 patient, non -COVID -19 acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_458699], control).  
 
The quality of the specimen captured on the filter, i.e. from the lung or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_458700] A (lung) and amylase (upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]).  
 
The PCR results will be analyzed as positive or negative and by [CONTACT_458718]. The PCR results in COVID -[ADDRESS_586055] some specimens with mass spectrometry to identify novel biomarkers associated with COVID -19 lung disease. Specimens will be saved for additional 
future research testing.

 4. Add 200ul Assay diluent to the 15ml tube with  filter.  
5. Mix well by [CONTACT_31954] 2  min.  
6. Transfer the filter and 200 ul of assay diluent carefully into the insert of a 2.0 ml spin -Xcolumns 
using the sterile  forceps.  
7. Add 100ul assay diluent to 15ml tube to remove any residual specimen. After vortexing for ~[ADDRESS_586056] and 
regulations (HIPAA) will be identified. The participant will be informed that the researchers who obtain 
IIHI (“individually identifiable health information” or “IIHI”) from the health care entities are not 
covered  by [CONTACT_2373]. Once they receive the IIHI from the health care entities, they will put it in a separate 
research record that is not a part of the medical record and that IIHI placed in the separate research record is not be covered by [CONTACT_2373].  
We will also infor m them of their ability to provide research staff consent to access their IIHI for the 
purpose or research. Data and specimen collection will not be linked to individual participants for privacy interest as described in section 7.  
Participants are informed  that they do not have to sign the consent form. If they do not sign this 
consent form, then they may not participate in the research study.  
20. Economic Burden to Participants  
There will be no cost to participants for participating in the study, other than ba sic expenses like 
transportation. Participants will not be charged for any of the research activities . 
 
21. Consent  Process  
Once a potential participant is identified and confirms interest in the study, the study staff will initiate the informed consent proces s. The consent process may be initiated by [CONTACT_458719] a 
prescreening process utilizing an oral consent and phone screen document as described in the recruitment section of this document. In cases where the consent process begins in person, t he study 
coordinator will discuss the study with a potential participant or LAR in a private room within the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic. The subject may be referred by a healthcare provider or may request information 
independent of a provider’s referral about the cou gh droplet specimen collection COVID [ADDRESS_586057] will be given ample time to review the consent and 
ask questions. The consent will be signed in the presence of the coordinator. A signed copy will be gi ven 
to the participant/LAR. The participant/LAR will have the option to retain consent, discuss with family members, and sign the consent at a future date in the presence of a member of the study staff. In the 
case of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458701], a copy of the consent will be made for the medical record.  
 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA and Biomarkers in Coughed Droplets from  
Patients with COVID -19 and Controls  
Page 11 of 12  Protocol Version: v3 10SEP2021  
  
 In some scenarios, informed consent will be obtained verbally without signature [CONTACT_10782] a waiver of 
documentation. This would be done in situations where it is important to minimize in -person exposure 
time to protect study staff and reduce risk of disease transmission in general or the potential 
participant’s LAR is not allowed to visit them (the potential participant) per containment policies. In this 
situation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458702], or an emailed copy of the consent form will be made 
avail able to the participant/LAR from contact [CONTACT_458720][INVESTIGATOR_33717]. The research 
staff will contact [CONTACT_458721]. An informed consent progress note will be used to source document th e consent process, date, name [CONTACT_458723], and relationship to participant. The consent process will be the same as 
written consent (as described above) the only element missing will be the written signature, as the 
process is oral and not in person, from the participant/LAR.  
In the case of the adult SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive patients or the adult patients with a non - 
COVID -19 acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_458703], the ability 
to consent will be made in conjunction with the study team and the advice of the primary care physician. For all cohorts, the appropriate time will be allowed for consenting, including questions and answers, as well as steps to reduce the risk of coercion or undue influen ce. 
Within the consent process, participants will be able to indicate optional consent for participation in future studies and genetic testing of samples. Currently there are no plans for genetic testing.  
Non -English -Speaking Participants  
At this time due to resource restraints we will not be seeking non -English speaking 
participants, however will seek amendment if this becomes available.  
Participants who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
At this time, our target population will be adults ages [ADDRESS_586058] participants and/or the LAR.  
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed, or the research involves deception)  
A partial HIPAA waiver for identification and recruitment may be utilized. Additionally, a waiver of written signature [CONTACT_458724] 10 when oral consent will be obtained in lieu of written consent.  
 
22. Setting  
The research wil l be done at Emory Healthcare facilities either as an inpatient or 
outpatient, and Emory Children’s Center for Healthy Volunteers and follow up visits.  
23. Resources  Available  
• The research group at ECC has its own recruitment staff and utilizes research databases to 
satisfy recruitment  goals.  
• This research will be ongoing until the goals for recruitment have been  satisfied.  
• We are a research facility in which all staff members have been adequately trained on the protocol and appropriate training credentials are  on record.

Title: A Phase 2b,  8-Week, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled , 
Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Effect s of 3 Different Dose  
Levels of IX-01 on Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time 
(IELT), Patient -Reported Outcomes, and Safety in Men with 
Lifelong Premature Ejaculation (PE)  
Sponsor:  Ixchelsis Ltd .

Ramsgate Road, Sandwic h, Kent CT13 9NJ , [LOCATION_008]  
Study Phase: Phase 2b 
Study Sites: Approximately 30 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Indication:  Premature Ejaculation  
Rationale:  In a previous clinical study, the selective oxytocin -receptor 
antagonist, IX -01 has been shown to prolong intravaginal 
ejaculatory latency time ( IELT) and improve patient -reported 
outcomes in men with lifelong premature ejaculation ( PE). This 
study is desi gned to explore the relationship between efficacy 
and dose.  
Objectives:  • To determine the efficacy of 3 different dose  levels of IX-01 
to prolong IELT in men with PE.  
• To determine the efficacy of 3 different do se levels of IX-01 
on Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), control of 
ejaculation, ejaculation -related distress and interpersonal 
difficulty, and satisfaction with sexual intercourse in men 
with PE. 
• To determine the toleration and safety of 3 different dose  
levels of IX-01 taken as required in men with PE.  
Patient Population:  • Men aged ≥18 years and ≤60 years in stable (≥6 months) 
heterosexual relationship and who have lifelong PE.  
• PE confirmed by [CONTACT_736869] ≤[ADDRESS_1006685] 75% of 
attempts at sexual intercourse during  the run-in period.  
• Men meeting other aspects of International Society for 
Sexual Medicine ( ISSM) definition including inability to 
delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations 
and negative personal consequences such as distress, bother 
and frustration .

Study Drug, Dosage, 
and Route of 
Administration:  Study drug will be supplied as 400  mg caplets (IX -01 or 
matching placebo). One dose is 3 caplets to be taken orally 1 to 
6 hours before sexual activity , but not more than once per day. 
There will be 4 dosage groups (placebo, IX -01 400 mg, IX-01 
800 mg, and IX-01 1200 mg). In order to preserve the blind , 
each dose will be supplied in a blister pack containing 3 caplets 
(which will comprise placebo and/or IX -01, depending on the 
treatment group assigned).  
Sample Size: The target total is for  220 patients to be randomized in the study. 
The randomization ratio will be 2:2:3:3 ( placebo, IX -01 400 mg, 
IX-01 800 mg, and IX -01 1200 mg dose groups, respectively).  
Thus, 44 patients each will be randomized to the placebo and 
IX-01 400 mg dose groups, and 66 patients e ach will be 
randomized to the IX-01 800 mg and IX -01 1200 mg dose 
groups. The 2:3 ratio results in only slight loss of statistical 
power from 1:1 randomization while increasing the chances that 
a patient will be randomized to an effective dose of study dru g. 
Assuming an alpha (2 -sided) of 0.05 and a n SD of 70 seconds, a 
sample size of 220 patients randomized in total (44  to the 
placebo and IX -01 400 mg  dose groups  and 66 to the IX-01 
800 mg and IX -01 1200 mg dose groups) provides 
approximately 85%, 90% , and 90% power to detect a mean 
difference of 45 seconds between change from baseline in 
geometric mean ( GM) of IELT for the IX-01 400 mg, IX -01 
800 mg, and IX -01 1200 mg dose group s, respectively, 
compared with the placebo group.  
Sequential multiplicity control testing of IX -01 1200 mg dose 
versus placebo, followed by [CONTACT_736870] -01 800 mg dose versus placebo 
and then IX -01 400 mg dose versus placebo will be done in 
order to control for multiplicity.  
Additional patients may be recruited if some patie nts discontinue 
from the study with less than 2 postbaseline IELT assessments.  
Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the change in GM 
IELT over the treatment assessment period compared with 
baseline, ie , [GM(IELT treatment per iod) – GM(IELT baseline)]. 
Change from baseline in GM IELT over the treatment 
assessment period will be analyzed using a mixed linear model, 
including treatment and baseline IELT as fixed factors and site 
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01 
Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006691] is IX-01 1200 mg versus 
placebo. If it is statistically significant at α=0.05, then the 
following comparisons will be tested in the following order:  
• IX-01 800 mg vs placebo group  
• IX-01 400 mg vs placebo group  
If at any point in the sequence statistical significance is not met, 
then subsequent analyses in the sequence cannot be deemed 
statistically significant. In such cases, nominal P values and 
95% CI will be reported and interpreted in an exploratory 
manner. Irrespective of whether there are any statistically 
significant differences between treatment groups, IELT data 
from all treatment groups will also be used to model a possible 
dose response relationship.  
The same approach to control for multiple comparison s as 
proposed for the primary endpoint will be used for each 
secondary endpoint analysis.  
The following key secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
analyzed:  
1. Fold change in GM IELT over the treatment assessment 
period compared with baseline. 
2. Proportion of pat ients with ≥2.5-fold increase in GM IELT 
over the treatment assessment period compared with 
baseline, ie , [proportion of subjects with 
GM(IELT treatment  period)/GM(IELT baseline) ≥2.5]. 
3. Proportion of patients rating their PE as improved per the 
CGIC question naire. 
4. Proportion of patients achieving mean change in category of 
≥1 or ≥2 on control of timing of ejaculation (PEP) , ie, 
improving control from “very poor ” or “poor” to “fair,” 
“good,” or “very good ” at end of treatment.  
5. Proportion of patients achieving mean change in category of 
≥1 or ≥2 in ejaculation -related personal distress (PEP) , ie, 
improving rating of ejaculation -related distress to 
“moderate,” “a bit,” or “not at all” at end of treatment.  
6. Proportions of patients achieving change in category of ≥2 
on control of timing of ejaculation (PEP) and achieving 
change in category of ≥1 in ejaculation -related personal 
distress (PEP) at end of treatment .

ejaculation (e -diary) over the treatment assessment period.  
8. Mean change from baseline in score on ejaculation -related 
personal distress (e -diary) over the treatment assessment 
period. 
Analyses of e -diary data expressed in change from baseline  over 
the treatment assessment period will be carried out using a 
mixed linear model. All analyses should include treatment, 
baseline IELT , and the baseline score of the analyzed endpoint as 
fixed effects and the site as a random effect.  
For each analysis on proportion endpoints, difference in the 
proportions between each test group and placebo group will be 
tested using a logistic model. All analyses should include 
treatment, baseline IELT and the site as factors. P values and 
adjusted od ds ratios will be presented.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
1.1 Disease Under Treatment  
Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common male sexual dysfunction , but the etiology is not well 
understood. Although historically considered to be predominantly a condition of 
psychological origin, over the last decade , it has been increasingly recognized that men with 
PE starting and continuing from their earliest sexual experiences may have a genetic 
predisposition to ejaculate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_736856] m ay have a 
variety of psychosocial and physical factors that bring on the condition.1 Thus, PE is 
subclassified as “lifelong” or “acquired”.[ADDRESS_1006694] sexual experience and persistence of rapid ejaculation (before or 
within 1 to 2 minutes after vaginal penetration) throughout life. Acquired PE is characteri zed 
by a gradual or sudden onset following normal ejaculation experiences before onset of the 
condition , when time to ejaculation becomes short (but often not as short as in  lifelong PE).  
Until recently , there has been no universally accepted definition of PE. Generally, definitions 
of PE acknowledge certain core components: short ejaculatory latency , lack of control over 
ejaculation , and ejaculation -related personal bother o r distress. The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5), published in 2013, defines the condition 
as persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity 
within approximately one minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual 
wishes it, and is associated with clinically significant distress in the individual. The 
International Consultation on Sexual Dysfunctions suggests that men with an intravaginal 
ejaculatory latenc y time (IELT) less than [ADDRESS_1006695] few 
years, there has been a new evidence -based definition that has gained widespread acceptance. 
It is the definition adopted by [CONTACT_736871] (ISSM), and 
defines PE as a male sexual dysfunction characteri zed by [CONTACT_736872] (lifelong PE) OR a 
clinically significant reduction in latency time, often to about 3 minutes or less (acquired PE), 
and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative 
personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration , and/or the avoidance of sexual 
intimacy.4 The definition applies to both lifelong and acquired PE but is limited to 
intravaginal sexual activity.  The ISSM definition is similar to the DSM -5. 
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01 
Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006696] on quality of life, and men with 
PE are mo re likely to report low satisfaction with their sexual relationship, low satisfaction 
with sexual intercourse, difficulty relaxing during intercourse, and less frequent intercourse 
than men without PE.5,6 PE also diminishes self -confidence and damages the relationship 
with the partner and may cause mental distress, anxiety, embarrassment , and depression.7 
Rosen and Althof confirmed a high level of psychological distress associated with PE that 
can be as impactful as erectile dysfunction on the couple.8 They also found that women were 
impacted as much and possibly more than their partners by [CONTACT_736873].  Another study9 confirmed that the partner ’s satisfaction with the 
sexual relationship decreased with increasing severity of the man ’s condition , and a more 
recent study reported that the detrimental effects of PE often resulted in the termination of the 
relationship .10 
At present, the only approved prescription oral  medication specifically for the management 
of PE is dapoxetine (Priligy®), which has approval in over 60 countries in Europe, Asia , and 
Latin America.11 Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) taken on 
demand. When SSRIs are used for the management of depression, they have been associated 
with the side effect of anorgasmia and hence have been prescribed off -label (often as 
continuous daily dosing regimens but sometimes on demand) for the treatment of PE. 
Patients are often reluctant to begin off -label treatment of PE with SSRIs for reasons of not 
wanting to take an antidepressant, treatment effects below expectations, and cost. Recently, 
the European Medicines Agency approved a topi[INVESTIGATOR_177494] -only treatment (PSD502®), 
a local anesthetic containing lidocaine and prilocaine.12 
In view of the paucity of available treatment options for men with PE, new oral treatments 
with different modes of action and different benefit/risk profiles are needed.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  1.3.2 Safety Pharmacology  
The biochemical activity of IX -01 was screened in different assays for enzymes, receptors, 
and transporters. Activities w ere observed in 3  of 60 for the receptors, channels, and 
transporters tested. There was no activity detected in enzyme assays.  
In isolated dog Purkinje fibe rs, dose-dependent reductions in action potential duration at 50% 
and 90% repolari zation occurred at  IX-01 concentrations of 10 and 30 µM. IX -01 also 
reduced peak hERG potassium current amplitude at high concentration. It was devoid of any 
biologically  relevant hemodynamic or electrocardiogram ( ECG) effects in conscious dogs up 
to the dose of 20 mg/kg (t otal Cmax of 9007 nM).  
IX-[ADDRESS_1006702] respi[INVESTIGATOR_736857] 150 mg/kg. The only 
effects were a small reduction in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1521] a nonstatistically significant decrease in 
minute volume at 450 mg/kg.  
IX-01 had no adv erse effects on neurofunctional assessment in male rat s. 
IX-01 at dose levels up to 20 mg/kg (C max 9007.5 nM, 3780 ng/mL) does not adversely affect 
cardiovascular function in conscious male dog s. 
1.3.3 Toxicology  
Administration of IX -01 to male rats and male dogs were performed per Good Laboratory 
Practice. 
In the toxicology program, IX -01 was orally administered to male rats and dogs for up to 
90 days. Adaptive changes related to liver enzyme induction were noted in the liver as well 
as in the thyroid and pit uitary. Deaths observed at doses ≥750 mg/kg in the 1 -month studies 
and exploratory rat studies were likely due to hypothermia. In addition to low core body 
temperature, these deaths were preceded by [CONTACT_736874], 
decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and neurological signs in the animals. At 200 mg/kg  of IX-01, 
dogs exhibited potential neurological signs consisting of titubation, prostration, whining, 
partially closed eyes, tremors, and occasional diarrhea. The no observed adverse e ffect levels 
(NOAELs ) with repeated administration were 450 mg/kg in rats and 120 mg/kg in dogs. The 
corresponding C max and AUC values in rats were 10  100 ng/mL (525 ng/mL free) and 
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01

(5660 ng/mL free) and 778  000 ng × h/mL (83  246 ng × h/mL free) , respectively. The 
NOAEL is based on adverse clinical effects apparently associated with the CNS observed at 
higher doses.   
IX-[ADDRESS_1006703] Metabolism in Animals  
Pharmacokinetic studies were done in rats and dogs, and in vitro. It was found that 87.4% to 
94.8% of IX -01 was bound to rat, dog, and human and dog plasma proteins in vitro. IX -01 
penetrated the CNS. Clearance predominantly occurred through  cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 
3A4 metabolism, with minor contributions from CYP2C19, CYP2D6 , and glucuronidation. 
The overall potency of IX -01 as an inhibitor of CYP metabolism is weak; however, CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers may alter the pharmacokinetics of IX -01. 
1.3.[ADDRESS_1006704] received one or more doses of IX -01. Clinical safety and 
pharmacokinetic data are available from four completed Phase 1 studies (A8651001, 
IX-0101, IX -0102, and IX-0104). Also, preliminary clinical safety and kinetic data are 
available from recently completed study IX -0106. A Phase 2a proof-of-concept study (IX -
0103) has also been completed and demonstrated the efficacy of IX -01 (doses 400 to 800 mg 
as needed ) to prolong IELT, improve ejaculation -related control , and reduce 
ejaculation -related distress in men with lifelong PE.  
Single-Ascending Dose Study  
The first-in-human study (A8651001) recruited 30 healthy male volunteers in  3 sequential 
cohorts and evaluated 11 different dose  levels of IX-01 ranging from 0.3 mg to 2400 mg. The 
overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar across all treatment groups , including 
placebo. The most common treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) were 
nasopharyngitis, headache, insomnia , and nightmares. The most frequent treatment -related 
AE was headache. All of the AEs were considered mild to moderate in severity. Three 
subjects who had received IX -[ADDRESS_1006705] who had received placebo reported events

Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006706] who reported 3  epi[INVESTIGATOR_736858] 2 different doses of IX -01 (one epi[INVESTIGATOR_736859] 400 mg and 2  epi[INVESTIGATOR_736860] 800 mg). All events of nightmare 
were mild in intensity.  
There was no evidence of a drug - or dose-related effect on laboratory test results , and there 
were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or ECGs. One subject in Cohort 2 
discontinued from the study due to mild, asymptomatic , non-sustained ventricular 
tachycardia (IX -01, 400 mg) that appeared approximately [ADDRESS_1006707] of IX -01 on core body temperature at any dose studied. The mean 
maximum exposure reached (1.9 μg/mL total, 452 nM total) was similar to that which 
resulted in mild hypothermia in rats (1 -10 μg/mL; 238-2380 nM total).  
Peak plasma concentrations (T max) of IX-01 occurred approximately 1 to 2 hours after oral 
dosing. Overall, exposure (AUC) increased subproportionally  with dose. The terminal 
half-life was approximately 12 hours. Under fed conditions (800 mg), both peak 
concentration and overall exposure were increased (1.8 -fold and 1.3 -fold, respectively). 
Urinary excretion of intact drug was negligible , with < 0.05% of the dose excreted over 24 
hours after dosing.  
Multiple-Ascending Dose Study (1)  
The multiple -ascending dose study (IX -0101) recruited 48 volunteers in 4 cohorts of 
12 subjects each. Within each cohort , subjects were randomi zed (1:3) to receive placebo or 
IX-01 in the fasted state once daily for 10 consecutive days. The final cohort received the 
maximum dose (1200 mg daily) permitted by [CONTACT_760]. The protocol required monitoring 
of vital signs and the recording of 12 -lead ECGs at frequent intervals postdose on Days 1 and 
10 and predose on Days 1, 5, 8 , and 10. Continuous Holter ECG monitoring was performed 
on all subjects from 2 hours predose to 8 hours postdose on Days 1 and 10. In addition, aural 
temperature was recorded at frequent intervals postdose on Days 1 and 10, and pre dose and 
12 hours postdose on Days 2 to 9.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  All 48 subjects completed the study, and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no 
severe AEs. There was no evidence of any treatment -related change s in aural temperature at 
any of the doses administered. The mean maximum plasma concentration of IX -01 reached 
in this study (2.2 μg/mL total at C max on Day 10 in the 1200 mg dose group) was higher than 
the mean maximum exposure achieved with a single [ADDRESS_1006708] per treatment group apart 
from headache (2 of 9 subjects receiving 1200  mg IX-01). Two subjects (one receiving  
placebo and one  receiving 800 mg  IX-01) reported intermittent vivid dreams (coded as 
abnormal dreams) throughout most of the dosing phase of the study. There were no reports of 
nightmares.  
There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, or ECG monitoring 
by [CONTACT_63199] r eported by [CONTACT_736875].  
The Day 10 pharmacokinetic profiles were similar to those observed on Day 1. IX-01 was 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], reaching C max at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax) postdose (range 
0.5-4 hours) across the dose range. Post -Cmax, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic 
manner. The terminal half -life (t1/2) was similar across all dose groups , with mean estimates 
of 11.6 to 12.3  hours. The geometric mean (GM) steady-state C max values increa sed 
subproportionally compared with dose, with a 6.2 -fold increase over a 12 -fold dose range.  
Accumulation ratios (C max and AUC 0-24h values on Day 10/Day 1) were 1.24 and 1.34 , 
respectively , for the 1200  mg dose. 
Semen samples were collected from all subjects at 2 to 4 h ours postdose on Day 9, and the 
concentrations of drug were subsequently measured.  The mean amou nt of IX-01 in the 
ejaculate (2  μg or less) constituted <0.0003% of the administered dose , and as such , the 
intravaginal dose to the partner of a subject taking IX -01 is negligible.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  Multiple-Ascending Dose Study (2)  
A maximally tolerated dose was not identified in Study IX -0101, and therefore , a second 
multiple-ascending doses study (IX -0104) was performed . This study recruited 24 volunteers 
in 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each. Within each cohort , subjects were randomi zed (1:2) to 
receive placebo or IX -01 in the fasted state once daily for 10 consecutive days. The final 
cohort received the maximum dose (2400 mg  daily) permitted by [CONTACT_760]. The protocol 
required monitoring of vital signs and the recording of [ADDRESS_1006709] being note d. There were no clinically 
significant changes in vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, or ECG monitoring by t elemetry reported 
by [CONTACT_736875].   
IX-01 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], reaching C max at approximately 2 hours (T max) postdose. The 
GM Cmax values on Day 1 were 1883 and 2622 ng/mL for the 1600 mg and 2400 mg 
treatment groups , respectively. The GM AUCtau values on Day 1 were 14  953 and 
25 926 h × ng/mL for the 1600 mg and 2400 mg treatment groups , respectively.  
The Day 10 pharmacokinetic  profiles were similar to those observed on Day 1. IX -01 was 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_736861], reaching C max at approximately 2 hours (T max) postdose (range 1.5 to

for the 1600 mg and 2400 mg treatment groups , respectively. The GM AUCtau values on 
Day 10 were 28 623 and 27  862 h × ng/mL for the 1600 mg and 2400  mg treatment groups , 
respectively.  
The terminal half -life (t 1/2) was similar in both dose groups , with mean estimates of 11.6 to 
11.7 hours. This study confirmed subproportional increases in the absorption of IX -01 when 
administered as a dispersion in the fasted state.  
Relative Bioavailability Study  (200mg capsules)  
In Study IX -0102, 12 subjects were randomized to receive IX -01 800 mg dispersion in the 
fasted state, IX -01 800 mg (4 × 200 mg capsules) in the fasted state , and IX-01 800 mg 
(4 × 200 mg capsules) administered after a high -fat meal. 
The bioavailability of the capsule formulation was similar to that of the dispersion 
formulation when both are administered in the fasted state.  Administration of a high -fat meal 
immediately prior to the capsules increase d the bioavailability of IX -01. 
In this study , the subject s also underwent lumbar puncture 1  to 6 hours after receiving the 
dispersion formulation. The results confirmed that IX -01 is present in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]; 
CNS penetration of IX -01 is important for the potential to treat PE. 
Relative Bioavailability Study  (400mg caplets)  
In Study IX-0106, 12 subjects were randomized to receive IX -01 1600 mg dispersion in the 
fasted state, IX -01 1600 mg (4 × 400 mg caplets) in the fasted state, and IX -01 1600 mg 
(4 × 400 mg caplets ) administered after a high -fat meal. 
The preliminary results indicate that the GM C max values were 2 152 ng/ml for the  caplet 
formulation administered in the fasted state, and that the caplet has an improved 
bioavailability compared to the dispersion, with GM Cmax and AUC 1.8 fold those of the 
dispersion. In addition , food increased the bioavailability (AUC) of the caplet (1. 5 fold), 
which is comparable to the effect of food seen with the capsule and dispersion formulations 
previously. However, unlike the capsule and dispersion formulations, the rate of absorption 
was not significantly delayed for the caplet formulation with Cmax increasing 2.7 fold in the

this study.  
Proof-of-Concept Study  
IX-0103 was an 8 -week, double -blind, placebo-controlled , Phase 2a clinical study that 
recruited 88 men with lifelong PE at 10 study cent ers in the U nited States  and Australia.  
Eligible patients (men fulfilling the ISSM definition of lifelong PE with ≥75% of 
intercourses lasting ≤60 seconds during a 4 -week run -in period without treatment) were 
randomized (2:1  ratio) to an 8 -week treatment period with IX -01, 400  mg (2 capsules), or 
equivalent double -blind placebo, with the medication being taken as required,  1 to 6 hours 
prior to sexual activity. If treatment was poorly tolerated , the dose could be reduced to 200 
mg or equivalent placebo. From Week 2 onwards , the investigator could increase the dose to 
800 mg or equiv alent placebo (4 capsules) if toleration was acceptable and optimal efficacy 
had not been obtained.  
During the treatment period, patients were required to return to the study site at Weeks 2, 4, 
and 8 and use their electronic diary (LogPad) to complete th e Premature Ejaculation Profile 
(PEP) and other patient -reported outcomes. A follow -up visit was to be performed 2  weeks 
after the end of treatment.  
The mean age of men in this study was 43 years , and the baseline GM IELT was <30  seconds 
in both treatment groups. Patients randomi zed to IX-01 took a mean of 14.6  (range 1-59) 
doses during the study. Patients randomi zed to placebo took a mean of 13.0 (range 1 -51) 
doses. Fifty (89.3%) and 23 (76.7%) patients (IX-01 and placebo , respectively) took the 
permitted maximum dose of [ADDRESS_1006710] once during the study.  
Mean IELT values increased 3.6 -fold from baseline for IX-01, compared with 1.8-fold for 
placebo. Mean IELT value s increased by [CONTACT_46431] 1 minute (61.0 seco nds) for IX -01 compared 
with 16.4 seconds for placebo . The results also showed clinically and statistically significant 
improvements in perceived control of ejaculation and ejaculation -related personal distress at 
end of treatment for IX-01 compared with placebo. Twenty -one (44%) patients randomi zed 
to IX-01 rated their PE as improved at  the end of treatment compared with 3 (13%) of 
patients randomi zed to placebo.  There were also clinically and statistically significant

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  improvements for some of the results of the 4-week recall PEP, with 17 (33%) patients 
randomized to IX-01 improving their control of ejaculation to “fair,” “good,” or “very good ” 
compared with one (3%) patient randomi zed to placebo. There was also a clinically and 
statistically significant difference in favor of IX -01 for the proportion of patients whose level 
of ejaculation -related distress improved to “moderate,” “a bit,” or “not at all,” 24 (46%) for 
patients randomized to IX-01 versus 4 (16%) for patients randomized  to for placebo.  
There were no serious and no severe AEs reported during this study.  The proportions of 
patients reporting AEs were similar for IX -01 and placebo , with no AE reported by [CONTACT_726] 
2 patients in any treatment group.  Two patients were discontinued from IX -01 for possibly 
treatment -related AEs : one for AE of increased transaminases that normali zed during 
treatment and one for AE of nausea. There were n o safety signals arising from review of vital 
signs, laboratory function test results, 12 -lead ECGs, and other safety assessments.  
This study has demonstrated the ability of IX -01 (taken as required prior to sexual activity) to 
improve all the 3 key featur es (short ejaculation time, lack of control, and ejaculation -related 
distress) of the condition in men with most severe form of lifelong PE.  IX-[ADDRESS_1006711] been

1.4.1 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The results of study IX -0103 indicated that single doses of IX -01 (400 to 800 mg  
administered as capsules ), taken 1 to 6  hours prior to intercourse in the fasted state, prolong 
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01 
Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006713]  hoc analysis indicate d that 
400 mg is less effective than the 800  mg dose. However , even at 800 mg , less than half of the 
patients reported benefit, and therefore , the objecti ve of this study is to explore the efficacy 
and safety of 1 200 mg (3 x 400 mg caplets)  and to compare the response at this dose with 
placebo, [ADDRESS_1006714] one hour before or after food , 
and 1 to 6 hours prior to sexual activity. A 400 mg caplet formulation has been developed to 
improve bioavailability and to allow a reduced number of caplets to be taken per dose of IX -
01. 
1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits  
The nonclinical toxicology, pharmacology , and pharmacokinetic data generated to d ate and 
the clinical safety, pharmacokinetic , and pharmacodynamic data generated in studies 
A8651001  and IX-0101 to IX -0104 support an acceptable risk -benefit profile to evaluate the 
efficacy and toleration of single doses of orally administered IX -01 (taken as required but not 
more than once per day) in adult males, aged 18  to 60 years, inclusive, with PE. The 
maximum dose to be administered in this study is 1 200 mg (3 x 400 mg caplets) taken prior 
to sexual activity but not more than once per day. Doses u p to and including [ADDRESS_1006715] been discontinued from IX -01 because of skin AEs: a subject who had a 
pruritic skin rash after [ADDRESS_1006716] 
received 1600mg administered as 4 x 400 caplets in fasted state and 11 subjects also received 
4 x 400 mg caplets after a high fat meal.  No treatment -related adverse events were observed. 
As in the prev ious Phase 2 study, the safety of the patients will be assessed at frequent 
intervals by [CONTACT_736877]. Although preclinical and 
clinical data generated to date with IX -01 provide no evidence of adverse effects on mood, 
this protocol includes questionnaires and interviews to screen for depression and suicidality, 
which is in accordance with other clinical studies of new treatments for PE.

at Visit 1.  
At the end of the run-in period, patients will undergo their baseline measurements  and 
examinations detailed in the Schedule of Events (Table 13-1), which includes a PEP, 
International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF), Patient Health Questionnaire  9 (PHQ-9), and 
mandatory Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assessment.  The patient ’s 
LogPad is used for completing the questionnaires and providing results to the Investigator 
regarding the eligibility of the patient, based on IELT and patient-reported outcome criteria. 
The C-SSRS is a face-to-face interview that must be administered by [CONTACT_471144]/her designate.  If the patient does not meet eligibility to remain in the study, the 
Investigator must not randomize the patient and may suggest alternate treatment.  
Eligible patients will undergo one 8 -week treatment period, during which time they are 
randomized to take IX -01, 400, 800, or 1200 mg or matching placebo.  In order to maintain 
the double -blind, each dose will be presented a s 3 caplets in blisters in single -dose units. 
Thus, for example, a patient randomized to 400  mg IX-01 will receive blister car ds with each 
dose comprising one IX -01 400 mg caplet and t wo matching placebo caplets. Patients will 
complete an e -diary (LogPad) on all days during the treatment period that sexual activity is 
performed with or without the use of the study drug.  
During the treatment period, patients will be expected to return to the study site and use their 
LogPad to complete the following questionn aires according to the study schedule:

Protocol: IX-0105 Final Protocol Amendment 1.0 16 January 2017  
 Page 50 
 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  IELT  
The IELT is the time from the start of intercourse (penetration) until ejaculation and is 
recorded by [CONTACT_736883]. At the start of the run -in 
phase, the patient and partner should decide who will  activate the stopwatch  and 
subsequently  stop the stopwatch to record the timing of intercourse.  The same person should 
start and stop the stopwatch with every intercourse attempt throughout the study  until Visit 5.  
LogPad 
The LogPad has been specifically designed to enable patients to record details of sexual 
intercourse attempts and study drug use throughout the study. The key data to be recorded by 
[CONTACT_736884], date and time of any inte rcourse 
attempt, IELT, level of control of timing of ejaculation ; and level of ejaculation -related 
personal distress. The patient also will use the LogPad at each study visit to complete the 
PEP, PGIS, IIEF, and PHQ -9 (PEP, PGIS and IIEF are not completed at Visit 3/Week 2) . At 
the final treatment  visit (Visit 5 or Early Termination) , the CGIC is also collected via the 
LogPad. For further details of the LogPad design and function , refer to the Study Training 
Manual. 
PEP 
The PEP i s a widely used self -administered tool that includes measures of perceived control 
over ejaculation, ejaculation -related personal distress, ejaculation -related interpersonal 
difficulty, and satisfaction with intercourse. It has been used in many previous s tudies of PE 
and is considered validated for this purpose. All of the domains are relevant to a patient with 
PE, and the instrument has the advantage of being simple and quick to use.14.  In this study an 
additional exploratory question on bother will be included in the 4 -week recall version used 
at baseline, week 4 and week 8.  
 
PGIS 
The Patient Global Impression of Severity is a questionnaire that asks the patient to assess 
the severity of their condition (categories of response are no PE, mild, moderate, severe).  
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01 
Protocol: IX-0105 Final Protocol Amendment 1.0 16 January 2017  
 Page 51 
 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  CGIC 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) (also referred to as PGIC) is a simple and 
validated instrument that allows the patient to rate the change in his condition (PE) at the end 
of treatment on a 7 -point scale ranging from “much worse ” to “much better .”[ADDRESS_1006739] 5 minutes and will include diastolic and systolic blood pressure and heart rate. 
Vital signs may be repeated if clinically significant values are measured. Out -of-range blood 
pressure or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the Investigator ’s discretion  
especially if the investigator believes that the initial measurements are due to insufficient 
relaxation or error . Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements must be 
recorded as AEs.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A single [ADDRESS_1006740] be documented. If a clinically 
significant abnormal finding occurs after the patient initiates use of the study drug, then it 
will be recorded as an AE in the eCRF.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  IIEF 
The IIEF is a validat ed 15-item questionnaire that was designed to evaluate sexual function 
in men with possible erectile dysfunction. The main purpose of including this instrument in 
this study is to exclude men with coexisting erectile dysfunction at baseline and to check 
whether erectile dysfunction occurs during the study.16 As this instrument was designed for 
use in men with possible erectile dysfunction , the investigator should clarify the meaning of 
Questions 4, 5 , and 15 before the patient completes the questionnaire. The patient should be 
told that he is being asked to a ssess whether he can maintain his erection until ejaculation 
occurs (Questions 4 and 5) and about his confidence to get and keep an erection until 
ejaculation occurs ( Question 15).  
Psychological Assessments  
The following questionnaire will be self -completed by [CONTACT_736885] 
(e-diary). 
• Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) 
The PHQ -9 is a reliable and valid screening tool for depression severity. The module scores 
each of the 9 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth editi on 
(DSM-IV) criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day).  A PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a 
sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ -9 scores of 5, 10, 15, 
and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depres sion, respectively.17 
The questionnaire will be completed at each study visit during the treatment period.  
The Investigator will administer the fol lowing instrument at baseline and at other times  
thereafter  throughout the study as required by [CONTACT_760].  
• C-SSRS 
The C-SSRS is a structured clinical interview used to assess an individual ’s behavior to 
exhibit thoughts or intent to commit suicide.[ADDRESS_1006741] be trained in its use.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  6.3.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the c linical study is 
to establish drug effect. After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, site personnel will 
record any change in the condition(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  
An SAE or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that: 
• results in death;

An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above. (Examples o f such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions 
occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Serious adverse event collection begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition 
has worsened during the  course of the study.  
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for AEs once the study has ended 
(after follow -up visit), unless stipulated otherwise in the protocol. However, if an investigator 
becomes aware of any SAEs occurring after the patient ’s participation in the study has ended , 
the investigator should report the SAEs to Ixchelsis or designated representat ive regardless of 
the investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. In order to adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations for reporting an SAE, the study site must notify Ixchelsis or designated 
representative within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aw are of the SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a n SAE 
requiring immedia te notification to Ixchelsis or designated representative. For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325542]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Events  
All observed AEs and their suspected causal relationship to  the study product will be 
reported. A dverse event s and SAEs should be reported using concise medical terminology as 
appropriate in the eCRF.  
For all AEs, the Investigator must obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of the AE and to asse ss whether it meets criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Ixchelsis or designated representative.  
Ixchelsis Ltd  IX-01 
Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006743] report all SAEs to Ixchelsis or designated

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity  
Severity describes the intensity of a specific event:  
• Mild – Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the patien t or does not make the patient 
uncomfortable. The AE does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription 
drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s).  
• Moderate – Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity/intensity to make the patient 
uncomfor table. Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) 
may be needed.  
• Severe – Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the patient severe discomfort. 
Severity may cause cessation of treatment with the investigational product. Treatment for 
symptom(s) may be given.  
• Life-threatening – Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity/intensity to cause the patient to be 
at immediate risk of death. Treatment for symptom(s) may be given.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality  
For all AEs, sufficient i nformation should be obtained by [CONTACT_118555] (serious and nonserious). An Investigator ’s causality assessment is the

Protocol: IX-[ADDRESS_1006744] caused 
or contributed to an AE. If the Investigator ’s final determination of causality is unknown 
because the Investigator does not know whether or not the study product caused the AE, then 
the AE will be handled as “related to investigational product ” for reporting purposes and 
reporting expedited according to local regulations. If the Investigator ’s final determination of 
causality is “unknown but not related to investigational product ,” this information should be 
clearly documented in the study records. 
In addition , if the Investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the Investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and eCRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

7.3 Sample Size Calculations  
The target total is for 220 patients to be randomized in the study.  
The randomization ratio will be 2:2:3:3 ( placebo, IX -01 400 mg, IX -01 800 mg, and IX -01 
1200 mg dose groups, respectively).  
Thus, 44 patients each will be randomized to placebo and IX -01 400 mg dose groups, and 
66 patients each will be randomized to IX -01 800 mg and IX -01 1200 mg dose groups. The 
2:3 ratio results in only slight loss of statistical power from 1:1 randomization, while 
increasing the chances that a patient will be randomized to an effective dose of study drug.  
Assuming an alpha (2 -sided) of 0.05 and a n SD of 70 seconds, a sample size of 220 patients 
randomized in total (44 to the placebo and IX -01 400 mg  dose groups  and 66 to the IX-01 
800 mg and IX -01 1200 mg dose groups) provides approximately 85%, 90% , and 90% power 
to detect a mean differ ence of 45 seconds between change from baseline in GM of IELT for 
the IX-01 400 mg, IX-01 800 mg, and IX-01 1200 mg dose group s, respectively , compared 
with the placebo group.

[CONTACT_736870]-01 800 mg dose versus placebo and then IX -01 400 mg dose versus placebo will be done 
in order to control for multiplicity. See details below.  
Additional patients may be recruited if some patients discontinue from the study with less  
than 2 postbaseline IELT assessments.  
7.4 Analysis Sets  
The following  4 populations, defined as below,  will be used in the analyses : 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Set : The ITT Set is defined as all randomized patients who have taken 
at least 1 dose of study medicatio n. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment arm 
to which they were randomized . 
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Set : The mITT Set is defined as all randomized patients 
who have taken at least [ADDRESS_1006748] 2 postba seline 
analyzable IELT assessments. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment arm to 
which they were randomized . 
Safety Set : The Safety Set consists of all randomized patients who have taken at least 1 dose 
of study medication. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment arm for the study 
drug that  they actually received.  
Per-Protocol Set: The Per-Protocol Set is defined as all patients from the mITT without any 
major protocol deviation  that could affect the evaluability of the primary efficacy parameter . 
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized.  
The allocation of patients to analysis sets will be done in a blinded way prior to database 
lock.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  If at any point in the sequence statistical significance is not met, then subsequent analyses in 
the sequence cannot be deemed statistically significant. In such cases, nominal P values and 
95% CI will be reported and interpreted in an exploratory manner.  Irrespective of whether 
there are any statistically significant differences between treatment groups, IELT data from 
all treatment groups will also be used to model a possible dose response relationship. F urther 
details on dose response analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
The analyses above will be repeated using the P er-Protocol and ITT population s to examine 
the robustness of the primary results.  
As a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, a nonp arametric approach will be carried 
out on the mITT population in order to obtain the median treatment effect and 95% CI. 
7.6.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
All secondary analyses will be carried out testing each dose group versus the placebo group  
on for the ITT population . 
The same approach to control for multiple comparisons as proposed for the primary endpoint 
will be used for each secondary endpoint analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Change From Baseline Endpoints 
Analyses of e-diary data expressed in change from baseline over the treatment assessment 
period will be carried out using a mixed linear model. All analyses should include treatment, 
baseline IELT , and the baseline score of the analyzed endpoint as fixed effects and the site as 
a random effect. In addition to the mixed linear model, a nonparametric approach may be 
carried out for specific secondary endpoints. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
Change in score from baseline in each of the PEP questions (ie , Endpoint 17 of Section  7.2.2) 
will be carried out using a mixed-effect model repeated measure model. All analyses should 
include treatme nt, baseline IELT, the baseline score of the analyzed endpoint, the visit , and 
the interaction between visit and treatment as fixed effects and the site as a random effect. 
Visit will be considered as the repeated measurement.

1. Only patients taking chronic SSRIs will have an additional 4 -week washout prior to the 4 -week run-in period. They will attend a Prescreening 
Visit and will return to t he site for a complete screening (Visit 1) once their washout period is complete.  Informed consent and medical history 
will be obtained at the Pre screening Visit for patient s who are receiving chronic SSRIs. 
2. Refer to the Study Training Manual for instructi ons if a patient does not remember to return the LogPad . 
3. The patient will return the LogPad to the investigator. The LogPad  will provide a summary of the IELT data collected during the run -in period, 
and will indicate whether the patient is eligible to continue in the study based on the IELT criteria  
4. Coagulation (p rothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) will be tested at baseline  (Visit 2). Only prothrombin time will be taken 
at other time  points if certain laboratory test criteria defined in Section 4.[ADDRESS_1006766] 4 -week recall periods , and so these questionnaires are completed by [CONTACT_736902].  
7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  is only mandatory at baseline but may be administered at other visits if clinically indicated.

 IXCHELSIS CONFIDENTIAL  SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate event; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past ____  
Years 
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result 
of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have 
to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it  can be 
considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , 
just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but 
gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred 
clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is 
clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., guns hot to 
head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to 
die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
 What did you do?  
 Did you ____as a way to end your life?

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -
injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person ha s pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this 
becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward 
self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling tri gger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to 
jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has 
not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Relative Bioavailability Study (400mg caplets)  
In Study IX -0106, 12 subjects were randomized to receive IX -01 1600 mg dispersion in 
the fasted  state, IX-01 1600 mg (4 × 400  mg caplets) in the fasted state, and IX -01 1600 
mg (4 × 400 mg caplets) administered after a high -fat meal. 
The preliminary results indicate that the GM C max values were 2 152 ng/ml for the caplet 
formulation administered in the fasted state, and that the caplet has an improved 
bioavailability compared to the dispersion, with GM Cmax and AUC 1. 8 fold those of 
the dispersion. In addition, food increased the bioavailability (AUC) of the caplet (1.5 
fold), which is comparable to the effect of food seen with the capsule and dispersion 
formulations previously. However, unlike the capsule and dispersion formulations, the 
rate of absorption was not significantly delayed for the caplet formulation wit h Cmax 
increasing 2.7 fold in the presence of food. There were no treatment -related adverse 
events or safety issues reported in this study.

PEP, IIEF, and PHQ -9 (PEP, and IIEF are not completed at Visit 3/Week 2). At the final 
treatment  visit (Visit 5 or Early Termination) , the CGIC is also collected via the LogPad. For 
further detai ls of the LogPad design and function, refer to the Study Training Manual.  
PEP 
The PEP is a widely used self -administered tool that includes measures of perceived control 
over ejaculation, ejaculation -related personal distress, ejaculation -related interpers onal 
difficulty, and satisfaction with intercourse. It has been used in many previous studies of PE 
and is considered validated for this purpose. All of the domains are relevant to a patient with 
PE, and the instrument has the advantage of being simple and quick to use.14.   
CGIC 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) is a simple and validated instrument that 
allows the patient to r ate the change in his condition (PE) at the end of treatment on a 7 -point 
scale ranging from “much worse ” to “much better. ”[ADDRESS_1006797] details of sexual

PEP 
The PEP is a widely used self -administered tool that includes measures of perceived control 
over ejaculation, ejaculation -related personal distress, ejaculation -related interpersonal 
difficulty, and satisfaction with intercourse. It has been used in many previous studies of PE 
and is considered validated for this purpose. All of the domains are relevant to a patient with 
PE, and the instrument has the advantage of being simple and quick to use.14.  In this study 
an additional exploratory question on bother will be included in the 4 -week recall 
version used at baseline, week 4 and week 8.  
PGIS 
The Patient Global Impression of S everity is a questionnaire that asks the patient to 
assess the severity of their condition (categories of response are no PE, mild, moderate, 
severe). 
CGIC 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) (also referred to as PGIC)  is a simple 
and validated instrument that allows the patient to rate the change in his condition (PE) at the 
end of treatment on a 7 -point scale ranging from “much worse ” to “much better. ”15  In this 
study the CGIC will be administered after the PEP at the final visit and will include two 
additional questions.  See Appendix 2.

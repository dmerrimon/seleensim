Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of long -term disability in the US, and 
every  minute  of delay  from  onset  to treatment  reduces  the likelihood  of good  clinical  outcome.  As 
a result  of our ongoing  Comprehensive  Stroke  Center  (CSC)  quality  improvement  efforts,  we have 
identified a key delay: time from the completion of computed tomography (CT) angiography of 
the head and neck to interpretation in the setting of AIS care. Motivated by [CONTACT_328418],  and in partnership  with the UTHealth  School  of Biomedical  Informatics,  we recently 
developed a machine -learning algorithm to automate the interpretation of CT angiography (CTA) 
for the presence or absence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and other stroke relevant  information 
such as estimated stroke core size. We propose a prospective, cluster - randomized study to 
determine  whether  incorporating  our automated  machine  learning  (ML)  algorithms  to AIS care pathways 
reduces the time from patient ER arrival to imaging interpretation by [CONTACT_328419]. Physicians will ultimately decide if patients are 
eligible for thrombectomy, and all patients wil l receive the standard of care following current 
guidelines. This strategy is expected to help improve patient stratification procedures for 
endovascular thrombectomy by [CONTACT_328420]. Our unique research team 
consisting  of machine -learning  and AIS imaging  experts  will take advantage  of the rich and diverse 
talents across the UTHealth Campuses and Memorial Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328414].

Acute  Ischemic  Stroke  (AIS)  is the leading  cause  of long-term disability  in the US adult  population 
with nearly 800,000 new patients affected by [CONTACT_328421], and with Large Vessel Occlusion 
(LVO), a subtype of AIS that could require endovascular stroke therapy (EST), disproportionately 
contributing to stroke -related dependence and death.1,[ADDRESS_405435] were nearly 2.5 fold more likely to achieve good 
neurological outcomes (number needed to treat = 3), a treatment effect size rivaling that of antibiotics to 
treat acute bac terial infections.8,[ADDRESS_405436] moved on to c are for another  patient.  
Through our continuous process of quality improvement, we recently conducted an analysis of 
delays  in AIS treatment.  Among  833 patients  with AIS, median  time from  ER arrival  to CTA  interpretation 
for presence or absence of LVO was 65 minutes [IQR 41 - 127]. In order to comply with our Joint 
Commission requirements for Comprehensive Stroke Center, the EST procedure must be initiated within 
[ADDRESS_405437], and can nearly instantaneously analyze images for LVO.12 We then 
validated this algorithm on a fully external dataset of 126 patients, and found that it can perform this task 
with very high discrimination (Figure  1). 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0630 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/09/2023  Page 4 of 9  Given  these  results,  we propose  a prospective,  cluster -randomized  study  to determine  whether  AIS 
care pathways incorporating image based ML algorithms reduces the time from patient ER arrival to 
imaging  interpretation  (Figure  2). Our unique  research  team  consisting  of machine -learning  and AIS imaging 
experts  will take advantage  of the rich and diverse talents  across  the UTHealth  Campuses  and the Memorial 
Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214]. Given our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that integration of these 
approaches into the AIS care pathway will reduce delays from CTA acquisition to interpretation, wit hout 
requiring any change in existing CT hardware or acquisition  protocols.  
Objectives  
 
The expected outcome is the creation of a state -of-the-art infrastructure for deploying artificial 
intelligence algorithms in the clinical practice and a thorough evaluation of a potential paradigm shifting 
approach for a measurable and sustainable quality  improvement of stroke care.  
Study Design  
 
To test the previously mentioned hypotheses, we propose a multi -center, stepped wedge cluster - 
randomized study that will include patients across 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328415]/UTHealth stroke 
system of care in the greater Houston area. The software will be randomly enabled at each of [ADDRESS_405438] (“door -to- 
groin” time). Secondary outcomes include the number of patients treated with EST and [ADDRESS_405439] angiography imaging studies for participating Hosp itals.  
A valid sample will be one that satisfy the following criteria:  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Male or Female, 18 years of age or  older.  
2. Patients who present to the emergency department with signs and/or symptoms concerning  for 
acute ischemic  stroke.  
3. Patients who undergo CT angiography  imaging  
4. Patients determined to have a large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. This determination will be made 
based on official radiology report for the CT angiography  imaging.

Study Procedures  
 
ML Algorithms Integration  
 
Custom ML software (Viz.AI) will be installed on a server and receive data from the centralized 
PACS system. This software has been purchased by [CONTACT_3433] e MH hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328416]. The 
system will then send alerts to the care team through notifications pushed through the Viz.AI app present 
on the physician, nurse and technologist’s mobile phone. Diagnosis and treatment decisions will be based 
on the clinical evaluation and review of the images by [CONTACT_1963], as per routine standard of 
care.  This study  will not interfere  with routine  clinical  work.  Data  capture  will be performed  after treatment 
decisions and care have been  delivered.  
 
Clinical Data Acquisition  
 
Clinical data will be collected at each of the participating sites as a part of our ongoing 
Comprehensive Stroke System quality improvement protocols. All other clinical and outcome data will be 
collected through electronic medical record review. Captured data will include patient demographics, past 
medical history, imaging utilization and imaging findings, time intervals (i.e. time from last known well  to 
presentation, time from door to imaging, time from door to IV tPA, time from door to groin puncture), 
procedural  outcomes  (i.e. TICI  scores,  hemorrhage  rates),  discharge  clinical  outcomes,  and in patients  who 
received  EST or IV tPA, 90-day disability  outcomes.  These  data are routinely  captured  per standard -of-care 
at our Comprehensive Stroke System and wil l be used for analysis as a part of this  study.  
Ethics  
 
Being an observational project, there will be no interventions, investigations, tests, drugs, and/or 
interviews administered to patients. We do not expect any research -related adverse events. All personal 
health  information  from  patients  will be kept confidential  and in compliance  with HIPAA  regulations.  This 
site is seeking waver of consent for this observational study involving electronic medical chart review and 
analysis of de -identified CTA  images.  
Risks and benefits for the human subjects  
 
Risks  
In this study, ML algorithms are not used for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention as it  
only sends alerts. All diagnosis and treatment decisions are still based on the clinical evaluations and 
radiology reports. As such, we do not foresee t hat this study poses more than minimal risk encountered 
during the routine stroke care.  
 
Benefits  
We do not foresee any immediate benefits for the human subjects involved. However, if successful,  
this study could enable a faster time -to-treatment for strok e patients.  
 
Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_328417]: 02/09/[ADDRESS_405441]’s  MRN 
for prospective data collection. If data is to be analyzed, no patient identifier will be included to ensure no 
patient  can be tracked  or identified.  Thus,  analysis  will solely  be performed  on de-identified  data.  No paper 
records will be kept. To ensure reproducibility of the finding, the UTHealth RedCap will continue to store 
the data after the completion  of the study  and until IT resources  will allow  to maintain  the machine  updated 
and protected. If this is not possible, all the data containing Protected Health Information (PHI) will be 
destroyed.  
 
Data Sharing  
In order  to allow  for a broader  reach for our finding  and scientific  publications,  we might  have  to share  part 
of the data for scientific non -commercial purposes. In this case, we will strip the imaging and clinical data 
of any PHI  information.  
 
Publication Plan  
 
Results based on data gathered from this this study may serve to elaborate abstract submissions or 
manuscripts for peer -reviewed journals. Research publications will not include any patient -specific 
information or identifiers.

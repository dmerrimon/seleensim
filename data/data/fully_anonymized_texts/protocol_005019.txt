proptosis , tissue crowding, and SlTess on 
the optic nenie). These combine to 
produce marked reductions in quality of 
life (e.g., physical functioning, role 
functioning, social functioning, mental 
health, health perceptions and pain). TED 
can also produce profound psychosocial 
problems, in particular anxiety and 
depression, due to the alarming and 
disfiguring changes in appearance. Taken 
together, these data show that TED is a 
physically and emotionally debilitating 
condition (Figure 7.1).

Thyroid eye disease has high rnorbiJity 
[Bartalena et al, 2008; Rartlcy, 1994; 
Dickinson, 2011; Gerding ct al. 1997). 
Morbidity takes the form of orbital pain, 
together with a number of serious, 
vision-or sight-threatening conditions, 
including diplopia ( due to inability to 
correctly align the eyes), corneal 
ulceraiion (due to inability to close lid,) 
and dy$lhyroid optic neuropathy (due to 
proptosis, tissue crowding, and stress on 
the optic nerve). These combine to 
produce marked reductions in quality of 
life (cg, physical functioning , role 
functioning, social functioning, mental 
health, health perceptions and pain) 
(Gerding et al 1997; Terwee et al, 2001). 
Thyroid eye disease can also produce 
profound psychosocial problems, in 
particular anxiety and depression, due to 
the alarming and disfiguring changes in 
appearance [Bartley ct al, 1996; Coulter 
et al. 2007; Kahaly et al 2005). Taken

This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial. Patients will be 
screened for the trial within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day I) Visit. Approximately 57 patients who meet the 
trial eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day I in a 2: I ratio to receive 8 infusions of TEPEZZA ( 10 mg/kg 
for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) or placebo once every 3 weeks (q3W). All 
patients will enter a 24-week double-masked Treatment Period, during which trial drug will be infused on Day I 
(Baseline) and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24 of the 24-week Treatment Period). 
All trial drng dosing will be performed at the clinic or infusion center under adequate healthcare professional 
supervision. Al any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced. or the dose may be interrupted or held 
based on tolerability (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].'.2 for details). On each dosing day, scheduled assessme nts (except for 
AE and concomitan t medication use monitoring. which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be 
completed prior to dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions. patients will be cont.acted by [CONTACT_648]/email the 
following day for safety and tolerability assessments. An additional phone/emai l contact [CONTACT_567125]-a ssociated event. 
At the end of the double-masked Treatmen t Period (Week 24), all patients will be assessed for treatment 
response: proptosis responders (study eye has ?:2-mm reduction in proptosis from Baseline without deterioration 
[?:2-mm increase in proptosis) in fellow eye) or proptosis non-responders (study eye has <2-mm reduction in 
proptosis). Proptosis non-responders who have completed the double-masked Treatment Period may choose to 
teceive 8 infusions of TEPEZZA (IO mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in 
an open-label fashion q3W at Weeks 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42 and 45. These patients will rcrum to the clinic at 
Week 48 for End-of-Treatment assessments, and patients will be contact[CONTACT_3012]/email 30 days after the 
Week 48 Visit for safety assessment. ?roptosis responders, as well as non-responders who choose not to receive 
TEPEZZA in an open-label fashfon, will enter a 30-day Follow-up Period, during which trial drug will not be 
administere d. These patients will be contact[CONTACT_3012]/email 30 days after the Week 24 Visit for safety 
assessment. 
Patients who premature ly discontinue trial drug dosing prior to Weck 21 ofl11e doublt:-1nasked Treatment Period 
br prior to Week 45 of the open-label Treatment Period will return to the clinic, undergo the scheduled End-of­
Treatmen t assessments (with the exception of the collection of blood samples for biomarker evaluations) and 
enter the Follow-up Period. provided such continued panicipation will not detrimentally affect the health, safety 
and welfare of the patient per Investigator detennination. An overview of the trial design is presented in the 
schematic below, and details of trial activities are provided in Section 2.1, Schedule of Assessments.

grading scale, when available . Shift tables using categories of low, normal and high from Baseline to each visit 
will be generated by [CONTACT_1570]. Additionally, a shift table for glucose by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE grade and visit will 
be generated by [CONTACT_1570]. Summarie s will be provided separately for hypergly cemia. 
The rate and titer of positive ADA samples will be summarized by [CONTACT_22987]. Tcprotumumab peak and trough (i.e., prior to dose) concentrations will also be summarized by [CONTACT_16787]. 
Sample Size Estimate: 
A total of 57 patients (38 in the TEPEZZA group and 19 in the placebo group) will be enrolled in the trial to 
detect at least a 2-mm mean difference between the [ADDRESS_744882] 81 % power al the 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_744883] 2.0 mm 
( clinically relevant) and the standard deviation of proptosis change values is 2.5 for both groups (larger than 
observed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 active TED trials).

Protocol HZNP-TEP-403 
Version 5.0, Amendment 4 
Thyroid eye disease (TED), also termed Graves' ophthalmopathy /orbitopathy and 
thyroid-a ssociated ophthalmopathy , is a serious, debilitating and painful autoimmune disease t hat 
can, in severe cases, lead to blindness. TED is common ly associated with Graves' 
hyperthyroidism/disease, but also occurs in a proportion of patients with other autoimmune 
thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto 's thyroiditis. The natural history involves an "active 
TED,'' which is an autoimmune inflammatory response targeting orbital soft tissues, and 
"inactive TED," in which there is tissue expansion remodeling. Active TED typi[INVESTIGATOR_34607] I to

TED (Burch et al. 1993) 
The annual incidence rate of TED in the US has been estimated to be 16 cases per 
I 00,000 people for women and 2.9 cases per I 00,000 people for men [Bartley, 1994]. The 
incidence appears to be comparab le in Europe [Abraham-Nord ling et al, 2011;

7.1.2 TEPEZZA® 
TEPEZZA' lll (teprotumumab -trbw, hereafter referred to as TEPEZZA) is a fully human 
imrnw1og lobulin G l monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human insulin-like growth 
factor (JGF)-1 receptor (IGF-lR). The IGF-lR is a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor that 
shares ~50% overall homology with the insulin receptor (Ullrich et al, 1986]. TEPEZZA binds 
with high affinity and selectivity to the extracellular domain of IGF-lR and prevents its 
activation by [CONTACT_567138], IGF-[ADDRESS_744900] (phosphoinos itide 3 kinase/Akt) and has no affinity for the insulin receptor. In 
addition, TEPEZZA causes direct inactivation of TGF-1 R through antibody-induced cellular 
internalization and degradation. Binding of TEPEZZA has been shown to inhibit canonical 
signal transduction and cellular proliferation and survival functions mediated by [CONTACT_567139]-1 R in 
cancer cells. TEPEZZA does not indµce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . 
TEPEZZAiE (teprotumumab -trbw) was approved by [CONTACT_3557] 21 January 2020 for the 
treatment of TED. 
Previous teprotumumab clinical trials for the TED indication include 2 independent, randomized, 
double-masked, placebo-controlled , parallel-group, multicenter trials (Phase 2 Trial TED0 l RV

In the Phase :2 trial. the majority ofrcporred adverse cYents (AEs) wen: mild, required no

effect in reducing the need for conective surgeries. Previous clinical expe1ience indicates that, at 
doses that are phannaco logically relcYant for blocking IGF-IR. TEPEZZA produced statistically 
significant and clinically relernnt imprm·ements in measures that assessed multiple facets of 
acrive TED (proptosis. inflammation as measured by C AS, diplopia and quality of life). Tn 
addition. TEPEZZA has an acceptab le safety profile following intravenous (IV) infusion and is, 
therefore>. a suitable drng candidate to be investigated in a chronic (inactive) TED patient 
population. 
Data on natural history ofproptosis change were taken from the TEPEZZA Phase 2 and Phase 3 
tri:-ils In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. patients entered the trials with TED diagnosis a mean of 
5 months prior to enrollment. These patients were followed for 72 weeks. Io addition, the 
majority of the placebo patients (67'87) had a CAS score of less than or equal to 3 out of7 
(defines chronic [inaccive] TED for these trials) in the fellow-eye during the treatment period. 
The findings with regards to proptosis in this patient population are the following: mean change 
from baseline in proptosis at Week 72 (n'=35) for the study eye was -1.2 mm with 95% 
confidence inter1al (Cl) (-1.84, -0.67). while the non-study eye change from baseline for n=35 
was 0.43 with 95% CI (-1.07, 0.21). The mean change in proptosis for the inactive TED 
population identified above (n=3 l) was -0.48 with 95% CI (-1.14, 0.17). lt is therefore concluded

7 .3 Rationale for Dose Selection 
The US FDA-approved dosing duration for TEPEZZA is 10 mg/kg for the first dose followed by 
20 mg/kg administered IV once every 3 weeks (q3W) for 7 additiona l infusions . 
Since there is no expected difference in TEPEZZA pharmacokinetic (PK) between active and 
chronic (inactive) TED patients, the same dose regimen will be used in this trial.

This is a randomized. double-masked, placebo-conrrolled, parallel-group, multicent er trial. 
Patients will be screened for the trial within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. 
Approximately 57 patients who meet the trial eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day l in a 
2: l ratio to receive 8 infusions of TEPEZZA (IO mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for 
the remaining 7 infusions) or placebo q3W. All patients will enter a 24-week double-masked

9.2 Discussion of Trial Design 
The ttial population is well-defined and consistent with the US FDA-approved indication (for the 
treatment of TED) in the TEPEZZA prescribing information. 
This trial is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter trial 
designed according to standard principles for adequate and well-cont rolled trials. The 
measurements used in this trial for the efficacy endpoints (proptosis, 
•• md GO-QoL qut:slionnaire) are established endpoints in TED clinical trials that have been 
shown to correlate significantly with TED. 
The sampk size for this trial was dete1mined assuming that the mean difference in proptosis 
change between the [ADDRESS_744907] 2.0 mm (clinically relevant) and the standard deviation of 
proptosis change values is 2.5 for both groups (larger than observed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 
active TED trials). A total of 57 patients (38 in the TEPEZZA group and 19 in the placebo 
group) will be enrolled in the trial to detect at least a 2-mm mean difference between the 
[ADDRESS_744908] 
81 % power at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Given the teratogenic effects of TEPEZZA noted in animal reproduction studies and its 
mechanism of action (see the current edition of the TEPEZZA Investigator's Brochure), women 
of childbearing potential who arc sexually active with a non-vasectomized male partner are 
required to use adequate contraception and report any pregnancies for at least [ADDRESS_744909] dose, the estimated plasma concentration (0.2

provide trial drug in infusion bags (fully diluted for administration) lo site personnel with 
appropriate masked labels. The patient, Investigator. and all other site personnel will be masked 
to the treatment being administered. 
The trial mask should be broken only if the safety of a patient is at risk and the treatment plan 
depends on which trial drug he or she received. Unless the patient is at immediate risk, the 
Investigator mu!-t make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_13679]'s designee before 
unmasking the patient's data. The Investigator must use the Randomi zation and Trial Supply 
Management (RTSM) application to unmask the patient's data. Tf a patient's data are unmasked 
without prior knowledge of the Sponsor, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as 
possible and no later than the next business day. All circumstances surrounding the event must 
be clearly document ed. 
The Sponsor or designee will unmask the identity of the trial drug for an unexpected, 
Jrug -related SAE for submission to health authorities and IBB/Independent Ethics Committee 
according to applicable regulatory requirements. However , the results will not be shared with 
other Sponsor representatives or staff at investigative sites. Details of patients who are unmasked 
during the trial will be included in the clinical study report. 
Unmaski ng for independent pharmaco logical analysis of biological samples or SAE reporting 
will be perfonned according to procedures in place to ensure integrity of the data.

and pregnancy testing (if applicable). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.l Adverse Event Definition 
According to !CH, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a phannaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treaLment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigat ional) product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal (investigation al) product. 
Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the trial are to be reported as AEs. New findings 
reported from the on-trial visual acuity assessmen ts will not be repmted as AEs if, according to 
the Investigator , the abnormalities are related to TED and not considered related to the trial drug. 
Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded on the AE 
pages of the eCRF unless there is a clear exacerba tion of a chronic condition. 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsenin g of a patient's condition at1ributablc to the 
cfo:ease for which the t1ial drng is being studied (i.e., TED) and may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increase in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of worsening proptosis may be considered as disease progression and not an AE. 
Events that are unequivoca lly due to disease progressio n should only be reported as AF.s if they 
fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of trial drng. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE), Baseline event, or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial, including 
deaths that appear to be compktcly unrelated to the trial drug (e.g., due to car accident). 
• Life-threatening adverse experience. An AE or suspected advi.::rse reaction is considered 
life-threatening it: in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe fo1m, might have caused death.

• fnfusion-related events observed wirh teprotumumah to date have not been anaphylactic 
in nature. rlowcvcr. because of the protein nature ofteprotumumah and the potential for 
infusion-related readions and hypersens itivity reactions, teprotumumab should be 
administe red in a setting with emergency equipment and staff who are trained to monitor 
medical situations and respond to emergencies. For the first 3 infusions. patients should 
be monitored for any events during infusion and for 60 minutes after completion of 
infusion. For subsequent infusions (the fourth dose and beyond), patients who have not 
previously experienced an infusion reaction should be monitored during the infusion and 
for at least 30 minutes after the infusion. 
• Patients who exhibit immediate hypersensitiv ity reactions or infusion-related reactions 
during an infusion oftcprotumumab should have the infusion interrupted or the infusion 
rate slowed. Symptomat ic treatment , e.g., antipyrctics, antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids, oxygen, beta agonisls and IV fluids, should be administered to the 
patient. Following an immediate hypersensitivity reaction or infusion-associated reaction, 
vital signs (temperatme , blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be monitored 
every 5 minutes until stable. and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional dctcnninations. 
The infusion may be restarted upon complete resolution of symptoms except in the case 
of patients wbo experience an anaphylactic reaction of life-threatening intensity; these 
patients should be removed from the trial. 
• 1n general, the decision to keep a patient on trial treatment with tcprotumuma b should 
lake into consideration potential risks and benefits to the patient. Prior to future infusions 
of teprotumumab, these patients may be premedica tcd with JV diphenhydramine 1 to 1.25 
mg/kg (maximum 50 mg), JV ranitidine 50 mg. IV famotidine 0.5 mg/kg, IV 
dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 20 mg) and/or acetaminophe n 500 mg. Tn addition, 
all future infusions should be administered over 90 minutes. Vital signs should be taken 
every 15 minutes during the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion. 
• Patients who experience delayed-type hypersens itivity reactions (e.g., skin rash) may 
remain in the ttial at the discretion of the Investigator and, prior to all future infusions of 
teprotumumab, may be premedicated with the above medications (diphenhyd ramine, 
ranitidine, famotidine, dexamethasone and acetaminophen) . However, if a rash worsens

Risk of New Onset or Exacerbation ofIBD 
• In Phase 2 TEDOIRV, 2 teprotumumab -treaced patients with a history ofIBD reported 
serious TEAEs (Diarrhoea in l patient and Inflammatory bowel disease in l patient) that 
led co discontin uation of trial d.rng. Based on these serious events and the fact that a 
placebo pariem with Crohn's disease did not experience these types of events, patiems 
with a history of IBD are either excluded from current trials or must be in clinical 
rem1ss1on. 
• Patients who experience progressive and persistent diarrhea or other IBD symptoms, such 
as bloody stools or abdominal pain, should undergo prompt evaluation to exclude new 
onset or exacerbation of preexisting IBD or other serious conditions. If possible, 
medications known to cause diarrhea, such as laxatives and magnesium shall be avoided.

• Patients with recurrent hyperglycemia , defined as a fasting glucose> 126 mg/dL, will 
require evaluation for diabetes mellitus (e.g., fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and 
HbAlc tests) and appropriate medical management, al the discretion of the Investigator, 
Management of Severe Diabetic Complications 
Hyperglycemia can cause serious acute complications, presenting as endocrine emergencies, 
such as Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmol ar state (HHS). Both of 
these conditions are caused by [CONTACT_567148]-regulatory hormones (glucagon, growth hormone. cortisol, catecholamines) 
(Marcovecc hio 2017). Both DKA and HHS are usually triggered bv an underlying illness or 
event such as acute infection, infarction, non-complianc e with diet and skipped insulin doses or 
insulin pump failure. DKA and HHS are life-threatening emergencies. Prompt clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_567110], hyperglycemia, and electrolyte abnormalit ies which will include, 
but is not limited to, IV fluid resuscitation, IV insulin, and IV potassium. Every effort should be 
made to identify the cause, so that future preventive measures can be taken. Patticipants 
experiencing OKA or HHS should be discontinued from study treatment. Management of 
infusion reactions and hyperglycemia is also described in Section 9,4.6,3.2. 
Risk ofMuscle Spasms 
Among reprotumum ab-treated patients, Muscle spasms was the most commonly reported TRAE 
in clinical trials of Active TED (Double-Masked Treatment Period: 26.2% tcprotumumab 
compared to 7.0% placebo; Open-Label Extension Trial: 41.3%). /\II events were non-seriou s 
and the majority were mild in intensity. 
lf possible, avoid medications known to cause muscle spasms or muscle toxicity, such as 
diurelics or statins. If muscle spasm occurs, evaluate for other causes of muscle spasm, such as 
electrolyte abno1malities and dehydration . 
Risk of Hearin!!, Impairment 
Adverse reactions of middle- to high-range sensorineural hearing loss have been reponed in both 
healthy volunteers and patients with malignancies who received as little as I dose of various 
IGF-IR mi\bs. 
Eighteen events associated with hearing impairment have been observed in 14 teprotumumab 
treated patients in the TED trials, with no reports observed in placebo treated patients. Each of 
these events were nonserious, mild or moderate in intensity and none led to premature

[IP_ADDRESS].7 Medication Errnr and Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administration of investigat ional drug to or 
by a trial patient, at a dose equivalent to 27 mg/kg q3W or greater. 
A medication error is defined as any unintended failure in the drug treatment process, such as 
mistakes in the prescribing, dispensing, storing, preparing or administering of a medicine that 
leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient. 
All cases of medication errors and overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be 
documented on the eCRF in order to capture this important safety information consistently in the 
database. A Es associaled wilh an overdose and SAEs of overdose are to be reported according to 
the procedures outlined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS].2 and [IP_ADDRESS].5, respectively. 
There is no antidote for TEPEZZA; therefore, in the event of drug overdose, the patient is to be 
treated with symptomatic and supportive care as required.

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs and Weight 
Demi led timing of vital sign and weight measurements is described in Section 2.1. 
Vital signs (blood pressure. heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature) will be measured at all clinic 
visits. Vital signs will be measured pre-and post-infusion on Day I and Week 3 (all patients). 
pre-and post-infusion at Week 24 and Week 27 (proptosis non-responde rs who elect to receive 
open-label TEPEZZA ) and pre-infusion on all other infusion days. ln addition, if immediate 
infusion-associated evenrs are noted during the infusion, vital signs will be monitored every 
5 minutes until stable and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional determinations. Also, vital signs 
will l:,e monitored every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after 
infusion completion for any subsequent infusions after the previous occurrence of immediate or 
delayed infusion-associated events. 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be obtained with the patient's arm unconstrained by 
[CONTACT_567155]. When possible, the same ann will be 
used for measurements at all trial visits.

If significant abnormal ities arc noted compared with previous visits, including a loss of2 lines or 
more of vision or other abnormalitie s not otherwise specified but of concern to the 
ophthalmologist, further investigations of visual function will be conducted according to the 
ophthalmologist's decision. 
New findings reported from on-trial visual acuity assessments will not be reported as AEs if, 
according to the Investigator, the abnormalit ies are unequivoca lly due to disease progression and 
should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of trial drug.

If any modification s in the trial design, dosages, parameters, patient selection or any other 
sections of the protocol are indicated or required, the Investigator will consult with the Sponsor 
before any such changes are instituted. Modifica tions will be accomplished through formal 
amendments to this protocol by [CONTACT_567166]. 
The Sponsor's Medical Monitor will consider any requests for exceptio ns to protocol entry 
criteria on a case-by-case basis. The Investigator or other health professional in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_436869]. All protocol deviations and the reasons for such 
deviations must be document ed in the eCRF. In the event of a protocol deviation , the 
Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor will determine whether the patient should continue 
participation in the trial. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to report fully to regulatory authorities all results of 
administration of investigational drugs to humans. No investigational procedures other than those 
described in this protocol will be undertaken on the enrolled patients without the agreement of

the orbital rim (a). 
2. Open it wider than required. 
3. Sit opposite the patient. and at the same level. 
4. Keep the patient relaxed, avoiding breath holding and excessive eyelid retraction . 
• • 
( 
move adjustable part to left side of 
patient only when right size is 
stabilised firmly in position 
5. Position left foot of Hertel against the patient's right lateral orbital rim, at level oflateral 
canthus (b ). 
It should sit firmly as medially as possible, but outside lateral canthus and without 
distorting position of globe. 
6. Slide right foot medially into identical position on left orbital rim (c). This will feel tight 
and slightly uncomfortable, but minimizes potential side slippage of Hertel. 
7. Ask patient to fix their right eye on your left eye while you occlude the patient's left 
visual axis with your right thumb. ln this position, align the instrument such that the 
vertical mark (or cone) is aligned with the manufactu rer's pre-marked position on the 
ruler. Once aligned, rotate the instrwnent slightly around the horizontal plane such as to 
view the apex of the cornea in the mirror. Record the position of the corneal apex on the 
nikr. This is Hertel value. 
8. To record the left eye, hold the instrument stationary and move your head. Then use your 
1ight eye to record the patients left eye. Again, the opposite visual axis is occluded by 
[CONTACT_567176], while the patient is asked to fix on your right eye. Ensure that the 
corneal apex is measured by [CONTACT_567177], 
if required.

Title of study : Metformin Effect on Brain Function in Insulin Resistant Elderly People 
June 22, 2021 
Version  17 
  
Research Design and Methods  
Participants : We will recruit equal numbers of pre-diabetic, elderly men and women using the 
following criteria: age ≥ 60 yrs.  BMI  > 25fasting glucose ≥ 100-140 mg/dL. These selection 
criteria will allow us to recruit participants with reduced insulin sensitivity , but the variations in 
insulin sensitivity among participants will be evident from hyperinsulinemia glucose clamp  that 
we will perform. People on medications that interfere with primary outcome measurements will 
be excluded (See under Subject Details ). Importantly, people on hypoglycemic drugs including 
metformin will be excluded. We will exclude T2D /pre-diabetic  people on oral hypoglycemic 
agents due to their variability in insulin secretion and also because most people in Olmsted County with fasting glucose >140 mg/dl are on metformin  and it would be unethical to withhold 
treatment from these individuals . People who engage in structured aerobic exercise ≥ 3 d/wk or 
have active cardiovascular disease, renal failure, or liver function abnormalities will also be excluded (see Subject  Details ). In the current study, we will screen medical records for any 
diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia. We do not intend to target people with clinical dementia in the current study.  We will also administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at the screening visit and exclude any individual with a score < 22. English language proficiency will also be included as a criterion  for enrollment, as strong English proficiency will 
be necessary for proper administration of the NIH Toolbox cognitive testing.  We will recruit equal numbers of men and women and strive to recruit all ethnic groups represented in the community.  Overall Study Design :
  We will conduct a placebo -controlled, double- blind randomized trial 
with longitudinal (pre- & post-intervention) measurements. 40 participants will be randomized to placebo or metformin (2000 mg/d) groups. The initial study visit will include a screen, including testing for the criteria mentioned above.  Participants will be asked to report to the CRTU fasting for a blood test,  including a CBC, liver function, fasting glucose, lipid panel, and TSH.  They 
will also have height and weight measurements taken and the MoCA test administered.  While this is being done, the blood test results will be made available to the study team.   If the 
participant passes the screening criteria, an outpatient visit will includ e a DEXA scan to assess 
body composition, a VO
2max test on a cycle ergometer to test aerobic capacity .The first inpatient 
day will examine baseline brain structure and function using fMRI analysis .  For fMRI 
measurements , a minimum 20 participants are recommended for sufficient reliability for fMRI 
neuroimaging studies (4) . Additionally, cognition will be assessed by [CONTACT_105648]-
Cognition Battery (NIHTB- CB). Participants will be asked to report to the Charlton CRTU 
fasting on the day of their fMRI study.  They will have a fasting blood draw, followed by [CONTACT_343124].  Imaging will be performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra equipped with a 32-channel head coil and the multi-nuclear option (MNO) running VE11C software. Imaging sequences include the following: To measure structural information:  A sagittal 3D 
3 
 MPRAGE sequence with 0.7mm isotropic voxels (TR=2400, TE=2.57, TI=1100, FA=8) will be 
used to acquire high-resolution structural data for volumetric analysis of brain region changes related to metformin.  The higher resolution allows for less variable segmentation and parcellation resulting in more accurate volumetric measurements. To measure white matter information: An axial 2D symmetric multi-slice (SMS) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence with 60 diffusion directions, 5 B0 acquisitions and 2mm isotropic voxels (TR=3000, TE=73, FA=90, ETL 43, both A-P and P-A phase encoding for B0 images) will be used to acquire white matter integrity data related to metformin.  To measure global brain blood flow information: An axial 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) sequence (WIP 818) with 4mm isotropic voxels (TI1=1800, TI2=3600, iPat ≤ 2) will be used to acquire quantitative blood flow measurements (flow in ml/100g/min) throughout the brain.  A post-label delay of 1800 ms will be used as we are i maging otherwise healthy subjects. To measure global brain functional 
network information: An axial 2D echo-planar imaging sequence with 3mm isotropic voxels (FA=90, TE=30, TR=2000, # slices=50) will be used to acquire resting state functional MRI data throughout the brain. To measure brain lactate: A single voxel point-resolved MR spectroscopy sequence (PRESS, 2 cm isotropic voxel, TE=30, TR=2000, 5000 Hz, 2048 points, 128 acquisitions with water suppression and 16 acquisitions without water suppression) will be used to acquire metabolite information from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To measure brain ATP levels: Multivoxel chemical shift imaging (dual-tuned proton (Helmholtz pair)/phosphorus (loop) flex coil applied such that the phosphorus loop overlies the right DLPFC, WIP 1071, axial 1.5 cm slice prescribed to encompass the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 12x12 matrix reconstructed to 16x16 matrix, 1.5 cm nominal isotropic voxels, TR=1500) will be used to acquire phosphorus metabolite information from the right DLPFC.  Following the MRI measurement, the subject will remain at Charlton 6 for a brain PET scan.  Brain glucose uptake will be evaluated using 18F-Fludeoxyglucose injection and positron emission tomography (PET) scans at baseline and following 40- weeks of placebo  or metformin  
treatment .  The results will provide insight into how brain metabolism changes with metformin 
treatment .   
 Imaging:  Each patient will be injected with approximately 8 mCi (440 MBq) (range 7-10mCi) of F-18 FDG.  The F-18 FDG scan will be performed 30 minutes after injection is performed 
with an  8-10- minute acquisition. The PET sinograms will be reconstructed using iterative 
reconstruction into a 256 mm field of view; the pi[INVESTIGATOR_343099] 1.[ADDRESS_424845] image, obtained prior to injection of FDG, will be used for attenuation correction and a model- based scatter correction applied. Random coincidences will be corrected 
for using single event count rates and corrections for dead-time and decay will be applied. An absolute calibration correction, which converts the image intensity into activity concentration, will be used.  Quantitative PET ROI Analysis: Anatomic standardization and statistical quantification of FDG PET image sets will be performed using a program (Cortex ID, GE Healthcare, WI) that generates standardized three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection datasets for individual subjects. In this algorithm, an individual brain image set will be first realigned to the midsagittal plane. The AC-PC line (a line passing through the anterior and posterior commissures) will be estimated by [CONTACT_343125] a standard atlas template. 
This standard atlas template was produced as an average of FDG images from [ADDRESS_424846] the individual brain shape to the stereotactic atlas coordinate system proposed by [CONTACT_343126], nonlinear warpi[INVESTIGATOR_343100]. The directions will be predefined in the stereotactic coordinate space on the basis of the fiber origins and their cortical projections. Individual landmarks for cortical projections will be searched iteratively between c enters and cortical landmarks predetermined on the template brain using a 
profile curve analysis. Detected individual landmarks will then be warped to predefined landmarks, resulting in a standardized image set with a uniform voxel size of 2.25 mm, interpolation to 60 slices, and a matrix size of 128 x128. This enables reliable pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]-by-pi[INVESTIGATOR_343101]. To determine projection map values, the program will use a predetermined vector that is 6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463] (13.5mm) long and oriented perpendicular to the outer and medial surfaces of the right and left- brain hemispheres for each 
surface pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]. The surface pi[INVESTIGATOR_343102]. We will normalize surface pi[INVESTIGATOR_343103]. The normalized cortical pi[INVESTIGATOR_343104] a statistical map, which will show surface pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]-by-pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] z- scores 
derived from comparing an individual’s scan with results in normal controls. These Z- score maps 
and values will be used for comparison of baseline and post- test scans to detect changes in brain 
metabolism.  
 
Approximately 1 week after completion of the outpatient study visits , we will assess  insulin 
sensitivity  by [CONTACT_343127] a 6 hour two -stage hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp at  Mayo 
Clinical Research Trial Unit (CR TU) as an inpatient study following an overnight fast . On the 
evening prior to the clamp, participants will receive a standardized diet from the CRTU research 
kitchen  (10kcal/kg body weight; composition 20% protein, 30% fat and 50% carbohydrate ). 
Following the meal,  we will use the computerized NIH toolbox to measure cognitive outcomes. 
The NIH encourages the use of these tools to enhance collection of data in large studies and for clinical trials (7). The cognitive and behavioral tests were normed across a national sample of persons aged 3-[ADDRESS_424847] shown that residents within Olmsted County, MN prefer the iPad over a personal computer (8). The NIH Toolbox-Cognition Battery is composed of 7 core tests and 2 supplemental tests (~30-45 minutes) including the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) Test (executive function), the Flanker Inhibitory Control Test (executive function), the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17121] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]), the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] (vocabulary), the Oral Reading Recognition Test (reading), the List Sorting Working Memory Test (working memory), the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (processing speed), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Trials 1 -3 (epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]), and the Oral Symbol Digit Test (processing speed).  For each test, 
the raw scores will be converted to normally distributed standard scores. The NIH Toolbox-Cognition is an in-person test that requires specialized knowledge for administration (use is limited to in dividuals supervised by a psychologist), as well as back and forth interactions with 
the patient and a provider throughout its administration. Several measures use computer adaptive testing, which bases subsequent items on a subject’s previous response, essentially shortening the time to administer the measure while improving the psychometric properties of the measure (e.g., 
5 
 reliability, validity). Because it is administered directly on the iPad, scoring is instantaneous 
which greatly improves clinical efficiency and reduces costs. Also, iPad administration will help to reduce administration and scoring errors and further incr ease standardization across sites. Due 
to this iPad administration and the use of computer adaptive testing, there is no single form for this test than can be reviewed. However, detailed training videos are available online that illustrate test content and  administration: http://www.healthmeasures.net/NIH_Toolbox_iPad_e-
learning/story_html5.html   
 Participants will be offered the opportunity at their screening visit to meet with the dietary staff of the CRTU to discuss dietary preferences and address any concerns or questions. Three hours prior to start of hormone (somatostatin) infusion, priming [6,6’2H2 ]glucose bolus 
(approximately 6 mg/kg FFM) will be administered followed by [CONTACT_34050] [6,6’2H2]glucose (approximately 4 mg/kg FFM/h). [6,6’2H2] glucose infusion rate will be titrated downward by 10-30% at 1-2-hour intervals after start of the hormone infusions. For the first 3 hours regular insulin will be infused at a rate of 0.6 mU/kgFFM/minute then 2.4 mU/kgFFM/minute for 3 hours. Euglycemic blood glucose will be maintained with titrated infusion of [6,6’2H2] glucose labeled 40% dextrose solution.  Blood will be collected from a catheter inserted in their dorsal hand vein that is kept in a hot box to collect arterialized venous blood.  Urine will be collected  prior to starting  the insulin clamp until the end of the clamp. A 
stool sample will also be collected during this visit to assess changes to the microbiome based on the study intervention.  If participants are unable to provide a stool sample at this time, a kit will be provided with instructions on how to perform the collection at home and how to return the kit to the study team. The stool samples will be sent to the Cell Signaling Clinical Core Lab in the Guggenheim for storage. When the samples are pulled for testing,  they will be sent to the 
University of MN – Genomics Center to have the test performed.  After the clamp participants 
will be able to resume their usual diet and will be discharged from the CRU. We will perform indirect calorimetry of [ADDRESS_424848]. Mary’s CRTU fasting at 6am.  Percutaneous vastus lateralis muscle biopsies will be performed prior to and 1-h post a 25 kcal/kg FFM mixed meal (50% Fat, 30% Carbohydrate HO, 20% Protein) as we have previously described (9). Briefly, muscle biopsies will be performed with a percutaneous biopsy needle (modified Bergstrom needle).  Local subcutaneous injection of 2% lidocaine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate will be used for analgesia.  A small incision will be made through the skin and fascia. After the biopsy, pressure will be held over the incision until hemostasis is achieved.  The incision is closed with sterile strips, gauze,  and an Ace wrap.  Risks of this 
procedure include hematoma, infection, and pain.  Hematoma likelihood is minimized by [CONTACT_343128], followed by a pressure dressing.  The risk of infection is minimized by [CONTACT_343129]. Pain is managed by [CONTACT_343130]. Muscle mitochondrial studies will be performed in muscle samples as we have previously reported (9). We will also be examining muscle samples for changes in protein expression, metabolite concentrations, and gene expression.  This visit should last approximately [ADDRESS_424849] 2 months to ensure compliance. Participants will return every 4 weeks to refill their prescription where a tablet tally will be performed to determine the adherence to the drug. We will measure plasma metformin levels at each monthly return visit.  
At the conclusion of the 40- week  intervention period, subjects will return to repeat the4 study 
visits outlined above (DEXA scan/VO
2max test, MRI/cognitive study/ PET scan, inpatient clamp 
study, and muscle biopsy study).  A study flow diagram is shown in Figure [ADDRESS_424850] -intervention 
study visits.  
 
We will escalate the dose of metformin (500 mg metformin  and blinded placebo) (week 1, [ADDRESS_424851] and dinner twice daily; week 2, [ADDRESS_424852] and 2 tablets with dinner). Administration of tablets with 
meal reduces the gastro -intestinal (GI) adverse effects which are the most common adverse effects 
especially when taking metformin on an empty stomach. If the participant develops any adverse GI symptoms on escalating the  dose, we will revert back to the previous dose. The maximal dose 
that is FDA approved is [ADDRESS_424853] the higher 
dose is preferred . The time scale for escalation of metformin dose will be standardized for all 
participants. Those who develop gastrointestinal symptoms as we escalate the dose to the optimum dose will be analyzed separately from the participants that are able to adhere to the escalation protocol. To account for the anticipated 10% that will experience GI symptoms, we have increased our accrual by [ADDRESS_424854] treating 
exclusively patients with diabetes and lipid disorders at Mayo Clinic and he has extensive experience in using metformin in patients as well as in research  (5). 
The randomization order will be determined by [CONTACT_343131] U pharmacy department.  Since vitamin B12 deficiency has been 
reported (6) (4.3 VS:2.3% Metformin VS Placebo on 5 year) we will check vitamin B12 and more 
sensitive methyl malonic acid at pre-intervention MRI outpatient  visit, 4, 12, [ADDRESS_424855] 
intervention MRI outpatient visit.  All participants  will be given vitamin B12 replacement per 
DSMB recommendation . 
To ensure participant safety we will monitor glucose (fasting) when the participants present for s
cheduled visits to collect medication / placebo. If fasting glucose is > 140 mg/dl we will measure 
HbA1c. If the HbA1c is >7% we will refer to our safety officer  ([CONTACT_343169]  who is consultant 
diabetologist ) who will determine whether the participants need to be placed on “open label” 

9 
 metformin. Since the HbA1c target in that age group is 7% we consider up to 7% as a level that 
does not need intervention. While this management could break study blinding, the cognitive assessments and imaging will be conducted by [CONTACT_343132].  
Participants who do not show a reaction to the high dose insulin during the post -intervention 
hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp  will be asked to repeat this visit to rule out vein infiltration 
during the previous post-intervention insulin clamp.  
Sample size justification . T
 his is a developmental grant, so the sample size is not justified based 
on power for any of the particular aims. Rather, the estimate is based on precision and reliable 
estimates of the imaging studies. In particular, for the fMRI study Thirion et al (4) found that 20 
to 25 subjects were necessary to achieve reliable results. Given we want to study 20 within-group metformin subjects with fMRI, balancing the randomization 1:[ADDRESS_424856] sizes for between group differences are unknown; however, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of at least 0.9 SD difference between the groups at alpha=0.05 (two -sided). 
Statistical Considerations Statistical plan : T
 he analysis of the aims will be focused on estimation – standard deviations of 
MRS estimates and initial examinations of the changes in measures over time. With 20/group and repeated measures, we will be able to fit repeated measures models (e.g., mixed  effects 
“trajectories”). For MRS with only a pre- post assessment, the mixed model framework is 
essentially a two -sample t -test on the changes over time, but importantly, the modeling framework 
will allow inclusion of all available data. Th is is to provide the most degrees of freedom to estimate 
the residual error, which will be used to plan a definitive study should these results appear promising (biological engagement as quantified by [CONTACT_343133], change in insulin sensitivity, etc.) Supporting these analyses will be standard descriptive and graphical summaries of the data.    
Interpretation : In thi
 s double -blind placebo- controlled study all data interpretation will be 
performed at the end of the study and the un- blinding will be done by [CONTACT_30165]. Statistical 
plan is as outlined above. We will make conclusions on whether our hypotheses are proved or disproved based on statistical significance (P<0.05) of the outcomes that are outlined under MR data analysis and cognitive functions. If the observed data reaches statistical significance for one or more outcomes our outlined hypotheses will be proven. However, if the significance level does not reach statistical significance but shows promising results, that will offer opportunities for a 
larger study with more participants and perhaps longer duration.

Restrictions on Use of Other Drugs or Treatments:  
1. Medications that may impact study end points such as mitochondrial biology e.g. beta 
blockers 
2. Anti-hyperglycemic drugs including metformin 
3. Any other medication that the investigator believes is a contraindication to the subject’s participation.  
 Procedures: MRI scanning of the brain:  W
 e will be performing pre - and post -intervention MRI 
scanning to measure brain ATP production by [CONTACT_105705]. We will measure brain structure (grey and white matter content) and functions by [CONTACT_9268], fMRI. Participants will be explained all testing procedures and how the test can be terminated if the participant wishes to be removed from scanner. Injury within the MRI will be minimized by [CONTACT_343135] a magnetic materials safety questionnaire to ensure that it is safe for them to be ex posed to strong magnetic 
fields.   Burns due to touching the sides of the magnet will be avoided by [CONTACT_343136].  Interventions:   
 Metformin: We will use Metformin in half of the participants.  We will enquire 
about the prior use of this agent during a detailed history and physical examination as part of the screening visit.  We will also ensure that the likelihood of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_343106]. Subjects will start metformin at 500 mg twice daily and titrate upwards by 500 mg every 1-2 weeks to reach a maximum dose of 2000 mg (week 1, [ADDRESS_424860] and two tablets with dinner).   
 2.1.2. Sources of Materials:  
Samples of blood obtained during the course of the experiments will be used exclusively for research purposes. No use will be made of pre-existing specimens.  Screening visit:  All subjects will be consented by [CONTACT_343137]. The study physician will perform a detailed history and physical with special  emphasis on history of 
glucose tolerance. Clinical Research Unit (CRU) personnel will obtain routine vital signs and draw blood for screening labs, including hematocrit, comprehensive chemistry panel (including 
hematocrit, fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, liver function tests and TSH). If these tests are available close to recruitment, the same results will be used, and unnecessary testing avoided.  This study is not meant to find out if the participant has any other disease or problem. The study le
aders will alert the participant if any of the research results are important to his/her health during 
the study. The participant may have a copy of the screening tests to discuss with his/her personal physician. When the blood tests are completed, any blood left over will be thrown away. It will not be stored for any future testing.  Metabolic Measures :
  We will record participants’ body weight, height, body mass index (BMI). 
All subjects will be studied after fasting with a hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic clamp.  After an overnight fast, participants will have catheter inserted in their dorsal hand vein that is kept in a hot 
[ADDRESS_424861] arterialized venous blood at Mayo Clinical Research Trial Unit (CR TU) where 
baseline blood samples and then following a n insulin infusion at two different doses at [ADDRESS_424862] dextrose infusion to maintain blood 
glucose between 85 to 90 mg/dl. Another day they will be given a mixed meal and pre and post 
meal (1 hour) needle biopsy of muscle will be performed.  We will perform muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle under sterile precautions under local 
anesthesia. We have performed over [ADDRESS_424863] the lines and infusing normal saline to decrease the risk of phlebitis or occlusion.    Randomization: A
  participant who meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled 
in the study. After completion of baseline studies, the participant will be randomized to one of the study groups as described above.  Medical/Technical support:  St
 udy personnel will be available at all times during the length of the 
trial to answer any question or troubleshoot any problem. Access to individually identifiable private information about human subjects:  Pe
 rmission to gather, 
use and share information about the participant will be obtained in the consent forms. If the participant decides not to give permission, he/she cannot be in the study. This collected information may include personal information such as name, address, date of birth, social security 
number, medical records and test results from before, during and after the study from any of the participant’s doctors or health care providers (including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS record s) and information needed to bill others for participants care. These records may 
be accessed by [CONTACT_3476], people or committees that oversee the study, people who pay for the study, including insurance companies, tax reporting offices, people who evaluate study results, and government agencies that provide oversight such as the Office for Research Subject protection. The information collected might be published in a medical journal in a way that protects participant privacy. The participant may change  his/her mind at any time; however, permission does not end 
unless the participant cancels it by [CONTACT_5583] a letter or email to the researcher. The researchers will still use information about the participant that was collected before his/her participation ended. All researchers will  do everything possible to protect participant privacy.  
 2.1.3. Potential Risks and minimization: 
 Feasibility, Recruitment,  and Informed Consent:  These have been described earlier in this 
section.   Each willing participant will meet one of the investigators who will explain the scientific rationale of the study, the procedures and potential risks involved in the study.  The consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_343138].  Informed written consent from the participant will be obtained by [CONTACT_343139]. An electronic note will be entered in each participant’s medical record regarding the consent and a copy of the consent will be electronically ke pt with the participant’s medical record.  A copy of the consent will be given to 
the subject and the original kept in the study records.   The principal investigators or their co- investigators meet with each participant, review the consent 
form in detail  and confirm the subjects understanding of the study. They answer all questions posed 
by [CONTACT_343140] a signed consent. Only designated study staff is authorized to obtain informed consent.  
13 
 All experimental protocols will be conducted at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster CRU of the Mayo Clinic 
Center for Clinical and Translational studies (CCaTS).  Protection during in- patient studies:  All protocols and all techniques to be used will be 
approved by [CONTACT_343134].  All participants will have the Mayo Clinic paging operator available to them [ADDRESS_424864] the investigators for any problems.  The following protection will be taken for the risks identified above:  1. Intravenous risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_343141] 0.9% normal saline throughout the study to decrease the risk of phlebitis or occlusion.   
2. The amount of blood drawn is within the amounts acceptable by [CONTACT_8236]. There is a Center for Clinical and Translational Studies (CCaTS) electronic tracking system that monitors if a subject is in more than one research study at a time.   
 The following are the potential risks for this study with minimization strategies.  
 a) Blood will be withdrawn. The total blood withdrawn during each study protocol will not exceed 550 ml. Hemoglobin measured before starting the study will be greater than 12.0 g/dl in males and 11.0 g/dl in females. All subjects will refrain from giving blood or being in any other research study eight weeks prior to the study and until eight weeks after the completion of the study.  b) Metformin will be administered. We will enquire about the prior use of this agent during a detailed history and physical examination as part of the screening visit.  Subjects will start metformin at 500 mg twice  daily and titrate upwards by 500 mg every 1- 2 weeks to reach a 
maximum dose of 2000 mg (week 1, [ADDRESS_424865] and dinner twice daily; week 2, 
two tablets each with breakfast and  one with  dinner and week 3,  two tablets with breakfast and 
two tablets with dinner).  Administration of tablets with meal reduces the gastro -intestinal (GI) 
adverse effects which are the most common adverse effects, particularly when taking metformin on an empty stomach. If the participant develops any adverse GI symptoms on escalating the dose we will rever t back to the previous dose. The maximal dose FDA approved is 2500 mg and the 
optimum dose clinically used is 2000 mg. Since vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported (4) (4.3 VS:2.3% Metformin VS Placebo on 5 year) we will check vitamin B12 and more sensitive methyl malonic acid at  pre-intervention outpatient MRI visit,  4, 12, [ADDRESS_424866] -intervention 
outpatient MRI visit. All participants  will be given Vitamin B12 replacement per DSMB 
recommendation  
 c)  Vascular catheters will be placed.  Catheter insertion and blood withdrawal are associated with a small risk of phlebitis.  This will be minimized by [CONTACT_343142].  If phlebitis occurs, it will be treated conservatively with h eat and when appropriate, with antibiotics. 
In all experiments, “arterialized – venous” blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_1299] a hand in which a 
catheter has been inserted, in a heated box during the study.  The temperature inside the box is maintained at ~55 °C.  With prolonged exposure to continuous heat, there is a potential risk of local 
skin irritation or a minor burn.  If this occurs, it will be treated appropriately. However,  we have 
used this technique for the past [ADDRESS_424867] had no instances of hot box related burns or injuries. The potential risks of catheters and hot box use will be discussed with the volunteers prior to obtaining consent for the study.  D)  We will be performing pre - and post -intervention MRI scanning to measure brain ATP 
production by [CONTACT_105705]. We will measure brain structure (grey and white matter content) and functions by [CONTACT_9268], fMRI. The main risk of MRI procedures is claustrophobia.  Participants will be explained all testing procedures and how the test can be terminated if the participant wishes to be removed from scanner. Injury within the MRI will be minimized by [CONTACT_343135] a magnetic materials safety qu estionnaire to ensure that it is safe for them to be exposed 
[ADDRESS_424868] on the brain.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Statistical plan : The analysis of the aims will be focused on estimation – standard deviations of 
MRS estimates and initial examinations of the changes in measures over time. With 20/group and repeated measures, we will be able to fit repeated measures models (e.g., mixed effects 
“trajectories”). For MRS with only a pre -post assessment, the mixed model framework is 
essentially a two -sample t -test on the changes over time, but importantly, the modeling framework 
will allow inclusion of all available data. This is to provide the most degrees of freedom to estimate the residual error, which will be used to plan a definitive study should these results appear promising (biological engagement as quantified by [CONTACT_343133], change in insulin sensitivity, etc.) Supporting these analyses will be standard descriptive and graphical summaries of the data.    
 Sample size justification. This is a developmental grant, so the sample size is not justified based 
on power for any of the particular aims. Rather, the estimate is based on precision and reliable estimates of the imaging studies. In particular, for the fMRI study Thirion et al (1) found that 20 to 
25 subjects were necessary to achieve reliable results. Given we want to study 20 within -group 
metformin subjects with fMRI , balancing the randomization 1:[ADDRESS_424870] sizes for between group differences are unknown; however, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of at least 0.9 SD difference between the groups at alpha=0.05 (two-sided).  
 MR Data Acquisition : As the effects of metformin on the human brain are not known, a multi -
parametric imaging approach will be used to probe different aspects of the CNS.  Imaging will be performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra equipped with a 32- channel head coil and the multi -
nuclear option (MNO) running VE11C software. Imaging sequences include the following: To 
measure structural information:  A sagittal 3D MPRAGE sequence with 0.7mm isotropic voxels (TR=2400, TE=2.57, TI=1100, FA=8) will be used to acquire high- resolution structural data for 
volumetric analysis of brain region changes related to metformin.  The higher resolution allows for less variable segmentation and parcellation resulting in more accurate volumetric measurements. To measure white matter information: An axial 2D symmetric multi -slice (SMS) 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence with 60 diffusion directions, 5 B0 acquisitions and 2mm isotropic voxels (TR=3000, TE=73, FA=90, ETL 43, both A -P and P -A phase encoding for B0 
images) will be u sed to acquire white matter integrity data related to metformin.  To measure 
global brain blood flow information: An axial 3D pseudo- continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) 
sequence (WIP 818) with 4mm isotropic voxels (TI1=1800, TI2=3600, iPat ≤ 2) will  be used to 
acquire quantitative blood flow measurements (flow in ml/100g/min) throughout the brain.  A post -
label delay of 1800 ms will be used (2) as we are imaging otherwise healthy subjects. To measure 
global brain functional network information: An axial 2D echo- planar imaging sequence with 3mm 
isotropic voxels (FA=90, TE=30, TR=2000, # slices=50) will be used to acquire resting state functional MRI data throughout the brain. To measure brain lactate: A single voxel point -resolved 
MR spectroscopy sequence (PRESS, 2 cm isotropic voxel, TE=30, TR=2000, 5000 Hz, 2048 points, 128 acquisitions with water suppression and 16 acquisitions without water suppression) will be used to acquire metabolite information from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, chosen due to the high number of insulin receptors in this region (3).  As metformin has been 
shown to alter mitochondrial function in other organs, we will measure lactate in study participants to determine if they have significant anaerobic metabolism. To measure brain ATP levels: Multivoxel chemical shift imaging (dual -tuned proton (Helmholtz pair)/phosphorus (loop) flex coil 
applied such that the phosphorus loop overlies the right DLPFC, WIP 1071, axial 1.5 cm slice prescribed to encompass the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 12x12 matrix reconstructed to 16x16 matr ix, 1.5 cm nominal isotropic voxels, TR=1500) will be used to acquire phosphorus 
metabolite information from the right DLPFC.  B1 in homogeneities will be corrected using a 
second high- speed acquisition (4) . We may be able to detect changes in ATP levels in metformin 
subjects due to less efficient ATP production.  
MR Data Analysis : Brain volumetrics: MPRAGE data will be analyzed using Freesurfer 6.0 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard/edu). Briefly, MPRAGE images are converted to a NIFTI volume 
using mri_convert, then processed using recon_all with manual inspection of data between each 
recon step.  Cortical and subcortical parcellation ( 5;6) is then performed using the freesurfer 
DKT40 classifier atlas (reportedly more accurate than the Desikan -Killiany atlas)  (7) using 
mris_ca_label. Volumetric data from each brain region will be compared by [CONTACT_19313] (metformin vs. control) and across time (timepoint A and B).  As an exploratory analysis, we may also perform hippocampal subfield parcellation (8) , and see how the longitudinal processing stream compares 
to conventional two- timepoint  analysis (Reuter et al 2012). DTI analysis: DTI data will be 
processed using dt  recon with eddy current and motion correction. MPRAGE structural data will 
then be resampled into DTI space mri_vol2vol, and various DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), trace, radial diffusivity (RD) and axial dif fusivity (AD) 
tabulated for each cortical, subcortical and white matter region using mri_segstats. ASL analysis: CBF maps will be calculated per the method of Wang et al (9).  CBF data will then be converted 
into a volume, then co- registered to the MPRAGE data using bbregister.  Parcellation masks will 
then be used to calculate the average CBF in each region. rsFMR analysis: rsFMRI data will be denoised by a well- established preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] ( 10;11) , and registered to the MPRAGE 
structural data to get functional connectivity matrices across cortical and subcortical parcellations from FreeSurfer. Individual connectivity matrices for whole subjects will be used for the group comparison between placebo and drug- dose groups, and also for canonical correlation analysis 
between connectivity strength and clinical outcomes (behavioral scores) (12). Proton MRS 
analysis: single voxel proton MRS data will be processed using LCModel 6.3 -1L (13). Phosphorus 
MRSI analysis: multivoxel phosphorus MRSI data will be reconstructed and quantified using jMRUI 6.0 ( http://www.jmrui.eu ). For the primary and calibration acquisitions, a simulated 7 
metabolite basis set (PME, Pi, PDE, PCr, γ -ATP, α -ATP, β -ATP) will be fit to data following zero - 
and first -order phasing, and 8 Hz spectral apodization. Data will then be corrected for B1 
inhomogeneity per the method of Chmelik (14) . Metabolite data from the voxels incorporating the 
right DLPFC will be averaged and used in the statistical analysis.  
 
Cognitive function : We will use the computerized NIH toolbox to measure cognitive outcomes. 
The NIH encourages the use of these tools to enhance collection of data in large studies and for 
clinical trials  (15) . The cognitive and behavioral tests were normed across a national sample of 
persons aged 3- [ADDRESS_424871] 
shown that residents within Olmsted County, MN prefer the iPad over a personal computer  (16).  
[CONTACT_343170] will oversee this aspect of the proposal.  She is an expert in cognitive function and was 
a member of the NIH task force on computerized cognitive batteries.   
Cognitive Outcomes. The NIH Toolbox -Cognition Battery is composed of 7 tests (~30 minutes) 
including the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) Test (executive function), the Flanker 
Inhibitory Control Test (executive function), the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17121] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]), the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] (vocabulary), the Oral Reading Recognition Test (reading), the List Sorting Working Memory Test (working memory), and the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (processing speed).  For each test, the raw scores will be converted to normally distributed standard scores (scaled scores) having a mean of [ADDRESS_424872] deviation of 3.  To reduce the number of outcomes, our primary outcomes will focus on the following three 
composite scores:  Crystalized Cognition Composite (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343107]), Fluid Cognition Composite (DCCS, Flanker test, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17121], List Sorting Working Memory, and Pattern Comparison Processing Speed), and the Total Cognitio n Composite score. Both th e individual tests and composite outcomes have been found 
to have good convergent and discriminant validity and test -retest reliability (17-19).  
 Interpretation : In this double- blind  placebo- controlled study all data interpretation will be 
performed at the end of the study and the un-blinding will be done by [CONTACT_30165] . Statistical 
plan is as outlined above. We  will make conclusions on whether our hypotheses are proved or 
disproved based on statistical significance (P<0.05) of the outcomes that are outlined under MR 
data analysis and cognitive functions. If the observed data reaches  statistical significance for one 
or more outcomes our outlined hypotheses will be proven. However, if  the significance level does 
not reach statistical significance but shows promising results, that will offer opportunities for a 
larger study with more participants and perhaps longer duration.  
 
Limitations : We appreciate that this exploratory (R21) study plan is without having sufficient  
preliminary data to determine the optimum study duration and the number of participants required to prove or disprove our hypotheses  definitively . The primary objective of this type of grant is to 
obtain robust preliminary data for larger more definitive clinical trials. However, the robust study design,  reasonable stud ies duration ( e.g. a preliminary report of 8 weeks administration of 
metformin report ed cognitive improvements (20) may help to overcome the limitation . The 
objective of acquiring robust preliminary data to determine whether metformin has any definitive or potential benefit is likely accomplished  from the current study proposal.  Although it has been 
shown that  brain protein synthesis is low at 0.6%/h and half -life is 10 days (21), and may vary in 
different regions ,  a [ADDRESS_424873]  insulin resistance. Eventually the 
goal is to combine metformin with other lifestyle  measures such as exercise program.

• Lastly, you will have a PET scan done on your brain. Before beginning, we will check 
your blood glucose levels by [CONTACT_7087] a finger stick. The PET scan is done with a very small amount of a radioactive form of sugar, call ed 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG. A small 
catheter will be placed in your arm to inject this compound. Once this is injected you will sit for 30 minutes before the pi[INVESTIGATOR_343110].  You will be placed on a scanner bed  for 10 minutes while the scans are completed. 
Afterwards you will be asked to drink fluids and go to the bathroom. This will take about 
1 hour. 
• Arrive at the CRTU on Charlton 07. 
• A small blood sample will be taken.  
• Vitamin B12 levels will be assessed . 
• You will then be given a meal and allowed to leave after the visit is completed   
• This visit will take approximately 3-[ADDRESS_424881] overnight stay:  
• You will be given a standardized meal at 6:00 pm.  
• We will then ask you to perform approximately 1 hour of cognitive testing. These tests check your memory, thinking speed and other aspects of your thinking.  
• You will be asked to fast and take nothing by [CONTACT_343144] [ADDRESS_424882] nothing at all by [CONTACT_343145] 6 
1/2 hours of this study day.  
• Your resting energy expenditure (REE) will also be measured by [CONTACT_343146]. We will measure how much energy your body uses at rest 
by [CONTACT_1299] a special plastic dome over your head and having you rest quietly for [ADDRESS_424883] calorimetry (REE) will be done at the beginning of 
the clamp and a second indirect calorimetry (REE) will be done during the second phase of the clamp . 
• We will be placing a special kind of “backward” intravenous catheter into your hand and then placing that hand into a “hot box.”  This special kind of IV is the easiest way for us to get samples of blood during the study. The “hot box” is a transparent plastic box that is 
heated with a small  motor to  50 degrees Celsius ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit). We will be 
taking frequent samples of blood throughout the study. The total amount of blood taken during study (including blood taken during the medical evaluation and all stays on the CRT U) will be about one pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731] (about as much as a standard blood donation).  
• At approximately 4 a.m. w e will be placing intravenous (IV) needles to give you insulin 
and somatostatin. When these IV fluids are prepared, a small  amount of albumin, a 
protein common in our bodies, is used. Both insulin and somatostatin are hormones that are normally present in your body. The somatostatin used in this study is considered

Name [CONTACT_343162]. It has not been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for 
routine clinical use. However, the FDA has allowed the use of somatostatin in this research study . Giving you insulin  and somatostatin into your veins is called an “insulin 
clamp.”  
• Urine will be collected prior to starting the in sulin clamp until the end of the clamp. A 
stool sample will be collected at this visit. If you are unable to provide a stool sample at this time, a kit will be provided with instructions on how to perform the collection at home, and how to return the kit to the study team. 
• You will also receive IV glucose. Glucose is produced in your body mainly by [CONTACT_4852]. By [CONTACT_343147], we will be able to measure how much glucose you produce. 
• When  the intravenous lines are started, you will also receive a small amount of IV fluid 
that contains sodium chloride.  
• All infusions will be stopped by 1:30 pm and a meal will be provided for you by [CONTACT_343148].

• After the first mus cle biopsy, we will give you a milk shake to drink, and we will take 
small blood samples for the next 2 hours to see how your body processes the protein, 
sugar, and fat. We will ask you to complete the entire milk shake within 15 minutes. 
• After the second biopsy, you will be given a standardized meal and allowed to leave by 11:00am. This visit will take approximately 5 hours. 
• After completion of this visit you will pi[INVESTIGATOR_343112]’s study medication from 
the Research Pharmacy and begin taking the c apsules as instructed.  
 We will assign you by [CONTACT_3364] (like a coin toss) to the metformin  group or the placebo group. 
You and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_343113]. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to the metformin  group.  
 Placebo and Metformin This study uses a placebo.  A placebo looks exactly like the study drug, but it contains no active 
ingredient.  We use placebos in research studies to learn if the effects seen in research participants  
are truly from the study drug. You will be asked to swallow [ADDRESS_424886] month’s supply of capsules upon 
discharge from the CRTU (Clinical Research and Trials Unit) at the end of your basel ine studies. 
Once a month thereafter, you will be asked to report to the CRTU to pi[INVESTIGATOR_343114]. At this time, you will be asked to return any capsules that you did not consume d uring 
the previous month. You will also have a brief appointment where a small amount of blood will be taken to measure markers of renal and liver function. These measurements are done to make sure it is safe for you to continue with the study.  
 You will then report to the CRTU monthly for the [ADDRESS_424887] report to the CRTU fasting (nothing to eat or drink after 7 pm) for a weight check, blood test, and to pi[INVESTIGATOR_343115]. You will be asked to return any unused capsules at this time as well . Your vitamin B12 levels will be checked pre -intervention, during 
the, 1, 3, [ADDRESS_424888] 2 months to ensure compliance. After 40 weeks of taking  metformin or placebo you will 
return  to the CRT U to repeat the 1 inpatient and 3 outpatient visits  as listed above. All 
procedures will be the same.

6. What are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this research 
study?  
 
 Metformin may cause nausea or diarrhea. Metformin has been shown to cause lactic acidosis in patients with impaired liver, renal or heart function. Although these side -effects are rare, we will 
perform routine blood tests to make sure it is safe for you to  be in the study. As with any 
medication, allergic reactions are a possibility.  
 If you have recently had (<6 weeks) or are planning to have medical imaging performed on your body that requires contrast agents ( i.e., dye) to be consumed please inform the investigators.  
 You will receive the following drug and hormones during the study: Lidocaine, insulin, somatostatin, and labeled  glucose. Infusion of insulin may decrease blood glucose (sugar) levels. 
Low blood sugar levels can cause you to fee l sweaty, sh aky, dizzy,  or weak. Changes in blood 
glucose will be managed by [CONTACT_343150] [ADDRESS_424889] given into the skin.  This stinging is 
lessened by [CONTACT_343151]. As with any medication, allergic rea ctions are 
a possibility. In addition to the IV fluids containing medications, you will receive fluids that contain sodium chloride (salt).  This fluid helps keep the veins open if the other fluids are not 
running and helps make the sugar water less irritat ing to your vein. 
 You will have blood tests, body measurements, and blood pressure measurements that could uncover a condition you did not know you had. This can be stressful.  We will fully explain any 
results that are not normal.

 The “hot box” may cause mild discomfort an d reddening of your skin. This will go away when 
your hand is taken out of the “hot box.”  
We will be collecting urine  and stool samples during your stay in the Clinical Research Unit. We 
will need to ask you to use a urinal or bedside commode. This may be embarrassing. We will 
provide privacy to minimize any embarrassment.  
 A DEXA scan uses X -rays to measure body composition or bone density. You will be exposed to 
radiation during the DEXA scan. The amount of radiation you will receive  has a low risk of 
harmful effects.  
 The treadmill exercise test may be uncomfortable becau se of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_343116]. 
Breathing through the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_343117]. We will be asking you to exercise as long as possible. Your heart rate and blood pressure will be watched  
closely, and the test can be stopped at any time. 
 Participating in unaccustomed resistance exercise may include risk of injury. To reduce this risk, the exercise will be performed under the supervision of qualified study team member, which will also decrease the likelihood of inju ry. 
 There is a risk of claustrophobia (fear of closed space) while you are in the transparent plastic  
hood during the indirect calorimetry (REE). Fresh air does come through the hood. This risk will be decreased by [CONTACT_343152] a movie while the hood is on. If you are unable to tolerate the hood, it will be removed.  Side affects you  may experience from the muscle biopsy include bleeding, collection of blood 
under the skin, bruising or infection. By [CONTACT_343153], bleeding and bruising are usually avoided. Strict sterile precautions will be taken to avoid infection. Pain is unlikely since a local anesthetic is used. However, you may experience a deep pressure feeling at

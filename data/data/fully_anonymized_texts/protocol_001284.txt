Title of Study: 
Prospective, open- label, uncontrolled, Phase III study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Octafibrin for on- demand treatment of acute bleeding and to prevent bleeding during and 
after surgery in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency  
Indication: Congenital fibrinogen deficiency  
Number of Study Centres: Approximately 15 study centres worldwide.  
Study Duration: 4th quarter 2014 to 4th quarter 2019 Development Phase: III  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibrin for on -demand treatment of acute bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (spontaneous or after  trauma).  
Secondary:  
• To show an association between the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
and the surrogate endpoint ‘clot s trength’ or ‘clot firmness’ (referred to as ‘maximum 
clot firmness’ [MCF] in this protocol) that was used as a surrogate endpoint for haemostatic efficacy and determined via thromboelastography (TEG) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_658715] (PK) study FORMA -01. Ther efore, MCF as surrogate efficacy 
parameter will be determined before first infusion and [ADDRESS_888672] infusion.  
• To achieve a peak target plasma fibrinogen level of 100 mg/dL in minor bleeds  and 
150 mg/dL for major bleeds [ADDRESS_888673]-infusion.  
• To determine the response to Octafibrin based on incremental in vivo recovery (IVR).  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibri n in preventing bleeding during and after 
surgery.  
• To assess the safety of Octafibrin in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, 
including immunogenicity, thromboembolic complications, and early signs of allergic  or 
hypersensitivity reactions.

31-Oct-[ADDRESS_888680], Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
In this study, Octafibrin will be administered as intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection. 
Continuous infusion is not allowed. 
 
Octafibrin Dose Calculation  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the type of bleeding or surgery (minor or major). The dose will be 
calculated individually as follows : 
*The median response in this dose calculation formula is the median incremental in vivo recovery reported in the 
interim analysis of study FORMA -01. 
**The measured level for the first infusion will be the historical level for that patient after a washout or, if below 
the limit of detection of the local assay, zero (0) will be  used.  
 
Dosing for On -Demand Treatment of  Bleeding  
For each bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658718], each subject will receive at 
least 1 infusion of Octafibrin for the treatment of a major or minor acute bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658719] 1. 
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or major).  
• Minor bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommen ded target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Major bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL. 
On subsequent study days, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor bleeding will be observed for at least 3  days.  
• Major bleeding will be observed for at least 7  days. 
Addition al Octafibrin infusions, as required  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of 
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.

Definition of minor and major bleeding  
• Minor bleeding events are defined as mild haemarthrosis or superficial muscle, soft 
tissue, and oral  bleeding.  
• Major bleeding events are defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, 
such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial bleeding, or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome, or bleeding causing a decrease in haemoglobin level by 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or  more.  
Characterisation of any other bleeding events not within these categories will be discussed individually with the investigator.  
 
Dosing for Surgery 
For each surgery that is treated as part of the study, within [ADDRESS_888682] will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin.  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the surgery type (minor or major).  
• Patients undergoing minor surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80  mg/dL.  
• Patients undergoing major surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL.  
On each post -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be  measured daily to determine 
whether maintenance infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor surgery will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_888683] -operative  days. 
• Major surgery will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_888684] -operative  days. 
Maintenance infusions, as required:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of 
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor surgery, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual  fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target  level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.

(i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion” assessments should be  performed.  
 
All study days after Day 1 (treatment observation period)  
Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the 
event and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] .

by [CONTACT_166551] /her judgement of the subject’s  condition.  
On subsequent study days (at least 3 days for minor bleeding or 7 days for major bleeding), fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed. 
 
Daily assessments (for at least 3 days for minor bleeding or 7 days for major bleeding)  
• Blood draw for:  
− fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity): Based 
on local lab results, the investigator will determine whether addition al infusions of 
Octafibrin are  needed.  
− safety lab  (local –haematology)  
− retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
Octafibrin infusion, as required  
After these daily assessments, dosing should occur as required depending on the actual and target plasma level and based on the following criteria:  
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is below the accepted lower limit of the target 
fibrinogen plasma leve l (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding), 
the subject should receive another infusion of  Octafibrin . 
• If the fibrinogen plasma level is greater than or equal to the accepted lower limit of the 
target fibrinogen plasma level, Octafibrin should not be administered on that  day.

ASSESSMENTS IN SUBJECTS UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROPHYLAXIS  
In the case of a surgical procedure, Octafibrin will be given prior to surgery as well as 
during and after surgery based on the physician’s judgement, the patient’s history, and the sever ity of the procedure. Subjects enrolled for elective surgery will be treated (as required) 
and assessed throughout the surgical observation period.  
The surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered prior 
to elective surg ery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at least       
[ADDRESS_888708]. 
NOTE: All adverse ev ents (AEs), including thromboembolic events and early signs of

Study Completion Visit 
At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion 
Visit, during which the following assessments will be performed:  
• Blood draw for retention serum samples for potential viral testing.  
• Physical  examination.  
After the Study Completion Visit, the clinical study is considered completed for the subject.  
If the subject has not been treated for bleeding or surgery, subject will be notified that the study has ended and will be considered a ‘no treatment’ patient and report ed separately. No 
further assessments will need to be performed.  
 
Statistical analysis:  
Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum, and number of observations and missing observations). Categorical variables will be summarised with counts and percentages.  
Efficacy analysis  
 
Primary endpoint  
For bleeding efficacy, the primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of the haemo-  
static efficacy of Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658730]. The first bleeding ep isode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion 
until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation 
period, whichever comes  last. 
For the statistical analysis, the assessment made by [CONTACT_658773] 4- point rating 
scale will be transformed to a dichotomous endpoint with success defined as a rating of excellent or good. The success rate will be calculated as the proportion of patients with success, and the two -sided 90% Blyth- Still-Casella conf idence interval (CI) will be 
calculated. By [CONTACT_658774] a predefined threshold of 0.7, the hypothesis that the success rate is greater than 0.7 will be tested (H
0: p 
≤ 0.7 / H A: p > 0.7). The final efficacy assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_658775] & Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC).

addition, a correlation analysis between MCF and the haemostatic efficacy assessment will be performed.  
 
Octafibrin use  
The dose of the IMP used per day and in total will be summarised using descriptive statistics for minor and major blee ding events. Frequency of infusions and duration of 
treatment will also be  summarised.  
 
In-vivo recovery (IVR)  
Response and classical IVR will be calculated for each infusion of each subject. Descriptive tables will show the distributions of the 2 parameters per infusion day separated for minor and major bleeding events. An exploratory analysis using a repeated -measures analysis of 
covariance model will analyse whether the response/classical IVR changed over time, with dose associated with respective IVR as covariate in model.

1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
Human fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein synthesised in the liver, and it circulates in the 
plasma at a concentration of 2.9 –4.5 g/L. In healthy human adults, about 2–5 g of fibrinogen 
is synthesised daily, and the same amount is catabolised [1, 2]. Fibri nogen is essential for 
haemostasis, wound healing, fibrinolysis, inflammation, angiogenesis, cellular and matrix interactions, and neoplasia. These processes involve the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, 
and often the interaction of fibrinogen with var ious proteins and cells. The plasma half -life of 
fibrinogen, under normal physiological conditions, has been estimated to be 3–5 days [3, 4]. 
The plasma level of clottable fibrinogen may be markedly decreased or even undetectable in 
various congenital or a cquired conditions [5, 6]. Conditions of congenital fibrinogen 
deficiency include:  
• Afibrinogenaemia: Complete absence or extremely low levels of plasma  fibrinogen.  
• Hypofibrinogenaemia: Reduced concentration of plasma fibrinogen. 
• Dysfibrinogenaemia: Presence of abnormal or dysfunctional fibrinogen molecules.  
Congenital afibrinogenaemia is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder occurring in homozygotic patients with an estimated incidence of 1 in 10
6 in the European population [7]. 
The disease is characterised by a complete lack of coagulable and/or immunologically determinable fibrinogen in the plasma. Patients present with frequent severe bleeding  epi[INVESTIGATOR_658732] [8, 9]. Bleeding may occur after a minor trauma or a 
small surgi cal intervention, into the skin, mucosa, muscles, gastrointestinal tract, or the  brain.  
Congenital hypofibrinogenaemia is more common than afibrinogenaemia and is characterised 
by [CONTACT_658777]. Clinical symptoms of hypofibrinogenaemia are usually milder compared to afibrinogenaemia, and the condition is frequently combined 
with a dysfibrinogenaemia that is characterised by [CONTACT_658778]. Several 
missense mutations in the [ADDRESS_888741] bleeding in patients with these fibrinogen deficiencies [5, 7, 9, 10, 11]. 
 
1.2 Octafibrin  
Octafibrin is a highly purified, lyophilised, human plasma fibrinogen concentrate, without 
added albumins. Octafibrin is double vi rus inactivated using 2 dedicated virus inactiva - 
tion/removal steps, i.e., solvent/detergent treatment and nanofiltration.  
Solvent/detergent treatment mode of action causes enveloped viruses to be irreversibly destroyed. These include the most transfusion- relevant viruses, such as human 
immunodeficiency virus types l and 2 (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] -1, HIV -2), 
hepatit is B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), but also many other adventitious agents, 
e.g., newly emerging viruses that are enveloped, such as West Nile virus (WNV). 
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888742]-2014  
Page 8  
  
 
The Planova 20N filter was specifically developed by [CONTACT_658779]. to remove 
infectious agents from protein solutions on the basis of their size. Thus, this nanofiltration  
step is in principle effective for removing even very small enveloped and non- enveloped 
viruses. Nanofiltration may be the only method to dat e permitting efficient removal of 
enveloped and non- enveloped viruses under conditions where 90- 95% of protein activity is 
recovered  [12].  
 
1.3 Rationale for Conducting the  Study  
It is estimated that there are 500 to 1000 patients with congenital fibrinogen de ficiency in the 
European Union (EU). Historically, the principal source for the treatment of congenital fibrinogen deficiency has been cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] [7]. Plasma -derived and viral -inactivated 
fibrinogen concentrates are proven to be safer and more specifi c in the treatment of congenital 
fibrinogen deficiency compared to cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]  [13].  
The introduction of Octafibrin will present an additional and safe option, providing more 
choices of supply for the benefit of the medical community and patients affected by [CONTACT_658780].  
This phase III study is designed as a multinational, multi -centre, prospective,  open -label, 
uncontrolled study to assess the efficacy and safety of Octafibrin for on- demand treatment of 
acute bleeding in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency. 
As there are currently no guidelines concerning fibrinogen concentrates in either t he United 
States (US) or the EU, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_658733] (EMA) Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma - 
Derived Factor IX Products (CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009) [14] and discussions with the Paul Ehrlich Institute and the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the EMA.  
 
1.4 Dose Rationale  
The dose rationale is based on published data from a questionnaire survey based upon the data obtained in 100 a - or hypofibrinogenaemic patients [15]. Based on this representative sample 
(53 males and 47 females with median fibrinogen plasma level of 6 mg dL
-1), the peak 
fibrinogen plasma level most often recommended for on -demand treatment of minor bleeding 
was approximately 100 mg/dL, but the target level for m ajor epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], such as central nervous 
system bleeding, was higher (150 mg/dL). Minor epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], like epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], gum bleeding, menorrhagia, were usually treated with target peaks of 50 to 70 mg/dL. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 2 weeks for major events, from 1 to 7 days for minor events. Minor surgeries were treated for up to 7 days with a target fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL. Major surgeries were treated for 4 to 14 days with a target fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL.  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888743] a very good overall safety profile.  
Provided that the pharmacokinetic (PK) values are in the same range as for the already 
licensed fibrinogen concentrate, Octafibrin is expected to be efficacious in the treatment of 
congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
As known for other fibrinogen plasma -derived concentrat es, the following adverse reactions 
may occur with the use of Octafibrin : 
1. Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions.  
Observed symptoms may include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and hypotension. These reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis, 
including shock. 
2. Thromboembolic  events.  
Such events have been reported in patients treated with plasma -derived fibrinogen 
concentrates. Thus, patients receiving Octafibrin should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of thrombosis.  
3. Infections caused by [CONTACT_658781]. Standard measures to prevent these infections include the selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclus ion 
of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are considered 
effective for enveloped viruses, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV, and for the non- enveloped 
hepatitis A virus (HAV). The measures taken may be of limited value against  non- 
enveloped viruses, such as parvovirus  B19. 
In conclusion, there is no reason to believe that participation in this study presents the subjects with any greater risk of viral transmission or thrombosis than treatment with currently marketed products. The manufacturing process of Octafibrin , which includes 2 viral 
inactivation steps with different chemical/physical action principles, represents a high 
standard for plasma -derived concentrates in terms of viral  safety.

2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibrin for on -demand treatment of 
acute bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (spontaneous or after trauma).  
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To show an association between the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
and the surrogate endpoint ‘clot strength’ or ‘clot firmness’ (referred to as ‘maximum 
clot firmness’ [MCF] in this protocol) that was used as a surrogate endpoint for 
haemostatic efficacy and determined via thromboelastography (TEG) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_658734] -01. Therefore, MCF as surrogate efficacy parameter will be determined 
before first infusion and [ADDRESS_888745] infusion. 
• To achieve a peak target plasma fibrinogen level of 100 mg/dL in minor bleeds and   150 mg/dL for major bleeds [ADDRESS_888746]-infusion.  
• To determine the response to Octafibrin based on incremental in vivo recovery (IVR).  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafib rin in preventing bleeding during and after 
surgery.  
• To assess the safety of Octafibrin in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, 
including immunogenicity, thromboembolic complications, and early signs of allergic 
or hypersensitivity  reactions.  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888747] Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) 
after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last.  
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding will be 
based on a 4- point haemostatic efficacy scale as described in Section 7.2.1. The final efficacy 
assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_658782] & 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC).  
In the final analysis, the number of subjects per outcome category will be assessed.  
 
3.1.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• MCF assessment before first infusion and [ADDRESS_888748] infusion of 
each documented bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• Fibrinogen plasma level before and 1 hour after the end of each subsequent infusion as well as at the  time  of the  overall  clinical  assessment  of  haemostatic efficacy (i.e.,  
[ADDRESS_888749] infusion of each documented bleeding  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]).  
• Resp onse as indicated by [CONTACT_658766], calculated as the maximum increase in 
plasma fibrinogen (Clauss data) between pre- infusion and [ADDRESS_888750] -infusion 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in all bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658735]’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding based on 
a 4-point haemostatic efficacy  scale.  
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in preventing bleeding during and after surgery as assessed at the 
end of surgery by [CONTACT_301292] -operatively by [CONTACT_658783] 4-  
point haemostatic efficacy scales (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). An overall efficacy assessment 
taking both the intra- and post -operative assessment into account will be adjudicated by 
[CONTACT_658768]. The surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will l ast at least [ADDRESS_888751]-2014  
Page 12  
  
 
The safety endpoints are:  
• Vital signs.  
• Physical  examination.  
• Routine clinical laboratory assessment, including coagulation  parameters.  
• Adverse events (AEs), including thromboembolic complications and early signs of 
allergic o r hypersensitivity  reactions.  
• Immunogenicity testing at Day [ADDRESS_888752] 4 subjects aged between 12 and 18 years (only 18 and above in Russia). This will also include at least 4 surgeries, 2 of which should be performed in subjects aged between 12 and 18 years (only 18 and above in Russia). The study will be conducted in approximately [ADDRESS_888753] (IMP) whenever 
possible. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658736], the subject may receive a different licensed fibrinogen concentrate (e.g., 
Haemocomplettan P
®/RiaSTAP™) or whatever the investigator considers standard of care. 
The use of another licensed fibrinogen concentrate is also permitted in emergency situations, e.g., if the IMP is not available for the patient in  time.  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888754] dose of Octafibrin administered for on -demand treatment of an 
acute bleeding ep isode (Day 1) and will be followed for up to Day 30. 
Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the event 
and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
On each day of the treatment observation period (i.e., 3 days for minor and 7 days for major 
bleeding), fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen plasma 
level measured on these days is  below  the  accepted  lower  limit  of  the  target  level  
(80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major  bleeding).  
• If the actual  fibrinogen plasma level  is above  the accepted  lower  limit  of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
The actual treatment duration will be determined by [CONTACT_166551]/her 
judgement of the subject’s condition.  
All adverse events (AEs), including thromboembolic events and early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, occurring between the start of the first Octafibrin infusion and the 
end of each 30- day observation and follow -up period will be recorded. Concomitant 
medications will also be recorded throughout each 30- day observation and follow -up period.  
All SAEs occurring after the first IMP infusion will be documented and reported for a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in t he study or as required to meet local 
regulations. Also, any concomitant medications used to treat an SAE will be recorded.  
At the end of the study (i.e., when the 24th patient has had at least one treated bleeding epi - 
sode), all patients will be asked to  return for a Study Completion Visit.  
 
3.2.2 Surgical  Prophylaxis  
Subjects planning to undergo elective surgery may also be enrolled in the study.  
Within 3 hours prior to surgery, each patient will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin to 
achieve a recommended fibrinogen plasma level of  100  mg/dL  for  minor  surgeries  and 150 mg/dL for major  surgeries.  
Each subject’s surgical observation perio d starts with the first dose of Octafibrin 
administered prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at least [ADDRESS_888755] -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily (i.e., at least [ADDRESS_888756] -operative days for major surgeries) to determine 
whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed. 
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen plasma 
level measured on subsequent days is below the accepted lower limit of the target level 
(80 mg/dL for minor surgeries, 130 mg/dL for major  surgery).  
• If the fibrinogen plasma level is greater than or equal to the accepted lower limit of the target fibrinogen plasma level, Octafibrin should not be  administered.  
The actual treatment duration will be determined by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator based on his/her judge - 
ment of the subject’s condition.  
All AEs, including thromboembolic events and early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity 
reactions, occurring between first infusion of IMP before the start of surgery and the Last 
Post-Operative Day will be recorded.  
All SAEs occurring after the first IMP infusion will be documented and reported for a patient 
throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study or as required to meet local regulations. Also, any concomitant  medications used to treat an SAE will be recorded.  
At the end of the study (i.e., when the 24th patient has had at least one treated bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), all patients will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit.  
 
3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choi ce of Control  Group(s) 
As there are currently no guidelines concerning fibrinogen concentrates in either the US or the EU, the study was designed following established programs for Factor IX concentrates. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the clinical evaluation of a new concentrate initially examines  the IVR and the PK 
properties of the principal active factor. Prior to initiating the present study, comparative PK 
data have been obtained in study FORMA -01. 
The open- label uncontrolled design and choice of study objectives are motivated by 
[CONTACT_658784] [14] and discussions with the regulatory  bodies.  
The median response value used in the fibrinogen dosage calculation is the median incremental in vivo recovery reported in the interim analysis of study FORMA -01. 
Although all bleedi ng epi[INVESTIGATOR_658737], only the first bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658738] (see Section 3.1.1). This is because the study will end once the 24th enroll ed 
patient has at least one documented bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], potentially resulting in a large diversity 
in the number of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658739]. The entirety of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658740] a secondary endpoint (see  Section 3.1.2).

Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recomm ended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or  major).  
• Minor bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Major bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL. 
 
On subsequent study days, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusio ns of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor bleeding will be observed for at least 3  days.  
• Major bleeding will be observed for at least 7  days. 
Additional Octafibrin infusions, as required  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibr inogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of the target level (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
Definition of minor and major bleeding  
• Minor bleeding events are defined as mild haemarthrosis or superficial muscle, soft 
tissue, and oral  bleeding.  
• Major bleeding events are defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, 
such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial bleeding, or intramuscular bleeding with compa rtment syndrome, or bleeding causing a 
decrease in haemoglobin level by 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or  more.  
Characterisation of any other bleeding events not within these categories will be discussed individually with the investigator.

5.4.3 Dosing  for Surgery  
For each surgery that is treated as part of the study, within 3 hours prior to surgery, subjects 
will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin . 
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the surgery type (minor or  major).  
• Patients undergoing minor surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Patients undergoing major surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an acce pted lower limit of 130  mg/dL.  
On each post -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine 
whether maintenance infusions of Octafibrin are needed.  
• Minor surgery will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_888769] -operative  days. 
• Major surgery  will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_888770] -operative  days. 
Maintenance infusions, as required:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of  
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor surgery, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
Definition of minor and major surgery  
Surgeries are defined as major , if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Requiring general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_301252].  
• Requiring opening into the great body cavities.  
• In the course of which hazards of severe haemorrhage is  possible.  
• Requiring haemostatic therapy for at least 6  days. 
• Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder).  
• 3rd molar extraction or extraction of > 3 teeth.  
• Surgeries/conditions in which the subject's life is at stake.

5.5 Preparation and Method of  Administration  
 
5.5.1 Preparation  
Each vial of Octafibrin will be reconstituted with 50 mL WFI. The solvent (i.e., WFI) and the 
concentrate in the closed vials must be warmed up to room temperature. Room temperature 
must be maintained during reconstitution. Octafibrin dissolves at room temperature to an 
almost co lourless and slightly opalescent solution within 30 minutes. If the solution is cloudy 
or contains particulates, it should not be used. The solution should not be frozen.  
Octafibrin should be administered immediately after  reconstitution at a  rate not ex ceeding    
5 mL per minute. Octafibrin should not be mixed with other medicinal products or 
intravenous  solutions.  
 
5.5.2 Method of Administration  
Octafibrin will be administered as intravenous (i.v.) infusion.  
NOTE: In this study, only bolus injections of Octaf ibrin are permitted. Continuous infusion 
is not allowed.

The Last Post -Operative Day is either post- operative day [ADDRESS_888792] -operative day (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In addition, the following assessments will be performed on the Last Post -Operative Day:  
• post-operative efficacy assessment by [CONTACT_658772] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• brief narrative describing the details of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (start and end date, details of the 
procedure), follow -up, outcome, and efficacy of the  intervention. 
 
The assessments performed on the Last Post -Operative Day conclude the surgical observation 
period. No further study -related assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns (e.g., 
ongoing AEs) require follow -up. 
 
Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. When the study is closed, all s ubjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion 
Visit as summarised in Section 6.1.4.  
 
6.1.4 Study Completion  Visit  
At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit, during which the following assessments  will be performed:  
• Blood draw for retention serum samples for potential viral testing.  
• Physical  examination.  
After the Study Completion Visit, the clinical study is considered completed for the subject.  
If the subject has not been treated for bleeding or surgery, the subject will be notified that the 
study has ended and will be considered a ‘no treatment’ patient and reported separately. No 
further assessments need to be performed.

6.2.3 Premature Termination of the  Study  
Both the investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. 
Should this be necessary, the procedures will be arranged on an individual study ba sis after 
review and consultation by [CONTACT_49249]. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.  
Furthermore, the investigator should promptly infor m the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) and provide a detailed written explanation. The pertinent regulatory authorities should be informed according to national regulations.  
Early termination of the study as a whole or ce ntre-wise may apply for the following reasons:  
• Clinical Study: At any time the study as a whole may be terminated prematurely if new 
toxicological or pharmacological findings or serious adverse events (SAEs) invalidate the earlier positive benefit -risk-assessment.  
• Study Centre: At any time the study may be terminated at an individual study centre  if: 
− The centre cannot comply with the requirements of the  protocol. 
− The centre cannot comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.  
− The required recruitment rate is not met. 
Should the study be prematurely terminated, al l study materials (completed, partially 
completed, and blank CRFs, IMPs etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor.

7 ASSESSMENTS AND  METHODS  
 
7.1 Background and Screening Information  
The following information will be captured on at screening:  
Demographics : sex, age, weight and height (calculated body mass index), and ethnic origin.  
Medical history : obtained by [CONTACT_232456]/legal guardian and by [CONTACT_746] a 
physical examina tion. 
Previous and concomitant medication: obtained by [CONTACT_232456].  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_888798] documented bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658722].  
• The first bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658749] 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation 
period, whichever comes  last. 
• The investigator’s overall clinical assessment covers the entire time period of the first 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_17111]. The assessment includes the clinical condition of the 
subject, laboratory values such as haematocrit and haemoglobin, as wel l as any 
additional haemostatic  treatments.  
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy will be based on a 4-point haemostatic efficacy scale (Table 2). The final efficacy assessment of each patient  
will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_658790].

7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clot Strength 
MCF will be determined using thromboelastography (TEG) and will be used as a surrogate 
marker for haemostatic efficacy. TEG is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation and clot firmness. It utilises a mechanical detection system which is b ased on the 
ability of the blood or plasma clot to form a mechanical coupling over a distance of 1 mm.  
TEG is the continuous registration of blood clot firmness during the entire coagulation process (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Example of thromboelastogram  
MCF (measured in mm) is a functional parameter which depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross -linking of the fibrin network. 
TEG has been shown in various studies to be predictive of clinical coagulopathy [16, 17, 18, 
19, 20]. TEG has been used as a functional marker for the assessment of fibrinogen content, and for the effects of fibrinogen supplementation on the clinical effica cy [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 
26]. Therefore, the MCF parameter is regarded as an adequate surrogate marker for the haemostatic efficacy of fibrinogen supplementation in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
To obtain consistent results across all study centres, with minimal centre- to-centre variability, 
MCF data will be forwarded to the central laboratory. MCF will be assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples.  
The MCF (units: mm) at [ADDRESS_888800]-2014  
Page 36  
  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recovery  
IVR will be determined using the following approaches:  
• Incremental IVR (response): calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen 
(i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion  and [ADDRESS_888801] -infusion (expressed as 
absolute concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by [CONTACT_658791] 
(expressed as mg/kg dosed).  
• Classical IVR:  calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss 
data) between  pre-infusion and [ADDRESS_888802] -infusion (expressed as absolute 
concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by [CONTACT_658792] (expressed as mg/dL), with expected plasma volume being estimated based on the blood volume formula described by [CONTACT_627826]  [27].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgical  Prophylaxis  
The efficacy of Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be assessed at the end of surgery by [CONTACT_658793] -operatively by [CONTACT_658794] 3. The efficacy of 
Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be based on an overall assessment. The overall surgical 
efficacy will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_658795]’ and investigators’ assessments in conjunction with a review of the surgical case.

lower or equal to the maximal expected blood loss for the type of procedure in a 
subject with normal  haemostasis.  
Moderate Intra -operative blood loss* was higher than maximal expected blood loss for the 
type of procedure performed in a subject with normal haemostasis, but haemostasis was controlled.  
None Haemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor replacement  regimen.  
 
*All excludes unexpected blood loss due to surgical complications, i.e.,

2. Haematology and virology serology (EDTA blood and serum, respec tively)  
3. Clinical chemistry  (serum)  
 
7.3.2 Citrated  Plasma  
Blood samples taken for plasma will be centrifuged after collection as instructed in the laboratory manual provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Aliquots of the supernatant are subsequently transferred into the tubes provided by [CONTACT_658796].  
For the analysis performed in the central laboratory, samples of citrated blood will be collected for coagulation factor analysis and antibody testing. After collection and centrifugation as instructed in laboratory manual, the plasma will be aliquoted into cryo - 
resistant tubes. Samples will be stored frozen  and shipped to the central laboratory on  dry-ice.

7.3.5 Recording of Clinically Significant Abnormal Labora tory Values as  AEs/ADRs  
The investigator must assess the clinical significance of abnormal laboratory values outside the normal range as specified by [CONTACT_149094]. Any clinically significant abnormalities should be fully investigated.  
Only laboratory abnormalities that have been rated as being clinically significant will be documented as AEs/ADRs. Clinically significant is defined as any laboratory abnormality that the investigator feels is of clinical concern and/or requires medical interventio n and/or follow - 
up. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or aetiology of an abnormal result or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained if clinically indicated.  
Any abnormal laboratory value that persists should be followed until resolution or for [ADDRESS_888808]. Preferably, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be medically diagnosed and entered as a diagnosis into the AE form.  
 
7.4 Safety  Assessments 
Any of the following drug safety information shall be collected:  
• All AEs occurring between the start of the first Octafibrin infusion and the end of each 30-
day observation and follow -up period for on- demand treatment or until the Last Post-  
Operat ive Day in surgeries will be  recorded.  
• All SAEs occurring after the first Octafibrin infusion will be documented and reported for 
a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study or as required 
to meet local regulations (definitions and reporting requirements, see Section  7.4.1). 
• Post study related safety repor ts, pregnancies, drug overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse, 
or medication error (see Section  7.7).

7.4.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
• AE: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject receiving an IMP  
and which does not ne cessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to th e IMP.  
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an 
IMP related to any dose. The phrase ‘response to an IMP’ means that a causal relationship between the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the  
relationship cannot be ruled  out. 
• Other significant AEs : Any marked laboratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead to an 
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant 
additional concomitant  therapy.  
• Withdrawal due to AE/ADR : Subject whose treatment with IMP is discontinued 
because of an AE or ADR. Any such events will be followed up by [CONTACT_658798]. All follow -up 
information collected will be made available to the  Sponsor.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of AEs  
The condition of the subject will be monitored throughout each 30- day observation and 
follow -up period for on -demand treatment or each surgical observation period for surgical 
interventions. At each visit, whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a 
standard non- leading question such as ‘How have you been since the last visit?’  
Only AEs or ADRs which occur during any [ADDRESS_888810] reports several signs or symptoms which represent a single syndrome or diagnosis, the latter s hould be recorded in the 
CRF.  
The investigator responsible will grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate, or severe; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the seriousness (non- serious or serious; see Section 7.5), and 
causality (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The Sponsor is responsible to assess the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated 
and followed up until they have returned to normal and/ or an adequate explanation is 
available.  
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later stage unless they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening). 
The investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888811]-2014  
Page 41  
  
observations or com ments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the 
subjects’ AEs or ADRs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of  AEs 
The intensity/severity of all AEs will be graded as follows:  
• Mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the 
subject’s routine  activities.  
• Moderate:  an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the subject’s 
routine  activities.  
• Severe:  an AE which is incapacitating a nd prevents the pursuit of the subject’s routine 
activities.  
Grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement of the investigator and will be decided on a 
case- by-case basis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality of AEs  
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed  by [CONTACT_658799]:  
• Probable:  reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonab le temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_658750]’s clinical  state.  
• Possible:  reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for  example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. A 
reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other  factors.  
• Unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. An event which may have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state 
or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_301254].  
• Not related (unrelated): events for which suff icient information exists to conclude that 
the aetiology is unrelated to the  IMP.  
• Unclassified:  reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g., 
because of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Classification of ADRs  
ADRs will be classified by [CONTACT_301298]:  
• Expected:  an AE  that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
• Unexpected:  an AE that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure, or that differs because of greater severity or greater  specificity.

[IP_ADDRESS] Outco me of  AEs 
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows:  
1. Recovered,  resolved.  
2. Recovering, resolving.  
3. Not recovered, not  resolved.  
4. Recovered, resolved with  sequelae.  
5. Fatal.  
6. Unknown.  
 
NOTE: A subject’s death per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted 
into subject’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs 
within [ADDRESS_888813] of being considered treatment - 
related or not.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action(s) Taken  
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognised standards of medical care to protect the health and well being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be available to ensure the best pos sible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by [CONTACT_549947]:  
1. In general:  
− None.  
− Medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started.  
− Test performed.  
− Other (to be  specified).  
2. Regarding the  IMP:  
− None. 
− Product  withdrawn. 
− Dose  reduced. 
− Dose  increased.  
The responsible investigator will follow -up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the subject is stable; all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the 
Sponsor. 
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888814] administration of IMP in the study will be 
documented and reported for a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study. This will be designated as occurring in either an “active peri od” (i.e., during the 
treatment observation and follow -up period) or an “inactive period” between treatment events 
(i.e., bleeding or surgery). 
All related concomitant medications will also be collected for these events.  
No SAEs will be collected between screening and the first treatment unless required by [CONTACT_13125].  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death.  
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574].  
• Results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• Is another important medical event.  
NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ refers to an event in which the subject was — in the view 
of the reporting investigator — at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
In other situations, medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious: Important AEs/ADR s that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658751], should also be considered serious. 
In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the subject. A passive transmission  of antibodies alone does 
not constitute a suspected virus  transmission.

7.7 Other Rele vant Safety  Information  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-study Related Safety Reports  
Any ADR (i.e., any AE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP) which occurs after the completion of the study should be reported by [CONTACT_093]. The usual procedure for reporting post marketing safety information should be followed, but relati on to the clinical 
study should be stated on the  report.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies  
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP.  
Pregnancies occurring after IMP treatment is initiated (foetal exposure to the IMP) need to be 
reported.  
In case of pregnancy during the study, the investigator is asked t o complete the pregnancy 
notification form and to send it (by [CONTACT_6791]) to the Clinical Project Manager or designee.  
Follow -up information on the outcome of both mother and foetus will be requested by a 
Sponsor representative.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose, Interaction, Misuse, Me dication Error and Lack of  Efficacy  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as an AE or, if the reaction fulfils one of the criteria for seriousness, as a SAE.  
• Drug overdose:  An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment 
at a dose higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
• Interaction:  A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product 
affects the activity of an IMP, i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as drug  interaction.  
• Misuse:  Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside 
its described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label - 
use). The reaction must be clearly  identified as  misuse.  
• Medication error: Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or 
unintended use of a medicinal product which may be caused by [CONTACT_151814], presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, and/or instructions for use/labelli ng. 
The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication  error.  
 
7.8 Other  Assessments

9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE  SIZE  
 
9.1 Hypothesis Testing and Determination of Sample  Size 
The following hypothesis will be tested:  
H0: p ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_888827] the alternative  
HA: p > 0.7 
where p is the proportion of subjects with successful haemostatic efficacy (i.e., ‘excellent’ or 
‘good’).  
The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by [CONTACT_658806]-sided 90% Blyth- Still- Casella confidence interval for the proportion of patients with 
successful haemostatic efficacy with the predefined threshold of 0.7.  
The number of subjects is limited by [CONTACT_658807]. 
Therefore, no real sample size estimation is provided. Instead, the probabilities for different outcomes are provided, given a success rate of 90% for a total number of 24 subjects together with respective confidence intervals (CIs).  
Assuming that haemostatic treatment is successful (i.e., ‘excellent’ or ‘good’) in 90% of the 24 subjects, the success rates and probabilities given in Table 5 will  apply.

a Blyth -Still- Casella interval [28], realised by [CONTACT_658808] [29].  
Hence, assuming that treatment with Octafibrin is associated with a true success rate of 90% 
of the 24 subjects, there will be a 78.6% probability that at least [ADDRESS_888828] a 
successful assessment. In case of 21 successful assessments, the lower boundary of the 90% CI will be 0.718, i.e. >70%.  
For the purpose of analysis, t he efficacy assessment made by [CONTACT_658773] 4 -point 
rating scale (see Section 7.2.1) will be transformed to a dichotomous endpoint, with ‘treatment success—yes’ defined as a rating of ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ and ‘treatment success — 
no’ defined as a rating of ‘moderate,’ ‘none,’ or a missing rating. The success rate will be 
calculated as the proportion of patients with treatment success.  
Study Protocol

In addition to the inferential evaluation of the success rate described in the preceding section, the haemostatic efficacy scale data will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_658809].  
The statistical analysis of safety variables will be descriptive only.  
Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, Standard Deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum, and number of observations and missing observations). Categorical variables will be summarised with counts and percentages.  
Data will also be presented as bar and line graphs.

The full analysis set defined according to the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle will include 
subjects who fulfil all of the following conditions: 
• Received at least one infusion of the  IMP.  
• Entered the study with a confirmed congenital fibrinogen deficiency (second inclusion criterion; see Section  4.2).

9.3.3 Per-Protocol  Population 
The per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects of the full analysis set who fulfil all 
of the following conditions:  
• Provide valid, i.e., non- missing haemostatic efficacy  data.  
• Provide a 1- hour post -infusion MCF  value.  
• Received ≥90% of the planned total dose of the IMP in the first  infusion.  
• Received ≥80% of the calculated dose  (no dose was calculated, 0% will be assumed) of 
the IMP over all further infusions according to the treatment schedule  
• Did not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:  
– Bleeding disorder other than congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
– End-stage liver disease (i.e., Child -Pugh- score B or  C). 
– Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_658757] -fibrinogen inhibitor as indicated by [CONTACT_658810], if  available  
<0.5 (mg/dL)/(mg/kg).  
– Treatment with any fibrinogen concentrate or other fibrinogen -containing blood 
product within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment for the bleeding ep isode or 
surgery.  
• Did not use any coagulation -active drug (i.e., non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, 
warfarin, coumarin derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors) within 1 week prior to 
start of treatment for the bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_658717], or as a planned or expected medication during the time period from Day 1 until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last Octafibrin  infusion.  
• Surgical procedure with a need for at least one infusion of the IMP with an overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy.  
Any protocol deviations other than those with respect to the above conditions for the PP population must be agreed upon in writing by [CONTACT_658811], and in any case, before database closure.  
The efficacy analysis will be performed for bleeding events using the full analysis set (ITT analysis) and for the PP population (PP analysis). An additional analysis will also be performed for the surgical population. 
 
9.3.4 Subpopulations  
Subpopulations based on the following categories will be examined:  
• Severity of bleeding: minor versus  major.  
• Age: Paediatric (≤18 years) versus adult (18–64) versus elderly patients ( ≥65), if 
appropriate.  
• Sex.

No. FORMA -[ADDRESS_888832] Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the 
last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last (see Section 3.1.1). 
Frequency distribution will be provided for the haemostatic efficacy scale data. In addition, a 
90% CI for the success rate in haemostatic efficacy (excellent or good) according to Casella (Blyth -Still-Casella interval [28]) will be computed using SAS soft ware [29]. 
For the following subjects, the haemostatic efficacy outcome will be set to the worst efficacy category, i.e., ‘none’:  
• Subjects who withdraw from the study due to lack of  efficacy.  
• Subjects receiving cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_658758] (unless it is clearly documented that these products were administered for reasons unrelated to IMP efficacy [e.g., p harmacy 
error]).  
• Subjects with missing haemostatic efficacy  assessment.  
Haemostatic efficacy will be displayed by [CONTACT_658812] (sex, age groups, weight, type of bleeding) in tables or with covariables in listings depending on the number per subgroup. 
 
9.4.2 Secon dary  Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clot strength  (MCF)  
MCF before the first infusion and [ADDRESS_888833] infusion as well as changes of MCF from pre -infusion will be summarised using descriptive statistics and 
displayed graphically. The course of l aboratory data will be presented graphically. Mean 
changes in MCF will be described with 2 -sided 95% CIs.  
The same analyses will be performed separated for the predefined subgroups as well as separated for the subjects’ clinical outcome represented by [CONTACT_658813] 4 -point 
haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate, none) and the dichotomised haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent/good, moderate/none). Scatterplots will show MCF by 
[CONTACT_658814].  
In addition, a correlation analysis between MCF and the haemostatic efficacy assessment will be performed. To evaluate the correlation betw een MCF and the primary efficacy variable, 
Spearman correlation coefficients will be estimated for the correlation of the 4 -point 
haemostatic efficacy with MCF and with MCF change.  
NOTE: If there is almost no variation in haemostatic efficacy outcomes (e.g ., if almost all of 
the outcomes are ‘excellent’) there will be only low discriminatory power to show an association between MCF and haemostatic efficacy.

[IP_ADDRESS] In-vivo recovery  
IVR will be determined using incremental and classical IVR (see S ection [IP_ADDRESS]). Calculation 
and analysis of IVR will be performed for the Clauss method only.  
Response (incremental IVR) will be calculated as the maximum increase in plasma 
fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion and [ADDRESS_888835] -infusi on (expressed 
as absolute concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by [CONTACT_658791]

Classical IVR will be calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion and [ADDRESS_888837] -infusion (expressed as absolute 
concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by [CONTACT_658815] (expressed as mg/dL, expected plasma volume being estimated based on the blood volume formula described by [CONTACT_627826] [27]):  
 
Classical IVR (%) =

Response and classical IVR will be calculated for each infusion of each subject. Descriptive 
tables will show the distributions of the 2 parameters per infusion day separated for minor and major bleeding. An exploratory analysis using a repeated- measures analysis of covariance 
model will analyse whether the response/classical IVR changed over time. The dose (mg/kg) associated with the respective IVR will be held as covariate in the model. The response/IVR over time and dose will also be presented in scatter plots for all subjects and by [CONTACT_213366]/minor bleeding.

Octafibrin use  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or major). Target level and achieved level after 
individual dosing as well as the difference between target level and achieved level will be summarized using descriptive statistics and displayed  graphically.  
The dose of the IMP used per day and in total will be summarised using descriptive statistics for minor and major b leeding events. Frequency of infusions and duration of treatment will 
also be summarised. The frequency of unscheduled infusions will be summarised descriptively.  
 
9.5 Handling of Missing  Data  
In general, if not stated differently, missing data will not be imputed.  
If the haemostatic efficacy assessment is missing, it will be set to ‘none’ in the ITT analysis. Subjects  with  missing  haemostatic  efficacy   assessment   will   be   excluded   f rom   the

Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and any subsequent amendment(s) will be submitted to an IEC/IRB and to the Regulatory Authority. The study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, GCP regulations and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The regulatory application or submission for regulatory approval will be made by [CONTACT_301327] (e.g., CRO), as required by [CONTACT_17657]. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_888845] information and informed consent form, any other materials provided to the subjects, and further requested information will be submitted by [CONTACT_658820]/IRB and the Regulatory Authority. The 
study approval letter must be available before any subject is exposed to a study- related 
procedure.  
The Sponsor, the investigator and any third party (e.g., CRO) involved in obtaining approval, must inform each other in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject is enrolled in the study.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_888846]’s decision to participate. The informed consent form must be signed, with name [CONTACT_658826] [CONTACT_658821], before the subject is exposed to any study- related procedure, including 
screening tests for  eligibility.  
For subjects not qualified to give legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legal parent/ guardian. If children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the 
study, they should also be informed and provide their written consent.  
If the period between screening and treatment is more than [ADDRESS_888847] will be informed that his/her medical (source) records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_119645], a quality assurance auditor or a health authority inspector, in accordance with applicable regulations, and that these persons are bound by [CONTACT_658822].  
 
10.4 Protocol  Amendments  
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the investigator (co- ordinating 
investigator in multi- centre studies) and the Sponsor prior to its implementation. Any such 
amendments will be submitted to the IEC(s/IRB) and/or competent authority responsible as required by [CONTACT_5279]. IEC(s)/IRB approval will at a minimum be requested for any change to this protocol which could affect the safety of the subjects, the objective/design of the stu dy, any increase in dosage or duration of exposure to the IMP an increase in the 
number of subjects treated, the addition of a new test or procedure, or the droppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a test intended to monitor safety.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_888848]’s confidentiality is preserved. On CRFs or any 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor, the subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by a unique subject number. Documents not for submission to the Sponsor, i.e., the confidential subject identification code list, original consent forms and source records will be maintained by [CONTACT_1210].  
Study Protocol

source data/records, verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness 
and accuracy of all CRF entries compared to source data. The investigator will co -operate 
with the  monitor to ensure that any discrepancies identified are resolved.  
For this study, the first monitoring visit shall take place shortly after the start of treatment of the first subject. Thereafter, monitoring frequency will depend on study progress.  
The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and 
records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any 
records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the clinical stu dy. Source data will 
be available for all data in the CRFs, including all laboratory results.  
 
11.2 Audit and  Inspection  
The investigator will make all study -related source data and records available to a qualified 
quality assurance auditor mandated by [CONTACT_1034], or to IEC/IRB/regulatory inspectors, after reasonable notice. The main purposes of an audit or inspection are t o confirm that the rights 
and welfare of the subjects have been adequately protected, and that all data relevant for the assessment of safety and effectiveness of the IMP have been reported to the Sponsor.

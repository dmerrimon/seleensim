 [ADDRESS_20769] infection (UTI) is the most frequently occurring serious bacterial infection in young children and 
accounts for more than 1 million office visits (0.7% of all physician office visits), 5 to 14% of emergency 
department (ED) visits, and approximately 4 0,000 admissions per year.1 UTI involving the renal parenchyma – 
referred to as acute pyelonephritis (APN) – is one of the principal causes of renal scarring in children. Renal 
scarring in childhood has been associated with hypertension, preeclampsia and ESRD decades later.2-4   
Current management of children with UTI has focused on the treatment of the subgroup with vesicoureteral 
reflux (VUR) and on the early treatment of UTI wi th antibiotics. Although the presence of VUR – backward 
flow of urine from the bladder to the kidney – increases the likelihood of bacteria gaining access to the kidney, 
correction of VUR is not sufficient to prevent scarring. Renal scarring frequently occ urs in children who do not 
have VUR,5-8 and the aggressive diagnosis and treatment of children with VUR that started in the 1960’s has 
not been associated with a reduction in the incidence of end stage renal disease.9, [ADDRESS_20770] convincingly shown that once the infection has 
localized to the renal parenchyma, treatment with antibiotics alone does not prevent scarring.12-16 It is now clear 
that the current managem ent strategy is not always effective in preventing renal scarring.  
The proposed study examines whether an alternate strategy – one that focuses on identification and modulation 
of the host inflammatory response – is effective in reducing renal scarring.  
Aim – To determine whether adjuvant therapy with dexamethasone reduces renal scarring in children 
treated with antimicrobials for acute urinary tract infection.   
Because host inflammatory response is the final and most important step in the formation of r enal scars, the use 
of anti-inflammatory agents may be the best strategy to reduce renal scarring. In animal studies, the use of 
corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in preventing post -pyelonephritic scarring.17-[ADDRESS_20771] a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial (n=320 evaluable children , 160 per arm ) to determine the 
efficacy of [ADDRESS_20772] 
frequently seen in males with grades IV or V VUR and is characterized by [CONTACT_21830](s) with 
little or no function.33-[ADDRESS_20773]. In her 10 to 41 yea r follow-up of 226 
children with VUR, Smellie noted that those with poor prognosis fell into two categories: boys with severe 
VUR and scarring at presentation, and girls with mild to moderate VUR with scarring secondary to recurrent 
   
 [ADDRESS_20774] had acquired renal scarring 
(and not dysplasia) – i.e., studies of females with low -grade VUR or no VUR – one can get a better apprecia tion 
for the morbidity associated with childhood UTI. Jacobson reported on a 27 -year follow -up of 30 patients (87% 
females) with non -obstructive focal scarring following APN in 
childhood.4, 40 Approximately 10% of patients developed end -stage 
renal disease, 23% developed hypertension, and 13% of women 
experienced preeclampsia. Raz followed 63 adult women 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21812] 10 -20 years; 8% had 
evidence of impaired  renal function (GFR<75 mL/min per 1.73 
m2).41 In a 37-year follow -up study, of 267 children (89% female) 
with VUR, 9% developed ESRD.42 In a long-term study of 100 
adults (83% female) with reflux nephropathy, [ADDRESS_20775] found that 0% to 2% of children had evidence 
consistent with dysplasia at e nrollment (see preliminary data).44-46 
Yet, in these same studies, approximately 15% of children 
developed permanent renal scarring.44, 46 
In summary, there is overwhelming evidence to support the role of 
APN in the development of permanent renal injury in children. R ecent studies confirm the notion that earlier 
studies likely overestimated the importance of acquired scarring, but that APN remains an important and 
preventable cause of permanent renal injury.22  
II. Inflammation Leads to Renal Scarring (Figure 1)  
APN occurs when bacteria successfully ascend from the bladder to the kidney. Approximately two -thirds of 
young children with febrile UTI have evidence of renal parenchymal involvement.8, 12, 22 VUR, dysfunctional 
elimination syndrome (DES), 47,48,49-[ADDRESS_20776], the 
majority of children (60% -68%) with UTI have no demonstrable VUR,5, [ADDRESS_20777] 
severe (grade IV, V) VUR (<5%).12, 55, [ADDRESS_20778] -infectious renal scarring appears to be the inflammat ory response to acute infection – not VUR.7, 
55, 59-[ADDRESS_20779] on the rates of scar ring (Table 1). In these studies, prevalence of renal scarring on the 
12-month DMSA scan was compared in children with 
UTI treated with antibiotics within [ADDRESS_20780] to induce 
immunosuppression in rats with UTI; immunosuppressed rats had lower rates of renal scarring when compared 
with immunocompetent rats.27 Meylan showed that rats treated with dapsone, which inhibits neutrophil oxidant 
damage, had a 65% reduction in renal scars compared with controls.[ADDRESS_20781] 
in the group receiving combination therapy.  
The use of corticosteroids in conjunction with antibiotic therapy was examined in 3 studies:  
1. In a study by [CONTACT_21831], rats were either left 
untreated, treated with delayed ciprofloxacin 
(begun 72 hours a fter bacterial inoculation), or 
treated with prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d for 4 days) 
in combination with delayed ciprofloxacin 
(Figure 2). Microscopic and/or macroscopic renal 
scarring was observed in 70% of the untreated 
rats, 56% of the rats treated with cip rofloxacin 
alone, and 10% of rats treated with both 
antibiotics and corticosteroids.[ADDRESS_20782] -APN renal scarring in a small number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_1515] (N= 36). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_21813]. Severity of renal scarring 
was based on histopathologic findings 2 months after APN. Scarring was observed in 60% of control pi[INVESTIGATOR_21814] 
49% of steroid -treated animals. Given the small sample size, this did not reach stat istical significance (p=0.22). 
Nevertheless, severe APN (defined as involvement of >2/3 of a renal zone) was [ADDRESS_20783] 
effective in moderately and severely affected kidneys.18   Table 1. Renal scarring according to timing of treatment

 6 3. In a recent study, 54 children 3 months to 10 years of age with APN were placed on dexamethasone (0.15 
mg/kg every 6 hours for 3 days) plus ceftriaxone, or on ceftriaxone alone.19 Urinary IL -6 and IL-8 were 
measured at the time of presentation and at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. A significantly larger drop in the 
levels of urinary IL -6 (p<0.001) and IL -8 (p<0.001) was noted i n children treated with corticosteroids as 
compared to children treated with antimicrobials alone. Follow -up DMSA scans were not performed.  
In contrast, the use of corticosteroids in animals not concurrently treated with antibiotics did not decrease rates  
of scarring.21, 25, [ADDRESS_20784] the efficacy of ster oids in preventing scar formation.  
VI. Efficacy and Safety of Corticosteroids for Other Infectious Diseases  
Corticosteroid use during acute infection decreases the inflammatory response by 1) inhibiting cytokine and 
chemokine production, 2) inhibiting leu kocyte migration, 3) inhibiting transcription of inflammatory proteins, 
and 4) upregulating the transcription of anti -inflammatory proteins.[ADDRESS_20785] examined the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for patients with acute bacterial 
meningitis; most trials demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss, and some 
demonstra ted a reduction in mortality.[ADDRESS_20786] for assessing presence of renal scars. Risdon, using a pig model, compared 
the location and extent of renal scarring on histopathological examination with DMSA scan findings 
immediately before sacrifice.69 DMSA identified 94% of kidneys with pathology and was 100% specific. 
Approximately 47% of abnormalities noted on scans conducted [ADDRESS_20787], 90% of abnormalities 
noted on scans conducted ≥5 months (20 weeks) after the index UTI 
were persistent.[ADDRESS_20788] a multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
double-blind clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant 
dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg per dose, twice daily for 3 days) in 
preventing renal scarring in young febrile children (2 months to 6 years) 
with a first -diagnosed UTI. [ADDRESS_20789] dose of antibiotic treatment for  the UTI. A 
flavoring syrup will be mixed by [CONTACT_21832]  

   
 7 with the medication/ placebo to make the study medication flavor more appealing to the child. The parent will 
draw the prescribed amount of medication/ placebo  from the syringed -top medication bottle and push it out into 
a small medication cup provided by [CONTACT_3476]. The parent will then draw an equivalent amount of 
flavoring syrup from the flavoring bottle using a separate dosing syringe and push the flavor ing out into the 
same medication cup. The parent will then mix the contents in the medication cup. After mixing, the child will 
be able to drink the contents directly from the medication cup or the parent will re -draw the contents using the 
syringe and adm inister the contents to the child with the dosing  syringe. The study medication will be given 
with meals, twice daily to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. If vomiting occurs within 20 minutes of steroid 
administration, an equivalent second dose will be  administered. We will ask that the study medication doses 
administered to the child be recorded in a medication diary that will be provided by [CONTACT_1758]. When the child 
has completed the study, we will ask that the parent return all medication supplies and the medication diary in a 
postage-paid box that will be provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
II.      Recruitment   
The centers participat ing in this study  are: Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815], Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21816], the American Family Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21817] a children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21818] , Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C , Hasbro Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21819] , and Primary Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21820]. At each site, particip ants will be recruited at the time of 
UTI diagnosis from the emergency department (ED) and from a network of outpatient/private practice offices. 
Recruitment from the ED will be supervised by [CONTACT_21833] (ED Enrollment Coordinator) and a part -time 
nurse.  
III.      Eligibility C riteria 
Parents of febrile children 2 months (60 days) to 6 years of age (before sixth birthday) who have pyuria on 
urinalysis or dipstick and who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be asked to p articipate in the study 
(Table 2). We will exclude children younger than 2 months of age because, 1) the incidence of bacteremia is 
highest in this age group,22, 71 2) clinical assessment of children < 2 months of age is more difficult . Two studies 
in rats suggested that treatment of near -term premature animals with corticosteroids is associated with increased 
risk of adverse events; therefore, children between 2 and 3 months of age will only be enrolled if they are born 
at term (≥ 37 weeks).72, 73, We will limit the study to children with their first protocol defined UTI. This will 
minimize the number of children with preexisting scars secondary to previous UTIs. To minimize the number of 
children with false positive urinalyses, young children who have urine collected via a bag specimen  for culture  
(without a follow -up 
catheterized specimen) will be 
excluded. Other exclusio n 
criteria are listed in Table 2. 
See last page of this document 
for changes made to the 
protocol after starting patient 
enrollment.  
IV.    Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization 
will occur in blocks of 4. 
Stratification will be based on 
the duration of fever (either 
documented or by [CONTACT_21834]) prior 
to diagnosis ( <48 hours vs 
≥48 hours) and the site of enrollment. That is, children will undergo site -specific blocked randomization 
sequences for each of the strata defined by [CONTACT_21835]. Subjects are randomized into the appropriate strata 
based on this information. The investigator will be provided with a unique randomization code, which will  Table 3. Summary of Observations

pharmacy will be aware of treatment assignment.  
 
Any protocol defined recurrence will be treated with the same therapy initially given to the child. This treatment 
will be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis (but no later than 48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy).   
V.      Data to be Collected (T able 3) 
A. Baseline D ata 
 
Information on the following potential predictors and confounders of renal scarring will be collected during the 
baseline evaluation: Demographics (sex, race, ethnicity, age), symptoms (type and duration), past medical  
history (including result of prenatal ultrasound), medications [including non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
use (NSAIDS)], and family history (VUR, UTI, scarring, kidney disease). There will be an age -appropriate 
evaluation for dysfunctional eliminatio n syndrome (DES),[ADDRESS_20792] their child’s bloo d drawn, and urine for all laboratory tests (Table 3) will be 
collected before steroids are administered and a portion of the specimen will be saved for future hypothesis -
driven studies . If the parent consents to the genetic blood draw at the time of enrollment, this sample can be 
drawn at the time of the DMSA scan . 
B.  Follow-up  
Day 2-4 Phone Call  
To monitor the child’s wellbeing and to ensure compliance with medication administration, we will call parents 
for 3 days following the day of enrollment. If the child’s fever has not resolved by [CONTACT_4475] 4, we will continue daily 
phone calls until the child becomes afebrile. With recurrent UTI, the phone call sequence will begin the day 
after the study medication is administered and will end after the fever has resolved. At least two attempts each 
day will be made to contact a parent. Attempts should be made at different times of day or to more than one 
phone number, leaving a message to call us if there is no answer, with a 24 -hour return phone number.  
 
A positive urine culture will be defined as either a:  
1) Urine specimen obtained by [CONTACT_21836]:  
a. The growth of one or more uropathogens at ≥50,000 CFU/mL  
OR 
2) Urine specimen obtained by [CONTACT_21837]:  
a. The growth of one or more uropathogen s at ≥100,000 CFU/mL 
 
For children who have a negative urine culture, corticosteroids will be stopped. All parents will be instructed to 
arrange a follow -up appointment with their primary care provider irrespective of culture results. Because of 
theoretical concerns reg arding the anti -inflammatory effects of ibuprofen, parents will be asked to refrain from 
using ibuprofen (or other NSAIDs) during the study.23 
 
1-Month Visit  (+/- 2 weeks)  
Approximately one month  after enrollment in the study, we will attempt meet parents of enrolled subjects  to 
review 1) the results of the urine culture, 2) the results of any imaging tests ordered by [CONTACT_21838], and 3) the plan for the remainder of the study period including a 
tour of the nuclear medicine department where the outcome DMSA will be performed. To save parents from 
making an extra trip, we will try to coordinate this visit with the routine imaging tests ordered by [CONTACT_2252]’s 
PCP.  If it is very difficult for parents to make this visit in person, we will conduct the visit over the phone.  
 
The research nurse or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_21821] 24 hours a day to parents of enrolled 
children via a study -dedicated cellular phone or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based beeper.  Parents will be instructed to (1) contact 
   
 9 study personnel in the event of intercurrent febrile illness or urinary symptoms, (2) have their child evaluated 
within 24 to 48 hours and (3) have a urine specimen obtained to evaluate for the presence of UTI. We will call 
parents monthly to determine whether any interim UTIs have been diagnosed . In case of recurrent UTIs, records 
from the visit(s) will be reviewed. Children with febrile re-infections will be retreated, in a blinded fashion, with 
antibiotics and t he same study medication (dexamethasone or placebo) that was used at the time of the index 
UTI.  
C. Routine Imaging T ests 
All children in the study will be evaluated with currently recommended, age -appropriate 
imaging tests. Routine imaging tests will be at the discretion of the providing physician . If 
VUR is identified on VCUG, appropriate treatment for VUR will be institute d. Although 
current guidelines recommend that children with VUR be treated with prophylactic 
antibiotics, several studies are underway that may change the way VUR is managed. We will 
use the best available evidence to manage children with VUR. Although the  yield of 
ultrasounds in this population is expected to be low, in the context of this research study, a 
normal ultrasound will provide reassurance that few or no children with significant dysplasia 
are included.  
D. Outcome DMSA Renal S can (5-24 months from the time of enrollment)  
The presence and extent of renal scarring is determined using a DMSA scan. When radiolabeled DMSA is 
given to patients whose tubular cell function is permanently impaired, the scan will show a photon -deficient 
area(s) with or without a loss of renal contour(s) (Fig. 4). Children with no further UTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (94% of 
children in the study)[ADDRESS_20793] a DMSA scan approximately 5  months (+/- 2 weeks) to 24 months from the 
time of enrollm ent) after the index UTI to determine the presence and extent of renal scarring. For children who 
have a re-infection during the follow -up period, the scan will 
be performed at least [ADDRESS_20794] 
the interpretation of the outcome scan. Children will be 
injected with a dose of 50 -75 µCi 99mTc-DMSA per Kg 
(maximum dose 3 miC).  High-resolution magnified images 
of the kidney will be obtained, including posterior and posterior oblique projections using a high -resolution 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_21822] 1.5 to 3 hours following injection. Scarring will be defined by [CONTACT_21839].76, 77 These cortical defects will be assessed semi -quantitatively by 
[CONTACT_21840] 12 equal segments (Table  4). The number of renal segments affected will be 
determined and the grade of scarring will be assigned based on a system developed by [CONTACT_21841]. DMSA scans will be interpreted by [CONTACT_21842]. Inter -observer agreement will be as sessed. To maximize reliability, we will 
request that each participating site send 10 de -identified DMSA scans (from children recently seen) to the 
reference radiologists for review prior to the start of enrollment. If the quality of the scans is suboptima l, 
appropriate changes will be made.  
E. Specimen P rocessing  
Urine biomarkers – 1 mL of urine will be filtered, frozen, and processed in batches at CHP or the Luminex 
Facility at the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_21823]. This method is well-established and  is particularly suitable when the 
sample volume is limited. Concentra tions will be measured using multiplex bead technology.  
 
Blood biomarkers  – At the time of UTI diagnosis, and if parents’ consent to a blood draw, 1 mL of blood will 
be collected in EDTA plasma tubes for biomarker analysis .

 10 Analysis plan – Efficacy of corticosteroids in the prevention of renal scarring  
The proportion of children who have any renal scars on the outcome DMSA scan in each treatment arm will 
serve as the principal outcome variable. Renal scarring will be defined a s decreased uptake of tracer with or 
without loss of contours . We will also compare the proportion of children with severe scarring between groups. 
Severe scarring will be defined as the presence of grades [ADDRESS_20795] one kidney. Three reference 
radiologists, blinded to treatment assignment, will make all determinations  and the reading endorsed by [CONTACT_21843] . The analysis will follow intent to treat principles: 
subjects will be analyzed according  to randomized treatment assignment regardless of adherence. Children who 
are found to have a negative urine culture will not be included in the efficacy analysis. These children do not 
have a UTI and are not at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_21824]. Up to 6%  of children (n=23) are expected to  have a 
recurrent UTI in the follow -up period.[ADDRESS_20796] of these children (~85%), the recurrent UTI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_21825]. As such, t he effect of re -infections on the primary analysis will be 
minimal. The incidence and the extent of renal scarring in the two treatment groups will be compared using 
logistic regression . We will also test for statistical interaction for individual variables (age, gender, race, 
mother’s education, fever duration, infecting organism, CRP, ibuprofen use within 24 hours of enrollment, and 
5 preselected urinary biomarkers listed below) and steroid treatment. This is done to investigate the possibility 
that the relative treatment effect differs among patient subgroups. We are aware that tests for interaction 
generally have low statistical power and we will likely detect only marked differences in treatment effects in 
these subgroups. Furthermore, the additional problem of falsely identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect 
among patient subgroups in clinical trials is well known and therefore the interpretation of subgroup differences 
is consider ed exploratory and will be done with caution.  Another analysis will be the proportion of children 
with recurrent febrile UTIs in each treatment group.  
 
Data will be analyzed after approximately one third of enrolled children complete the outcome DMSA scan . If 
there is a significant difference between groups, the DSMB may consider the possibility of terminating the 
study. Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_21844], Harrington and O’Brien. Testing will be 
conducted at significance levels of 0.005 and 0.048 at the interim and final analysis, respectively.78 
 
We will also compare the mean proportion of scarring in the two treatment groups across the three radiologists 
while adjusting for the correlation resulting because the radiologists evaluat ed the same set of scans.  
 
Because some of the STARRs participa nts also participated in the comp anion “Biomarkers for Pyelonephritis” 
study, in which early DMSA scan is performed to det ermine whether pyelonephritis is present, we will examine 
the efficacy of treatment in children with and without pyelonephritis .  
 
The study will be powered to detect a 10% difference between the two arms. A 10% absolute difference 
between the two groups translates into a number needed to treat of 10 (i.e., 10 children will need to be treated to 
prevent one child from developi[INVESTIGATOR_21826]). Assuming a 15% rate of scarring i n the control group, a two -sided 
alpha of 0.05, a beta of 0.8, a 10% attrition rate, and a 7% rate of false positive urinalysis, 190 children will be 
required per group  (i.e., 160 evaluable children per group) . However, as the study progressed, we realized  that 
30% of children enrolled had a false positive urinalysis, and thus increased the required sample size to 260 
children per group (to arrive at the 160 evaluable children needed). The 15% rate of scarring in the control 
group comes from a meta -analysis we conducted .[ADDRESS_20797]. Logistic regression 
   
 11 models will be fitted by [CONTACT_21845] (adjusted as appropriate for other 
confounders). We will include the following 5 biomarkers, each as a continuous variable (transformed as 
appropria te): IL-15, MCP1, CXCL1 (also known as GRO-alpha), interferon gamma, and NGAL.

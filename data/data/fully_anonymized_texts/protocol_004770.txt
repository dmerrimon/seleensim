contraception  (oral, patch,  vaginal  ring)  
ii. Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with  
inhibition  of ovulation  (oral,  injectable,  implantable)  
iii. Intrauterine  device  or intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system  
iv. Bilateral  tubal  occlusion  
v. Vasectomized  partner  or partner  of the same  sex 
vi. Double  barrier  method  (any combination  of physical  and chemical  
methods)  
b) Is not a  WOCBP:

Withdrawal  Criteria  • Experience an intolerable adverse event: such events include, but are  
not limited to, adverse events ≥ Grade 4*, bone marrow -related  
events,  a ≥ Grade  3* cardiac event (*CTCAE  v5.0 criteria);  • Experience an intolerable adverse event, including but not limit ed to  
bone marrow related events characterized by [CONTACT_841299], or a ≥ Grade 3 cardiac event, or a ≥ Grade 4  
(other) adverse event (CTCAE v5.0 criteria) considered possibly related to  
study  drug.  Because  laboratory  abnormali ties can occasionally  occur  that 
do not in themselves pose an unacceptable risk to subject safety (e.g., CK  
elevations with exercise, laboratory errors or artifacts), the occurrence of  
a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1168890] should discontinue randomized  
treatment.  Documentation  on the determinati on will be maintained  in the 
study  files Modified criteria for  
clarity  
9.2.1/Dose  Patients who withdraw consent and therefore are discontinued from the  
study should undergo an Early Termination Visit and subsequen t 
Safety Follow up Visit as appropriate per Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_1168891].

endpoints, in the order specified (see Section  12.4.3) (within each dose versus placebo) will continue to  
be tested at 0.025, in an alpha -level protected fashion, until not significant at 0.025.  Nominal p -values  
will be reported  for all  tests,  irrespective.  Testing  will be performed  only for the Treatment  Period.  
Secondary  Endpoints  
 Relative  change  in SALT scores from  Baseline  at Weeks  4, 8, 12, 16,  20, and 24 
 Percentage of responders (defined as “much improved” or “very much improved”) using the

 Percentage of patients achieving an absolute SALT score of ≤[ADDRESS_1168906]  will be outlined  in the 
Statistical  Analysis Plan finalized  prior  to database  lock for the  Primary  Efficacy  Analysis.  
Safety  
Safety and tolerability of CTP -543 will be assessed by [CONTACT_256435], vital signs,  
concomitant  medications,  and clinical  laboratory  results,  as well as physical examinations.  
Statistical  methods:  
Sample  Size:  
Power is calculated for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint for the chi -square test using a 2 -sided  
significance level of 0.025.  Based on Phase 2 results, the percentage of patients achieving an absolute  
SALT score ≤20 at Week 24 is assumed to be 40%, 25%, and 1 0% for the CTP -543 12 mg, CTP -543 
8 mg BID, and placebo groups, respectively.  Patients will be randomized in a 3:5:2 ratio with a total  
N of approximately  700 patients (i.e.,  210 for 12 mg  BID, 350 for  8 mg  BID,  and 140 for placebo).  
These sample sizes will provide >99% power for the comparison of CTP -543 12 mg BID versus  
placebo  and approximately  94% power  for the comparison of CTP -543 8 mg  BID versus placebo.  
Efficacy  Analyses:  
The Efficacy Population will include all patients who ar e randomized in the study and dispensed study  
drug during the Treatment Period.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients  
achieving an absolute SALT score of ≤[ADDRESS_1168907] using baseline scalp hair loss (partial  
vs complete/near -complete) as the stratification factor, for each active treatment group versus placebo.  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_580358] -treate d patients (i.e., by [CONTACT_1570]).  
All data for analysis will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively  
(mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures  
will be presented as  number  and percentage.  
The final efficacy analysis will be conducted when all patients in the study have had the opportunity to  
complete Week 24.  Additional details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical  
Analysis  Plan.  
Safety  Analyses:  
The Safety Population will include all patients who receive study drug during the Treatment Period.  
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_841301].  Clinically significant deteriorations in physical examination findings will be reported and  
summarized as adverse events.  Adverse events, vital sign measurements, physical examination  
findings, clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medications w ill be tabulated and  
summarized  by [CONTACT_841302].  By-patient listings  will be provided  for any deaths,  serious  
adverse  events, and adverse  events leading  to discontinuation  of treatment.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Overview  of Alopecia  Areata  
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by [CONTACT_580359] -scarring  
alopecia affecting scalp or scalp and body hair.  Alopecia Areata is clinically heterogeneous,  
affects males and females, and has a prevalence rate of ap proximately 0.2% of the [LOCATION_002]  
population ( Safavi, 1992 ; Benigno, 2020 ). There is no preventative therapy or cure.  Alopecia  
areata often presents as a cyclical disorder marked by [CONTACT_841303], and varia tion in the degree or pattern of hair loss gives rise to different  
subtypes of alopecia areata, such as patchy, ophiasis, totalis, or universalis.  Approximately 7%  
of patients have severe disease with almost complete hair loss and little or no regrowth  
(Villasante Fricke, 2015 ). Approximately 80% of alopecia areata patients experience the first  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_841267]  40 years  of age  and 40% by 20 years of  age (Villasante  Fricke,  2015 ). 
Alopecia areata can have a psychological impact with high rates of depression ( Sellami, 2014 ) 
and anxiety reported, particularly in children and adolescents ( Bilgic, 2013 ), and therefore,  
psychological  counseling is  often recommended  as part of  the standar d of care (Al- 
Mutairi,  2011 ). 
A cause for  alopecia  areata  has not yet been identified,  though  as in other  autoimmune  disorders,  
genetic  susceptibility  and a wide  array  of environmental triggers are  thought  to be  involved.  
Presently,  treatments  for alopecia  areata  include  moderately  effective  intralesional  corticosteroid  
injections or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], or aesthetic disguises such as makeup and wigs.  Currently, no existing  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841268] (FDA), Health Canada, or any Competent Authority in the European Union  
indicating  a significant unmet medical need.  
4.2. Scientific  Rationale  for the Study  
Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA have shown Janus kinase (JAK)  
inhibitors  to be  a promising  novel therapy.  
The JAKs are intracellular tyrosine kinases that play a central role in the signaling of cytokine  
and growth factor rec eptors ( Ghoreschi, 2009 ). Cytokine -induced receptor conformation  
changes activate the JAKs and trigger phosphorylation of the 6 -member signal transducers and  
activators of transcription (STAT) protein transcription factor family.  Upon phosphorylation,  
STAT s dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841269],  psoriatic  arthritis,  and rheumatoid  arthri tis, and multiple  
JAK inhibitors are in development for autoimmune disorders such as atopic dermatitis, systemic  
lupus erythematosus and others ( Levy, 2015 ). In a murine model of AA, CD81 T cells were  
shown to be central in  AA, causing  up-regulation of  interleukin -15 in hair follicles and  
ultimately production of interferon -gamma, which targets the hair follicle for attack ( Xing,  
2014 ). As downstream regulators of interferon -gamma and interleukin -15, JAK inhibitors have  
been shown to eliminate  the interferon  signature  [CONTACT_841363].

a 50% relative reduction in SALT score at Week 24 relative to Baseline.  The primary efficacy  
endpoint was met in both the 8 mg BID group and 12 mg BID groups.  The difference between  
the 4 mg BID group and the placebo group wa s not statistically significant.  The 8 mg BID and  
12 mg BID doses also produced significant results vs placebo when other analyses of SALT data  
(i.e., percentage of patients achieving SALT ≤ 20) were conducted as well as analyses of patient  
and clinician reported global impression.  The 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID doses were further  
assessed in two additional Phase 2 dose regimen clinical trials (see Section 4.4.2 ) in which once - 
daily  versus twice -daily  dosing  with C TP-543 were  assessed.  
The definitive dose -ranging study (CP543.2001) and the completed dose regimen studies  
(CP543.2002  and CP543.2003)  demonstrated  that both the 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID doses of  
CTP-543 are effective and generally well tolerated.  Consequen tly, both of these doses will be  
studied  in this Phase  3 registration study  in adult patients  with alopecia areata.  
Summaries of all clinical studies conducted to -date can be found in Section 4.4 below.  Further  
details  are provided in the  current CTP -543 Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
4.3. Nonclinical  Information  for CTP -543 
A series  of nonclinical  studies  were  performed  with CTP-543, which  evaluated  the in vitro  and in 
vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism properties, safety pharm acology, toxicology and  
toxicokinetics, and genotoxicity.  All safety pharmacology and toxicology studies considered  
necessary for human safety assessment were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory  
Practice  regulations.  
Further  details  of the nonclin ical studies  for CTP-543 are described  in the Investigator’s  
Brochure.  
 
4.4. Clinical  Information  for CTP -[ADDRESS_1168917] been completed in healthy subjects, evaluating the safety,  
tolerability, and PK profile of single and multiple ascending doses of CTP -543: a single dose  
crossover study of CTP -543 versus ruxolitinib; a food effect study of CTP -543; a mass -balance  
study, and a drug -drug interaction (DDI) study with oral contracepti ve (OC).  A brief description  
of these studies is described below.  Further details of the Phase 1 studies for CTP -543 are  
described  in the  Investigator’s  Brochure.  
Study  CP543.1001  was a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  study  consisting  of a 
first-in-human  single  ascending  dose study  and a sequential  multiple  ascending  dose study.  The 
objective of the study was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and  
pharmacodynamics of CTP -543 in healthy subjects.  A total of 82 subjects were planned for the  
study;  32 subjects in  4 cohorts  randomized at  a ratio  of 3:1  CTP-543 to  placebo for  the single  
CTP-543

 ascending  dose part (Part A),  and thereafter,  50 subjects in  5 cohorts randomized  at a ratio  of 4:1 
CTP-543 to placebo for the multiple ascending d ose part (Part B).  The doses studied in the  
single ascending dose study were 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg, and 48 mg.  The doses studied in the  
multiple ascending dose study were 8 mg once daily, 8 mg twice daily, 24 mg once daily, 32 mg  
once daily, and 16 mg twice d aily, dosed for 7 consecutive days. CTP -543 was generally well  
tolerated  in these  studies  and showed a  dose proportional PK profile.  
Study CP543.1002 was a single dose cross -over study to assess safety and tolerability and to  
compare the metabolite and pha rmacokinetic profiles of CTP -543 versus ruxolitinib.  A total of  
12 subjects were enrolled in the study; 2 groups of 6 subjects each were dosed with either 15 mg  
of ruxolitinib or 16 mg of CTP -543 in Period 1 who then crossed over to the alternate treatment  
for Period 2.  CTP-543 was generally well tolerated in this study and showed an increase in PK  
parameters  compared to ruxolitinib.  
Study CP543.1003 was a cross -over study to characterize and compare the relative  
bioavailability and PK profile of CTP -543 an d metabolites under both fed and fasted conditions.  
A total of 14 subjects were enrolled and received single oral doses of 16 mg CTP -543. The 
administration of 16 mg CTP -543 under fed conditions resulted in a statistically significant  
decrease (approximate ly 40%) in peak exposure but not in total exposure compared to  
administration under fasted conditions.  Single oral doses of 16 mg CTP -543 appeared to be well  
tolerated  in both fasted  and fed conditions.  
Study CP543.1004 assessed the absorption, metabolism,  excretion, and mass balance of oral  
[14C] -CTP-543 in healthy  adult  male  subjects.  The study  showed  that there  are no circulating  
metabolites above 10% of drug related material.  Additionally, all metabolites in excreta are  
below  25% of drug related materia l. No adverse events  were reported in  this study.  
Study CP543.[ADDRESS_1168918] of multiple  
doses of CTP -543 on single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of the components of a combination  
OC, ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG).  Multiple oral doses of 12 mg CTP -543 
administered BID on Days 1 – [ADDRESS_1168919] on EE overall and peak exposures following  
coadministration with a single dose of combination OC (0.03 mg EE / 0.[ADDRESS_1168920] G). Multiple  
oral doses of 12 mg CTP -543 administered BID on Days 1 - 8 increased LNG overall and peak  
exposures by [CONTACT_3450] 17% and 16%, respectively, following coadministration with a  
single dose of combination OC (0.03 mg EE / 0.15 mg LNG) compared  to Combination OC  
alone.  This small increase in LNG exposure is not expected to impact the efficacy or safety of  
the OC.  Overall, there were no new findings and AEs reported were consistent with previously  
reported safety  data from  other  CTP-[ADDRESS_1168921] been completed.  An Open - 
Label Extension study is currently ongoing.  Qualifying patients from the completed Phase 2  
trials  were  eligible  to enroll  in the Open -Label  Extension  study  and continue  to receive either  8 
mg BID or 12 mg BID CTP -543 for an additional 108 weeks.  For full details of these studies,  
please  see the CTP -543 Investigator’s Brochure.  
Study CP543.2001 was a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 2 dose ranging  
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTP -543 in adult patients with moderate to severe  
alopecia areata.  A total of 149  adults  with moderate  to severe  alopecia areata  were  enrolled

 across  three  cohorts.  Patients were  sequentially  randomized  to receive  one of  three  doses  of 
CTP-543 (4, 8, 12 mg  twice  daily) or  placebo for  [ADDRESS_1168922] a 50% relative  reduction  in SALT  
score, from Baseline at Week 24.  The primary efficacy endpoint was met in both the 8 mg BID  
group and the 12 mg BID group.  The difference between the 4 mg BID group and the placebo  
group was not statistic ally significant.  
The primary efficacy endpoint result was supported by [CONTACT_841304] -based assessments and patient reported outcomes.  The 8 mg BID and  
12 mg BID groups differentiated from placebo on v arious SALT analyses and had significant  
improvements  in alopecia  areata  as measured  by [CONTACT_87791]-I and PGI-I compared  with the  placebo  
group.  
The improvements  in alopecia  areata  symptoms  observed  in the CTP-543 treatment  groups  were  
progressive over time through 24 weeks and appeared to be dose responsive.  Significant  
differences  from placebo  were  noted  as early  as 12 weeks into  treatment.  
CTP-543 was generally  well tolerated in  all Cohorts.  
Study CP543.2002 was a randomized, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability  
of two dosing regimens (8 mg BID versus 16 mg QD) of CTP -543 in adult patients with  
moderate  to severe  alopecia  areata.  Fifty -seven  patients were  randomized  to receive  
CTP-543 either  8 mg  BID or 16  mg QD  over a  24-week  treatment  period.  The  trial measured  the 
relative change in SALT score between Week 24 and Baseline.  Efficacy results in the 8 mg BID  
arm were  consistent  with the previously -reported  8 mg  BID results  from the  CP543.2001  trial 
and showed superiority of the 8 mg BID dose group over the 16 mg QD dose group.  Treatment  
was generally  well tolerated in both arms of  the study.  
CP543.2003 was a randomized, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two  
dosing regimens  (12 mg BID versus 24 mg QD) of CTP -543 in adult patients with moderate to  
severe alopecia areata.  Sixty -six patients were randomized to receive CTP -543 either 12 mg  
BID or 24 mg QD over a 24 -week treatment period.  The trial measured the relative change in  
SALT score between Week 24 and Baseline.  The primary outcome for the CP543.2003 study  
was the relative  change  in SALT  score  for each dose  regimen  from  Baseline  at Week 24.  
Following  24 weeks of  dosing, subjects  in the 12 mg BID dose group  had a 60%  relative  change  
to Baseline  in total  SALT score  at Week 24  compared  to 52% in the 24 mg  QD dose group.  
CTP-543 was generally  well tolerated  in both  24 mg/day  dosing  regimens.  
Both  dose regimen studies  support  the continued  use of the  BID dosing  regimen  in the Phase  3 
program.  
Study CP543.5001 is an Open -Label Extension study in patients with alopecia areata who were  
previously enrolled in a qualifying clinical trial with CTP -543 and completed through the 24 - 
week Treatment Period.  Patients will receive dail y treatment with CTP -543 at a dose of 8 mg  
BID or 12 mg BID for up to 164 weeks in this study.  Previously qualifying CTP -543 clinical  
trials include: Cohort 3  from Study  CP543.2001, Study  CP543.2002, and Study  CP543.2003.  
Taken  together,  the safety  results  of the Phase  2 clinical trials  performed to -date appeared  to 
show  an overall acceptable risk -benefit profile  for CTP -543.

 7. OVERALL  STUDY  DESIGN  
7.1. Study  Design  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy  
and safety of CTP -543 in adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata.  Patients will  
require a definitive diagnosis of alopecia areata by [CONTACT_841307].  The patien t’s alopecia areata will be  
classified  by [CONTACT_841308]:  
1) Partial  scalp hair  loss (SALT  score ≥  50 and < 95); 
2) Complete  or near-complete  scalp  hair loss (SALT  ≥ 95).  
Patients will be between [ADDRESS_1168924] 50% hair  
loss as measured by [CONTACT_580365], and should not be treated  
concurrently  for alopecia areata  or with other  treatments that  might affect  hair regrowth.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) will perform regular safety assessments.  
The DMC will convene to review accumulated safety data at regular intervals specified in the  
DMC Charter.  The DMC will determine if there are adequate safety data to support continuation  
of a particular dose group or individual patient and may advise study and/or treatment arm  
cessation due to intolerability  at any  time.  
The Screening Period may last up to [ADDRESS_1168925] -Treatment Safety  Follow -up to assess safety  following  treatment  
completion.

Patients will provide appropriately -obtained informed consent prior to initiating any screening  
procedures.  Patients meeting initial screening criteria will be eligible to continue to the Day 1  
visit for review of eligibility and bas eline assessments, including SALT assessment, physical  
examination, clinical laboratory assessments, and vital signs.  Patients will be randomized in a  
3:5:2  ratio (12 mg BID:8  mg BID:placebo).  Randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_841309]: 1) Partial scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 50 and < 95); 2)  
Complete  or near-complete scalp hair  loss (SALT  ≥ 95).  
The double -blind, placebo -controlled Treatment Period for each group will last [ADDRESS_1168926] to food, for the  
duration of  the Treatment Period.  Patients should  take study  drug in the clinic on all Study  Visit  
Days after clinical laboratory blood draws are completed.  All efficacy, patient and clinician  
reported outcomes, and laboratory and safety assessments will be conducted according to the  
Schedule  of Assessments  (Table 2). 
Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_841310],  
and supported by [CONTACT_841311], and DMC.  Chemistry, hematology,  
and lipid laboratory values will be monitored closely for the du ration of the study.  Chemistry

integrity, alternative methods for drug dispensation and assessments, including telemedicine  
visits and clinical laboratory blood draws at a local laboratory or via a Home Health Care  
agency, may be offered for those trial participan ts who may no longer have access to the  
investigational site.  Additional information will be documented in study manuals.  Significant  
cytopenias or other hematologic abnormalities will be managed by [CONTACT_841312], an d signs and symptoms of infection will be closely monitored  
and treated promptly.  Patients who experience intolerable symptoms during treatment may  
discontinue treatment at the judgement of the Investigator, but will continue in the study and  
complete all assessments unless they withdraw consent.  Patients may withdraw consent at any  
time.  
 
7.2. Number  of Patients  and Sites  
Approximately 700 patients are planned to be randomized in the study at approximately 70 study  
centers.  
 
7.3. Method  of Treatment  Assignment and  Blinding  
Patients will be randomized in a 3:5:2 ratio (12 mg BID:8 mg BID:placebo). Randomization will  
be stratified by [CONTACT_580367]: 1) Partial scalp hair loss  
(SALT ≥ 50 and < 95); 2) Complete or near -complete scalp hair loss (SALT ≥ 95). The  
randomization  schedule  will be  generated prior  to study  start.  
All study  patients,  Investigators,  and site study  staff will be blinded  to study  drug assignment  for 
the duration of the study.  Tablets and packaging of CTP -543 and placebo will be identical in  
appearance.  
 
7.4. Rationale  for Study  Design,  Doses,  and Primary  Endpoint  
Double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled studies are considered optimal for obtaining  
unbiased estimates of the efficacy and safety of investigational products.  The Severity of  
Alopecia Tool (SALT)  (Olsen, 2004 ) was introduced  as part  of investigative guidelines  
published by [CONTACT_841313] t he extent of the  
scalp surface hair loss in AA.  The SALT has been used as the hair loss measurement scale in all  
the studies of CTP -543 in patients with alopecia areata to date.  The 24 -week duration of the  
Treatment Period has been shown to be sufficient i n establishing hair regrowth with CTP -543 
and to significantly  differentiate  active  doses  from placebo  as well as differentiate  between  doses  
of CTP -543. 
The selection of the 8 mg and 12 mg BID doses of CTP -543 for this study is supported by [CONTACT_841314] a nd safety of CTP -543 observed in the completed and analyzed Phase 2 CP543.2001,  
CP543.2002, and CP543.2003 studies.  Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in CP543.2001  
showed that the proportions of responders (patients achieving at least a 50% relativ e reduction in  
SALT  score  from Baseline  at Week  24) were  significantly  greater in  the 8 mg BID group and  
12 mg BID group compared  with the placebo  group  (P <0.001  for both)  and compared  with the 
4 mg BID group ( P = 0.030  and P = 0.003, respectively).  For  the analysis performed  on the  
efficacy  population, 9.3%  of patients  in the placebo group and 21.4%  of patients  in the  4 mg BID 
CTP-543 
Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021  
Concert  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  28  
 group were responders, compared with 47.4% in the 8 mg BID group and 58.3% in the [ADDRESS_1168928] 50%,  75%,  and 90% relative  reduction  in SALT  
score  by [CONTACT_10585] 24  compared with both the  placebo  group  and the 4  mg BID group.  
Additionally, both the 8 mg BID group and the 12 mg BID group had significantly greater  
proportions  of patients  who achieved  an absolute  SALT  score  ≤20 at Week  24 compared  with 
the placebo group.  Achieving a SALT score ≤ 20 has been reported by [CONTACT_841315] -meaningful treatment success for AA ( Wyrwich, 2020 ). In the  
Wyrwich study, qualitative interviews were conducted in the US with hair expert dermatologists  
and AA patients who had experienced ≥50% scalp hair loss.  The clinicians judged that 80%  
scalp hair represented treatment success.  Adult and adolescent AA patients participating in the  
study  perceived that, short of  100%  scalp hair, the  presence  of ~70 -90% scalp hair  (median 80%)  
represented treatment success.  Nearly all queried clinicians and patients in this study agreed that  
for patients  with ≥  50% scalp  hair loss, successful  treatment would  be hair regrowth  resulting  in 
≤ 20% scalp  hair loss. 
Therefore, based on the efficacy and safety data observed in the CP543.2001, CP543.2002, and  
CP543.2003 studies, 8 mg BID and 12 mg BID of CTP -543 will be assessed further for efficacy  
and safety in the Phase 3 program in patients with moderate to severe alopecia are ata. This 
Phase 3 study will employ SALT as the hair loss assessment tool and the primary efficacy  
endpoint will be the percentage of patients who achieve a SALT score ≤ 20, as this represents a  
clinically -meaningful  treatment success  for patients with  AA.

8.3. Patient  Withdrawal  Criteria  
For all patients, it is the intent that patients who discontinue study medication (at any time) for  
any reason will continue to be followed for all protocol -planned study visits through the  
completion of the [ADDRESS_1168942] all endp oints (including efficacy)  
collected  accordingly.  
The Investigator, Sponsor, or its designee may decide a patient should discontinue treatment at  
any time and for any  reason.  In  addition,  patients  will discontinue  randomized  treatment  if they:  
 Experience an intolerable adverse event, including but not limited to bone marrow  
related events characterized by [CONTACT_841317], or a ≥  
Grade 3 cardiac event, or a ≥ Grade 4 (other) adverse event (CTCAE v5.0 criteria)  
considered possibl y related to study drug.  Because laboratory abnormalities can  
occasionally occur that do not in themselves pose an unacceptable risk to subject  
safety (e.g., CK elevations with exercise, laboratory errors or artifacts), the  
occurrence of a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1168943] should discontinue randomized treatment.  Documentation on the  
determination  will be  maintained in the study  files;  
 Require a medication that is prohibited by [CONTACT_760].  However, under certain  
circumstances, and in consultation with t he Medical Monitor, short -term use of a  
prohibited medication may not necessitate withdrawal of treatment when its use is  
unlikely  to unfavorably  alter the  risk-benefit of subject participation;  
 In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2819], have  any medically  approp riate reason;  
 Become  pregnant;  
 Have  a serious adverse  event associated with a  SARS -CoV -2 infection;

  The Investigator believes that further treatment is undesirable or the risk -benefit  
profile  has become unfavorable.  
Furthermore, dose interruptions lasting more than [ADDRESS_1168944]  
the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant electronic case report form (eCRF).  The 
specific  reason for the  withdrawal should be carefully  documented on the  eCRF.  
 
8.4. Emergency  Unblinding  of Treatment  Assignment  
In the case of a medical requirement to  break the blind to determine appropriate treatment for an  
adverse  event,  unblinding  of a patient’s  treatment  assignment  can be achieved  through  the study - 
specific Interactive Web Response System.  If possible, the Investigator should discuss the  
circumsta nces with the Medical Monitor(s) prior to accessing unblinding information.  In the  
event of a blind break, the Medical Monitor(s) will be notified through the electronic data  
capture system.  The patient for whom the blind is broken should be subsequently w ithdrawn  
from the study.  The details regarding the process of breaking the blind are outlined in the  
Medical  Monitoring  Plan and the Pharmacy  Manual.  
 
8.5. Criteria  for Study  Termination  
The DMC will review cumulative safety data at regular intervals throughout the study.  Should  
safety signals arise that suggest treatment with CTP -543 poses an unjustified risk to patients,  
termination of the study or modification of dosing arms may occur u pon Sponsor review of the  
DMC  recommendation.  The DMC  may call for unscheduled data review meetings at  any time to  
ensure  appropriate  safety  monitoring.  
Events  that could  trigger  an unscheduled  review  may include,  but are  not limited to:  
High  frequency  of dose interruptions  
High  frequency  of, or a trend  in, SAEs  
High  frequency  of Grade  3/4 adverse  events  
Trend  in organ  system -specific  moderate  and/or  severe  adverse  events  
High  frequency  of patient  discontinuation  of treatment due  to adverse  events  
The Sponsor will notify  Investigators of  any recommendation of  study  termination by  [CONTACT_1363].  
The Sponsor will notify Investigators of recommendation for study modification as necessary to  
protect patient safety including appropriate instructions for removing p atients from treatment,  
while maintaining  the blind.

the Treatment Period and will be instructed to take study drug approximately every 12 hours (± 3  
hours)  without regard to food for the  duration of  the study.  
 
9.2. Dose -Adjustment  Criteria  
No individualized dose adjustment is allowed during the Treatme nt Period except in the event of  
intolerability, for which a dose interruption or patient discontinuation may occur at the  
judgement of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor (see Section 9.2.1 below  
for details).  
The DMC will review cumulative safety data throughout the study in accordance with the DMC  
Charter.  If the DMC determines that the high dose of CTP -543 should be stopped for safety  
reasons, patients rec eiving treatment at that dose will move to the low dose of CTP -543 at the  
patient’s next visit.  If an immediate hazard is suspected, patients without an imminent visit may  
have an Unscheduled Visit for potential dose adjustment to maintain the blind.  In the event of  
CTP-[ADDRESS_1168947] their dose interrupted at the discretion of the Investigator.  The Medical Monitor(s)  
should  be consulted whenever possible  prior  to decisions for  dose interruption.  
Patients  who withdraw  consent  and therefore are  discontinued  from  the study  should  undergo  an 
Early Termination Visit and associated adverse events should be followed as described in  
Section [ADDRESS_1168948] 4  weeks of the Treatment  Period,  
and every 4 weeks thereafter for the remainder of the study.  Prior to dose interruption,  
hematology parameters should be confirmed with repeat testing at an Unscheduled Visit within  
72 hours, except in severe cases (i.e.: neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 109/L) where immediate  
interruption of dosing is necessary for the safety of the patient.  Blood draws confirming dose  
interruption  criteria  should  occur  prior to  the first daily dose  on the  day of draw.

JAK inhibitors or  immunosuppressants.  
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary  for the  wellbeing  of the  patient may  be given at  
the discretion of the Investigator.  Use of medications that are prohibited per protocol will  
requi re patient withdrawal from the study.  However, under certain circumstances, and in  
consultation with the Medical Monitor, short -term use of a prohibited medication may not  
necessitate withdrawal when its use is unlikely to unfavorably alter the risk -benefi t of subject  
participation  or confound  the study  endpoints.  
The following  treatments  are not permitted  during  the study:  
 Medications that may affect hair regrowth or immune response (such as:

 10. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND  PROCEDURES  
The schedule of assessments and procedures is presented in Table 2 and should be referenced for  
details regarding the collection of each assessment at each visit.  Due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, patient safety and some other assessments outlined below may be performed remotely  
if travel restrictions, quarantine, and/or site closures are presented and the Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_841274].  
10.1. Demographic  Characteristics  and Medical  History  
Demographic characteristics [i.e., sex, ethnic origin, date of birth (as appropriate per local  
regulations),  and calculated body  mass  index] will  be collected at the  Screening  Visit,  between  
Day -28 and  -1, and detailed on the eCRF.  
The patient’s  alopecia areata  will be  classified by  [CONTACT_841319]:  
1) Partial  scalp  hair loss (SALT  ≥ 50 and < 95); 
2) Complete  or near-complete  scalp  hair loss (SALT  ≥ 95).  
Key criteria that distinguish alopecia areata from other forms of hair loss may include abrupt  
onset of disease, a history of recurrence and spontaneous remission, response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_841275], and distribution of hair loss pattern.  Care must be taken during  
the evaluation  to assess  for other  causes  of hair loss  such as trichotillomania, or  scarring  alopecia  
and other forms of non -scarring alopecia.  Evidence of thinning hair sh ould be distinguished  
from pattern hair loss or telogen effluvium and evidence of inflammation should be investigated  
to rule out infection, as appropriate.  
Thorough medical history, including current medications and any prior janus kinase (JAK)  
inhibitor use, nail and facial hair involvement, co -morbidities, serious infection history and  
exposure risk, including HIV, as well as history or vaccination against herpes zoster will be  
collected  at the Screening  Visit,  and at  the Randomization  Visit  on Day  [ADDRESS_1168956] herpes zoster or other recent live virus vaccinations, prior  
SARS -CoV-2 infection, as well as cancer risk  due to the potential immunosuppressive properties  
and known adverse  events  associated with JAK  inhibitors.  
 
10.2. Severity  of Alopecia  Tool  (SALT)  
The SALT score was introduced as part of investigative guidelines published by [CONTACT_841320] ( Olsen, 2004 ). The SALT is a measure of hair loss that quantifies  
the amount of scalp surface without hair in a pre -specified quadrant of the scalp (right side, top,  
left side, back), that  is further  summed  after applying  a quadrant -specific  multiplier  indicative  of 
scalp surface area contribution, to provide an overall score of total hair loss.  The SALT  
assessment will occur via live examination of the patient during clinic visits.  If a patient is  
unable to attend an in -person clinic visit du e to COVID -19, a SALT assessment will not be  
performed.  Missed  assessments  will be  recorded  in the  eCRF  as due  to COVID -19.

assessment of SALT as well as potential changes in SALT scores throughout the study.  Scalp  
photographs will correspond to the 4 defined quadrants of the SALT assessment and will be  
taken  when  SALT assessments  are performed.  Photographs  of the scalp  will b e used to support  
rater training and continued monitoring throughout the course of the trial.  However, no formal  
analyses  will be  performed on the photographs.  
Photographs of the eyebrows and eyelashes will be taken at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24 as  
outlined in Table 2 . A formal analysis via photographs will be performed for those patients with  
eyebrow  and/or eyelash involvement.  
A photograph of the hands will be taken at the same timepoints as eyebrows and eyelashes to  
document  potential  changes  for those with  nail involvement  throughout  the study  compared to  
Baseline.  No formal  analyses  of nail involvement will occur.  
If a patient  is unable  to attend  an in-person clinic  visit due to COVID -19, photographs  will not be 
performed.  Missed  assessments will  be recorded  in the  eCRF as due  to COVID -19. 
 
10.4. Global  Impression  Scales  
The Global  Impression  Scales  are measures  commonly  used in clinical  trials  to allow  integration  
of several sources of information into a single rating of the patient’s condition.  The Global  
Impression Scales employ a [ADDRESS_1168958] udy, the Global Impression Scale of Severity and the Global Impression Scale of  
Improvement  will be  performed by  [CONTACT_841321] 2 . 
 
10.4.1.  Clinical  Global  Impression of  Severity  (CGI -S) 
The Clinical Global Impression Scale of Severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_841322]’s alopecia areata at the time of assessment.  The Investigator  
may select one of seven numeric choices representing “Among the most extreme hair loss” to  
“Normal, no hair loss”.  To reduce variability, one rater should perform the CGI -S assessment  
for the patient.  An example of the CGI -S is provided in Section 17.3.1 . If a patient is unable to  
attend an in -person clinic visit due to COVID -19, the CGI -S will not be performed.  Missed  
assessments  will be recorded in the  eCRF  as due  to COVID -19.

 10.4.2.  Clinical  Global  Impression  of Improvement  (CGI -I) 
The Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement will be assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
Compared to  the patient’s alopecia  areata  prior to  treatment at  Baseline, the  patient’s current  
state of alopecia areata will be assessed according to the Investigator’s perceived change.  The 
Investigator may select one of seven numeric choices representing “Very Much Worse” to “Very  
Much Improved”.  To reduce variability, one rater should perform the  CGI-I assessment for the  
patient for the duration of the study.  An example of the CGI -I is provided in Section 17.3.2 . If a 
patient is unable to attend an in -person clinic visit due to COVID -19, the CGI -I will not be  
perfor med.  Missed  assessments  will be recorded  in the  eCRF  as due  to COVID -19. 
 
10.4.3.  Patient  Global  Impression  of Severity  (PGI -S) 
The Patient Global  Impression Scale  of Severity  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_841323]/her alopecia areata at the time of assessment.  The Patient may select one of  
seven numeric choices representing “Among the most extreme hair loss” to “Normal, no hair  
loss”.  An example of the PGI -S is provided in Section 17.3.3 . If a patient is unable to attend an  
in-person clinic visit due to COVID -19, the PGI -S should be performed via a virtual visit with  
video  capability.  
10.4.4.  Patient  Global  Impression  of Improvement  (PGI -I) 
The Patient  Global  Impression  Scale of Improvement will be  assessed  by [CONTACT_102].  Compared  
to the patient’s alopecia areata prior to treatment at Baseline, the patient’s current state of  
alopecia areata will be assessed according to his/her perceived change.  The patient may select  
one o f seven numeric choices representing “Very Much Worse” to “Very Much Improved”.  An 
example of the PGI -I is provided in Section 17.3.4 . If a patient is unable to attend an in -person  
clinic visit due to COVID -19, the PGI -I should be performed via a virtual visit with video  
capability.  
 
10.5. Hair  Satisfaction  and Hair  Quality  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  
The Hair Satisfaction Patient Reported Outcome (SPRO) is a single item questionnaire answer ed 
by [CONTACT_841324].  The Hair Quality Patient Reported Outcome (QPRO) questionnaire  
provides additional details on key attributes of their hair and t o help provide context to the SPRO  
response.  The SPRO and QPRO are provided in Section 17.4. If a patient is unable to attend an  
in-person clinic visit due to COVID -19, the SPRO and QPRO should be performed via a virtual  
visit with video capability.  
 
10.6. HADS  
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) is a 14 -item measure designed to assess  
anxiety and depression symptoms in medical patients.  Items are rated on a 4 -point severity  
scale.  The HADS produces two scales, one for  anxiety (HADS –A) and one for depression  
(HADS –D). An example of the HADS is provided in Section 17.5. If a patient is unable to  
attend  an in-person  clinic visit  due to  COVID -19, the HADS  should be  performed  via a virtual  
visit with video capability.

 10.7. BETA  
The Brigham Eyebrow Tool for Alopecia (BETA) is a clinician -rated scale that assesses the total  
eyebrow hair present.  The scale is used for each eyebrow in which the Individual Eyebrow  
Score is derived by [CONTACT_580381] (D) x surface area (SA).  An expert panel will perform  
central readings based on photographs of the eyebrows and will provide a score for each patient  
with eyebrow involvement.  The BETA will be performed at Baseline , Week 12, and Week 24.  
Additional detail on how to take the photographs for the central read of the BETA will be  
outlined in a separate study manual.  If a patient is unable to attend an in -person clinic visit due  
to COVID -19, the BETA may not be performed  due to the inability to take photographs of the  
eyebrows.  Missed  assessments  will be  recorded  in the  eCRF  as due  to COVID -19. 
 
10.8. BELA  
The Brigham Eyelash Tool for Alopecia (BELA) is a clinician -rated scale that assesses the total  
eyelash hair present.  The s cale is used for each eye in which the Total Eyelash Score is derived  
by [CONTACT_580381] (D) and distribution on the right and left eye.  An expert panel will  
perform central readings based on photographs of the eyelashes and will provide a score for each 
patient with eyelash involvement.  The BELA will be performed at Baseline, Week 12, and  
Week 24.   Additional detail on how to take the photographs for the central read of the BELA  
will be outlined in a separate study manual.  If a patient is unable to attend an in -person clinic  
visit due to COVID -19, the BELA  may not be performed  due to the  inability  to take  photographs  
of the eyelashes.  Missed  assessments  will be  recorded in the  eCRF  as due to COVID -19. 
10.9. Vital  Signs,  Weight,  and Height  
Vital signs will be measured after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -supi[INVESTIGATOR_841276] [ADDRESS_1168959] of care.  Patients should wear light clothing,  
empty pockets of heavy objects, and remove his/her shoes before weight is measured.  Height  
will be measured per institution standard of care, after the patient has removed his/her shoes.  
Height will only be measur ed at the Screening Visit.  Weight and vital signs will be measured  
according to the Schedule of Assessments.  Weight and height will be used to calculate the  
patient’s  body  mass  index  at Screening.  Refer  to the  Schedule  of Assessments  for assessment  
timepoints  (Table 2). 
In the event a patient is unable to attend an in -clinic visit due to COVID -19, vital signs may be  
performed  by a Home  Health Care  agency.  
 
10.10.  Physical  Examination  
Per the Sche dule of Assessments ( Table 2 ) a complete physical examination will consist of an  
examination of all major organ systems to include, but not be limited to, chest auscultation,  
abdominal auscultat ion and palpation, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat.  An assessment for  
active signs and symptoms of infection including tuberculosis, and skin examinations for non - 
melanoma skin cancers, will be performed.  Evaluation for progressive multifocal  
leukoencephalopathy (PML) symptoms such as facial droop, general weakness, clumsiness,  
trouble  speaking, personality  changes, memory  problems,  and vision  changes will be  assessed.

CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  47  
 Additionally,  an assessment  for the presence  or absence  of nasal  hair will be performed  during  
complete  physical exams.  
Per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ), brief physical examinations will include assessment  
for active signs and symptoms of infec tion, including tuberculosis, skin examinations for non - 
melanoma skin cancers, and an evaluation for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  
(PML) symptoms such as facial droop, general weakness, clumsiness, trouble speaking,  
personality  changes, memor y problems,  and vision changes.  
If telemedicine visits are warranted due to COVID -19, the focus of a virtual physical exam  
should be on evaluation of safety, including assessing for active signs and symptoms of  
infection,  exposure  to TB,  and inquiry  on changes  to skin lesions and/or  moles indicative  of skin 
cancers  and signs and symptoms of PML.  
 
10.11.  Electrocardiogram  
Twelve -lead electrocardiograms will be performed at the screening visit and end of study after  
the patient has rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.  Individual  
parameters  including  heart  rate, PR, QT, QTcF,  QRS,  and RR intervals  will be collected.  Repeat  
electrocardiograms (if deemed necessary) should be performed at least 5 minutes apart.  A 
central reading center wi ll be used to read all ECGs and determine QT/QTc intervals.  The 
Investigator should indicate review of the electrocardiogram report by [CONTACT_841325].  If a patient is unable to attend an in -person clinic visit due to COVID -19, an ECG may  
not be performed.  Missed  assessments will  be recorded  in the  eCRF as due to COVID -19. 
 
10.12.  Clinical  Laboratory  Assessments  
Clinical laboratory assessments are presented in Section 17.1. Clinical laboratory samples  
should be collect ed at the beginning of each clinic visit and just prior to a dose on all Study Visit  
Days and will be processed by a central laboratory.  In the event a patient is unable to attend an  
in-clinic visit due to COVID -19, clinical laboratory blood draws may be p erformed by a Home  
Health Care agency or a local laboratory.  Patients should try to have laboratory blood draws  
performed in the morning and dose study drug after clinical laboratory blood draws are  
completed.  
The results  of clinical  laboratory  tests condu cted at the Screening  Visit  (and prior  to dosing)  
must  be assessed  by [CONTACT_841326]’s  eligibility  for participation  in the 
study.  The Investigator should indicate review of the laboratory reports throughout the study by  
[CONTACT_841327].  
All clinical laboratory results that fall outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_841328],  not clinically  significant,  or Abnormal, clinically  significant.  
Laboratory results deemed Abnormal, clinica lly significant will be recorded as an adverse event  
in the eCRF (see additional criteria outlined in Section 11.1). Clinically significant laboratory  
abnormalities indicative of hematologic or other effects requiring interve ntion should be  
discussed  with the Medical  Monitor(s).  Additional  tests and evaluations  required to  establish  the 
significance or etiology of a clinically significant abnormal result or to monitor the course of an  
adverse event should be obtained when clinically indicated.  Whenever possible, the etiology of  
the clinically  significant abnormal  findings will be  documented  on the  eCRF.

An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug (ie,  
Day 1), will be considered a pretreatment adverse event and will be captured on the eCRF.  
Adverse events will be considered treatment -emergent if the onset is af ter the first dose of study  
drug.  
An abnormal  laboratory  value is  considered  to be an  adverse  event if  the abnormality:  
 Is considered clinically  significant; OR  
 results  in discontinuation  from  the study;  OR 
 is judged by [CONTACT_841329],  modification/interruption  of investigational  product  dose,  or any  other  
therapeutic  intervention.  
Regardless  of severity  grade,  only laboratory  abnormalities  that fulfill a  seriousness  criterion  
need to be documented as a  serious adverse  event.  
If a laboratory  abnormality  is one  component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then  only the diagnosis  
or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of  
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the adverse  
event.  If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not  
simply as an abnormal laboratory result (e.g., record t hrombocytopenia rather than decreased  
platelets).  
Vaccine -related AEs (e.g. fever, fatigue, headache) resulting directly from the vaccination may  
occur.  The temporal relationship of the event(s) to the vaccination should be clearly described  
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_841277] “unlikely” to be, or are “not related” to study  
medication.

 11.2. Evaluation  of Adverse  Events  
A qualified Investigator will  evaluate  all adverse  events  as to seriousness, severity/intensity,  
relationship  to study  drug, duration, action taken,  and outcome.  
 
11.2.1.  Serious  Adverse  Event  
A serious  adverse  event  is an adverse  event,  as per Title  21 CFR  312.32  and ICH E2A.II.B  that 
fulfills  the following  criteria:  
 Is fatal  (results  in death);  
 Is life -threatening (Note: the term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the  
patient  was at risk  of death  at the  time of the event;  it does  not refer  to an  event  that 
could  hypothetically  have caused death had it been more  severe);  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841278],  regardless  of length  of stay);  
 Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  (a substantial  disruption  of the 
patient's  ability  to conduct normal life  functions);  
 Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  or 
 Constitutes  an important  medical  event that  may jeopardize  the patient or may  require  
medical  or surgical  intervention to  prevent  one of  the other outcomes  listed  above.  
Important  medical events  are defined  as those  occurrences that  may not be immediately  
life-threatening  or result  in death,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or disability,  but may jeopardize  the patient  or 
require  medical  or surgical  intervention to  prevent  one of the  other  outcomes  listed above.  
Examples  of such medical  events  include  allergic bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  treatment  in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Events  not considered to be serious  adverse  events  are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15976]: 
 A procedure  for protocol/disease -related  investigations  (e.g.,  sampling  for 
laboratory).  However,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841279] a complication  
of such procedures  remains a  reportable  serious adverse  event.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social  
reasons,  in absence  of an  adverse event.  
 A procedure  that is planned  (i.e., planned  prior  to the starting  of treatment on  study);  
must be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170043] a complication remains a reportable serious adverse  
event.  
 An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing medical conditi on 
that does not worsen.  
 Emergency  outpatient  treatment  or observation  that does not  result  in admission,  
unless  fulfilling  other  seriousness criteria  above.

and outcome.  
Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will be handled through the electronic data capture  
system or other appropriate means.  Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be  
handled by  [CONTACT_756].  
 
11.2.2.  Severity/Intensity  
For both adverse events  and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the  
severity/intensity  of the event.  
The National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
(v5.0) should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events.  These c riteria will be provided  
in the Site Operations Manual.  If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the Investigator should  
grade  the severity  according  to the  following  criteria:  
 Grade  1 (mild):  does not interfere  with the patient’s  usual  function  
 Grade  2 (moderate):  interferes  to some  extent  with patient's  usual  function  
 Grade  3 (severe):  interferes  significantly  with patient's  usual  function  
 Grade  4 (life-threatening): results in  a threat  to life or in an  incapacitating  disability  
 Grade  5 (death):  results  in death  
The term “severe”  is often used  to describe  the intensity  of a specific  event  (as in mild, moderate  
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical  
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is  
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a  
patient’s  life or functioning.  
Seriousness,  not severity,  serves  as a guide  for defining  regulatory  obliga tions.  
 
11.2.3.  Relationship  to Study  Drug  
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event  
based on currently available information.  Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as  
additional  information  becomes  available.  Adverse  events  will be classified  by [CONTACT_841330]:  
Related  for Regulatory Reporting  Assessment:  
 Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other  
possible  contributing  factors  can be ruled  out. The clinical  event,  including  an abnormal  
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and  
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The event  
resolves or improves upon withdrawal of drug (de -challenge).  The event would be  
considered as definitely related to the study drug upon results of a positive re -challenge  
procedure.  
CTP-543 
Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021  
Concert  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  52  
  Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event  
occurred  within  a reasonable  time after administration of  the trial medication).  However,  
the influence of other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s  
clinical condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is  
unlikely, and the event follows a clinically reasonable response upon withdrawal of drug  
(de-challenge).  
 Possibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event  
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the stu dy drug).  However, the  
influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical  
condition,  other concurrent  disease, concomitant  medications or  events).  
Unrelated  for Regulatory  Reporting  Assessment:  
 Unlikely Related : A cl inical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal  relationship  to drug administration  makes  a causal  relationship  improbable  (e.g.,  
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial  
medication) and in which other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide  
plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant  
treatments).  
 Not related : The adverse event is completely independent of study drug administr ation,  
and/or  evidence  exists  that the  event  is definitely  related  to another  etiology.  There  must  
be an alternative, definitive  etiology  documented  by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
11.2.4.  Duration  
For all adverse  events  whether  or not considered serious,  the Investigator  will provide  a record  of 
the start and stop dates of the event.  Every effort should be made to resolve all adverse events  
with continued follow -up with the patient until appropriate resolution can be achieved.  If an 
event  is unresolved at the  end of the st udy it will  be recorded  as ongoing.  
 
11.2.5.  Action  Taken  
The Investigator will record the action taken with investigational product as a result of an  
adverse event or serious adverse event on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, or  
interruption of inve stigational product, as appropriate) and record if concomitant and/or  
additional  treatments were  given for  the event.  
 
11.2.6.  Outcome  
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g.,  
recovered,  recovered  with sequelae,  not recovered,  or death (due  to the  adverse  event).  
 
11.3. Follow -Up 
Adverse  events,  severe adverse  events  and serious adverse  events, including  clinically  significant  
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, or physical examination findings, will be followed,  
regardless of causality, for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or  
until the event stabilizes, is otherwise explained, death occurs, or the patient is lost to follow up.  
If resolved, a  resolution  date should  be provided.  The Investigator  is responsible  for ensuring  
CTP-543 
Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021  
Concert  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  53  
 that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or  
causality of the adverse event.  This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or  
investigation s, examinations,  or consultation  with other  health  care professionals  as is practical.  
 
11.4. Pregnancy  
The Sponsor must be informed within 24 hours upon learning that a patient, or male patient’s  
partner, has become pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_1168963] dose of study drug.  The Pregnancy Notification eCRF in EDC should be used to report the  
pregnancy to the Sponsor or its designee.  Patient pregnancies (or pregnancy of a male patient’s  
partner) must be followed until termination of pregnancy or the birth of the child.  The 
Pregnancy Outcome eCRF should be used to report information regarding the status of the  
infant.  
If pregnancy  occurs  in a female  patient, t hen study  drug should  be discontinued immediately.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication  
should be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event if reporting criteria are met.  
Spontaneous abortion, and any congenital anomaly or birth defect in the patient’s (or male  
patient’s  partner’s)  newborn should  be reported as  an SAE.  
If a female partner of a male patient taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male  
patient  taking  the investigation al product  should  notify  the Investigator,  and the pregnant  female  
partner  should be  advised to  call her healthcare  provider  immediately.  
 
11.5. Recording  Adverse  Events  
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from  
the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study visit are to be recorded in the  
eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a sepa rate entry.  The Investigator will  
provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, action(s) taken,  
outcome, and relationship to the study drug.  All adverse events should be documented in the  
patient’s  source  documents.  
11.6. Repor ting Adverse  Events  
The Investigator must report to Sponsor or its designee all adverse events that occur during the  
study from the time written informed consent is given until the final study visit or early  
termination, regardless of their relationship to  the study drug.  Serious adverse events and  
pregnancies will be reported from the time written informed consent is given through completion  
of the safety  follow -up visit, as applicable.  
 
11.6.1.  Reporting  Serious  Adverse  Events  
The Investigator is required to noti fy the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s designated Drug Safety  
Unit within 24 hours after becoming aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event.  All 
serious adverse events will be reported through completion of the adverse event eCRF.  The 
Investigator  will be  responsible  for reporting  serious  adverse events  to the IRB/EC.

11.6.2.  Reporting  Urgent  Safety  Issues  
If the study site staff becomes aware of an actual or potential urgent safety issue, then the  
Sponsor  and Sponsor’s  designee  [Medical  Monitor(s)]  must  be immediately  contact[CONTACT_841331].  An urgent  safety  issue  is defined as:  
 An immediate  hazard to  the health or  safety  of patients  participating  in a clinical  
study  
 A serious  risk to  human  health  or potentially  a serious  risk to  human health  
An urgent safety  issue  may include: (1) issues with an investigational drug  or comparators;  
(2) study  procedures;  (3) inter-current  illness  (including  pandemic  infections);  (4) concomitant  
medications; (5) concurrent medical conditions; or (6) any other issues related to the safe  
conduct of the  study  or that pose a  risk to study  patients.  
In exceptional  circumstances  of imminent  hazard and  in order  to safeguard the  health  or safety  of 
individuals, the Investigators may take urgent safety measures before informing the Sponsor, but  
the Sponsor must be informed immediately  after the  hazard  has resolved.

 Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median,  
minimum  value,  and maximum  value)  and categorical  measures  will be presented  as number and  
percentage.  
Additional  details  for statistical  methods  will be provided  in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan.  
 
12.4.1.  Disposition  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Disposition  will be summarized by  [CONTACT_841333].  The number  and percentage  of 
patients, who are randomized, treated, prematurely discontinued, (overall and by [CONTACT_386622]),  and complete the  study  will be  summarized.  
Baseline  characteristics  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570].  
The number  of patients  in each treatment  group  will be summarized  for each investigative  site 
for the Treatment Period.  Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for  
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology and summarized by [CONTACT_841334].  Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_841335] -Therapeutic -Chemical classification and 
preferred  term.  
12.4.2.  Efficacy  
The primary analysis targets an effect of treatment (response rates at 24 weeks) among subjects  
given the opportunity for treatment who are dispensed study drug.  The treatment policy strategy  
is used for the intercurrent event of discontinuation of study treatment (either temporarily or  
permanently) and so the response rates at [ADDRESS_1168967], irrespective of continued  
therapy,  in line with the intent -to-treat principle.  
For the primary efficacy analysis and the key se condary efficacy analysis, a 0.025 (two -sided)  
alpha -level will be allocated to each dose for comparison with placebo to adjust for multiplicity  
of testing associated with two doses.  Additional secondary endpoints will be tested in the  
following order (see  Section 12.4.3) and be considered statistically significant and alpha -level  
protected if they (and all prior endpoints in the hierarchy for that dose versus placebo) achieve  
statistical significance at the 0.025 level of significance.  Irrespective, nomina l p-values will be  
provided.  Testing will be performed only for the Treatment Period.  Missing values will be  
handled  as specified in Section  12.4.4 . 
Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary effic acy endpoint will be the proportion of patients achieving an absolute SALT  
score  ≤ [ADDRESS_1168968] using baseline scalp hair loss (partial vs complete/near - 
complete)  as the  stratification factor,  for each active  treatment  group  versus placebo.

Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021  
Concert  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  58  
 Other  Efficacy  Endpoints  
For proportions of patients achieving specified improvement criteria (eg, CGI -I and PGI -I 
responders),  pairwise  treatment  group  differences  from  placebo  at each scheduled  evaluation  will 
be assessed with the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test using baseline scalp hair loss as the  
stratification  factor. 
Absolute and/or relative changes in SALT score, SPRO score, CGI -S and PGI -S values, BELA  
and BETA score, QPRO scores, and HADS anxiety and depression scores, will be assessed with  
a mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) model.  The model will include fixed factors for  
treatment group, study visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_435236], with baseline SALT score  
as a covariate.  Treatment group comparisons at each visit will be based on least squares mean  
estimates.  An unstructur ed covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors.  
The Kenward -Roger  approximation  will be used to estimate  denominator  degrees  of freedom.  
 
12.4.3.  Multiplicity  
Hierarchical testing will be used to control for multiple comparisons. For the p rimary efficacy  
analysis and the key secondary efficacy analyses, a ≤0.025 (two -sided) alpha -level will be  
allocated to each dose for comparison with placebo to adjust for multiplicity of testing associated  
with two doses.  The below figure  displays the ord er of testing  of the  key secondary  endpoints.  
Once  p>0.025  is observed  for a treatment  group  comparison,  inference  for additional  endpoints  
is no longer alpha -level protected for that dose group, however nominal p -values will still be  
reported.  
Subsequently, conditional upon significance ( ≤ 0.025) for the primary endpoint and first key  
secondary endpoint for both doses, a linear hierarchical testing approach with ≤ 0.025 (two - 
sided)  alpha -level will be  used to test the  remaining  key secondary  endpoint comparisons versus  
placebo. Once p>0.025 is observed for a treatment group comparison, inference for additional  
endpoints is no longer alpha -level protected for that dose group, however nominal p -values will  
still be reported.

12.4.4.  Missing Data  for SALT -based  endpoints  
Prior to database lock, the classification of the missing data pattern for missing SALT scores will  
be finalized based on blinded data review and documented as either considered to be missing at  
random  (MAR) or  potentially  missing  not at random (MNAR),  consistent with general  categories  
of reasons for missingness.  Subjects with missing data due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1168969]  
captured the protocol -specified assessments. For example, missing at random will be considered  
plausible for COVID -19 related reasons such as site closures and travel limitations.  In general,  
however, if a MAR assumption is not considered plausible, MNAR will be assumed . Patterns of  
missing values across visits will be listed and summarized with numbers and percentages by  
[CONTACT_841336].

 12.4.5.  Multiple  Imputation  
A multiple  imputation  (MI)  approach  will be used to estimate  missing  SALT  scores.  Analyses  of 
the multiply imputed datasets will be performed for both the primary endpoint (percentage of  
subjects with absolute SALT scores ≤ 20) as well as key secondary endpoints employing SALT  
scores,  between each dose  and placebo, using  the MMR M approach.  
The imputation will be implemented separately for each treatment, under the assumption that  
different treatments may have distinct posterior distributions. Missing values will be imputed  
with a sequential regression approach under the assumptio n of multivariate normality. Missing  
SALT  scores  will be imputed  in a sequential manner  using  regression  models with  a number  of 
predictor variables. Covariates to be included are the baseline SALT score, in addition to the  
observed  or imputed values of th e previous time points.  
One hundred independent imputations will be done with SAS® PROC MI using the Fully  
Conditional Specification (FCS) regression method for all imputed continuous variables and the  
discriminant function method for all imputed classification variables, if needed. For each  
continuous  variable,  all other  variables  are used as covariates,  and for each imputed  classification  
variable, all other continuous variables are used as covariates.  The FCS method combines both  
the monotone and arbitrary  missing  data patterns into one procedure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis  of Imputed  Datasets  
For the analysis of the primary endpoint (i.e., the binary endpoint denoting a SALT score ≤ 20)  
the individual SALT scores will be categorized (≤ 20 versus > 20) and analyzed using a Mantel - 
Haenszel  test (comparing  each dose to placebo,  separately).  For each  imputed  dataset,  treatment  
differences will be assessed using the Mantel -Haenszel estimate o f a common risk difference,  
with the variance estimator due to Sato (used to construct confidence limits for the Mantel - 
Haenszel estimate of the common risk difference in the SAS FREQ Procedure).  The resulting  
[ADDRESS_1168970] errors will then be combined using SAS  
PROC  MIANALYZE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_841281] ≤ 20, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_841282] 24  if the  result of  the MI

Missing  values  will not  be imputed  for efficacy  endpoints  which are  not derived  from  SALT  
scores.  
 
12.4.6.  Study  Drug  Exposure  
Study  drug exposure  will be summarized for  each treatment  group.  The number  of days  on 
which  study  drug was dosed  will be  summarized for  each treatment  group.  
The total number of days on study drug will exclude dose interruptions.  The total number of  
days of exposure  to study  drug will be  summarized  with the  mean, standard deviation,  median,  
minimum, and maximum number of days on the dose.  Drug compliance will a lso be  
summarized.  
 
12.4.7.  Safety  
All safety summaries will be descriptive with no statistical hypothesis testing and based on the  
Safety Population. Patients will be summarized according to the study drug received (i.e., as  
treated), should it differ from the ra ndomized treatment arm.  All safety endpoints will be listed  
in by-patient data listings.  
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_841337].  Clinically  significant  deteriorations  in physical  examination  findings  will be 
reported  and summarized as adverse  events.  
Laboratory  values  will be converted  to the  project -defined  unit of measurement,  as applicable,  
before analysis.  Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values will be reported and  
summarized  as adverse events  (refer to Section 11.1). 
Adverse  Events  
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug (i.e.,  
Day 1), will be considered a pre -treatme nt adverse event.  Treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs)  will be defined  as any adverse  event  that occurs  after administration  of the first dose of 
study drug through to the final study visit.  The number and percentage of patients who report  
TEAEs  will be  summarized by  [CONTACT_27425].  
Treatment  emergent  adverse  events will  also be summarized  by [CONTACT_841338].  
Patients  who report  the same  preferred  term on multiple  occasions  will be counted  once for  the 
preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by [CONTACT_841339].  If a patient reports multiple  
preferred terms for a system organ class, the patient will b e counted only once for that system  
organ  class.

 Proportions  for adverse  events  that are gender -specific  (e.g.,  dysmenorrhea)  will be based  on the 
number  of patients from that gender.  
The number  and percentage  of patients  who experience  TEAEs  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_841340]:  
 By [CONTACT_841341]  
 By [CONTACT_926]/intensity,  system  organ  class,  and preferred  term 
 By [CONTACT_841342], system  organ  class,  and preferred  term 
 Serious  adverse  events by  [CONTACT_841343] 
 Serious  adverse events  by [CONTACT_841344],  system organ class,  and

 Adverse  events resulting  in discontinuation of  study  drug by [CONTACT_841345] 
 Adverse  events that result in study  drug dose interruption by  [CONTACT_841346]-patient listings will be provided for any deaths, serious adverse events, and adverse events  
leading to discontinuation of treatment.  Treatment -emergent adverse events that result in dose  
interruption  will also be  identified.  
Additionally, treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_207247]: [ADDRESS_1168972] dose of study drug on  
Day 1; if Day  1 values  are unavailable, then values obtained  at the  Screening  Visit will  be used.  
Second, shift tables will summarize the numb er and percentage of patients with categorical  
changes from baseline defined by [CONTACT_841347] (Below reference range, Within reference range, and Above reference range).  The 
baseline  category  will be  cross-tabulated  with post -baseline  category  (3 × 3 table).  The 
post-baseline  category  will be assigned  and summarized  in 2 ways  for each laboratory  parameter:  
smallest  post-baseline  value and largest post -baseline value.  
Third, treatment -emergent potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory values will be  
identified.  Potentially clinically significant values are defined as those that meet Grade 3 or  
Grade  4 toxicity  criteria  from  the CTCAE criteria.  Treatment -emerge nt PCS laboratory  values

12.4.8.  Interim  Analyses  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform regular safety assessments  
based on a  review  of cumulative safety  data.  The DMC may  advise study  and/or treatment  arm 
cessation due to intolerability at any time.  There are no plans to perform interim efficacy  
analyses or  to discontinue  the study  early  due to demonstration of  efficacy  differences.  
Therefore,  no adjustment  of Type I  error  is required  for interim  analyses.

documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized  
representative, and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_27727], as des cribed in ICH Guideline E6 (R2) and in  
accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study  
will receive approval from the IRB/EC prior to commencement.  The Investigator will conduct  
all aspects of this study in  accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the  
pertinent regulatory  authorities.  
 
13.2. Sponsor’s  Responsibilities  
The Sponsor  or its designee  is responsible for  the following:  
 Selecting  qualified  Investigators  
 Providing  Investigators with  the information  they need to properly  conduct  an 
investigation  
 Ensuring  proper  monitoring  of the investigation  
 Ensuring  that the applicable  regulatory  authorities,  and all participating  Investigators  
are properly informed of significant new information reg arding adverse events or  
risks associated with the  medication being  studied  
Before  an investigational  site can  enter a  patient into  the study,  a representative  of the  Sponsor  
will visit the  investigational study  site to: 
 Determine  the adequacy  of the  facilities  
 Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to  
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives.  This 
will be  documented in a  Clinical  Study  Agreement.

  Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case  
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other  
records  relevant  to the study.  This will require  direct  access  to all original  records for  
each patient (e.g.,  clinic  charts).  
 Record and report any  protocol deviations.  
 Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the possibility for site closures and/or travel  
restrictions,  source  data verification may  be performed remotely.  
 Confirm adverse events and serious adverse events have be en properly documented on  
eCRFs  and confirm any  serious adverse  events have  been forwarded  to the Sponsor  and 
those serious adverse events that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the  
IRB/EC  by [CONTACT_841348].  
The monitor  will be available between  visits  if the Investigator(s)  or other  staff needs  
information  or advice.  
As the Sponsor,  Concert Pharmaceuticals  has delegated  some  responsibilities  to a designee,  or 
Contract  Research Organization.  
 
13.3. Investigator’s  Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local  
regulations.  Each Investigator participating in this study is required to maintain complete and  
accurate  study  documentation  in compliance  with current  GCP  standards  and all applicable local  
regulations  related to the  conduct of  a clinical study.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53581], any amendments to the protocol, the study drug, and their 
study -related  duties  and functions.  The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17459]  a list of sub - 
Investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated  
significant study -related duties.  Individuals ineligible from conducting or working on clinical  
studies, including those ineligible as a result of debarment under the Generic Drug Enforcement  
Act of 1992, will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies sponsored by [CONTACT_841349] s. The Investigator  is required  to immediately  disclose  to the Sponsor  in writing,  
if any person involved in the conduct of the study is debarred pursuant to a hearing by [CONTACT_841350] -fraud law, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending, or is (to the best of the  
Investigator’s  knowledge) threatened.  
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all patients who sign an informed consent  
document.  Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the patient’s source  
documents.  
The Investigator or  designee should inform  the IRB/EC  of any  event  likely  to affect  the safety  of 
patients or the continued conduct of the study, in particular any change in safety.  Additionally,  
all updates to the Investigator’s Brochure will be sent to the IRB/EC and Regulatory Agencies,  
as required per country regulations.  Where applicable, a progress report will be sent to the  
IRB/EC and the protocol will be reviewed annually (e.g., re -approved ) or more frequently, as  
required  by [CONTACT_1201]/EC  or local regulations.  
CTP-543 
Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021  
Concert  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  66  
 The Investigator will maintain a copy of all correspondence with/from the IRB/EC, including  
copi[INVESTIGATOR_580348].  The Investigator will also maintain a copy of the IRB/EC  
membership  list with occupation  and qualification  (or a statement  confirming  compliance  with 
GCP  requirements for committee  composition).  
In the US, the Investigator or designee will notify the IRB of the conclusion of the clinical study  
within 1 mo nth of completion or termination of the study.  The final report sent to the IRB will  
also be sent to the Sponsor  along  with the completed  electronic  case report  forms  (eCRFs)  and 
all necessary  regulatory  documents,  thereby  [CONTACT_841351]’s  regulatory  responsibility.  
In the EU,  the Sponsor  or designee  is responsible  for notifying  the EC/RA  of the conclusion  of 
the clinical study within [ADDRESS_1168975]  be submitted  within 1  year after  study  completion.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during  
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to patient records (e.g.,  
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study -related charts) for source data  
verification.  The Investigator  must ensure  timely  and accurate  completion  of eCRFs  and queries.  
 
13.4. Protocol  Amendments  
Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific  
study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  All amendments to the protocol will  
be written by [CONTACT_1034].  The Inves tigator will not make any changes to this protocol without  
prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Except for  
administrative  amendments, Investigators  must  await IRB/EC  approval  of protocol  amendments  
before implementi ng the change(s).  The Sponsor will ensure submission of any protocol  
amendments  to the appropriate regulatory  agencies  and Ethics Committees.  
Trial conduct may be impacted in light of the COVID -19 pandemic.  Challenges may arise (e.g.,  
quarantines, site clo sures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for the  
investigational product, etc.) leading to difficulties in meeting protocol -specified procedures,  
including administering or using the investigational product or adhering to protocol -manda ted 
visits  and laboratory/diagnostic  testing.  Taking  into consideration  Regulatory  Agency  guidance,  
amendments to protocol defined criteria may be implemented without IRB approval or before  
filing an amendment to the IND/CTA in order to minimize or eliminate immediate hazards or to  
protect  the life and well -being  of research  participants (e.g., to  limit exposure  to COVID -19). 
Administrative  amendments  are defined  as having  no effect  on the  safety of the research  
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the study.  However, a protocol change  
intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients should be implemented  
immediately,  and the IRB/EC  notified  within 5  days or per  local regulations.  
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/EC, the Investigators, and/or the  
Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the  
potential risk to the patient, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification.  
In such cases,  repeat informed  consent  will be  obtained  from patients  enrolled  in the  study  before  
continued  participation under the  new amendment.

 13.5. Audits  and Inspections  
The Sponsor’s  Quality  Assurance  Unit (or representative)  may conduct  audits  at the study  site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to: drug supply, presence of required documents, the  
informed consent process, laboratory specimen processing, and comparison of eCRFs with  
source documents.  The Investigator agrees to cooperate with audits conducted at a reasonable  
time and in a reasonable  manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also audit the Investigator/site  during or after the study.  
The Investigator should  contact [CONTACT_841352], and  must fully  cooperate  
with the audits conducted at a reasonable  time in a reasonable manner.  
The Investigator is required to make all study documentation promptly available for inspection,  
review  or audit at the  study  site upon  request by  [CONTACT_2728], its representatives, or any  appropriate  
regulatory  agencies.  
 
13.6. Quality  Control  and Quality  Assurance  
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_841353].  
A quality  control  and quality  assurance  plan addressing  aspects  of the study  that may  impact data  
integrity or the protection of human subjects will be instituted for this study.  All audit findings  
will be summarized  and placed  on file with appropriate  documentation  of response/resolution.  
In light of the  COVID -19 pandemic,  patient safety  will be  ensured  by [CONTACT_841354]  (GCP) and  minimizing  risks to patient  safety  and data  integrity.  
These  efforts  include  additional  risk mitigation  strategies  and appropriate  documentation  of 
protocol  deviations occurring  prior to implementation of  protocol amendments.

 14. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
14.1. Confidentiality  
All information disclosed or provided by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee), or generated or produced  
during the study including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the Investigator’s  
Brochure, and the results obtained during the course of the study, are confidential.  The 
Investigator  or any person under  his/her  authority  agrees to  keep confident ial and not to  disclose  
the information to any  third party  without the prior  written approval  of the  Sponsor.  
Submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB/EC is expressly  
permitted, IRB/EC members having the same obligation of confidentiality.  Authorized  
regulatory  officials  and sponsor  personnel  (or designee)  will be allowed  full access  to inspect and  
copy the records.  The copi[INVESTIGATOR_841286].  Study drug, patient bodily fluids, and/or other materials  
collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in  
writing  by [CONTACT_324566](s)  or reg ulatory  authorities.  
Patients’ names may, however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized  
officials  in the event of  inspections.  Documents  containing  the full name  [CONTACT_841364].  This information will not be  
transferred  to the  Sponsor nor  be contained in regulatory  filings.  
 
14.2. Patient  Data  Protection  
Prior  to any  testing  under this protocol, including  screening  tests and assessments, candidates  
must also provide all authorizations required by [CONTACT_1769] (e.g., protected health information  
authorization).  
Patients  will be identified  only by [CONTACT_841355].  The patient will not be identifi ed by [CONTACT_71403], in any study samples or  
study reports.  All data generated in this study is for research purposes only.  The Sponsor, its  
partner(s) and designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of  
this study.  Every  effort  will be made  to keep  the patient’s  personal  medical data  confidential.  
The Sponsor will protect individual patient information to the fullest extent possible during this  
study.  At no time will a  patient  become  identified  in any publication  or presentation.  However,  
the patient may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit or  
inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to patient information is at the  
discretion of the Sponsor and cannot occur prio r to database lock or other specified events as  
determined solely  by [CONTACT_841356].  
14.3. Data  Collection  
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will use an  
electronic data capture system.  Data reported in  the eCRFs should be consistent with and  
substantiated  by [CONTACT_102]’s  medical  record  and original  source  documents.  Any discrepancies  
must be  explained.

 Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a Delegation of Authority  
form  (Site  Signature  [CONTACT_53633]),  showing  the signatures  and handwritten  initials  of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individuals who are  
authorized  to make  or change  entries on  eCRFs.  
 
14.4. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate according to the  
Monitoring Plan.  Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while monitoring.  
Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately.  Additionally, the  
Sponsor’s designee and the Sponsor may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which  
could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution.  The completed eCRF for  
each patient must  be signed  and dated by  [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_841287].  
 
14.5. Database  Management,  Data  Clarification,  and Quality  Assurance  
The Sponsor’s  designee  (i.e., a designated  Contract  Research  Organization)  will be responsible  
for data management.  Data Management will develop a Data Management Plan (DMP)  
document, and provide it to the Sponsor for approval.  The DMP document will define all  
activities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed DMP will be based on the  
protocol, work sc ope, contract, analysis plans, data -flows, eCRFs, data cleaning procedures,  
other  supporting  documents, and data management  standards and practices.  
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and  
consistency,  and queries  will be  generated upon data  entry  or via review by  a Clinical  Data  
Manager after  entry.  The sites will respond  to the data  queries in  a timely  manner.  
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated  
Contract  Research Organization standard operating  procedures.  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.  Any 
changes to the database after that time will only be made by [CONTACT_841357], Statisti cian, Data Manager, and Quality Assurance Auditor according to designated  
standard  operating  procedures of  the Contract Research  Organization.  
 
14.6. Inspection  of Records  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the Sponsor or designee must verify data entered in 
the eCRF  entries  against  the source  documents.  The objective  of source  document  verification  is 
to comply  with GCP  and international  regulatory  requirements  and to  reduce  the risks of  fraud.  
Source document verification means ensuring that source documents are an accurate and  
confirmable reflection of the patient’s evaluations during participation in the study and that all  
relevant information recorded in the source document is accurately ente red into the eCRF.  All 
source documents should be correctly labeled and filed and associated with a single, verifiable  
patient.  
All data required for this study should be captured in source notes.  No data obtained by [CONTACT_841358].  All source  
documents  pertaining  to this study  will be maintained by  [CONTACT_841359]-543 
Protocol  CP543.3001  28 April 2021

CONFIDENTIAL  & PROPRIETARY  [ADDRESS_1168976] be dated and signed at the time of the visit.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply  
original  source  documentation for  this clinical study.  
The Investigator will  note in a source  independent from  the eCRF  the following  information:  
 Information t o confirm that the patient exists [e.g., initials, date of birth (applicable  
per local regulations), and sex];  
 Confirmation  that the patient  satisfies  the inclusion/exclusion  criteria;  
 Confirmation  that the patient  is taking  part in the clinical  study;  
 Confirmation  of the informed  consent  process;  
 Visit  dates and  documentation of  protocol assessments  and procedures;  
 Information  concerning  all adverse  events;  
 Details  of concomitant  and investigational  medications.  
Source document verification is not a sub stitute for clinical study monitoring, the purpose of  
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the eCRF has been fully and  
accurately completed, source document verification has been carried out, and the study timelines  
and enrollm ent goals and requirements have been met.  In light of the COVID -[ADDRESS_1168977] retain study records from investigational drug studies for a period of  
2 years  following  the date  a marketing  application  is approved for  the drug for the indication for  
which it is being investigated; or, if no application is t o be filed or if the application is not  
approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and the  
appropriate regulatory  authority  is notified.  
The Investigator  must  maintain  all study  documentation  as confidential,  and take measures to  
prevent  accidental or premature  destruction of  these  documents.  
The Investigator must notify  the Sponsor prior  to destroying  any study  essential documents.  
If the Investigator can  no longer ensure  archiving, he/she  shall inform  the Sponsor.  The relevant  
records  shall be  transferred to a mutually  agreed  upon designee.

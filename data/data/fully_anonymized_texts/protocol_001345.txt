Methodology This study will be a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System for primary total hip replacement 
(THR) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria.   
 
Data from Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem cases that are enrolled in the Trident
® X3® Polyethylene Insert Study will be used as 
a historical control group. 
Study Duration • Minimum functional evaluation, assessment of health related 
quality of life (QOL) and radiographic follow-up of each 
primary THR case to 5 years 
• Enrollment period of 24 months 
• Completion of pain, satisfaction and survivorship patient 
questionnaire between 6 and 10 years 
• Approximate 12-year total duration 
Study Center(s) 10 – 12 
Hypothesis The success rate, defined as freedom from femoral stem/neck 
construct revision/removal for any reason, for hips implanted with the  
Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System, is no worse than for hips 
implanted with the Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral hip stem at 5 years postoperative.

1 Introduction 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Standards, associated Federal regulations and all applicable research requirements. 
1.[ADDRESS_1154168] been in clinical use since 1985.  In a study of 216 anatomic cementless THRs (208 patients) with ceramic bearings and modular necks, followed for a minimum of 3 years, the authors affirm that the advantages of this method include its adaptability to a variety of anatomical conditions.   From a clinical standpoint, all of the patients 
achieving long-term follow-up demonstrated improvement in pain, movement and walking.  
Radiographically, bone stability was observed in 98.8% of stems.  A total of 99.4% of stems were osseointegrated and only one case showed osteolysis requiring revision of stem and cup after [ADDRESS_1154169] primary hip femoral components, while facilitating implantation in 
patients with varied anatomical conditions.

 A review by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_626]
2 of a similar modular device’s 20-year  clinical history shows that the 
prosthesis has performed well in both primary and revision cases.  The modular junction has 
survived with long-term clinical follow-up.  The author argues that despi[INVESTIGATOR_831566], mid to long-term follow-up indicates that these issues do not pose a significant concern.  Furthermore , fixation by [CONTACT_831589], and loosening rates have been low, as evidenced by [CONTACT_252251].

Stryker is introducing a modular hip prosthesis, the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System.  The 
basic design of the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is similar to other total hip systems, both 
modular and monolithic, which are currently commercially distributed.  The Rejuvenate® Modular 
Hip System’s design features are based upon the previous success of Stryker’s hydroxylapatite 
(HA) coated monolithic femoral components.

Clinical History 
of the Following 
Straight, 
Cementless 
Modular Stem TMZF® Alloy 
Plasma Spray PureFix™ HA  Omnifit
® HA 
Secur-Fit™ HA 
 
The Omnifit® HA femoral component has long-term survivorship in a relatively young patient 
group, with a low mechanical failure rate compared to other fixation methods at similar lengths of follow-up.  A total of 166 hips (146 patients) were followed for an interval of 15 to 18 years, with both femoral aseptic revision and mechanical failure rates at approximately 0.6%.
4  
Omnifit® is considered Stryker’s gold standard for proximal HA-coated femoral stems.  The 
Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is an updated version of the Omnifit®, modifying the C-taper 
trunnion and bulky neck geometry.  These features are considered weaknesses of the Omnifit® 
design.  The Secur-Fit™ system, the historical control fo r this clinical study, was based on the geometry 
of the Omnifit
® femoral stem.  The Secur-Fit™ HA stem retains the Omnifit® geometry, 
normalized design and PureFix™ HA coating to further enhance initial stem stability and augment proximal load transfer.  The Secur-Fit™ HA stem has a highly polished neck, decreasing the potential for polyethylene debris.  Each implant maintains the same geometry, regardless of stem size, allowing the stems to more closely match natural anatomy. 
 
In a clinical and radiographic review by [CONTACT_831590]
5 of 215 THRs in which a monolithic, 
normalized, proportionalized, cemented femoral component was implanted, the design was reported to allow for more efficient force transmission between prosthesis, cement and bone 
and to lessen failure rates at these interfaces.  Overall, the study showed an aseptic failure 
loosening rate of 3.9% at [ADDRESS_1154170] generation and second generation stems at similar follow-up.
6  Although the 
Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is intended for cementless application, the findings by [CONTACT_831591]7 focus on a normalized femoral component.  As with the femoral stem studied, the 
Rejuvenate® Modular Stem includes a normalized pattern on the anterior and posterior aspects 
of the proximal end of the stem, facilitating load tr ansmission in the proximal region of the femur.

The Secur-Fit™ system is the direct predecessor for the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System.  The 
Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System introduces the concept of modularity, offering the surgeon 
additional intraoperative flexibility.  The mixing and matching of components, as described 
further in Section 6, Device Description, allows the surgeon to choose the best anatomical fit for 
the patient.  The Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System permits the matching of a proximal femoral 
neck in different lengths, angles and version, with different sizes of distal stems. 
 This clinical study is necessary to compare the success of the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System 
to the reported success of its monolithic predecessor.  The objective of the study is to show that 
neck modularity has not changed the survivorship  of standard primary hip femoral components. 
1.2 Investigational Device 
The Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is fabricated from TMZF® alloy and features the 
PureFix™ HA fixation philosophy.  The stem is built upon the design features and clinical history 
of the existing Omnifit® and Secur-Fit™ Stryker femoral stems.  The device provides better 
patient matching by [CONTACT_831592], femoral neck length, version and femoral head offset.  The Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System has a modular neck, 
allowing for 127°, 132° and 130° femoral neck angles.  The 130° modular neck is only available 
in the 16° version option.  Four femoral neck lengths are available, ranging from 30 mm to 42 
mm, in 4 mm increments.  Possible overall neck lengths range from 26 mm to 46 mm, utilizing 
V40 +/- 4 mm femoral heads.  
The Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System is intended for us e in a cementless application.  It is 
designed to address the need for greater accuracy in reproducing offset, leg length and femoral 
neck version, as well as optimize range of motion (ROM) for primary hip patients.  Data in support of these marketing claims will be collected in the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System 
Outcomes Study.

2 Study Objectives 
 
2.1 Efficacy 
2.1.1 Primary 
The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the success rate of cementless primary THR with the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System, as compared to the Secur-Fit™ 
HA monolithic femoral hip stem, a historical control.   Success will be defined as absence of femoral stem/neck construct revision/removal for any reason at 5 years postoperative.  It is expected that the survivorship of the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip

monolithic femoral hip stem cases enrolled in the Trident® X3® Polyethylene Insert 
Study. 
2.1.2 Secondary 
The secondary objectives of this study will be to measure natural preoperative 
biomechanical measurements for creation of a preoperative plan, and compare to 
postoperative biomechanical measurements, within the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip 
System group.  It is expected that the postoperative measurements at the 6-week interval will be similar to the preoperative plan.  
Additionally, pain, function and health-related QOL between the Rejuvenate
® Modular 
Hip System group and the Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral hip stem group will be 
compared at postoperative time points.  It is expected that the HHS, SF-12 and LEAS outcomes in the study group will be non-inferior to the historical control.  
Lastly, radiographic stability and complications between those implanted with the 
Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System and the Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem group 
will be reviewed.  Published complication rates with similar devices as well as complications related to modularity will be reviewed, as applicable. 
 
Clinical Outcomes: 
Clinical outcomes will be evaluated via the total HHS, including pain, motion and 
function, preoperatively, and at the 6-week, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year visits.  Additional HHS data will be obtained at the 7-year and 10-year time points at investigational sites that 
choose to bring their subjects back in for these optional visits.  
 Patient Outcomes: 
The SF-12 is a 12 item patient self-assessment evaluating health and general well 
being.  The LEAS is a tool that has been developed and validated to evaluate the level 
of patient activity.  These tools will be used to assess patient health-related QOL and will be collected preoperatively, at the 6-week, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year visits.  Additional patient outcomes data will be obtained at the 7-year and 10-year time points at investigational sites that choose to bring their subjects back in for these optional visits.  A questionnaire 
Rejuvenate® Modular Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_1154172] follow-up visit, is required at the 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10-year visits. 
 
Radiographic Outcomes: Radiographs will be taken and collected in the AP pelvis, AP femur and lateral views for the preoperative, 6-week, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year  intervals.  Additional radiographs will be 
obtained at the 7-year and 10-year time points at investigational sites that choose to bring their subjects back in for these optional visits.  
The AP pelvis and AP femur views allow for observations of any conditions involving the 
sacral wings, iliac bones, ischium, pubis as well as the femoral head and neck.  These views additionally display the critical relationship between the femoral neck’s longitudinal axis and the femoral shaft’s longitudinal axis for identification of displacement in the 
event of a femoral neck fracture.  The lateral view allows for evaluation of the entire hip 
joint as well as specifically the femoral head, neck and proximal shaft.
8  Suggested 
radiographic technique for the views required is included in Appendix A.  Radiographs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_831593].  Radiographic analysis of the femo ral component will employ seven zones (Zone 
1 - Zone 7) in the AP views and seven zones (Zone 8 – Zone 14) in the  lateral view; 
analysis of the acetabular component will em ploy three zones (Zone 1 – Zone 3) in the 
AP views.
9,[ADDRESS_1154173] 50% of a zone and measuring at least 1 mm in width is defined as radiolucency present.  Subsidence, migration and fixation will also be assessed.  Subsidence is defined as settling of the prosthetic component in bone, and is related to the distance between fixed 
bony landmarks and the prosthesis.

Preoperatively, study radiographs will be tak en by [CONTACT_104489].  From these 
radiographs, each investigator will determine natural measurements and provide a detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_831567]’s level of deformity, as follows.  
• Leg length discrepancy (centimeters) 
o Measurement of leg length discrepancy should be determined from the 
AP pelvis radiograph by [CONTACT_831594].  These lines are to be used as the main reference lines 
for measuring the distance to the top of each lesser trochanter.
11  The 
difference between these distances is the value of leg length discrepancy. 
• Natural femoral offset (millimeters) 
o Femoral offset should be determined by [CONTACT_831595].
12 
• Natural femoral neck angle (degrees) 
o Femoral neck angle is the angle between the long axes of the femoral 
neck and femoral shaft.13 
• Qualitative assessment of natural femoral version (Retroverted, Neutral, 
Anteverted)  
o Proximal femoral version reflects the relationship of the axis of the 
femoral neck to the transcondylar axis of the distal femur.14  Qualitative 
determination of whether natural femoral version is retroverted, anteverted or in a state of neutral version should be made from the lateral radiograph. 
 
The investigator at each center will creat e a preoperative biomechanical measurement 
plan for each case from templating, reflecting desired postoperative measurements and the component sizes, angles and offsets that will be used to achieve these measurements.  All component sizes should be corrected for magnification (if any) prior 
to data collection on the study Case Report Form (CRF).  This may be accomplished by 
[CONTACT_831596].

Device Description: 
The Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System consists of a m odular stem and a modular neck.  It is 
similar to other modular and monolithic hip systems currently distributed.  It is intended for 
cementless, press-fit application and is designed for use with currently available Stryker femoral heads.  A description of the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System components and compatible 
femoral heads follows.  Stryker acetabular components compatible with the chosen Stryker femoral heads must be used, according to this study protocol.  Appendix C gives an overview of all protocol-specified components. 
 
Modular Stem: 
The modular stem design is based on the Secur-Fit™ system.  The Rejuvenate® Modular Hip 
System includes a straight stem with a normalization pattern on the anterior and posterior 
aspects of the proximal end of the stem to facilitate press-fit stability and load transmission in 
the proximal region of the femur.  The stem has an internal opening which mates with the modular neck via an oblong Morse-type taper.  The drawing below depi[INVESTIGATOR_831568].

X3
® polyethylene is a highly cross-linked polyethylene manufactured through a proprietary 
process where the polyethylene receives 30 kiloGrays of gamma radiation, which generates 
free radicals and cross-linking in ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) prior to machining.  The polyethylene is then annealed below melting point to promote cross-linking and 
maintains mechanical strength
a, crystallinityb, and densityc.  This also stabilizes the free 
radicalsd.  This process is repeated twice.

Stryker Orthopaedics will retrieve any Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System components and/or 
adjacent tissues for analysis to help characterize potential device-related complications.  In the 
event that any portion of the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is removed from a study subject, 
the outlined procedure should be followed. 
 
1. When revision of a study subject is scheduled, the study coordinator (SC) should contact 
[CONTACT_773691] (CSM) or Clin ical Study Associate (CSA) assigned to the 
project, as soon as possible. 
2. The CSM or CSA will send a retrieval container to the SC. 3. The SC or an identified field representative will retrieve the device and place it in the 
retrieval container. 
4. The SC or an identified Stryker representative will complete a Product Experience 
Report (PER). 
5. The PER should be faxed to Stryker Product Surveillance at [PHONE_17320], as well as to 
Stryker Clinical Research at [PHONE_17321]. 
6. The PER should be attached to the retrieval container and sent to Product Surveillance.  
A de-identified operative report shoul d be included, when available. 
7. The CSM or CSA will follow up with Product Surveillance to obtain a PER number. 8. A summary of results will be provided to the investigator upon his/her request. 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
0.4 MPa and 23.5 ± 0.3 MPa for N 2Vac® UHMWPE and X3® UHMWPE, respectively.  Ultimate Tensile 
Strength was 54.8 ± 2.5 MPa and 56.7 ± 2.1 MPa for N 2Vac® UHMWPE and X3® UHMWPE, respectively. 
 
b X3® UHMWPE has similar crystalline and lamellar structure as N 2Vac® gamma sterilized UHMWPE as 
measured by [CONTACT_421148] X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis.  
DSC determined crystallinity was 61.3 ± 0.8% and 61.7 ±  0.6% for N 2Vac® UHMWPE and X3® UHMWPE, 
respectively.  Lamellar crystal thickness was 23.0 and 23.6 nanometers for N 2Vac® UHMWPE and X3® 
UHMWPE, respectively. 
 
c X3® UHMWPE increases cross-link density over N 2Vac® gamma sterilized UHMWPE by 87%, as 
measured by [CONTACT_421149], per ASTM F2214.  Cross-link density, as measured by [CONTACT_421149], was 0.08 ± 
0.00 mol/dl and 0.15 ± 0.01 mol/dl for N 2Vac® UHMWPE and X3® UHMWPE, respectively. 
 
d X3® UHMWPE virtually eliminates free radicals, as m easured by [CONTACT_421150] (ESR).  A 
very low (noise level, near instrument detection limit) concentration of residual free radicals was detected 
in the X3® UHMWPE.  A 99% reduction of free radicals (14 ± 2 x 1014 spi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]/gram versus 1550 ± 32 x 1014 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]/gram) was found when compared to N 2Vac® gamma sterilized UHMWPE.

7.1 Preoperative Visit 
During the preoperative visit, patients that are possible candidates for this study will be 
screened to determine if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If the patient is a candidate, 
the investigator will propose participation in the study to the patient, according to GCP 
guidelines.  Patients must sign an IRB approved study consent form prior to participating in any study related activities.  Consent must be obtained within four months of surgery.  
Once the subject has been consented, preoperative data will be collected including: 
demographics, medical history, HHS, AP hip, AP pelvis and lateral radiographs, SF-12, and LEAS.  Additionally, the investigator will measure the following from preoperative radiographs, 
including:  
• Leg length discrepancy (millimeters) 
• Natural femoral offset (millimeters) 
• Natural femoral neck angle (degrees) 
• Qualitative assessment of natural femoral version (Retroverted, Neutral, Anteverted) 
 
The investigator will then proceed with a preoperative plan from templating, reflecting desired 
postoperative measurements and the component sizes, angles, and offsets that will be used to achieve the following measurements: 
 Preoperative Distance from Planned Center of Rotation 
• Vertical distance from the anatomic hip center to the planned center of rotation of the hip 
(millimeters) 
• Horizontal distance from the anatomic hip center to the planned center of rotation of the

Rejuvenate® Modular Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_1154179] be collected within ± 3 weeks of 
the 6-week postoperative milestone date. 
 Additionally, each investigator will perform a postoperative check of biomechanical measurements from the 6-week radiographs: 
 Postoperative Distance from Planned Center of Rotation 
• Vertical distance from the postoperative hip center to the planned preoperative center of 
rotation of the hip (millimeters) 
• Horizontal distance from the postoperative hip center to the planned preoperative center 
of rotation of the hip (millimeters) 
 
Additional  Postoperative Measurements 
• Leg length discrepancy (millimeters)

The initial phase of the study will conclude after the 5-year follow-up visit but, at investigational 
sites that choose to continue collecting clinical, patient outcome and radiographic data, subjects will be evaluated again at 7 and 10 years after surgery.  In addition, all subjects will complete a brief Follow-up Questionnaire annually at the 6-year, 7-
year, 8-year, 9-year and 10-year follow-up interv als.  This form may be completed by [CONTACT_831599] a patient telephone interview or by [CONTACT_831600] a clinic visit.  The 
questionnaire will be used to obtain the following information, at a minimum: 
• Patient satisfaction with the hip replacement 
• Presence of any pain in the study hip • Any surgeries perfomed on the study hip 
 
The questionnaire will also provide information on any revisions and enable calculation of the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

9 Statistical Plan 
9.1 Efficacy 
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy parameter will be femoral stem/neck construct revision/removal for 
any reason. 
9.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
The secondary efficacy parameters include: 
• Biomechanical measurement change from  preoperative plan at 6-week visit 
• HHS at each visit 
• SF-12 scores at each visit 
• LEAS at each visit 
9.1.3 Primary Efficacy Hypothesis 
The primary hypothesis to be tested will be that the proportion of cases without femoral 
stem/neck construct revision/removal is no worse for patients with the Rejuvenate® 
Modular Hip System than for cases with the Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem at 5 years.  A non-inferiority comparison with a one-sided alpha set at 0.05, power of 80% 
and delta of 7% will be performed.  That is, the following hypothesis will be tested: 
H
0: P1 < P2 – δ   v s .   H a: P1 > P2 – δ

revision/removal for any reason for the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System group and the 
Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem control group, respectively and δ=7%.  
9.1.4 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
A case success is defined as no incidence of femoral stem/neck construct 
revision/removal. The 90% confidence interval around the difference in success rate 
(Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System – Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem) will be 
computed at 5 years postoperative.  For the non-inferiority comparison, the lower bound 
of this 90% confidence interval will be compared with -5%.  If it is greater than -5%, non-inferiority is supported.  In addition, if it is greater than 0%, superiority is supported. The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve will also be displayed using SAS/PROC LIFETEST. 
9.1.5 Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
A two-sided 0.05 alpha level will be used. 
 For comparison of biomechanical meas urements between a preoperative plan and 
postoperative measurements within the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System group, a t-test 
or Wilcoxon test will be used.  Independent group t-tests will compare HHS, SF-12 and LEAS at each time point 
between the Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System and Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral 
stem groups.  In addition, a paired t-test will compare the results preoperatively with 
each postoperative evaluation within the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System group. 
9.2 Safety Parameters 
9.2.1 Safety Parameters 
Safety parameters will include all AEs reported for each group, radiographic stability at each postoperative visit and revision rates. 
9.2.2 Safety Analysis 
 
All AEs will be listed, tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_15992], number and percent of 
cases/subjects.  AE rates and 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  In addition, a

9.3 Missing Data 
No missing data will be imputed for the primary analysis and secondary analyses.  
9.4 Statistical Methodology 
9.4.1 Data Summary 
The following is a detailed proposal of statistical analyses planned for data collected during the study.    Descriptive statistics will be computed fo r all preoperative conditions and demographic 
parameters.  That is, for continuous data (e.g. HHS) the N, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum will be computed.  For categorical data (e.g. gender) 
the frequency will be computed.  If appropriate, the data will be presented by [CONTACT_831603]
® Modular Hip System and the Secur-Fit™ HA groups. 
 
Descriptive statistics and statistical compar isons for important demographic, efficacy and 
safety variables will be provided in tables.   
 A survival analysis for revision/removal of the modular femoral stem/neck construct will 
be performed.  
9.4.2 Sample Size Calculation 
Given an estimated revision rate for both groups at 2.5% and a non-inferiority margin of 5%, with a one-sided alpha of 0.05 and 80% power, a total of [ADDRESS_1154186] the null hypothesis that the revision rate for Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip 
System cases is 5% greater than for Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem cases.  In 
order to control for a 20% drop-out rate, 183 cases per group are required.

data collected prior to the withdrawal of authorization in order to maintain data integrity.  
11.3 Source Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents and data 
records include:  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, study worksheets, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject questionnaires, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, radiographs, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical study. 
All data points collected during follow-up visits must be documented in the subject’s chart.  This 
includes ROM values, pain and function as well as AEs and additional comments.  The informed consent process should also be documented in the patient chart.  Monitors, defined further in Section 13, will be comparing the CRFs against source documents for adequacy.  The monitors 
will seek to draw a reference between each data point on the CRF and the subject’s chart.  
Thus, one cannot derive pain, ROM or function based on a chart note that reads “Patient doing well.”  Every effort should be made to ensure complete source documentation.  
Centers are required to create a source documentation plan including any applicable source 
documentation worksheets prior to enrollment. 
11.[ADDRESS_1154194] be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D.”  If the 
item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A.”  All entries should be printed legibly in 
blue or black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or white out errors

11.5 Data Clarification Requests 
If errors or omissions are noted by [CONTACT_831607], a data clarification form 
(DCF) or data clarification request (DCR) will be sent to  the center for clarification.  Clarifications 
should be answered in a clear and comprehensible manner.  If the clarification requires a 
change to data captured on a CRF, the CRF should be modified accordingly.  The clarification should clearly document changes, independent of the CRF to which it refers.  DCFs and DCRs 
must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  Completed clarifications should be returned to 
Stryker within 2 weeks of receipt.  Modified CRFs need not be included in conjunction to answered DCFs and DCRs. 
11.6 Protocol Deviations 
Any deviation from this protocol will be reported to Stryker as well as to the EC/IRB according to their reporting procedures.  Protocol Deviations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Informed consent deviations, including but not limited to: 
o Study procedures performed prior to informed consent 
o Incorrect informed consent version used 
• Patient enrolled does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• Protocol specified study component(s) not implanted 
• Visit deviations, including: 
o Unavailable primary endpoint 
o One or more required CRFs/radiographs not done 
o Evaluations occurred outside of protocol specified time window 
o Un-evaluable radiographs 
o Missed visit

12  Risk/Benefit Assessment 
12.[ADDRESS_1154195] these devices but cannot be evaluated in vivo, the components cannot be expected to indefinitely withstand the activity level and loads of normal 
healthy bone. 
 Adverse effects associated with primary THR include the following:  
Serious complications may be associated with any total joint replacement surgery.  These 
complications include, but are not limited to:  infection; genitourinary disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; vascular disorders, including th rombus; bronchopulmonary disorders, including 
emboli; myocardial infarction or death.  
With all implanted devices, asymptomatic, lo calized progressive bone resorption (osteolysis) 
may occur around the prosthetic components as a consequence of foreign-body reaction to the 
particulate matter of metal, UHMWPE and/or ceramic.  Particulate is generated by [CONTACT_831609], abrasion and fatigue.  Secondarily, particulates can 
Rejuvenate® Modular Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_1154196] body wear.  Osteolysis can lead to future complications, including 
loosening, necessitating the removal and replacement of prosthetic components. 
 Early and late loosening of total hip components can occur.  Early biomechanical loosening may result from inadequate initial fixation, latent infection, premature loading of the prosthesis or 
trauma.  Late loosening may result from trauma, infection, biological complications including 
osteolysis or mechanical problems, with the subsequent possibility of bone erosion and/or pain.  Dislocation of the hip prosthesis can occur due to inappropriate patient activity, trauma or other biomechanical considerations. 
 
Peripheral neuropathies, circulatory compromise and heterotopic bone formation may occur.  Intraoperative fissure, fracture, or perforation of the femur, acetabulum or trochanter can occur 
due to impaction of the component into the prepared femoral canal or acetabulum.  
Postoperative femoral or acetabular fracture can occur due to trauma, the presence of defects or poor bone stock.  If bone screws are used, appropriate selection of bone screw length and location is essential to 
avoid damage to underlying soft tissue structures.  Perforation of the pelvic wall can result in 
internal bleeding and possible damage to vital organs.  Metal sensitivity reactions have been reported following joint replacement. 
 
AEs may necessitate reoperation, revision, arthrodesis of the involved joint, girdlestone or amputation of the limb. 
12.3  Expected Complications and Rates of Occurrences  
The safety objective will compare the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System complication rates to 
published rates.  Table 4 on the following page lists expected rates for primary THA, averaged from Stryker clinical studies as well as from published results.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 
This material is the property of Stryker Orthopaedics.  Do not  disclose or use except as aut horized in writing by [CONTACT_421139]. *Data from the following Stryker sponsored clinical studies was used as a basis for this table:  
Omnifit® HA, ABC/Trident®, Meridian®, Citation®, Secur-Fit™, Accolade® TMZF and Trident® 
X3®.  There were 2,966 total cases (hips) in 2,697 subjects after combining results from these 
seven studies.  Percentages for operative and device related events were calculated by [CONTACT_831610] (hips) enrolled.  
Systemic events were calculated by [CONTACT_831611].  The protocols for the Omnifit® HA and ABC/Trident® 
studies originally required that all AEs be reported; however, after these products became 
commercially available, the protocols were modified and required that only operative related events be reported.  For the ABC/Trident
®, this change occurred in February 2003 and for the 
Omnifit® HA, in December 1990.  The protocol for the Trident® X3® and Accolade® TMZF studies 
required that operative site AEs and any event meeting the definition of a serious event be reported.  The protocols for Secur-Fit™, Citation
® and Meridian® required that all AEs were 
reported.  Percentages for primary THR taken from published literature represent averages or 
ranges as noted. 
12.[ADDRESS_1154197], this deviation will be prompt ly reported to both the EC/IRB and Stryker.   
12.[ADDRESS_1154198]  
There is no guarantee that subjects will personally benefit from inclusion in this study.  Subjects 
may undergo more thorough screening and follow-up than non-study patients and may benefit 
from this increased surveillance.  This study se eks to provide clinicians information about this 
system/device by [CONTACT_831612]/device to published results for other 
treatments/devices.  Information gathered in this study may benefit others undergoing this 
procedure in the future.  
Subjects will have incentives to return for follow-up visits through an optional patient retention 
program.  Subjects will earn points for completing each follow-up visit within the windows outlined in the protocol and without protocol deviations.  They will then have the opportunity to redeem their points for a gift (See Appendix G, Patient Retention Program).  Use of this

monitoring visit.  The monitor will review all source documents and compare them to the data 
contained in the CRFs, in addition to performing a periodic review of regulatory documents such as EC/IRB approvals.  The monitors will need the following when they visit: 
• An area where they can review study data 
• Subject case books • Patient charts pulled at the center 
• Regulatory documents 
• Time to meet with the SC and the Investigator  
13.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
A quality assurance audit is a form of review that provides additional confidence to the sponsor 
concerning the validity and accuracy of clinical study data that may be submitted to a regulatory agency or for publication.  The purpose of investigator audits is to ensure that the investigator has maintained all study information according to the sponsor’s protocol and standard operating procedures and in compliance with FDA regulations. 
 
The investigator will permit study-related monito ring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, 
Stryker and/or government regulatory bodies of all study related documents (e.g. source

14 Ethical Considerations 
This study is to be conducted according to [LOCATION_002] standards of GCPs and applicable 
government regulations including 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 as well as 46 CFR Parts 160 and 
164. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be subm itted to a properly constituted independent 
EC/IRB for formal approval of the study conduc t.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the 
conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to Stryker before commencement of this study.  The investigator should provide a list 
of EC/IRB members and their affiliates to Stryker, if available. 
 
All patients considered for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for patients to make an informed decision about their 
participation.  See Appendix E for a copy of the Model Informed Patient Consent.  This consent form must be modified to contain center specific information and submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a patient, using the IRB 
approved consent form, must be obtained before that patient is submitted to any study procedure.  This consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_831613]-designated research professional obtaining the consent.  
 
[ADDRESS_1154200] with this study (e.g. patent ownership, royalties or 
financial gain greater than the maximum allowable by [CONTACT_1385]) must have the conflict 
reviewed by [CONTACT_421171]/IRB or a properly constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a 
Rejuvenate® Modular Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_1154201]’s loss of health insurance coverage or denied coverage.  In a case where a patient has lost health insurance coverage and no other 
coverage is available, Stryker may, on a case-by-case basis, reimburse investigators for office visits and radiographic charges for subjects involved in this study in order to facilitate data retrieval.  The physician or the office staff should contact [CONTACT_831614] e-approval.  After receipt of the completed data 
forms, the physician must submit either evidence of coverage denial (e.g. explanation of 
benefits) or a letter explaining that the subject does not have insurance.  Other visits, procedures and assessments done other than those specified in the protocol will not be reimbursed.  Reimbursement may be provided under the following conditions: 
• Study subjects lose insurance coverage after enrollment into the study 
• An insurance carrier refuses to pay for a follow-up visit and/or radiographs     
• An insurance carrier refuses to provide a subject referral to see the investigator for 
follow-up  
 
Under extreme circumstances, and with prior approval, Stryker may reimburse a subject for the 
cost of transportation to and from the investigator’s office for a protocol-required office visit.  This policy is the same for all participati ng study subjects and does not bias against any 
particular subject or study cohort.   
 
16 Publication Plan 
 It is anticipated that publication of the multi-center study results will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_421134] a peer-reviewed journal at the time the study cohort reaches 5 years of follow-up.  Additional 
publication proposals may be made by [CONTACT_831615].  This study will utilize the guidelines for authorship published by [CONTACT_26399] (ICMJE).  This guidance can be referenced at www.icmje.org

Appendix B
 
  
Biomechanical Measurement Protocol  
 
The CRFs in Appendix F should be referenced 
for all preoperative and pos toperative data required.
The following lists biomechanical measurements required preoperatively and 
postoperatively according to this study protocol.  These measurements may not be standard as part of site data collection.  This appendix should be referenced in detail so 
that all source documentation is reflective of non-standard data points collected. 
A complete summary of all preoperative and postoperative data
 needed can be 
found in Appendix F. 
 
BIOMECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS 
An independent radiographic reviewer will be identified to assess radiographic stability during the study.  For collection of bi omechanical measurements, however, the 
investigator at each site will obtain natural preoperative and replaced postoperative values, as well as create a preoperative plan from templating. 
 
Measurement Guidelines 
 
Measurement of leg length discrepancy  should be determined from the AP pelvis 
radiograph by [CONTACT_831617] (Reference Line B in Figure 1, below).  These lines are to be used as the main reference 
lines for measuring the distance to the top of each lesser trochanter (Reference Line C 
in Figure 1, below).
i  The difference between these distances is the value of leg length 
discrepancy.  From this value, the amount of leg length to be restored may be planned. 
 
Figure 1.ii  Reference Lines for Measuring Leg Length Discrepancy 
 
Femoral offset  should be determined by [CONTACT_831618].iii 
 
Femoral neck angle is the angle between the long axes of the femoral neck and 
femoral shaft.iv 
 
Figure 2.v Femoral Offset “A” and Femoral Neck Angle “B” 
 
Qualitative determination of version:  Proximal femoral version reflects the 
relationship of the axis of the femoral neck to the transcondylar axis of the distal femur.vi  
Qualitative determination of whether natural femoral version is retroverted, anteverted or 
in a state of neutral version should be made from the lateral radiograph.  
 
Natural Preoperative Measurements 
 
Preoperatively, study radiographs will be tak en by [CONTACT_104489].  From these 
preoperative radiographs, the investigator at each site will provide a detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_831567]’s level of deformity, as follows.  
• Leg length discrepancy (centimeters)  
• Natural femoral offset (millimeters)  
• Natural femoral neck angle (degrees) 
• Qualitative assessment of natural femoral version  (Retroverted, Neutral, 
Anteverted)  
 
 
Preoperative Plan 
 
The investigator at each center will creat e a preoperative biomechanical measurement 
plan for each case from templating, reflecting desired postoperative measurements and 
the component sizes, angles and offsets that will be used to achieve these measurements.  All component sizes should be corrected for magnification (if any) prior to data collection on the study CRF.  This may be accomplished by [CONTACT_831619].
vii 
 
Preoperative Distance from Planned Center of Rotation 
• Vertical distance from the anatomic hip center to the planned center of 
rotation of the hip (millimeters)  
• Horizontal distance from the anatomic hip center to the planned center of rotation of the hip  (millimeters)  
  
  
Components to be Used 
• Acetabular cup size 
• Femoral neck angle [127°, 132°, 130° (The 130° neck angle is only available in 
16° of version.)]  
• Femoral neck length  (millimeters)  
• Femoral head size  
• Femoral head offset 
• Femoral stem size* 
• Femoral version (0°, ±8°, ±16°)  
 
 
*The Rejuvenate® Modular Stem will be available in sizes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.  The 
Rejuvenate® Monolithic Stem will be available in sizes 4, 5 and 6; however, the 
Rejuvenate® Monolithic Stem may not be used according to this protocol .  Patients 
requiring a femoral stem in size 4, 5 or 6 should not be enrolled into the study.  Investigators should template the femoral stem size to be used prior to completing the 
Inclusion/Exclusion CRF for enrollment into the study. 
 
Additional Planned Measurements 
• Amount of leg length to restore  (centimeters)  
• Femoral offset to achieve (millimeters)  
• Qualitative assessment of planned postoperative femoral version 
(Retroverted, Neutral, Anteverted) 
 
 
Postoperative Measurements 
 
A postoperative check of biomechanical measurements will be performed by [CONTACT_831597] 6-week radiographs to confirm the degree to which the 
preoperative plan was achieved.  If an AE for instability exists, Stryker will work with an independent radiographic reviewer 
to re-evaluate the case and confirm whether or not the postoperative biomechanical 
measurements have changed as a result of the AE. If changes have occurred, the reviewer will continue to assess radiographs at each applicable postoperative interval until the hip has stabilized.  
 
 
Postoperative Distance from Planned Center of Rotation 
• Vertical distance from the postoperative hip center to the planned 
preoperative center of rotation of the hip (millimeters)  
• Horizontal distance from the postoperative hip center to the planned preoperative center of rotation of the hip (millimeters)  
 
 Additional Postoperative Measurements 
• Leg length discrepancy (centimeters)  
• Final femoral offset (millimeters) 
• Final femoral neck angle used [127°, 132°, 130° (The 130° neck angle is only 
available in 16° of version.)]  
• Qualitative assessment of replaced femoral version (Retroverted, Neutral, 
Anteverted)  
 
These postoperative values will be compared to the preoperative plan to evaluate the 
degree of patient matching achieved with the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System.

Clinical Trial with Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System  
 
 
Dr. (name) of (practice) is participating in a clinic al study evaluating a new 
primary hip replacement for cementless us e in patients who are eligible for a 
primary total hip replacement.   
  The Rejuvenate
® Modular Hip System  features a modular hip prosthesis with 
two components fitting together, allowing  the device to be changed based on a 
patient’s anatomy.  This allows for more adaptability.  With a stem and neck 
used together, the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is intended for 
cementless, press-fit use.  It is compatible with other Stryker components as well.  
This system is currently being sold worl dwide and is implanted in patients who 
need primary hip surgery. 
 
 
 
 
Dr. (name) is one of 10 to 12 surgeons nation wide selected to enroll qualifying 
patients into this clinical study. The data  collected will be used to evaluate both 
short and long-term (10-year) performance of the components following surgery.  
 
The study includes males and non-pregnant  females [ADDRESS_1154207]. (name)  or 
(study coordinator name)  at the numbers listed be low for further details.  
  Your request for information about this study in no way commits you to 
participate.  In order to participate, you will have to meet specific criteria and

I. Study Title:  Post-market Study of the Stryker Orthopaedics Rejuvenate® Modular Hip 
System 
II. Description of the Study  
You have been asked to take part in this research study because your physician has 
determined that you need surgery to replace your hip joint.  A total of approximately 240 subjects from 10 - 12 different clinics will be participating in this study.   
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success rate of cementless primary hip 
replacement with the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System as compared to the Secur-Fit™ 
HA monolithic femoral hip stem, through absence of revision of femoral neck and stem 
(components implanted in your thigh bone) at 5 years postoperative.  We (Stryker Orthopaedics, implant manufacturer and sponsor  of the study, and your physician) are 
doing this study to find out if Stryker Orthopaedics Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System is 
at least as good as hips implanted with the Secur-Fit™ HA monolithic femoral stem.   
You will be asked some questions during this visit and based on study specific criteria, 
you may or may not be selected to participate in the study.  
Meeting all of the above criteria does not guarantee participation in the study. Further 
consideration and a screening evaluation with the physician are necessary to ensure this is the right study for you.  Study personnel at the site will explain all the details of the study to you so you can make an informed decision as to whether you would like to 
participate. 
If selected, your participation in the study will last [ADDRESS_1154208] 
care following hip surgery, and would be performed in the same manner if you were not 
involved in the study. Your doctor will inform you where the x-rays will be done.  In addition, your doctor will ask you to fill out the two general health assessment questionnaires at your 6 week, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10-year visits.  
Finally, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire regarding your satisfaction 
with the results of your hip replacement at 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after surgery. 
III.   Postoperative Condition and Care 
Your doctor will give you specific instructions regarding your care and rehabilitation after 
your surgery.  As with any surgery, your body takes time to heal.  That amount of time will be related to the extent of the surgical procedure and your general physical 
Patient’s Initials ______     Page 2 of 5 condition.  During this period of healing, you may experience postoperative pain, 
perhaps lasting several months after the operation. 
You will be told to use walking aids (crutches, walker or cane) for a period of time after 
your surgery.  The use of these walking aids will lessen pressure and weight loads on 
your hip, which is thought to increase the chances for a stable implant.  You have been informed that you must follow your physician’ s orders, including those regarding the use 
of walking aids.   
The goal of this surgery is to lessen pain and increase your hip function.  You will need 
to see your physician at 6 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 years after your surgery for 
evaluation of your artificial hip joint.   
IV. Foreseeable Risks and Discomforts 
This study involves the routine assessment of a primary hip replacement procedure.  
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the device used in this study for 
sale in the [LOCATION_002].  There are no additional risks associated with participating in 
this study over and above that of the primary hip surgery.  You may need to spend a little 
more time in the doctor’s office to fill out paperwork.  If at any time new information is developed during this research study which may affect your willingness to participate, the information will be provided to you. 
 
There are, however, standard risks associated with hip surgery.  These include but are 
not limited to:  moderate to severe pain; crack/fracture (breakage) of femoral (thigh) or acetabular (pelvic) bones or components; migration (movement) of components; 
subsidence (sinking) of components; dislocation (to move out of normal position) of components; sensitivity to metal components (femoral [thigh] and acetabular [pelvic]); revision (removal) of one or more of the components; loosening and infection; wear 
(rubbing) of the components which could lead to bone loss; peripheral neuropathies (any 
disorder of the nerves involving your legs); nerve damage; abnormal bone formation; circulatory compromise (changes in circulation related to your heart, blood and lymph vessels, to varying degrees); genitourinary disorders (related to urination); gastrointestinal disorders (related to the stomach and intestines); vascular disorders 
(related to blood vessels:  including thrombus [blood clot]); bronchopulmonary disorders 
(related to the bronchi tubes and lungs, such as pneumonia); emboli (plugged vessel); myocardial infarction (heart attack) or death. 
V.  Potential Benefits 
While there is no guarantee that you will personally benefit from inclusion in this study, information gathered in this study may benefit others undergoing primary hip surgery in 
the future. 
You will have incentives to return for annual follow-up visits through a patient retention 
program.  Patients enrolled into the study are encouraged to complete all of their required follow-up visits.  You will earn points for completing each annual follow-up visit within the windows outlined in the protocol and without any protocol deviations.  You will 
then have the opportunity to redeem your points for a gift selected from a specific listing, 
or save them and work toward a higher-level gift.  As the follow-up visits increase in  
number, the point values associated with the visits will also increase.  The monetary value of the gifts is modest and should not influence your decision to participate in the study. 
Patient’s Initials ______     Page [ADDRESS_1154209] discussed alternative treatments with your surgeon which include but are not 
limited to:  conservative non-surgical treatm ent, cemented total hip replacement utilizing 
commercially available components, hip fusion or no treatment at all. 
You may decline to participate in this study.  This will not change any procedures 
associated with your hip surgery.  Your physician can provide detailed information about 
this treatment and the benefits of various treatment options available to you.  You should 
feel free to discuss your alternatives with your physician.

A Prospective Open-label Evaluation of the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System 
 
• Who is eligible to participate?  
Enrolled subjects for the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System post-market study w ho have undergone primary cementless total hip 
replacement according to the protocol and are returning for the 1-year visit after completion of the 6-week follow-up visit, wi thout 
deviation  
 
• How long the program will run?  
Start of enrollment until [ADDRESS_1154239] has returned for the 10-year follow-up visit 
 
• Individual Rewards    
Subjects advance one prize level for each annual follow-up visit  completed within the windows outlined in the protocol (visit 
schedule noted below) and without any postoperative protocol deviations .  Upon exit from the study, subjects have the 
opportunity to receive a gift selected from a specific listing th at corresponds to the prize level earned.  Values may be divid ed to 
receive multiple awards.  As the annual follow-up visits increase in number, the award level will also increase.  For example, a subject that attends all annual follow-up visits would receive a G level award, a subject that has missed one annual follow-up visit or 
deviated in any one postoperative visit would receive a F level award and so on.  
   
  
 
• If a subject would then like to redeem his/her points prior to study withdrawal, they may at any time.  The subject would cont inue in the 
study, but the amount of points redeemed would be deducted from their total points moving forward.  For example: 
o A subject decides to redeem their points after completing the 1-year, 2-year and 3-year visits according to protocol.  The sub ject 
plans to continue in the study for the 7-year and 10-year time points. 
o The subject may redeem 300 points (or any lesser amount of points in 100-point increments) for completing three postoperative 
visits according to protocol.  If a subject chooses to redeem 300 points, he/she could either receive the Level C award booklet  
or Level A and Level B booklets at once. 
o As the subject continues in the study, the number of points already redeemed is deducted from t he number of points that would 
have been available for redemption at each later visit.  For instance, after [ADDRESS_1154240] would only be eligible for 400 points upon study closure. 
o The maximum number of points that can be redeemed over the course of the study is 700. 
 
• Bilateral subjects do not accumulate double points.  Points are accrued per subject, not per hip enrolled. 
 
• When subjects have completed the study by [CONTACT_831628] 10-y ear follow-up visit, they request an award booklet and order form f rom 
their SC.  The award booklet will only contain the awards that the patient is eligible to receive according to the total gift l evel they have 
earned at that time.  The subject selects the award and completes and mails in the order form.  Awards may also be redeemed onl ine 
at www.ecgy.net . 
 • All awards will be shipped directly to the subject’s address (no P.O. boxes) with postage and/or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_831587] S tryker.  In 
the event a parcel arrives in a damaged or unsatisfactory condition, the SC is notified so that Stryker may be informed.  Rewar ds 
should not be returned without specific instructions.

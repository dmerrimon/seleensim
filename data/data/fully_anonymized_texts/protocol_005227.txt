1. Introduction  
 
a. Background and significance  
 
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also called Osler- Weber -Rendu syndrome, is an 
autosomal domin ant disorder characterized by [CONTACT_7163]- systemic vascular abnormalities. The condition 
is associated with fragile telangiectasias  and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can affect 
the lungs, liver, brain, and mucosal surfaces. These abnormalities can re sult in severe and potentially 
fatal complications, including stroke, brain abscess, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. 
Although it is a rare condition, there is a large affected population with an estimated incidence of [ADDRESS_733277] benefit include estrogens, progestogens, and antifibrinolytics suc h as tranexamic acid. These 
medications, however, are associated with concerning and poorly characterized side effects and their 
benefit is generally inconsistent. Relevant procedural interventions include laser cauterization, septal 
dermoplasty, embolizat ion, and nasal closure. Disadvantages of these approaches include their 
invasive nature and associated risks, as well as a generally temporary benefit.  
 
Anti-angiogenic agents are being increasingly used to control bleeding in HHT patients, since the 
funda mental problem in HHT is abnormal angiogenesis. R educed activation of TGF -β and increased 
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  results in unregulated angiogenesis and leads to 
formation of d isordered and fragile blood vessels on the mucosal surfaces, particularly in the nose 
and gastrointestinal tract, which are prone to spontaneous and recurrent bleeding (1). Anti -
angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab and thalidomide have been used with great success to reduce 
the formation of these abnormal vessels and reduce bleeding in HHT patients (2 -7). Therapeutic effect 
has been seen even at low doses of these agents, suggesting that the telangiectasias of HHT may be 
particularly sensitive to anti- angiogenic agents (8,9). However, the existing anti- angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_558488], difficult to administer, and hard to tolerate due to frequent side effects. There is great 
need for a drug which can replicate these anti- angiogenic effects but which is well- tolerated, orally -
administered, inexpensive and readily available.  
            
Data suggests that doxycycline, a common medication used for decades in the treatment of bacterial 
infections, may have potential in the treatment of HHT epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. Recent studies reveal that 
doxycycline has potent anti -angio genic properties, inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
which function to allow endothelial cells to migrate during angiogenesis. These anti- angiogenic 
properties have been demonstrated in multiple in -vivo and in -vitro studies ( 10-14). Doxycycline se ems 
to effect anti -angiogenesis not only by [CONTACT_558508], but also by [CONTACT_558509] 3 of 8

 effect of VEGF (15) and inhibiting pro -angiogenic macrophages ( 16). Multiple in -vitro studies have 
demonstrated suppression of tumor growth and vascul arization in cell lines exposed to doxycycline, 
including lung, cervical, ovarian, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers ( 17-21). 
            
The potential of doxycycline to suppress angiogenesis and reduce nosebleeds has been previously 
recognized and studied in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (22). A retrospective analysis of seven HHT patients treated 
with oral doxycycline demonstrated that epi[INVESTIGATOR_145756] (ESS) significantly decreased with 
treatment, from a pre -treatment ESS of 4.[ADDRESS_733278] 50% reduction 
in nosebleed severity underscores the anti -angiogenic properties of doxycycline and supports the 
potential of this  therapy  in HHT .  
 
The NOSTRIL study will be the first prospective, randomized trial to assess the control of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558489]. This therapy has the potential to dramatically improve the health 
and quality of life of patients with HHT.  
 
2. Objectives and Specific Aims  
The objective of this study is to determine whether prophylactic oral doxycycline  is effective  in 
reducing epi[INVESTIGATOR_558490] ( HHT ).  
 
We will perform a comparative, blinded , randomize d (1:1)  controlled  trial to treat  HHT patients with 
nosebleeds with doxycycline versus placebo . This project has the following specific aims:  
 
1. Determine the effect of doxycycline  treatment versus placebo on the frequency, duration, and 
severity of nasal bleeding in HHT. Bleeding will be quantified in a systematic manner using the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_145746] (ESS), a validated and objective tool for the assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558491]. 
We will further quantify bleeding using a patient nosebleed diary  includ ing frequency, duration and 
severity of nosebleeds . 
 
2. Determine the effect of doxycycline  treatment versus placebo on quality of life in HHT. Data has 
shown that recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_558492], and HHT patients have 
identified epi[INVESTIGATOR_558493] a key focus for future research in the treatment of the disease. We will 
evaluate quality of life  using the objective, validated Short Form -12 (SF -12) Health Status 
Questionnaire.  
 
3. Determine the effect of doxycycline treatment versus placebo  on objective laboratory measures 
of bleeding, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin.  
 
4. Determine the effect of doxycycline treatment versus placebo  on the need for transfusion in HHT. 
Transfusion is used in cases of severe, life -threatening bleeding, and in many cases is required in 
HHT -related epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. We will compare the quantitative units of pac ked red blood cells (PRBCs) 
required with and without doxycycline  therapy.  
 
Hypothesis:  Treatment with doxycycline  results in significant improvement in HHT epi[INVESTIGATOR_558494] , which is manifested by [CONTACT_558510], better quality of life, 
improvement in objective laboratory values such as hemoglobin levels, and reduced need for blood 
transfusion .

3. Study Design and Dose Rationale  
 
a. Study Design Rationale  
A randomized  (1:1) , prospective, cross -over design will be used. This guarante es th at all participants 
will receive treatment with the treatment drug , which is important since all patients enrolled will have 
significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_558495] . An identical design was used in a previous  study of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558496]  (23).  
 
A one -month wash -out period between placebo and treatment drug was selected based on 
doxycycline pharmacokinetics  and mucosa turnover rate . Doxycycline is almost completely absorbed 
orally with bioavailability of 95% and a time to peak concentration of about [ADDRESS_733279] dose (12 half -lives). The nasal mucosa, which could be 
affected by [CONTACT_33641], regenerates approximately every 5 days  (24). Thus the biologic effect of the drug 
should be virtually absent by [ADDRESS_733280] th e follow -
up visit over the phone.  
 
Based on preliminary data ( 14) the average epi[INVESTIGATOR_145756] (ESS) for the patients we will recruit 
is 4.9 ± 2.2. The preliminary study found that doxycycline treatment reduced the ESS by [CONTACT_5554] 
2.4 ± 1.2 points.  Thus, a  sample size of 20 patients from the cross over de sign will achieve 90% power 
to test the mean differences in ESS between doxycycline  and placebo at alpha of 5% using a two-sided 
t-test. To consider the possible dropout or missing (approximately 10% rate), a  total sample size of 22 
patients will be random ized. This was the same sample size used in the previous cross -over trial of a 
different medication in HHT patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (23).  
 
b. Dose Rationale  
The dose of doxycycline used in this study will be [ADDRESS_733281] known at this 
dose. The preliminary trial of doxycycline in HHT patients used the same dose (14), as did several 
clinical trials of doxycycline for treatment of cancer and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (24,25) . 
 
4. Study procedures  
This trial will be performed with UCLA Institutional Review Board approval and in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsin ki, with all patients providing written informed consent.  
 
a. Study Design:  
i. This is a single -center , prospective , randomized  (1:1) , controlled, cross  over, double -
blinded  study  
ii. Total N = 22 Patients  
iii. The following information will be collected during the study:  
1- Demographic information

 2- Medical history  
3- Physical Examination  
4- Concomitant medication  
5- Adverse events  
6- Vital signs  
7- SF-[ADDRESS_733282] for HHT (relevant mutation in the genes coding for SMAD -4, ALK -1, or endoglin). 
Other inclusion criteria include age 18 or older, avoidance of other experimental 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195858], and significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (minimum of [ADDRESS_733283] 15 minu tes per week ). Female patients with 
childbearing potential will require a negative pregnancy test on Day 1 of the trial and at  
the Crossover visit . Female patients with childbearing potential will also  agree to use birth 
control  during the study from Day 1  of the trial (First and Second arm) and for 28 days 
following cessation of the study medication s (Placebo and Doxycyclyne).   Patients will also 
be excluded if they have used  certain medications within 14 days prior to the study, 
including barbiturates, tegretol, dilantin, warfarin, isotretinoin , and a variety of other 
medications that are contra -indicated with doxycycline  use. 
 
v. Consented subjects will be randomized and blinde d to the study medications. Subjects 
will be randomized to either the Doxycycline arm (100mg PO BID) or to the placebo arm 
(2 placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/day). After randomization, subjects will have 15 days to 1 month run in 
period to establish baseline characteristics  (bleeding) prior to treatment initiation. As this 
is a crossover study, subjects will start with one treatment for 2 months followed by a 1 
month washout period and then switch to the second treatment for another 2 months 
and a 1 month follow -up visit.  
 
vi. Both Doxycycline and placebo drugs will be dispensed by [CONTACT_558511] (RRUMC) investigational pharmacy. The exploratory grant is covering for 
the cost of the drugs.  
 
 
b. Outcomes  
The primary outcome measures will be the frequency and du ration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558497] a 
nosebleed diary and the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_558498] (ESS), a validated objective measure of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558499]. The ESS metric has been recommended for the evaluation of new epi[INVESTIGATOR_558500]. There 
will also be a numb er of secondary measures. First, we will evaluate patient quality of life using the 
objective Short Form- 12 (SF -12) Health Status Questionnaire. Laboratory markers of bleeding will 
represent an additional secondary outcome measure and include ferritin, hem oglobin, hematocrit  
and MMP -9. To evaluate for severe bleeding requiring transfusion, we will quantify the units of packed 
red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused over each one -month period of observation. Finally, we will 
evaluate for treatment failure, includ ing need for nasal surgery or other epi[INVESTIGATOR_558501] .

 c. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
i. Inclusion Criteria  
- Age [ADDRESS_733284] moderate by [CONTACT_55396][INVESTIGATOR_558502] (ESS) evaluation, a validated objective index of bleeding severity  
- Female patients with childbearing potential will require a negative pregnancy test on  
the first d ay of the trial and  at the crossover visit. They will also  agree to use birth control 
during the study medication period  (placebo and Doxycycline)  and for [ADDRESS_733285] that doxycycline  is a Pregnancy Category D  
medication  and sinc e this is a double blinded study, patients need to be on birth control 
on both arms  
 
ii.  Exclusion Criteria   
 - Patients will be disqualified for use of certain medications within 14 days prior to the 
study, including barbiturates, tegretol, dilantin, warfarin, isotretinoin, and several  other 
medications that are contra -indicated with doxycycline  use. 
 
5. Monitoring and Safety Mechanisms  
a. The study will follow the OHRPP Data Security in Research guidance and procedures for 
data security. The study data will be coded and no personal information will be recorded.  
b. Patient safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_16309]. Any events or 
unforeseen complications during and after the treatment period will be promptly 
assessed and any required intervention will be performed to minimize any compromise 
to patient care and safety.  
 
6. Statistical Analysis and Method of Data Analysis  
All data will be summarized with descriptive statists (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, median, and maximum) for continuous endpoints and frequency and percentage for 
categorical endpoints.  
 
The differences between ou tcome measures in the  doxycycline group versus the placebo group will 
be contrasted using Student’s t -test for each of the primary and secondary outcome measures. If the 
outcome measurements do not meet the normality assumption even after a transformation,  non-
parametric approach of Wilcoxon sign -rank tests can be used to test the differences between 
doxycycline  and placebo. Although we will have enough washout time before cross over to other 
treatment arm, we can test the effects of sequence and carryover in a model.

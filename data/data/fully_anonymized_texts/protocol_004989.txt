Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208011] places on the face to show signs of aging, in the 
form of lateral canthal lines or Crow’s Feet. Genetic differences and environmental toxins, 
predominantly ultraviolet light exposure and cigarette smoking, may alter  the rate of this 
normal aging process2. 
 
Over the past two decades, there has been increasing demand for aesthetic procedures 
to reverse the effects of aging, particularly in the facial area, and treatment of Crow's F eet 
is among the most frequent of corr ective treatment requests. A number of techniques 
have been developed to meet the increasing demand for aesthetic procedures to reverse 
the signs of aging . The se include:  incisional and excisional  surgery, various resurfacing 
procedures, and the use of temporary or semi -permanent , injectable dermal fillers such 
as allogeneic or xenogeneic collagen, hyaluronic acid, and autologous fat cells. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l 
agents, such as r etinoic acids, glycolic acids  and lactic acids, are other common methods 
to minimize Crow’s F eet and other facial wrinkles.   
 
Injection of botulinum  toxin type A (BoNT A) is now one of the most common  aesthetic 
procedures performed  and there is a considerable body of medical literature 
demonstrating its safety  and efficacy in aesthetic indications3. On a molecular level, 
botulinum  toxin prevents the release of preformed mediators, such as acetylcholine, from 
motor nerve endings leading to a flaccid paralysis.  
 
BoNTA  is an effective treatment for Crow’s Feet  and is associated with high subject 
satisfaction . However, the treatment requires multiple injections  into a well innervated, 
sensitive area that is prone to bleeding and bruising and close to delicate organs  such as 
the eyes  and lachrymal glands . In addi tion, misplacement of injection can lead to 
unwanted effects in non -target areas. Therefore, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_177490], avoiding the discomforts and potential side effects of 
injections, would be highly desirable .   
 
Several studies have been conducted assessing the dose -response of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_177491], ET-014, in the treatment of Crow’s Feet. The product was well 
tolerated . This current clinical trial seeks to expand on the existing work.

2 STUDY OBJECTI VES AND PURPOSE  
In two previous stud ies ET-01 was applied at doses of up to 1,150  U after skin pre -
conditioning with microneedle arrays of the type AdminStamp. The purpose of this 
Phase  2 study is to continue with the previously employed AdminStamp for skin pre -
conditioning  while advancing dose exploration.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Design  
The study will be a n out-patient, prospectively randomized, double -blind, vehicle -
controlled, two-armed, parallel dose  group , multi -center clinical trial.  
3.2 Treatment Groups / Sample Size  
The following dose groups and sample sizes are planned:   
 
Dose Group   Vehicle  1,600 U ∑ Total  
Sample Size  N = 20 20 40 
 
The treatment area  will be preconditioned with  a microneedle array, AdminStamp 600,  
that features microneedles 0.5 mm in length . ET-01 will be applied immediately after pre -
conditioning.  
3.3 Efficacy Parameters  and Timing  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Crow’s Feet Wrinkle Scale (CFW), which is a 
published validated, photo -numeric guide that grades severity of lateral canthal lines into 
one of the five categories of 0=none, 1=mi nimal , 2=mild, 3= moderate, and 4=severe. (see  
Appendix  A for details). Using the same scale, assessments will be made by [CONTACT_17588], t he 
investigator (IGA) and the subjects (SSA). Assessments are made “static” to avoid recall 
bias.  
 
The IGA  and SSA  are recorded separately for the right and left canthal areas , both “at 
rest” and “on contraction” . The IGA and SSA will be recorded at each visit.   
3.4 Safety Parameters and Timing  
Safety will be assessed during the study by [CONTACT_177508], review of 
concomitant treatments and laboratory data. Clinical adverse event reporting will be 
conducted at each visit.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-209 January 1 8, 2019 Page 8 of 42 
 
 Confidential     
All laboratory measurements will be performed by a central laboratory using appropriate 
and validated metho ds. Values will be reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Laboratory reference range values will be described in the laboratory manual. 
Investigators will assess all out of range values as being clinically significant or not.  
3.4.1  Vital signs  
Weight, height (Screening visit only) temperature, resting pulse , blood pressure, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. Vital signs will be recorded at every visit . 
3.4.2  Muscle Weakness or Paralysis  
Participants will be monitored for potential signs of botulinum  induced muscle weakne ss 
or paralysis. Subjects will be evaluated for Signs of Botulinum Toxin Spread ( muscle 
weakness  - ocular and the extremities) or difficulty swallowing or breathing (cranial nerve 
assessment, Appendix  B). 
 
The neurologic assessments are made at Baseline, Week 1, 2 , and Week 4.  
3.4.3  Hematology  
Non-fasting clinical hematology evaluations are:  
hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count , with a differential, 
and a platelet count.  
 
Non-fasting clinical hematology evaluations will be performed at Week 0 (Baseline) , 
Week  4, and Week  26/End of Study . 
3.4.[ADDRESS_208012] non-fasting chemistry panel will be performed which will incl ude the following 
parameters:  
glucose, uric acid, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, chloride, alkaline 
phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, 
bicarbonate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase , total protein, 
albumin.  
 
The chemistry panel will be performed at Basel ine (Week 0) , Week  4, and Week 26/End 
of Study . A urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of child -bearing potential at 
Baseline and the Week 4 visit.

3.6 Measures to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
To minimize bias, subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups, 
i.e. vehicle  (group A) vs. active dose (group B) . Neither subjects nor investigators will be 
aware of the treatment allocation.   
 
 
 
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208014] and diluents will be provided in kits containing 3 mL dropper bottles that contain 
either ET-01 or Vehicle.  
 
The following dose groups and sample sizes are planned:  
 
Dose Group   Vehicle  1,600 U ∑ Total  
Sample Size  N = [ADDRESS_208015]’s canthal areas. 
The site will be instructed to make sure no syringes or needles are present in the 
treatment room b efore study medication is brought into the room.  
 
The treatment area is the periorbital region in the distribution of the muscles responsible 
for the Crow’s Feet wrinkles. The muscle being treated to reduce the Crow’s Feet wrinkle 
– the orbicularis oculi  – is illustrated Figure 1.

In general, the treatment region begins on the bony rim of the orbit, extending laterally to 
approximately one centimeter from t he exterior edge of the hairline, 1 - 1.5 cm above and 
1.5 – 2 cm below a horizontal line emanating from the lateral canthus to the hairline. This 
area of application is illustrated by [CONTACT_177510][INVESTIGATOR_50615]:

Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208016]’s treatment. In no case, however, should ET-01 ever be 
applied within the area circumscribed by [CONTACT_177511].  
 
The treatment area will be pre -conditioned by [CONTACT_177512] , applying 
approximately 3 -4 pounds of pressure, to the skin. The location of the areas of pre -
conditioning are illustrated by [CONTACT_177513] 2. There will b e three (3) 
impressions made along the bony rim of the orbital cavity and one (1) impression distal 
and inferior to the horizontal mid-line. After all four impressions have been made, the 
micro -needle array will be rotated by [CONTACT_3450] 90 ° and the proc ess is repeated.  
 
Immediately thereafter, u sing a gloved finger, the investigator will massage [ADDRESS_208017] will be positioned on an examination table or fully 
reclined examination chair such that his/her temple will slightly slant backwards and to 
the side, directing any run -off away from the eyes and into the hairline.  
 
There are [ADDRESS_208018] Article are 
applied  as listed below:   
 
Phase 1: Gelling  the sample becomes clear in color and flowable.  
Phase 2: Creaming  the sample becomes more v iscous, is white in color, and 
sticky.  
Phase 3: Absorption  the sample becomes clear in color and has a glossy smooth 
finish. There is no visible residue left on the skin after 
absorption.  
 
The process of treatment application will take at least  [ADDRESS_208019] time, especially the creaming  phase. This procedure will be 
completed when there is no liquid visible on the surface of the skin.

6.1.9  Study Exit / Early Termination  
The scheduled Study Exit is at Week 26. However, if a subject should discontinue 
prematurely, the following will be performed in addition to the procedures scheduled for 
the patient’s t erminating visit:  
 
• collect non -fasting blood samples for laboratory safety testing  
6.1.[ADDRESS_208034] the investigator or may be called in for additional unscheduled 
visits due to safety reasons or at the discretion of the investi gator or Sponsor. All 
unscheduled visits will describe the reason for the visit in the  electronic  Case Report 
Form. Some of the procedures that may be completed at an Unscheduled Study Visit are 
as follows:  
 
• Review of adverse events and concomitant medica tions  
• Vital signs  
• Collection of  blood samples for laboratory safety testing  
• Urine pregnancy testing  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208035]  will participate for up to 26 weeks. There will be a (Qualifying) Baseline V isit 
on Week  0 and seven  in-office visits at Week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 , and 26. 
7.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177500] a sequential, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_42970], dose -escalation trial. 
Enrollment will be halted after each cohort until a safety review has been completed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one serious adverse event  (SAE) , 
considered to be probably or d efinitely related to the administration of study 
medication, is observed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one AE is observed considered to be 
indicative of distant spread of study medication or unintended exposure to other 
beings.  
 
• The Sponso r may stop the study in its entirety or discontinue individual study 
centers at its discretion for any reason or, e.g. if it is observed that the protocol or 
sound clinical practices are not being followed, or for any other reasons.  
 
The study protocol cal ls for only one single application of study medication at Baseline 
(Week 0). Since there is no continuous treatment, no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177501] v isit at Week 26. 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208036] s will be queried with regards to concomitant medication at all study visits.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
Adverse event reporting will be handled in accordance with the IRB requirements and the 
requirements of other regulatory authorities that may apply, e.g. the Food and Drug 
Administration.  
 
Adverse Events reporting will be solicited by [CONTACT_105] -leading "How Do Y ou Feel" questions. 
Subtle symptoms of local or systemic spread of toxin effect would be unlikely to be 
recognized by [CONTACT_177517]. Therefore, study participants will be 
asked if they experienced weakness, lethargy, or difficulty sw allowing or breathing. In 
addition, information derived from change in concomitant medications, laboratory 
analyses, and clinical observations will be evaluated for possible indications for side 
effects. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses o r reactions to concurrent 
medications will also be recorded. The Investigator must monitor the condition of the 
subject throughout the study from the time of obtaining informed consent until the final 
study visit.  
 
Any adverse event, including both observ ed and volunteered problems, complaints, and 
symptoms, will be recorded on the Adverse Event page s of the electronic Case Report 
Form. When an adverse event occurs, the following information and assessments should 
be recorded in the adverse event section o f the eCRF:  
 
• The signs, symptoms or diagnosis or the event,  
• The date and time of onset of the event using the 24 -hour clock where midnight is 
00:00 and noon is 12:00. Onset is the date when the first sign or symptoms were first 
noted.  
• Date of recovery/ resolution  
• The adverse event severity/ intensity using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.2  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug as outlined in Section 8.1.1   
• Any other actions required  such as therapy, medication, treatment or diagnostic 
procedure  
• Seriousness of the event using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.3  
• Outcome (recovered, recovered with sequelae, not yet recovered, death)  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208037] should be conducted until resolution of the adverse event or until 
the medical condition is stable. The investigator is responsibl e for the appropriate medical 
management of all adverse events.  
 
Adverse events will be analyzed and reported after unblinding of the treatment code within 
the clinical study report. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_177518] [ADDRESS_208038] that occurs during use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the 
drug; this includes accidental injuries, reasons  for any change in medication (drug and/or 
dose), and reasons for surgical procedures. It is to be noted that procedures are not 
adverse events. Abnormal laboratory values or clinically significant changes in laboratory 
values are not adverse events, but t he underlying reasons are. Regardless of the severity 
or relationship to the investigational drug, all adverse events occurring during the study 
period must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is one that has not been previousl y observed, or one that 
is of a specificity or severity not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure.  
8.1.1  Relationship to Study Drug  
The following definitions to assess the causal relationship between an adverse event 
and the study drug should be use d:  
 
Not Related : The event is clearly related to other factors such as a subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications.  
 
Possibly Related :  The event has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration and follows a known response pattern to the study 
drug. However, a potential alternate etiology may be responsible for 
the event.  
 
Related :  The event follows a clear -cut temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration and follows a known response patt ern to the 
study drug and either occurs immediately following study drug 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-209 January 1 8, 2019 Page 26 of 42 
 
 Confidential    administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on 
repeat exposure.  
8.1.2  Adverse Event Severity  
Mild: A mild adverse event is one that the symptoms are barely 
noticeable to a subject. It does not influence performance or prevent 
a subject from carrying on with normal life activities.  
 
Moderate :  A moderate adverse event is one that the symptoms make the 
subject uncomfortable and causes some impairment to normal life 
activitie s. Treatment for symptom(s) may be required.  
 
Severe :  A severe adverse event is one that the symptoms cause severe 
discomfort to the subject and severely limits the subject’s normal 
daily activities. Treatment for symptom(s) is given.  
 
Note that “serious ” and “severe ” are not synonymous. A serious 
adverse event must fulfill the requirements listed in the definition 
below, see section 8.1.3 . 
 
When intensity changes or occurs more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event will be listed. If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, then these min i-events or changes will be recorded separately (i.e., having distinct 
onset days).  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an event that is:  
• fatal / results in death  
• life-threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• requires or prolongs subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Life Threatening  is defined as an event in which a subject is at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it was more severe.  
Death : The death of an enrolled subject is not an event, but an outcome. It is the event 
that resulted in a fatal outcome that must be reported.  
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208039] BE R EPORTED IMMEDIATELY (DURING NORMAL 
BUSINESS HOURS, 9 AM TO 5 PM, ET) TO THE SPONSOR/MEDICAL MONITOR.  
 
Any serious adverse event should be reported to Eirion Therapeutics  by [CONTACT_18623]/or 
e-mail within [ADDRESS_208040]  be sent to Eirion 
Therapeutics . The original SAE report form should be mainta ined in the Regulatory 
Binder. It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to fulfill reporting obligations to the FDA . 
 
Reports of serious adverse events should be made by e-mail and/or telephone to  Eirion 
Therapeutics  Clinical Development Department:   
[EMAIL_3517]   [PHONE_3833]  
or  [EMAIL_3518]   [PHONE_3834]  
 
Serious adverse events associated with the use of the study medication will be reported 
to appropriate regulatory agencies, investigators, and the IRB by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.1.4  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Unanticipated problems involv ing risk to subjects or others are:  
• Any serious event (including on -site and off -site adverse events, injuries, side 
effects, deaths or other problems) which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177502], involved risk to subjects or others, a nd was possibly related to the 
research procedures.  
• Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that 
involves risk or has the potential to recur.  
• Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.  
• Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.  
• Any other serious and possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177503].  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_208041] at or after the Week  4 Visit will be permitted to remain in the study.  
 
Medically accepted methods of birth control are surgical sterilization (tubal sterilization or 
hysterectomy), vaginal ring contraceptive, patch contraceptive, injectable contraceptive, 
implantable contraceptive, Intrauterine Device (IUD), diaphragm, condom , or spermicidal 
gel or foam. Oral contraceptives (prescribed birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) are also acceptable 
provided this method has been used for at least [ADDRESS_208042] Population(s) for Analysis  
9.1.[ADDRESS_208043] (LOCF) procedure will be used for each pos t-
baseline visit with missing data. The exception to this procedure will be the treatment of 
missing data only on one side of the face, as discussed below. Subjects who are lost to 
follow -up and who do not have at least one post -baseline visit will not be included in the 
analysis.  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-209 January 1 8, 2019 Page 29 of 42 
 
 Confidential    An additional analysis may be performed in the per protocol population. Subjects will be 
considered “per protocol” if they complete the final visit  evaluation without a major  
protocol violation. No data imputations will be made f or this analysis.  
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1  Study Population  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, 
gender, race, height and weight) and background characteristics for all randomized 
subjects by [CONTACT_1570]. Past/c oexistent medical history information for all 
randomized subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing. Baseline assessments of 
LCL severity will also be presented as background characteristics of the population and 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Categorical measures 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. Continuous measures will be 
summarized with means, standard deviations and ranges (min and max).  
 
Descriptive statistics wi ll be used to summarize study medication compliance and 
exposure for all randomized subjects. Prior and concomitant medication information for 
all enrolled subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing.  
9.2.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The IGA and SSA scores  (Crow’s Feet Wrinkle scale) are evaluations performed by [CONTACT_177519], respectively, measured both at rest and on contraction. For 
analysis purposes they will be averaged between left and right sides prior to analysis. In 
the event one  side has missing data for a visit, the result from the side with non -missing 
data will be used instead of an average value. These scores will be treated as continuous 
measures for calculating means and performing ANOVA analyses, and they will be used 
as d escribed below to derive binary indicators of treatment success, which will be 
analyzed as dichotomous measures.  
 
Efficacy analyses will be  based on the assessments  from the treatment area s, i.e. the 
lateral canthal area only. Alpha will be set at 0.05. The Crow’s Feet Wrinkle scale  is an 
ordinal categorical scale  ranging from 0 to 4. As described above, left - and right -side 
values will be averaged, and the averaged values will be used for analysis.  
 
The Investigator’s Global A ssessment (IGA) is the primary efficacy parameter , and the 
evaluation of the active drug group  vs. vehicle will be the primary comparison s. Results 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-209 January 1 8, 2019 Page 30 of 42 
 
 Confidential    will be summarized for each treatment group and at each visit using frequency 
distributions.  
 
For the primary efficacy analysis , "IGA on contraction" (IGA -C) data will be analyzed at 
each visit  to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving treatment success  (responder) . 
For this analysis, a respon se will be defined as a reduction from baseline in IGA -C by [CONTACT_12697] [ADDRESS_208044] 2 points.  The analysis model s for the primary efficacy analysis 
will be used.  
 
Treatment success based on the SSA alone will also be analyzed using the abo ve 
definition and analysis model s. 
 
In addition, mean c hange from Baseline IGA will be analyzed using a n analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA ) model.  The first model contrast s will be separate  evaluation s of the  
effect of each active group vs. vehicle.  Additional contrast s will be performed  comparing 
pooled active treatment groups vs. vehicle  and comparing the two active treatment 
groups . Contrasts will be made within the ANOVA model using Least Squares  Means and 
the appropriate pooled error term, with n o alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons. An 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline average IGA score as the 
covariate will be used if it yields greater sensitivity than the ANOVA model.  
 
A similar model will be used to analyze mean change  from baseline SSA.  
 
Primary and secondary analyses will also be performed based on IGA and SSA 
evaluations made at rest.  
9.2.4  Safety Analysis  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events. Other 
safety data (e.g., vital signs and special tests) will be summarized as appropriate.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-209 January 1 8, 2019 Page 31 of 42 
 
 Confidential    Adverse events will be coded using a current MedDRA dictionary and summarized by 
[CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects having any 
adverse event, having an adv erse event in each body system (System Organ Class), and 
having each coded individual adverse event. Other adverse event information collected 
(e.g., severity/intensity or relationship to study medication) will be listed as appropriate.  
Data from other tes ts will be listed, notable values will be flagged, and any other 
information collected will be listed as appropriate. No inferential statistical tests are 
planned for safety data but may be performed on an ad -hoc basis to highlight any 
comparisons that may  warrant further consideration.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_208045] ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTATI ON 
Data reflecting subject ex perience with the drug under investigation will be recorded on 
appropriate source documents  and in the eCRF . The investigator understands that the

 Confidential    Investigators and subjects will use the same scale. As a photo guide, the guidance 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_177506] 11” x 17” laminated poster cards.  
 
 
Instructions for use:  
 
 
For Investigators:  
 
• “At Rest”: Ask the subject to make an expressionless face and indicate with a 
check mark the description that best describes his/her appearance.  
• “On Contraction”: Ask the subject to make a maximally exaggerated smile and 
indicate with a check mark the desc ription that best describes his/her 
appearance.  
 
For Subjects:  
 
• Place the subject in front of a mirror or provide a hand -held mirror in a well-lit 
room  
• Provide subject with the photo guide  
• “At Rest”: Ask the subject to make an expressionless face and stat e the grade 
that best describes his/her appearance. Record in the eCRF.  
• “On Contraction”: Ask the subject to make a maximally exaggerated smile and 
using the provided scale state the grade that best describes his/her appearance.

 Confidential    Appendix  B: Signs of Botulinum Toxin Spread  
 
 
 
1. Ask the subject to follow the examiner’s finger with his or her eyes without moving 
his or her head. At eye level, the examiner should move his or her finger to the 
right of the subject’s head and then to the left. Repeat this horizontal motion at the 
level of the subject’s forehead and chin. Note whether there is any abnormality in 
the form of any inability of the subject’s eyes to follow the finger.  
 
2. Ask the subject to raise his/her eyelids. Observe any indication for “droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”.  
 
3. Ask the subject to swallow and note any difficulty doing so.  
 
4. Ask the subject to partially flex his or her arms at the elbow, with fist at shoulder 
level. Ask the subject to attempt to fully f lex his or her arms against the resistance 
of the examiner pulling on the subject’s forearms. Note whether there is an 
abnormality in the form of any muscular weakness.

 Confidential    Appendix  C: Procedure for Color Photography  
 
 
Equipment:  Digital Camera , Log Book ,  Subject -Specific Index Card  
 
Procedure:  In these clinical photographs, for the duration of the study, the only variable 
allowed to change is the skin condition itself. Therefore, anything 
extraneous to the condition (jewelry, makeup, clothing, furniture, walls, etc.) 
is to be eliminated from the fields to be photographed, from baseline through 
the final photographs. The necess ity of good photos should be stressed to 
the subject s to ensure their cooperation. Camera, lighting, framing, and 
exposure must be held consistent.  In the end, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_94141] 
a time -lapse movie.  
 
Ask the subject  to stand against a light back ground, away from any window 
or other source of external light. The subject  should hold a white index card  
with his/her  identification number and initials. The photographer should 
stand about [ADDRESS_208051]  and set the camera for minimum 
zoom  and take 5 photographs : 1 full  frontal face photo,  and one 45 ° view of 
each of the right and left periorbital region, both, “at rest” and “on 
contraction” .  
 
For the “at rest” pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s, ask the subject to have a relaxed, expressionless 
composure . In the frontal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], the subject should hold an index card with 
subject ID , date  and initials . The ID card is not required for the 45 ° views. 
For the “on contraction ” pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], ask the subject to produce a smile that is 
maximally exaggerated by [CONTACT_177522] t o make the biggest smile 
possible.  An attempt should be made to consistently produce the same 
degree of smile in all photograph s. This can be guided by [CONTACT_177523].  
 
Maintain a Log Book that includes the follo wing information:  
• Protocol Number  
• Investigator Name  
• Subject  Initials  
• Subject  ID Number  
• Visit week  
• Date of Visit  
• Photographer’s Initials

 Confidential    Appendix  D: Irritation Scoring  
 
 
For the irritation assessment, the following scale will be utilized : 
 
Numeric Grades:  
0 = no evidence of irritation  
1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
2 = definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular 
response  
3 = erythema and papules  
4 = definite edema  
5 = erythema, edema, and papules  
6 = vesicular eruption  
7 = strong reaction spreading beyond test site  
 
All clinically significant skin responses obs erved with the test products or any score of 3 
or higher will be reported as an adverse event.

 Confidential    Appendix  E: Preparation of Study Drug  
 
Study drug will be provided as a set of dropper bottles. The target strength of study dr ug 
will be prepared by [CONTACT_177524] a randomization list 
provided by [CONTACT_456]. The bottles will be labeled “Active” or “Vehicle” and will be 
prefilled with [ADDRESS_208053].  
 
The procedure to dilute the study medication is as follows:  
 
• open the envelope with the study medication number assigned to the subject and 
follow  the instructions. Depending on treatment group, the instructions will read for:  
 
Vehicle : 
 
1. slowly invert bottle “Vehicle”  10 times to ensure resuspension of its content  
2. mask the bottle label with a secondary numbered  label, and  
3. provide the bottle to the investigator for application  
 
Active : 
 
1. slowly invert bottle “ Vehicle ” 10 times to ensure resuspension of its content  
2. remove screw cap and dropper insert from bottle “ Vehicle ”  
3. remove bottle “ Active ” from its carton. Do NOT  invert the bottle “ Active ”. 
4. remove screw cap and dropper insert from bottle “ Active ”  
5. using an adjustable pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], transfer 0.22 ml (220 µl) from  
bottle “ Vehicle ”   ➔   bottle “Active”  
6. reinsert dropper tip into bottle “Active ” and recap  
7. mask the bottle “Active” with a seco ndary numbered label  
8. slowly invert the masked bottle “Active” 10 times to ensure resuspension of its 
content, and  
9. provide the bottle to the investigator for application

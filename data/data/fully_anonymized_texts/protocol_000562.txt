TITLE:  An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of APX001 in 
Non-Neutropenic Patients w ith Candidemia,  with or w ithout Invasive Candidiasis, Inclusive of 
Patients with Suspected Resistance to Standard of Care Antifungal Treatment  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  APX001 -[ADDRESS_944797]:  APX001  
PHASE:  2 
INDICATION:  Treatment of non -neutropenic patients with candidemia  – inclusive of those 
patients with suspected or confirmed antifungal -resistant candidemia  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective  of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of APX001 for the 
treatment of adult non -neutropenic patients  ≥[ADDRESS_944798] of care (SOC) antifungal treatment.  
The secondar y objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluate the time to first negative blood culture  
• Evaluate the percentage of patients with Mycological Outcomes at  End of Study Drug 
Treatment ( EOST), End of Antifungal Treatment (EOT),  and 2 and 4 weeks after EOT  
• Evaluate the percentage of patients with Treatment Success at EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks after 
EOT  
• Evaluate overall survival at Study Day 30 
• Evaluate safety parameters, including number of patients with treatment- emergent adverse 
events  (TEAEs)  
• Evaluate pharmacokinetic (P K) parameters of APX001  
BACKGROUND:  
Disseminated infections associated with Candida species  (spp.)  are a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality. Candidemia is a common cause of healthcare -associated blood stream 
infections with approximately 50% of isolates identified as non- Candida albicans  for which the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America  (IDSA) revised clinical practice guidance in [ADDRESS_944799]  line empi[INVESTIGATOR_696336] .

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_944800] spectrum activity versus major fungal 
pathogens including Candida spp. and Aspergillus  spp., including isolates with resistance to 
azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes.  APX001A targets the conserved fungal enz yme 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored wall transfer protein 1 (GWT1 ), which is required 
for the expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the fungal cell wall. Inhibition of GWT1 by 
[CONTACT_696350]001A compromises cell wall integrity, inhibits biofilm formation , blocks filamentation, 
enhances immunogenicity of unmasked β-glucan,  and produces severe fungal growth defects . The 
closest ma mmalian ortholog of GWT1 is PIG -W, which ha s no demonstrable  inhibition by 
[CONTACT_696350]001A.  
APX001A has demonstrated broad in vitro antifungal activity against Candida spp.,  including 
activity against azole -resistant and echinocandin -resistant strains. APX001A has demonstrated 
synergy with echinocandins ( Aspergillus ) and azoles ( Candida). In inva sive fungal disease animal 
models, including those for Aspergillus  spp. and Candida spp. that are resistant to azoles, 
APX001A has demonstrated high survival rates and reduced colony counts of fungi in the lungs 
of infected mice . The PK-pharmacodynamic (PD ) driver for efficacy of APX001A was associated 
with area under the concentration -time curve (AUC)/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).  
In 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies of APX001, the safety, tolerability, and PK  of single 
ascending doses and mul tiple ascending doses administered intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) to 
healthy volunteers were studied. A total of 166 healthy volunteers w ere enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled Phase 1 studies of APX001. All APX001 doses studied in Phase 1 were 
consider ed well tolerated. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were  reported, and most of the 
non-SAEs  were mild, transitory , and required no intervention. No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
were observed and no TEAEs or safety laboratory test results met any of the a prior i rules that 
prevented dose escalation to the next protocol -specified cohort. The maximum tolerated dose was 
not determined/reached in either of the Phase 1 studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters for maximum 
serum concentration and AUC in both single a nd multiple APX001 IV and PO doses we re linear 
and dose proportional. In both the in vitro studies and in a cohort embedded within the PO  dose 
Phase 1 study, APX001 demonstrated a favorable drug -drug interaction profile. APX001A was 
shown to be a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, 
CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4; and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The relative 
bioavailability of the PO formulatio n was >90% in healthy subjects. There was no  evidence of an 
effect on the bioavailability of APX001 in the presence of food  (high fat and high calorie).  Most 
importantly, the target AUCs anticipated for efficacy against both yeast and molds have been 
achie ved with both IV and PO dose formulations  tested in Phase [ADDRESS_944801]- in-class  drug candidate with a 
novel mechanism of action , no cross -resistance with other classes of antifungal drugs has been 
observed or is expected.

STUDY DESIGN  AND DURATION:  
This is a multicenter, open -label, non -comparative, single -arm study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of APX001 for the first -line treatment for candidemia , including  suspected or confirmed 
antifungal -resistant candidemia in non -neutropenic patients  ≥18 years of age . Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_696339] -resistant candidemia is sufficient and subsequent documented resistance is not required  
for enrollment. The Study Drug Treatment Period will be up to a maximum of 14 days  (inclusive 
of the loading dose  [Study Day 1] ). After completion of [ADDRESS_944805] 
practice guidelines, fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal 
therapy) may commence  for up to a further 7 days. There will be a Follow -up Period of 4 weeks  
(+4 days)  after EOT. The total duration of participation in the study is up to approximately 
7.5 weeks (inclusive of the Screening Period [ ≤96 hours prior to Baseline ]).  
Patients  with a yeast identified in a blood culture  or a positive rapid diagnostic method are eligible 
to be consented and screened for the study. Patients  must have at least [ADDRESS_944806]  for 
Candida  spp. (or yeast suspected to be Candida ) for a diagnosis of candidemia  to be considered 
for enrollm ent into the study. Patients with a positive blood culture showing yeast suspected to be 
Candida  must have identification of Candida spp. from positive blood culture confirmed prior to 
dosing. Screening and Baseline procedures and the start of APX001 study drug will be initiated  
within [ADDRESS_944807] was drawn.  
Patients  with >2 days  (>48 hours) equivalent of prior systemic antifungal treatment at approved 
doses to treat the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_696340] [ADDRESS_944808]  received ≤5 days  (≤120 hours) equivalent of that prior treatment (results 
of susceptibility testing are required pr ior to enrollment).  
All patients  (or the patient ’s LAR) will sign an ICF before any protocol specified procedures that 
are not indicated by [CONTACT_696351]. Inclusion/exclusion criteria assessments, medical 
history, demographics, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score will be 
collected before dosing.  
On Study Day 1 (or over the first 24 hours if started in the evening ), a 1000 mg APX001 loading 
dose will be administered over 3 hours by [CONTACT_696352] (BID) . On Study Days 2 and 3 
of study drug, a 600 mg APX001 maintenance dose will be administered over 3 hours by [CONTACT_696353] ( QD). On Study Day [ADDRESS_944809], the APX001 maintenance dose will be

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_944810]. Study drug will be adminis tered for a maximum of 14 days . At the 
Investigator’s discretion , patients  requiring a longer duration of antifungal therapy will be 
switched to fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy), to 
adhere to the IDSA c linical practice guideline s for the treatment of Candidiasis .  
Candida  spp. blo odstream infection will be monitored by [CONTACT_696354] [ADDRESS_944811] ed for 
Candida  testing by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) assay at Baseline, during Study Drug 
Treatment, and EOST, or Early Termination. Other cultures, histopathology, and imaging tests to 
assess the site(s) and extent of  candidemia  infection  at other sites  will be conducted as clinically 
indicated, and the results should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form. The management 
of intravascular catheters , intravascular devices,  and, if applicable, any drains will be recorded, 
including any associated m icrobiology results.  
Patients  will be monitored for safety throughout the duration of the study. Safety assessments will 
include vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, 
and urinalysis), physical examinations  (including neurological assessment) , prior and concomitant 
medication reporting, and adverse event reporting. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be 
performed at Baseline (pre -dose), EOST, EOT, and [ADDRESS_944812] (for  females 
of childbearing potential only) will be performed at Screening and Baseline (pre -dose), every 
[ADDRESS_944813], EOT, and 2  and 4 weeks after  
EOT, or Early Termination.  
Plasma samples for PK (APX001 [prodrug] and APX001A [active moiety]) will be collected at 
Baseline  (pre-dose) , twice  weekly during S tudy Drug Treatment , EOST, EOT , 2 weeks  after EOT , 
or Early Termination . Serum samples for (1,3) -β-D-glucan levels will be c ollected at Baseline 
(pre-dose)  and EOST,  or Early Termination  (if applicable).  
Optionally, if body fluids are sampled as par t of routine patient management  (e.g., bronchoalveolar

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 9 CRITERIA FOR SWITCHING FROM I NTRAVENOUS  TO ORAL DOSE:  
Patients  who have completed a minimum of [ADDRESS_944816]  meet all of the following criteria  to 
switch from  IV to PO  dosing of  APX001:  
• Is clinically stable,  as determined by [CONTACT_737]  
• Is able to swallow tablets  
• Is demonstrated to have no further growth  of the infecting organism for [ADDRESS_944817] recent blood culture  
RATIONALE FOR DOSE AND SCHEDULE SELECTION:  
Dose  
In PK -PD studies, immunocompromised mice were infected with 1 of 3 spp. of Candida  
(C. albicans , C. glabrata, or C. auris ) and groups of animals were dosed with APX001 at different 
dose fractionations. The AUC/MIC ratio was determined to be the PK -PD variable that best 
correlated with antifungal efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_696355] (colony -forming units [CFUs]) 
in the kidne y. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated separately for each 
Candida  spp. tested. The PTA calculation used the APX001A free drug AUC level at the stasis 
endpoint divided by [CONTACT_696356] 90% of organisms (MIC 90) of each 
of the Candida spp. tested. 
The AUC level was estimated from a population PK model derived primarily from the Phase [ADDRESS_944818] prior to 
APX001 administration compared to CFUs at the endpoint of assessment ( i.e., 24 hours for 
C. albicans ; 96 hours for C. glabrata  and C. auris ). The MIC data for the Candida strains tested 
were obtained from recent surveillance data.  
Using the AUC at the stasis endpoint, along with the MIC 90 from the surveillance data and the 
predicted exposure at the dose regimen to  be used in this study, the PTA  for the 3 Candida spp. 
tested was s hown to be approximately 100%. Further, sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the PTA under diffe rent scenarios including increased variability of PK parameters and 
higher Candida spp. MIC 90 values. For both scenarios the PTA remained >90%. This is reassuring , 
as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696341] a higher clearance of antifungal  drugs 
and/or a patient may be infected with a Candida spp. with a particularly high MIC above the 
MIC 90.  
In [ADDRESS_944819] -in-human Phase 1 clini cal study, a loading dose of 
APX001 1000 mg IV 2 -hour infusion BID on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of APX001 
600 mg IV 1 -hour infusion QD on Days 2 through 7, was safe and well tolerated. This IV dose 
regimen is identical to the IV dose regimen th at will be used in this study. In the second Phase 1 
clinical study, a dose of APX001 1000 mg administered PO QD on Days 1 through 14 was safe 
and well tolerated. This PO-dose regimen is higher than the 700 mg PO  dose that will be used in 
this study.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 10 Sched ule 
To ensure the safety and tolerability of APX001 dosing for 14 days, this study will use an APX001 
dose and infusion duration already studied in Phase 1 for 14 days of therapy inclusive of IV and 
PO investigational drug therapy. The loading dose 1000 mg IV BID over a 3 -hour infusion 
followed by 600  mg IV QD over a 3 -hour infusion will optimize patient safety and tolerability on 
study. At Study Day 4, provid ed a patient meets the protocol -defined criteria for a  PO switch, then 
the switch will occur to PO APX001 dose at 700 mg QD for no more than 14 days of combined 
IV and PO APX001 therapy.  
Step-Down T herapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of C andidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14  days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the duration of antifungal treatment required to treat patients 
with candide mia in this study will be driven by [CONTACT_696357]. In 
3 randomized controlled trials in candidemia and invasive C andidiasis , the median time to 
bloodstream infection clearance after receiving appropriate antifungal therapy was 2 to 3 days. 
Therefore, patients enrolled in this study may need a few additional days of fluconazole therapy 
(unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) for a total duration of 
antifungal treatment of approximately [ADDRESS_944820] ions diagnosed after enrollment , while they can continue to receive APX001 study 
drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal d rug therapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results 
warrant alternative antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond [ADDRESS_944821] day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.

the field of fungal infectious diseases will constitute a DRC. The DRC serves to provide 
independent oversight to confirm eligibility for efficacy analysis, to confirm the diagnosis of 
candidemia at study entry, and to adjudicate efficacy outcome . The DRC assessments for each 
patient  will be recorded in the database and used in the primary efficacy analysis of the study . The 
DRC members will not be Principal Investigators in the study . Guidelines for the DRC are 
described in the DRC Charter.  
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD:  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of members with pertinent expertise 
will review the accumulating data from the study periodically as set forth in the DSMB Charter, 
or more frequent ly at the request of the DSMB. The DSMB will advise the Sponsor on the 
continuing safety of the study patient s and those yet to be recruited to the study, as well as the 
continuing validity and scientific merit of the study. At any time, the independent DSMB may 
temporarily suspend enrollment until any significant safety concerns are resolved or terminate the 
study to ensure patient  safety , if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_141211] , further dosing would pose  an 
inappropriate safety risk. Guidelines for what constitutes inappropriate safety risks are described 
in the DSMB C harter . 
ANA LYSIS POPULATIONS:  
Intent -to-Treat Population/Safety Population  
The Intent -to-Treat Population /Safety Population will include all patients  who have received at 
least 1 dose of APX001 .  
Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (MITT) Population will include all patients  who satisfy the 
following criteria:  
• Received at least 1 dose of study drug 
• Have a confirmed diagnosi s of candidemia within 96 hou rs of the start of treatment with 
APX001  
Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol Population will include all patients  who satisfy the following criteria: 
• Received at least 1 dose of study drug 
• Have a confirmed diagnosis of candidemia within 96 hours of the start of treatment with 
APX001  
• Did not exceed prior antifungal treatment (per eligibility)  
• Meet the protocol’s key inclusion and e xclusion criteria

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 14 STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary population for efficacy analysis will be the MITT Population.  
The efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively. The percentage of patients  with 
Treatment Success  at EOST  will be summarized. The same summary will be repeated for the 
Per-Protocol Population.  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, t he percentage o f patients  with Treatment Success at EOT, 
and [ADDRESS_944824] negative blood culture 
will also be provided . 
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety  Population. Safety data will be patient  to 
clinical review and summarized by [CONTACT_696359]. A DSMB will be assigned to 
monitor safety on an ongoing basis throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentration data will be performed using validated software 
in order to derive the population mean (an d variance) values of specific PK parameters.  
Plasma concentrations will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_696360]. Summary statistics in the tabulation will include n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using population 
PK analysis methods, which will be described in a separate data analysis plan. Results of the PK 
analysis will be reported separately.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
A sample size of approximately 20 patients  will be recruited in this open -label study.  No formal 
statistical assessment for sample size determination has been performed. This sample size is 
considered adequate to provide the necessary data t o evaluate the efficacy and safety of APX001 .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 24 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Disseminated infections associated with Candida species  (spp.)  are a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality. Candidemia is a common cause of healthcare -associated blood stream 
infections with approximately 50% of isolates identified as non -C. albicans  for which the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  revised clinical practice guidance in [ADDRESS_944834] spectrum activity ve rsus major fungal 
pathogens including Candida spp. and Aspergillus  spp., including isolates with resistance to 
azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes.3,4,5 APX001A targets the conserved fungal enzyme  
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored wall transfer protein 1  (GWT1 ), which is required 
for the expression of GPI -anchored proteins on the fungal cell wall. Inhibition of GWT1 by 
[CONTACT_696350]001A compromises cell wall integrity, inhibits biofilm formation,  blocks filamentation, 
enhances immunogenicity of unmasked β -glucan,  and produces severe fungal growth defects .6,[ADDRESS_944835] azole- resistant and echinocandin -resistant strains. APX001A has demonstrated 
synergy with echinocandins ( Aspergillus )8,9 and azoles ( Candida). In invasive fungal disease  
(IFD) animal model s, including those for Aspergillus  spp. and Candida spp. that are resistant to 
azoles, APX001A has demonstrated high survival rates and reduced colony counts of fungi in the lungs of infected mice .
8,9 The pharmacokinetic (PK) -pharmacodynamic (PD) driver for efficacy 
of APX001A was associated with area under the concentration -time curve (AUC)/minimal 
inhibitory concentration (MIC).  
In 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies of APX001, the safety, tolerability, and PK of single 
ascending doses and multiple ascending doses administered intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) to healthy volunteers we re studie d. A total of 166 healthy volunteers w ere enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled Phase 1 studies of APX001. All APX001 doses studied in Phase 1 were 
considered well tolerated. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were  reported, and most of  the 
non-SAE s were mild , transitory , and required no intervention. No dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs)  
were observed and no treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs)  or safety laboratory test results 
met any of the a prior i rules that prevented dose escalation to the next protocol -specified cohort. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined/reached in either of the Phase 1 studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters for maximum serum concentration  (C
max) and AUC in both single 
and multiple APX001 IV and PO doses we re linear and dose proportional. In both the in vitro 
studies and in a cohort embedded within the PO dose Phase 1 study, APX001 demonstrated a 
favorable drug- drug interaction (DDI)  profile. APX001A was shown to be a weak inducer of 
cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4; and a 
weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The relative bioavailability of the PO  formulation is 
>90% in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of an effect on the bioavailability of APX001 in

efficacy against both yeast and molds have been achieved with both IV and PO dose formulations  
tested in Phase [ADDRESS_944836] -in-class drug candidate with a novel 
mechanism of action , no cross -resistance with other classes of antifungal drugs has been observed 
or is expected. 
1.1 Rationale  
The need for improved treatment of IFDs remains high, particularly with the growing number of 
immunocom promised patients , such as hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], who are at particular risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_696344]. Species of Candida and Aspergillus  are well recognized as the 2  major causes of fungal 
diseases in these  patients , although other emerging fungi, such as non- C. albicans  (e.g., 
C. glabrata  and C. auris ), Fusarium  spp., Scedosporium  spp., and Mucorales fungi, are 
contributing to the need to find new and better strategies for  managing these infections. Existing 
antifungal agents can be difficult to use, are often poorly tolerated, or have become increasingly ineffective due to the rise of drug resistant fungal strains . 
1.2 Risk/Benefit  
The safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple  doses of APX001 administered by [CONTACT_696361] [ADDRESS_944837] -in-human  (FIH) Phase 1, randomized, placebo- controlled study to 
investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple doses of APX001 administered by [CONTACT_696362]. A final Clinical Study Report has been issued for this study . 
No severe o r SAEs have been reported and most of the adverse events were mild, transitory, and 
resolved with no intervention. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory safety tests. The AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC
inf) and C max were linear and dose 
proportional.  
All doses of APX001 were safe and well tolerated , and the majority of TEAEs  were  mild, 
transitory, and resolved without intervention. Single IV doses of APX001 up to 350 mg over a 
3-hour infusion and single IV doses of 1000 mg over 0.5- , 1-, 2-, and 3- hour infusion s were well 
tolerated . Shorter infusion periods ( i.e., 1000 mg over 0.5 to 2 hours) appeared to have s imilar 
toleration compared to 3 -hour infusion periods. Multiple IV doses of APX001 up to 600 mg once 
daily  (QD), for 14 consecutive days , were well tolerated by [CONTACT_665534]; however, the 
total number of TEAEs related to g astrointestinal (GI) and nervous system disorders increased 
when the dose was increased from 300 mg to 600 mg. A loading dose of 1000 mg a dministered 
twice  daily (BID) on Day [ADDRESS_944838] of food on APX001, and the DDI potential of APX001.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_944839] of food on the PK of APX001A exposures 
(single dose of 400 mg). In cohort 3 (1000 mg, QD for 14 days), there was an increase in the 
number of subjects reporting adverse events; however, the intensity of reported events did not 
increase with multiple doses.  
All doses of APX0 01 were safe and well tolerated , and the majority of TEAEs were mild, 
transitory, and resolved without intervention. The single IV doses of 200 mg APX001 and single 
PO doses in the dose range of 100 mg to 500 mg were well tolerated. Multiple PO doses of 500 mg 
and 1000 mg of APX001 administered QD for 14 consecutive days were well tolerated by [CONTACT_696363]; however, the number of moderate TEAEs, primarily those related to GI 
disorders, increased when the PO dose of APX001 increased from 500 mg t o 1000 mg. Dosing 
under fed conditions improved tolerability by [CONTACT_696364] (nausea, vomiting) 
and nervous system disorders (headache, fatigue).  
There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the study nor were there any withdrawals due t o 
adverse events. There were no clinically significant findings with respect to laboratory  safety tests, 
vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, or weight. No DLTs were observed. 
No TEAEs or laboratory safety tests met any of the criter ia to prevent dose escalation. The MTD 
was not reached in this study.

therapeutic effectiveness. Since the efficacy of APX001 has not yet been proven in patients , no 
additional protection of APX001 in this c oncentration can be assured. Patients  participating in this 
clinical study  will receive more intense health  monitoring as detailed in the schedule of procedures .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 34 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment G roups  
All patients  will be administered a 1000 mg APX001 loading dose BID followed by a 600 mg 
APX001 maintenance dose QD on  Study Day 2 and Study Day 3. From  Study Day 4 onwards , the 
APX001 maintenance dose will be administered as either 600  mg APX001 IV infusion over 
3 hours QD or may be switched to 700 mg PO QD  when/if the criteria for PO  dosing are met 
(Section 5.5.3) . 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
5.2.1 Dose 
In PK -PD studies, immunocompromised mice were infected with 1 of 3 spp. of Candida 
(C. albicans , C. glabrata , or C. auris ) and groups of animals were dosed with APX001 at different 
dose fractionations. The AUC/MIC ratio was determined to be the PK -PD variable that best 
correlated with antifungal efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_696355] (colony- forming units [CFUs]) in 
the kidney. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was c alculat ed separately for each 
Candida spp. tested. The PTA calculation used the APX001A free drug AUC level at the stasis 
endpoint divided by [CONTACT_696356] 90% of organisms (MIC 90) of each 
of the Candida spp. tested. 
The AUC level was estimated from a population PK model derived primarily from the Phase 1 PK 
data.  
In 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, APX001 IV and PO formulations were safe and well 
tolerated. The majority of the TEAEs were mild, transitory, a nd resolved without intervention. No 
DLTs  were observed. Specifically, in the FIH  Phase 1 clinical study, a loading dose of APX001 
1000 mg IV 2- hour infusion BID on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of APX001 600 mg 
IV 1-hour infusion QD on Days 2 through 7, was safe and well tolerated. This IV dose regimen is 
identical to the IV dose regimen that will be used in this study. In the second Phase 1 clinical study, a dose of APX001 1000 mg administered PO  QD on Days 1 through 14 was safe and well tolerated. 
This PO -dose regimen is higher than the 700 mg PO dose that will be used in this study . 
5.2.2 Schedule  
To ensure the safety and tolerability of APX001 dosing for 14 days, this study will use an APX001 
dose and infusion duration already studied in Phase 1 for 14 days of therapy inclusive of IV and 
PO investigational drug therapy. The loading dose 1000 mg IV BID over a 3 -hour infusion 
followed by 600 mg IV QD over a 3 -hour infusion will optimize patient safety and tolerability on 
study. At Study Day 4, provided  a patient meets the protocol -defined criteria for a  PO switch, then 
the switch will occur to PO  APX001 dose at 700 mg QD for no more than 14 days of combined 
IV and PO  APX001 therapy.  
5.2.3 Step-Down T herapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment o f Candidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14 days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the duration of antifungal treatment required to treat patients

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 35 with candidemia in this study will be driven by [CONTACT_696366]. In  
3 randomized controlled trials in candidemia and invasive Candidiasis , the median time to 
bloodstream infection clearance after receiving appropriate antifungal therapy was 2 to 3 days. 
Therefore, patients enrolled in this study may need a few additional days of fluconazole therapy (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) for a total duration of antifungal treatment of approximately [ADDRESS_944856] deep- seated 
sites of infections diagnosed after enrollment, while they can continue to receive APX001 study drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal drug therapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alterna tive antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond [ADDRESS_944857] day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.

5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures  
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] APX001A as a victim substrate for cytochrome P450 drug- drug interact ions 
APX001A is metabolized by [CONTACT_696372]001A. 
Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol APX001 -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 37 However, patients who are receiving or will receive strong inducers of multiple CYP enzymes 
(e.g., rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, rifabutin, efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
modafinil, nafcillin, St. John's Wort, and enzalutamide ) are excluded from participating in the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] APX001A as a perpetrator of cytochrome P450 drug -drug interactions  
APX001A was shown to be a weak inducer of CYP2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4; and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The potential clinical 
significance of any APX001A DDI  will depend on the extent of induction or inhibition and 
therapeutic margin of the specific victim substrate or substrates.  
Considering the magnitude of CYP inhibition/induction effects of APX001A , a review of drugs 
commonly used as part of the SOC for patients with candidemia indicates that clinically significant 
DDIs are unlikely to occur. Nonetheless, co -administration of drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_696373] (where applicable) considered, especially for CYP substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.  
5.6.2 Prohibited Medications and/or Procedures  
Eligible patients  are prohibited from receiving >2 days ( >48 hours)  equivalent of antifungal 
treatment in the 96 hours prio r to starting study treatment. The exception to this rule applies only 
to patients  whose candidemia is caused by [CONTACT_27383]. with laboratory -confirmed resistance to  
the specific antifungal administered , for whom ≤5 days (≤120 hours)  equivalent of prior antifungal 
treatment is permitted. Once on study, patients  may not re ceive concomitant systemic anti fungal 
therapy for the treatment of candidemia  while they are receiving A PX001 .  
Patients  cannot have received  any investigational drug within 30 days prior to dosing.  
5.6.3 Step-down Antifungal Therapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of C andidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14 days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the durati on of antifungal treatment required to treat patients 
with candidemia in this study will be driven by [CONTACT_696366]. In 
[ADDRESS_944860] deep- seated sites of infections diagnosed after enrollment, while they can continue to 
receive APX001 study drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal drug t herapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results 
warrant alternative antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond [ADDRESS_944861] day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.

(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. All adverse events, including observed 
or volunteered problems, complai nts, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent until study participation is complete. Patients should be ins tructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Beginning

Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific  disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at S creening should not be reported as an adverse event 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at Baseline change in severity or seriousness at any time duri ng the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at S creening and significantly worsen during the s tudy 
should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse eve nt. A laboratory finding that is abnormal but not clinically significant 
(e.g., does not warrant intervention) is not considered an adverse event.  
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a study drug related to any dose should be co nsidered an 
adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a study drug means that a causal relationship between a

Assessment of Severity : 
The severity of all adverse events should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts (CTCAE) v4.03. These criteria can be found at 
http://ctep. cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. For those adverse events not listed in the CTCAE, the 
following grading system should be used:  
• Mild (CTCAE Grade 1):  Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but easily tolerated and no interference with patient ’s daily activities  
• Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2):  Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with patient ’s usual 
activities, but still acceptable  
• Severe (CTCAE Grade 3):  Incapacitating signs/symptoms which cause considerable 
interference with the patient ’s daily activities, unaccept able 
• Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4):  Life -threate ning or disabling adverse event  
• Death (CTCAE Grade 5):   Death -related adverse event

Causality Assessmen t: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence  or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 51 The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any oth er disease the patient may have  
• Concomitant drug-  
o The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
questi on 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug-  
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response  is likely to be a 
class effect  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug-  
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered 
8.2 Serio us Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
o An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form , might have caused 
death  
• Requires hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]

• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event  
o Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or t he

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 57 9.2.2 Analysis of Safety  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. Safety data will be patient to 
clinical review and summarized by [CONTACT_208257]. A DSMB will be assigned to 
monitor safety on an ongoing basis throughout the study.  
Analyses will be based on adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and ECGs. Safety analyses will be descriptive and will be presented in tabular format with the appropriate summary statistics.  
A TEAE is defined as an adverse event  started on or after the administration of study drug. The 
number and percentage of patients  with TEAEs will be tabulated by s ystem organ class, preferred 
term, and by [CONTACT_22056]. Serious adverse events and adverse events 
leading to discontinuation from study drug will be summarized. Listings will also be provided for SAEs and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory data for both actual values and 
changes from B aseline over time.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for vital sign data presented as both actual values and 
changes from B aseline over time.  
Abnormal physical e xamination findings will be listed.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for ECG interval data and presented as both actual values and changes from B aseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentration data will be performed using validated software 
in order to derive the population mean (and variance) values of specific PK parameters.  
Plasma concentrations will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_685311]. Summary statistics in the tabulation  will include n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, 
median, minimum,  and maximum. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using population 
PK analysis methods, which will be described in a separate data analysis plan. Results of the PK analysis will be reported separately . 
9.2.3 Interim  Analysis  
No int erim analysis is planned  for the study.  
9.2.4 Independent Data Review Committee  
To ensure standardization of interpretation regarding the validity of study patients , the medical 
management , and response to treatment in this open -label study, a panel of recognized experts in 
the field of fungal infectious diseases will constitute a DRC. The DRC serves to provide 
independent oversight to confirm eligibility for efficacy analysis, to confirm the diagnosis of candidemia at study entry, and to adjudicate efficacy outcome . The DRC assessments for each 
patient  will be recorded in the database and used in the primary efficacy analysis of the study . The 
DRC members will not be Principal Investigators in the study.  Guidelines for the DRC are 
described in the DRC Charter.

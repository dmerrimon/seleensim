STUDY PROTOCOL INCLUDING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
OFFICIAL TITLE:  Modeling Stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_307716]:  Stress and smoking behavior  (Sherry McKee, PhD, PI)  
 CLINICALTRIALS.GOV ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
PROTOCOL DATE: J anuary [ADDRESS_376608] of guanfacine on smoking behavior . 
Using a double -blind, placebo -controlled, we randomized a dults with nicotine dependence  to 
guanfacine (3mg/day or placebo) to evaluate wh ether guanfacine increases the ability to resist smoking . 
Following titration to steady state medication levels over a [ADDRESS_376609] s completed  two 
laboratory sessions to evaluate drinking smoking behavior.  
 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
This study was a double -blind, placebo controlled, parallel- group design, to compare immediate release 
guanfacine (3.0mg/day) to placebo (0mg/day) in adults meeting criteria for nicotine dependence . This 
study consist ed of an intake session, a physical exam, and two lab oratory sessions following titration to 
steady state levels. Ability to resist smoking was modelled as the delay to start smoking in exchange for 
monetary reinforcement. Primary outcome measure time to delay smoking .

STATISTICIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: During the laboratory session , 3mg/d ay guanfacine vs placebo will increase the 
time to resist smoking . Anova of medication condition  was used to evaluate time to delay smoking .

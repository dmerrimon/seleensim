 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  An Investigator -Masked, Randomized, Parallel -Group Study of the Ocular 
Tolerability of Voclosporin Ophthalmic Solution versus Restasis® in Subjects with 
Dry Eye Disease  
Study  Product:  Voclosporin ophthalmic solution (VOS)  
Indication:  Dry Eye Disease (DED)  
Phase:  2 
Sponsor:  Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Study Code:  AUR -VOS-2017 -01 
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
 To assess the ocular tolerability of VOS compared to cyclosporine ophthalmic 
emulsion (Restasis®) in subjects with DED.   
Secondary Objective  
 To assess the safety and efficacy of VOS in subjects with DED.  
Design:  This is a Phase 2, multi -center, Investigator -masked, randomized, parallel -group 
study to evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and safety of VOS versus Restasis® over 
a 28-day treatment period in subjects with mild to moderate DED. Approximately 
60 subjects will be randomized to either VOS or Restasis® at approximately 5 
centers located in the US.   
Treatment:  Investigational product  (IP): 0.2% VOS, twice daily (BID), both eyes  (OU)  for 28 
days. 
Comparator: 0.05% cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) BID, OU for 28 
days.

Primary 
Endpoint:  Change from baseline in Drop  Discomfort VAS  score [ADDRESS_1165690] Dose 1 
instillation .  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Key Secondary Endpoints : 
• Change from baseline in Drop Discomfort  VAS  score   
• Change from baseline in each of the 6 Individual Symptom Severity 
Assessments (VAS)  score s 
• Change  from baseline in the sum of the Individual Symptom Severity 
Assessments score (VAS  Total Symptom Summary Score )  
• Change from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Ey e (SANDE ) 
score  
• Change from baseline in unanesthetized STT score   
• Change  from baseline in Fluorescein Corneal Staining (FCS) total 
score ( National Eye Institute (NEI)/Industry Workshop 0- 15 scale)   
Safety Endpoints : 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Change from screening in BCVA   
• Changes from baseline in Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy  
• Changes from screening in Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
Procedures:  At Visit 1 ( screening) informed consent will be obtained from subjects and 
eligibility will be determined . A Schirmer Tear Test (STT) will be performed at 
this visit. The score will be used as the baseline and eligibility. During this visit, 
all subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus® , in both 
eyes to assess ability to self -admini ster study product.  At Visit 2 (Randomization) 
continued eligibility will be confirmed. During this visit, all subjects will self -
administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus® , in both eyes to evaluate ability 
to tolerate ocular drops . Individuals who are unable to successfully instill the drops 
or who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable, based on a post -instillation 
Drop Discomfort  VAS  score , will not be eligible for participation in the study. 
(Note:  For subjects meeting the Screening and Rand omization Criteria, the Visit 2 
Drop Discomfort  VAS score will be used as the baseline value.)

 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment 
groups: VOS BID or Restasis® BID. The first instillation of IP will be 
administered, at least 2 -hours following administration of Refresh Plus® and by 
[CONTACT_838903] (OU) during Visit 2. I nvestigational Product  will be 
administered to the subject by a n unmasked dedicated dosing coordinator (the  
subject and the  Investigator will be masked to study treatment  for the first post 
randomization instillation ). Tolerability, safety and efficacy assessments will be 
performed at this visit.  
At Treatment Visits 3 and 4, tolerability , safety  and efficacy evaluations will be 
performed. At the End of Treatment, Visit 5 , tolerability, safety and efficacy 
evaluations will be performed. Subjects who discontinue before Visit 5 will 
undergo all Visit 5 evaluations (Early Termination). IP will be administered to the 
subject by a dedi cated dosing coordinator  at the clinic visits . A Drop Discomfort  
VAS will be administered in the clinic at 1 and 5 minutes following instillation of 
IP at Visits 2 through 5  (Investigator is to remain masked) . With the exception of 
clinic day visits, subje cts will self -administer IP twice a day OU over the [ADDRESS_1165691] by [CONTACT_838904] ([ADDRESS_1165692] -instillation).   
At Visit 6, there will be a [ADDRESS_1165693] -treatment Follow -Up, in which safety 
assessments are performed and all remaining study materials are collected. The subjects will be instructed to continue to withhold all other concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_838887] 
(through Visit 6).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) ongoing as of Visit [ADDRESS_1165694] resolved, stabilized in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], or returned to baseline.  
This study will be conducted per the schedule shown in the Schedule of Events  
(Table 1 ) and the Study Schematic ( Figure 1). 
Sample Size:  The study will include 60 male or female subjects.  
• The primary analysis will assess the difference in change from baseline 
in Drop Discomfort  VAS  scores 1-minute post -Dose 1 instillation  
between the two treatment groups . 
• A sample size of 26 subjects per group (52 in total) will provide at least 
90% power assuming:  
o a mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of 
+30 mm for subjects randomized to Restasis® 
o a mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of 
+[ADDRESS_1165695] deviation of 21 
o a 2-sided alpha of 5%  
• Under the same assumptions, the study will have at least 80% power if the common standard deviation for the discomfort score were to be 25 . 
• The study also provides 80% power should the treatment difference in 
discomfort scores be 16 (common standard deviation =20) . 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 10 of 95 
 • To allow for 15% dropouts, a total of 60 subjects will be randomized . 
Statistical 
Methods:  The primary endpoint is measured on a VAS and will be summarized and analysed  
as continuous data. Summaries of VAS scores (absolute and change from baseline) 
by [CONTACT_838905] (minutes 1, 5 and 
overall mean) at each visit. Should the data meet the necessary assumptions 
(normality a nd equal variance in both treatment groups) then the treatment groups 
will be compared using a t -test. If assumptions are violated , the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test will be used.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options  
Dry Eye Disease (DED), also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is a common clinical 
problem as over 7 million people in the U nited S tates experience dry eye symptoms.  
Symptoms of DED include a sensation of dry eyes, foreign body sensation, irritation, burning, 
tearing, ocular pain, and itching , among others.  DED affects quality of life and work 
productivity, and patients with moderate to severe DED may experience reduced visual 
function in addition to ocular dysfunction.  
DED is  a multi- factorial disease, defined  by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and 
accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and hyper -osmolarity, ocular 
surface inflammation and damage , and neuro- sensory abnormalities play etiological roles  [1].  
DED patients are classified by [CONTACT_719899][INVESTIGATOR_838888].  Evaporative dry eye tends to be more prevalent than aqueous deficient ; however, as 
the disease progres ses, both components become apparent [1].  The common pathway for both 
groups is that desiccating stress leads to ocular surface inflammation [7,10,12]   
1.1.1 Limitations of Current Treatment 
Current therapy includes a stepped approach which starts with over the counter  (OTC)  
lubricants and artificial tear replacements, and then expands to include topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -
inflammatory therapy and punctal occlusion [1]. There are currently two FDA -approved 
prescription medication s used for DED, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8579] ( Restasis®) and lifitigrast 
(Xiidra®).  A significant number of patients using Restasis® experience the following 
problems: ocular irritation upon instillation, slow onset of response, and limited efficacy  
(Restasis® Package Insert , see Appendix 8) .  Problems with Xiidra® include instillation 
irritation, dysgeusia  and reduced visual acuity which occurred in 5-25% of subjects in clinical 
trials ( Xiidra® Package Insert ). There is a clear unmet clinical need for improved therapeutic 
options for patients with moderate to severe DED. 
1.2 Rationale for the Use of Calcineurin  Inhibitors in Dry Eye Disease  
In patients with DE D, tear production has been shown to be increased with the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_789142], including cyclosporine. It is believed T -lymphocyte infiltration and 
activation in the lacrimal gland represents an underlying pathogenesis for DED. Calcineurin 
inhibitors (CNI s) reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 23 of 95 
 
 
 T-lymphocytes, in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cy cle and also reversibly inhibit the 
production and release of lymphokines  [9].  Calcineurin is a calcium - and 
calmodulin -dependent serine -threonine phosphatase. CNIs inhibit the ability of calcineurin to 
dephosphorylate the nuclear factor of activated T -cells (NFAT), which is required for 
translocation of NFAT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby [CONTACT_789165] T -cell 
activation (e.g., interleukin -2, interleukin- 4, tumor necrosis factor -α, granulocyte-macrophage 
colony stimulating factor, and interferon-γ,[ 11,13]) . 
Voclosporin is a next generation CNI that is currently being evaluated for a variety of systemic 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_608919]. Voclosporin is structurally similar to  cyclosporine A  (CsA), except for 
a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid- [ADDRESS_1165708] from amino acid- 1 which is the major site of 
metabolism for CsA. The altered metabolic profile has led to a faster elimination of metabolites resulting in lower metabolite exposure as compared to CsA. The combination of increased 
potency and decreased metabolite exposure, for voclosporin as compared to CsA, has led to 
better pharma cokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) predictability.  
1.2.1 Non-Clinical Studies of Voclosporin in Dry Eye 
Two Good Laboratory Practice  toxicology studies [3,4]  have been conducted to evaluate the 
safety of voclosporin ophthalmic solution (VOS ) in the eye of the New Zealand White (NZW) 
rabbit and the Beagle dog with dosing for [ADDRESS_1165709] animals were euthanized on Day 15, 
and recovery animals were sacrificed on Day 29. Animals received two, four, or eight bilateral 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_789143] 0.2% VOS within 8 hours daily, corresponding to doses of 
approximately 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 mg/eye/day, respectively. Control animals received 8 doses 
of the vehicle within 8 hours daily. Safety was evaluated using macroscopic and mi croscopic 
ophthalmologic evaluation, tonometry, electroretinography (ERG) evaluation, gross and microscopic pathology of the eyes (including optic nerve), submandibular lymph nodes, spleen 
and thymus, and hematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation parameters. Blood voclosporin 
concentrations were obtained on Day [ADDRESS_1165710] VOS instillation.  
In the NZW rabbit study, no VOS ocular treatment -related changes in serum chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, gross pathology or organ weights were found at the completion of the dosing period or following a 14- day recovery (without treatment). Similarly, no 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-[ADDRESS_1165711] battery of bilateral full -field flash ERGs was performed; sporadic 
statistically significant differences were seen , but as these were all limited to one eye, were not 
dose- dependent, and were not supported by [CONTACT_789166] 
(for example, a change in a- wave implicit time was not accompanied by a change in a -wave 
amplitude), they were judged to have no significance. The ocular no observed adverse 
effect -level (NOAEL) for VOS in NZW rabbit s was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There 
was some accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough levels on Day 13 of 0.028, 0.154, and 0.325 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, 
respectively. The mean maxi mum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose 
group) was 2.29 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In the Beagle dog study, similar results were reported for all safety parameters. The ocular 
NOAEL for VOS in Beagle dogs was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There was some 
accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough levels on Day 13 of 0.017, 0.173, and 0.297 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. 
The mean maximum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose group) was 
1.178 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In an additional  13-week NZW rabbit study [5], no mortality, systemic toxicity or effects on 
specific ocular indices were observed following daily bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_838889] (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily (hourly intervals; 
~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4-week recovery period. The NOAEL for 
repeat topi[INVESTIGATOR_838890] (0.2% voclosporin) to male and female NZW rabbits for 13 weeks is >0.56 mg/eye/day.  
In summary, the two repeated -dose ocular toxicology studies  [3,4]  demonstrated that there 
were no specific ocular indices or histopathology, and no systemic toxicity observed in either 
dogs or rabbits with 14 days of dosing. In addition, there was no mortality, systemic toxicit y 
or effects on specific ocular indices observed following daily bilateral topi[INVESTIGATOR_789146] (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily 
(hourly intervals; ~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4-week recovery period, in 
the S08711 study.

 In addition to the three repeated dose toxicology studies, the safety and efficacy of VOS 0.2% 
has been evaluated in dogs with naturally occurring KCS [6] , diagnosed by [CONTACT_838908] r Tear 
Test (STT) of >1 mm/min and <8 mm/min in one or both eyes  (OU) . Thirty -five dogs 
≥6 months old were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either VOS (n=25) or 
Optimmune Ophthalmic Ointment (n=10) for 28 days twice daily ( BID). Results showed t hat 
treatment with VOS resulted in a statistically significant within group increase in mean STT 
from baseline of 4.6 mm/min to each post -treatment visit. Qualitatively, this increase in 
magnitude was higher than seen in the concurrent Optimmune control group. For the Optimmune group, the change from baseline to Visit 2, 3 and 4, respectively was not 
statistically significant, whereas for the VOS treated group, each change from baseline was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001), demonstrating that VOS was both safe and effective in 
treating KCS in dogs. 
In order to determine potential melanin binding of 
14C-LX214, ocular tissue 
14C-LX214-derived radioactivity concentrations were compared between data obtained from 
albino NZW rabbits given a single bilateral instillation in a separate study and similarly treated 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_789147]- Belted rabbits . Ocular pi[INVESTIGATOR_789148]- Belted rabbits are widely spread 
in multiple structures including iris (stroma and epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), ciliary body (stroma and one epi[INVESTIGATOR_658154]), c horoid (stroma), retina (epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), eyelids and conjunctiva. The total 
radioactivity in these ocular tissues of Dutch -Belted rabbits was not statistically significantly 
different from NZW rabbits at the six sampling time points. Therefore, there was no e vidence 
of melanin binding of 
14C-LX214 after a single ocular administration. These data were 
confirmed in an in vitro model.  
1.2.2 Clinical Studies of Voclosporin in  Dry Eye 
VOS  has been investigated in one Phase 1 dose -escalation study (LX214 -01) in 30 healthy 
volunteers, followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label evaluation of VOS in 5 subjects with DED. In that study, 
both 0.02% and 0.2% concentrations were found to be safe and well tolerated following 
multiple instillations in healthy subjects. Adverse events (AEs) and ocular findings were mild 
and similar between VOS and placebo groups. Although the sample size was small, results 
from the [ADDRESS_1165712] VOS may be beneficial in t he treatment of DED and is 
supported by [CONTACT_838909] (OSDI) scores, which were improved in all subjects at all time  points while on study drug. Overall, the results indicated VOS can be used 
safely when administered BID for two weeks . 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential

 These factors form the basis for the rationale to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
voclosporin in subjects with DED.  Study AUR -VOS -2017- 01 will evaluate the tolerability 
and efficacy of VOS versus Restasis® in subjects with DED.

 2. RATIONALE  
2.1 Dose Ratio nale 
Based on Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and all clinical trials to date in the clinical 
development program in other indications, oral voclosporin is generally well tolerated at doses 
up to 0.8 mg/kg BID with no unexpected safety concerns compared to the profile expected for 
CNIs.  
VOS was evaluated in a Phase 1 parallel, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, 
dose- escalation (0.02% and 0.2%) study assessing the safety and tolerability of VOS in healthy 
volunteers, followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label evaluation of VOS (0.2%) BID in subjects with DED  
(see voclosporin Investigator’s Brochure  (IB)). Although the sample size was small, results 
from the five  subjects with DED suggest VOS may be beneficial in the treatment of DED and 
is supported by [CONTACT_838910]. The mean improvement in STT scores between baseline and the end of treatment 
provides further evidence of efficacy. It is anticipated that 0.2% VOS BID will be an effect ive 
dose in the treatment of immune- mediated ocular surface disease.

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, m ulti-center, Investigator- masked, randomized, parallel -group study to 
evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and safety of VOS  versus Restasis® over a 28-day treatment 
period in subjects with mild to moderate DED .  Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 
to either VOS or Restasis® at approximately 5 centers located in the US .   
At Visit 1 ( screening), informed consent will be obtained from subjects and el igibility will be 
determined .  A STT will be performed at this visit. The score will be used for eligibility  and 
baseline.  During this visit, all subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh 
Plus®, OU to assess ability to self -administer  study product. 
At Visit 2 (Randomization) , continued eligibility will be confirmed .  During this visit, all 
subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus®, in both eyes to evaluate 
ability to tolerate ocular drops.  Individuals who are unable to successfully instill the drops or 
who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable, based on a post -instillation Drop Discomfort  
VAS  score, will not be eligible for participation in the study.  (Note:  For subjects meeting the 
Screening and Rand omization Criteria, the Visit 2 Drop Discomfort  VAS score will be used 
as the baseline value.)   
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups :  
VOS BID or Restasis® BID.  The first instillation of Investigat ional Product (IP) will be 
administered , at least 2  hours following administration of Refresh Plus® and by [CONTACT_838911] 2.  IP will be administered to the subject by a dedicated dosing coordinator 
(the subjec t and the Investigator will be masked to study treatment for the first post 
randomization instillation).  Tolerability, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at 
this visit.  
At Treatment Visits 3  and 4 , tolerability , safety  and efficacy evaluations will be performed.  At 
the E nd of Treatment , Visit 5, tolerability, safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed.  
Subjects who discontinue before Visit 5 will undergo all Visit 5 evaluations ( early 
termination) .  IP will be admin istered to the subject  by a dedicated dosing coordinator  at the 
clinic visits  (single masked: the Investigator and study staff  will remain masked to study 
treatment) . A Drop Discomfort  VAS will be administered in the clinic at [ADDRESS_1165713]  by [CONTACT_838912] 
(See Appendix 9) and the Drop Discomfort VAS  (1- and 5-minutes post- instillation).  
At Visit 6, there will be a 3-day post- treatment Follow-Up, in which safety assessments are 
performed  and all remaining study materials are collected .  The subject s will be instructed to 
continue to withhold all other concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_838891] (through Visit 6). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) ongoing as of Visit [ADDRESS_1165714] resolved, 
stabilized in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], or returned to baseline. 
This study will be conducted per the schedule shown in the Schedule of Events  (Table 1 ) and

 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any  reason. 
Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s 
best interest.  
Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study, either voluntarily or at the Investigator’s discretion, to undergo end of study assessments (Visit 5), if possible. If 
possible, the subject should also be advised to come for the Follow -up V isit, [ADDRESS_1165728] 
dose (Visit 6). If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal should be 
fully documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ). It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the study without providing 
a reason. In this case, the source documents and the eCRF should document the reason for 
discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent.” Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
5.[ADDRESS_1165729] be made t o evaluate protocol- specified safety follow -up 
procedures (see Section 9.3, Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy ). If a subject 
is withdrawn due to an AE, the event should be followed by [CONTACT_429690]. All AEs should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-[ADDRESS_1165730] Research Organizations (CROs), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to study 
product assignments. There will be an unmasked dedicated dosing coordinator who wil l 
dispense the IP to the subject and who will perform drug accountability on the returned IP.  This individual will be otherwise uninvolved in the study operations.  Further more , there will 
be a Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ) dedicated to drug accountability who will be 
unmasked to the treatment assignment by [CONTACT_838913].  In case of medical emergency, or 
occurrence of an SAE, the randomization code may be unmas ked and made available to the 
Investigator, Sponsor , and/or other personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of this 
study. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the study is completed and the database is locked.   
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no specific antidote to VOS, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary. If the 
Investigator feels it is necessar y to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency situation, 
the Investigator may call the Medical Monitor and notify the Sponsor. The IP assignment will 
be revealed on a subject -by-subject basis with the approval of the medical monitor and 
Sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact.  
A randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_838914] ( EDC ) system .  No other 
 or Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Aurinia) staff will have access 
to the schedule.  
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. 
With the exception of the dedicated dosing coordinator  and drug accountability CRA, all other 
study personnel , the Sponsor , and project teams at the CROs involved in the study will be 
masked  to study product assignments.

 6.2 Masking  
On Day 1 Dose 1, this study is double-masked. T he IP allocation ( VOS versus Re stasis®) will 
be masked to the Sponsor, the subject  and the investigative staff with the exception of a 
dedicated dosing coordinator  and unmasked CRA.  The dosing coordinator will be responsible 
for dispensing and retrieving IP to/from subjects, instructing subjects regarding dosing of the 
IP, addressing study subjects’ questions regarding IP, and reviewing daily dosing diaries .  As 
a consequence of these interactions, the dosing coordinator will be unmasked to the study 
treatme nt for each subject. In order to ensure subject masking, at Visit 2, first dose, the dosing 
coordinator will not provide any IP related information prior to instilling the IP. The IP will be 
instilled in a masked  manner.  Instructions regarding storage and dosing will be provided after 
this first instillation.   
On Days [ADDRESS_1165731] assignment ; however, as 
VOS and Restasis® have different storage conditions and appearance , it may be  possible that 
the subjects who have previously used Restasis®, may know that those differ from their prior 
experience.  Therefore, the study will be considered Investigator- masked during this timeframe.  
The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_838915] S tatistician (who is not 
on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and limited -access location 
separate from the study Investigator and members of the project team.  
6.[ADDRESS_1165732] the information to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of unmasking. 
If an SAE is assessed as unexpected and related to the IP, and therefore meets the requirement 
for expedited regulatory submission, the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Surveillance department will 
unmask the treatment assignment for the individual subject. Expedited reports will be submitted to Regulatory Authorities in accordance with applicable regulations. Expedited 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 38 of 95 
 
 
 reports will be distributed to Investigators without revealing the treatment assignment and will 
be submitted to Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ). 
If emergency unmasking is required, withdrawal of the subject from the study is not mandatory 
unless there are other circumstances that requi re the subject’s discontinuation.  At the 
Sponsor’s discretion, the subject may remain in the study without continued use of the IP.   
In the event of accidental unmasking, the event would be reported as a protocol deviation and escalation to the Sponsor.  The subject may remain in the study.  If identified by [CONTACT_188528], a Sub-I nvestigator may be asked to assume clinical study assessments for a subject if 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_838892].

7.3 Package and Labeling  
All study treatments provided by [CONTACT_789192]. All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to GMP and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
7.4 Study Treatment Allocation  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either VOS or Restasis® in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be 
allocated a kit number for the duration of the study.  Subjects will be assigned to treatment 
groups using the randomization module within the EDC  system.   As e ligible subjects are 
enrolled and the corresponding Randomization eCRF  completed, a kit number will be 
assigned.  
7.5 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability  
7.5.1 Site Supply  
Once a site has been approved for study initiation, the site will be supplied with an initial stock 
of IP. Each site will receive one shipment of  both Restasis® and VOS prior to study enrollment.  
Additional shipments of both Restasis® and VOS will be provided to each site as needed. 
7.5.2 Storage 
VOS should be stored refrigerated between 2º C and 8º C (35º F to 49º F) but may be brought to room temperature prior to use. Subjects should be consistent in their use of VOS IP.  
Opened ampules must not be stored for re -use as the formulation does not contain 
preservatives.  
STUDY DRUG SHOULD NOT BE FROZEN. DO NOT USE IF THE VIAL CONTENT 
DOES NOT APPEAR CLEAR.  
Restasis
® should be stored at room temperature ( 15-25°C/59-77°F) . 
Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. Th e log should be updated by [CONTACT_838916] -VOS-[ADDRESS_1165733] be recorded on the 
relevant forms provided. 
Each study site will ma intain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all IP dispensed and 
returned. At the end of the study, one copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be 
sent to Aurinia or designee for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files.  
After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all un dispensed IP will be 
returned to Aurinia. The decision to destroy IP at a site must be made by [CONTACT_429691]. If the  
dispensed/returned IP is destroyed at a site, the Investigator mu st receive Aurinia approval of 
the site’s standard operating procedure addressing the destruction process and forward 
documentation of destruction to Aurinia.

 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
8.1 Description of Study Assessments  
8.1.1 Dry Eye Disease Activity Assessments 
The following a ssessments will occur as part of the evaluation of D ED (See Appendix 2).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye ( SANDE )  
Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate the frequency and severity of their dry eye symptoms 
at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5  using the SANDE.  The total length of the line from “rarely” to “all the 
time” (frequency of symptoms) and from  “very mild” to “very severe”  (severity of symptoms)  
is 100 mm. Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate the frequency and severity of their 
symptoms (OU) by [CONTACT_635799] “X” on the relevant horizontal line. The length of the line 
between the “rarely” or  “very mild”  starting point and the first point where the subject’s mark 
crosses each line will be measured and recorded in millimeters. This assessment is a general 
assessment of both eyes.  There will not be a question for each individual eye.  This assessment 
should be performed prior to assessing for AEs and prior to any other invasive visit assessment  
(See Appendix 3).  
[IP_ADDRESS] V isual Analogue S cale (VAS)  Symptom Assessment s  
Individual Symptom  Severity Assessments  using VAS:  
Subjects will be asked to rate their  current symptoms (unrelated to study drug instillation) at 
Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5.   The following six symptoms will be evaluated:  Burning/Stinging, Foreign 
Body Sensation, Photophobia, Eye Pain, Eye Dryness, and Itching. 
The subject will be asked to subjectively rate each of six ocular symptom (OU) by [CONTACT_1299] a 
vertical mark on the horizontal line to indicate their  level of discomfort. 0 corresponds to “No 
Symptoms” and 100 corresponds to “Severe Symptoms .” The linear dimension of the scale is 
measured in millimeters.  This assessment is a general assessment of both eyes.  There will not 
be a question for each individual eye. This assessment should be performed following SANDE , 
and prior to assessing for AEs and prior to any other invasive visit assessment  (See Appendix 
4).  
[IP_ADDRESS] F luorescein Corneal S taining   
Corneal staining will be performed at Visit 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Corneal staining assessment will be 
performed using methods developed by [CONTACT_559050] ( See Appendix 7).

Evaluation Technique  
NOTE:  All steps in this procedure should be completed for the right eye ( OD) prior to 
repeating the procedure for the left eye ( OS). 
• Place Slit-Lamp magnification at 10x (it is acceptable to use 16x if no reticle is used)  
• Use a yellow barrier filter (Wratten or Tiffen #11 or #12)  
• Place 5 µL of non-preserved, 2% fluorescein into eye , gently touch ing the drop at the 
tip to the lower palpebral conjunctiva of the eye 
• In order to thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film, ask the subject to blink 
several times and move his/her eye around 
• Wait 2 .5 minutes to assess cornea  
• Measure staining under Cobalt blue light (465 nm to 490 nm) 
• Compare staining with the standard with scor ing in each of 5 areas of the 5 corneal 
sections  
Scoring system 
• Grade each of 5 sections of cornea (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal, central) 
• Provide grades for each of the 5 sections: 
o Grade by [CONTACT_559052] (definition  in Appendix  7) as 0,  1 (mild),  2 (moderate),  or 3 
(severe)  
• Total score is obtained by [CONTACT_559053] 5 sections of the cornea 
o NEI score will be from 0 -15  
(See Appendix 7). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unanest hetized Schirmer Test  (STT)  
Schirmer Tear Test (without anesthesia) will be conducted at Visit [ADDRESS_1165735] 20 minutes 
following FCS at Visit 5 : 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 46 of 95 
 
 
 Identical Schirmer strips will be supplied to each site.  When conducting assessments room 
temperature and humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each visit and throughout 
the study.  
• While still in the plastic sheath, fold the notched end of the Schirmer  strip at the apex 
of the “v. ”  Additionally, make a partial second fold at the halfway point of the strip so 
that the strip does not lie directly in the subject’s line of sight  
• Remove the right eye strip from the sheath  
• Ask the subject to look up and gently draw the right lower lid in a downward and 
temporal direction  
• Place the rounded end of the strip toward the temporal one- third of the lower eyelid  
• Repeat this procedure in the left eye  
• Dark en the room but ensure that the largest letter(s) of a Snellen or ETDRS chart is 
visible  
• Instruct the subject to relax and look at the chart while blinking normally or have 
patients gently close eyes  
• Remove the strips after 5 minutes  
• After removing the strips, with a sharp pencil draw a horizontal line across the leading 
edge of moisture and a second horizontal line across the lowest point of moisture 
• Using a ruler and/or the millimeters recorded on the strips, measure a point halfway between the two lin es and record this as the amount of wetting 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1165736]- Instillation Tolerability  Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drop  Disc omfort Assessment   
Drop dis comfort will be assessed  by [CONTACT_838918] a Drop Discomfort VAS  (0-100 mm) 
where 0 corresponds to “no discomfort”  and 100 corresponds to “maximal discomfort.” (S ee 
Appendix 1).  
At Visit 2,  prior to randomization, i n order to evaluate the subject’s ability to tolerate ocular 
drops, all subjects will self -administer an  OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus®, in both eyes. 
Upon instillation of the ocular lubricant in both eyes, subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_838919] [ADDRESS_1165737] -instillation  by [CONTACT_1299] a mark on the 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 47 of 95 
 
 
 Discomfort VAS . Subjects who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable , defined as a VAS 
score ≥ [ADDRESS_1165738] s will complete this assessment in the clinic following the  AM dose of IP at Visits 2, 3, 
4 and 5 and again at home following the  PM dose on the evenings of Visits 2, 3, 4 and the 
evening prior to V isit 5.   
 
8.1.3 Safety Assessments 
The following assessments will occur as part of the safety evaluation of the subje cts: 
[IP_ADDRESS] B est Corrected Visual Acuity  (BCVA)   
BCVA will be conducted at Visit [ADDRESS_1165739]’s own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_558670]. 
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used, and charts may be reflectance o r 
retro -illuminated .  If a 24.5” by 25”  chart is used , the subject must view the chart from exactly 
4 meters (13.1 feet).  If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are used, 
the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet.  Reflectance wall charts should be 
frontally illuminated (60 -watt bulb or a well- lit room).  
The subject should be positioned per the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle.  The right eye should be tested first.  The 
subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with line [ADDRESS_1165740] identification of each letter.  He/she 
is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  If the subject 
changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted.  
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart encouraging the subject to 
guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the 
examiner should stop the test.  The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be 
noted.  ( See Appendix 6). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Op hthalmoscopy  
Dilated ophthalmoscopy exam will be performed per the Investigator’s standard procedure  at 
Visit [ADDRESS_1165741] from study participation.  A clinically significant change from baseline may 
indicate an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy  
The biomicroscopy exam will be perfo rmed at Visit 2 and Visit 5.  It should be performed with 
the Slit-Lamp using a beam of width and intensity to provide optimal evaluation of anterior 
segment.  
This procedure will be performed in the same manner for all subjects observed at the Investigator ’s site  (See Appendix 5). 
8.2 Schedule of Assessments  
A detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol -required assessments, visits , and 
visit windows) is located on the Schedule of Events  (Table 1 ). No study -related assessments 
will be performed (including changes to current medications to meet study eligibility) until the subject has provided signed and dated informed consent. Every effort will be made to keep the 
subject within the requested visit schedule. If a subject is seen outside of the visit window listed on the Schedule of Events , the reason must be clearly documented in the source notes.

AUR -VOS-[ADDRESS_1165755] a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1165756] or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means  that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
9.1.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
A Suspect Adverse Reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For purposes of Investigational New Drug  (IND) safety reporting , 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
9.1.4 Unexpected  
An AE or SAR is considered “une xpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  
9.1.5 Life-threatening 
An AE/SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the pati ent or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not 
include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

 9.1.6 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE  is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  meets one or more of the following 
criteria : 
• Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) 
• Is life -threatening (Note: the te rm “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe)  
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a con genital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event or reaction  
The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. 
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789154]. These will also usually be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789155] -exist ing conditions, which 
have not worsened after initiation of treatment, will not be classed as SAEs. Previously 
scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789156]’s source documents before the 
subject signed the informed consent form ( ICF).  
9.1.7 Suspe cted Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_429651], is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product is a susp ected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) .

 9.2 Adverse Event Descriptors  
9.2.1 Intensity/Severity Categorization 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction);  however , the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by 
[CONTACT_838924]. The medical assessment of intensity will be 
determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]: 
Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. 
Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to fu nction. 
Severe:  The AE is incapacitating,  and the subject is unable to work or complete usual 
activity.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_1165757] been caused by [CONTACT_104841]. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE /SAE must 
be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause -and-effect relationship between the study treatment and the 
occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be considered related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of 
causal relation ship on the SAE reporting form. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 59 of 95 
 
 
 Term  Relationship  Definition  
Related  Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration 
indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.  
Not related  No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration does 
not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatment is determined to be 
“related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator  has not yet provided 
his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify 
for expedited regulatory reporting. 
9.2.3 Outcome Categorization 
Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequel ae; improved; 
worsened; ongoing; ongoing at end of study ; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as 
recovered with sequelae for a n SAE , the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on 
the SAE reporting form. SAEs  that are ongoing at the time  of death will have an outcome of 
“unknown” recorded.  SAEs resulting in a fatal outcome will have an outcome of “fatal” 
recorded.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_1165758]’s worst observed intensity.  The Investigator will 
be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for each AE as related or not 
related. An AE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under study and related

AUR -VOS-[ADDRESS_1165760]'s source 
documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study  drug. 
For screen failure subjects, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the scree ning period (after 
informed consent) will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation only and will not be 
collected on the eCRF. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug must be 
collected.  
If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to disease under study, relationship to 
study treatment , any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has 
become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not , will be recorded. Use of 
colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only one AE term should be recorded in 
the event field on the AE eCRF. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis 
rather than signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation  of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis 
is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should 
be nullified  by [CONTACT_838925], 
with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by [CONTACT_423]. For screen failure 
subjects, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the screening period will be recorded in the 
subject’s source documentation only . For enrolled subjects (i.e., those  who successfully 
complete screening),  the AE reporting period ends at the Follow-U p visit ( Visit 6). Adverse 
events persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by [CONTACT_838926] (or the subject is lost to 
follow- up and cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]) and recorded in the source documents . If the subject reports 
an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess 
causality. T his may require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone 
contacts, etc.  In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_1155], the

assessment of a caus al relationship must be provided by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator will 
also be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for each SAE as related or not related. An SAE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under s tudy and 
related to study trea tment. Any safety information that is obtained after  the follow-up visit 
(Visit 6) will be documented in the safety database only. 
A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within [ADDRESS_1165762] study visit (including the follow -up visit) or until [ADDRESS_1165763]  died, the SAE report should include the cause 
of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related to study treatment, as well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed by [CONTACT_838927] i nclude copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports/certificates and 
other documents when requested and applicable. 
Additional follow-up information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness 
following Investigator (or site) awareness of  the information. The Investigator should not delay 
reporting a n SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional information, when 
available, should be reported to  by [CONTACT_429712]. The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the study Medical Monitor when the issue of 
seriousness is unclear or questionable.

 An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) if appropriate , according 
to local requirements.  
The Sponsor or its representative will be responsible for determining and, in turn, reporting 
SAEs to Regulato ry Authorities according to the applicable regulatory requirements.

female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she b ecomes pregnant during the 
study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in a female subject should continue until conclusion of the 
pregnancy. In case of a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the Investigator should 
obtain informed consent of the pregnant partner prior to monitoring of the pregnancy. 
Women who have a positive pregnancy test during the study will be withdrawn from the study 
treatment  and the procedures for withdrawal will be completed. The Medical Monitor must be 
contact[CONTACT_838928] (if applicable). 
All pregnancies , subject or partner of a subject, that  occur during the study or come  to the 
attention of the Investigator within [ADDRESS_1165765] study visit (including the Follow -up 
Visit) or until [ADDRESS_1165766] be 
reported to  by [CONTACT_429712]. 
The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and 
documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made 
to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as 
appropriate) post -partum. It will be the responsibility of Aurinia, together with the appropriate 
support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. 
Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or 
congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported following the reporting 
procedures as outlined in Section 9.3.2, Serious Adverse Events .

 10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
10.1 Statistical Methods  
Complete details of the statistical and analytical methods will be provided in a formal 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to the database lock . A general 
description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the C linical Study Report. 
All statistical analyses will be undertaken at study closure and will incorporate all endpoints. 
10.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The study will include approximately 60 male or female subjects.  
The primary analysis will assess the difference in change from baseline in  Drop Discomfort 
VAS scores  (range 0 to 100 mm) 1-minute post-Dose 1 instillation  between the two treatment 
groups.   
A sample size of 26 subjects per group (52 in total) will provide at least 90% power 
assuming: 
• A mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of +30 mm for subjects 
randomized to Restasis® 
• A mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of +10 mm for those 
randomized to VOS 
• A common standard deviation of 21 mm 
• A 2-sided alpha of 5% 
Under the same assumptions, the study will have at least 80% power if the common standard deviation for the discomfort score were to be 25. 
The study also provides 80% power should the treatment difference in discomfort scores be 
16 (common standard deviation=20). 
To allow for 15% dropouts, approximately  60 subjects will be randomized.

 10.6 Statistical and Analytical Methods  
10.6.1  Primary Analysis 
The primary endpoint is measured on a VAS and will be summarized and analyzed as 
continuous data.  Summaries of VAS scores (absolute and cha nge from baseline) by [CONTACT_838929] (minutes 1, 5 and overall mean) at each visit.  Should the data meet the necessary assumptions (normality and equal variance in both 
treatment groups) , then the treatment groups will be compared using a t -test.  If assumptions 
are violated , the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used.  If needed, transformations will be 
considered in order to meet the necessary assumptions. 
10.6.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Descriptive statistical summary  (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum) will be presented  by [CONTACT_838930] .  Changes from 
randomization/baseline will be compared between VOS and Restasis® using a two -sample t -
test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  Further d etails will be addressed in the SAP.  
10.6.3  Safety Analysis 
Adverse events will be aggregated by [CONTACT_838931].  Other safety endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_765] a s absolute values and 
changes from baseline (as appropriate).  Endpoints with specific ranges will have counts of values falling outside of the range summarized by [CONTACT_560225].   
10.7 Safety Evaluations  
Safety evaluations include:  
• Treatment -emergent adver se events (TEAEs)  
• BCVA  
• Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy

 14. PROCEDURE FOR MODIFICATION OF PROTOCOL OR 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
14.1 Protoc ol Waivers, Deviations and Violations  
Protocol waivers shall not be permitted.  
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without 
written agreement from Aurinia and prior documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_120973]/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study . If the Investigator must implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior written approval , the 
implemented deviation or change and the reasons for it should be submitted in a timely manner 
to Aurinia and to the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_429724].  
The Investigator, or person designated by [CONTACT_737], will document and record the preventative and/or corrective measures for any deviation from the approved protocol. 
Accidental deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be assessed as minor or major on a case- by-case basis. The criteria describing the 
deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be documented in the SAP. 
Any amendment to the protocol requires written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC 
prior to its implementation unless there are overriding safety reasons.  
In some instances , an amendment may require a change to the ICF. The Investigator must 
receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_429653].  
14.2 Study Termination  
Aurinia reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time. Reasons for termination may include but  are not limited to  the following: unsatisfactory subjec t 
enrollment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 
 
The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:  
• Potential for Eye Injury and Contamination [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1165785] common adverse reaction following the use of RESTASIS
® was ocular burning 
(17%).  Other reactions reported in 1% to 5% of patients included conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230], eye 
pain, foreign body sensation, pruritus, stinging, a nd visual disturbance (m ost often blurring). 
 
 
 6.[ADDRESS_1165786] approval use of RESTASIS®. Because these 
reactions are reported voluntarily from  a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably 
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
 
Reported reactions have included: hype rsensitivity (including eye swelli ng, urticaria, rare cases of severe 
angioedema, face swelling, tongue swelling, pharyngeal edema, and dyspnea); and superficial injury of the eye (from the vial tip touching th e eye during administration).  
 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
 8.1   Pregnancy 
Risk Summary 
Clinical administration of cyclos porine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% is no t detected systemically following 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784] [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], and maternal use is not expected to result in 
fetal exposure to the drug. Oral admi nistration of cyclosporine to pregnant  rats or rabbits did not produce 
teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses [ see Data ]. 
Data 
Animal Data 
At maternally toxic doses (30 mg/kg/day in rats a nd 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits), cyclosporine oral solution 
(USP) was teratogenic as indicated by [CONTACT_838936]- and postnatal mortalit y, reduced fetal wei ght and skeletal 
retardations. These doses (normalized to body surf ace area) are 5,000 and 32,000 times greater, respectively, 
than the daily recommended human dose of one drop (approximately 28 mcL) of cyclosporine ophthalmic 
emulsion 0.05% twice daily into each eye of a 60 kg pers on (0.001 mg/kg/day), assuming that the entire dose is 
absorbed. No evidence of embryofetal toxicity was obser ved in rats or rabbits r eceiving cyclosporine during 
organogenesis at oral doses up to 17 mg /kg/day or 30 mg/kg/day, respectivel y. These doses in rats and rabbits 
are approximately 3,000 and 10,000 times greater, respec tively, than the daily recommended human dose. 
An oral dose of 45 mg/kg/day cyclos porine administered to rats from  Day 15 of pregnancy until Day 21 
postpartum produced maternal toxicity and an increase in postnatal mortality in offspring. This dose is 7,000 
times greater than the daily recommended human dose. No  adverse effects in dams or offspring were observed 
at oral doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (2,000 times gr eater than the daily r ecommended human dose). 
 
8.2   Lactation 
Risk Summary 
Cyclosporine is known to appear in human milk following systemic admini stration, but its presence in human 
milk following topi[INVESTIGATOR_838898]. Although blood concen trations are undetectable 
following topi[INVESTIGATOR_838899]® ophthalmic emulsion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , 
caution should be exercised when RESTASIS® is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and 
health benefits of breastfeeding should be consid ered along with the mother’s clinical need for RESTASIS® and 
any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from cyclosporine. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1165787] not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 16. 
 
 
 8.5   Geriatric Use 
No overall difference in safety or effectiveness has been observed between elderly and younger patients.

polysorbate 80; carbomer copolymer type A; purified water; and so dium hydroxide to adjust pH. 
 
[ADDRESS_1165788] 
mechanism of action is not known. 
 
12.3  Pharmacokinetics 
Blood cyclosporine A concentrations were measured us ing a specific high pressure  liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry assay. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine, in all the samples collected, after topi[INVESTIGATOR_838901]
® 0.05%, twice daily, in humans for up to  12 months, were be low the quantitation 
limit of 0.1 ng/mL. There was no detectable drug accumu lation in blood during 12 mont hs of treatment with 
RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion. 
 

 
 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
 
13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,  Impairment of Fertility  
Carcinogenesis 
Systemic carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female mice and rats. In the 78-week oral (diet) 
mouse study, at doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg/day, eviden ce of a statistically signi ficant trend was found for 
lymphocytic lymphomas in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose males significantly exceeded the control value.  In the 24-month oral (diet) rat study, conducted at 0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day, pancreatic islet ce ll adenomas 
significantly exceeded the control rate in the low dose leve l. The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet 
cell adenomas were not dose related. The low doses in mice and rats are approximately 80 times greater 
(normalized to body surface area) than the daily r ecommended human dose of one drop (approximately 28 
mcL) of 0.05% RESTASIS
® twice daily into each eye of a 60 kg person (0.001 mg/kg/day), assuming that the 
entire dose is absorbed.   Mutagenesis 
Cyclosporine has not been found to be mutagenic/genot oxic in the Ames Test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the 
micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone-
marrow, the mouse dominant lethal  assay, and the DNA-repair test in  sperm from treated mice. A study 
analyzing sister chromatid ex change (SCE) induction by [CONTACT_838937] a positive eff ect (i.e., induction of SCE). 
 Impairment of Fertility 
No impairment in fertility was demonstrated in studies in male and female rats receiving oral doses of 
cyclosporine up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 ,000 times the human daily dose of 0.001 mg/kg/day 
normalized to body surface area) for 9 weeks (mal e) and 2 weeks (female) prior to mating. 
 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
 
Four multicenter, randomized, adequate and well-controlled clin ical studies were performed in approximately 
1,200 patients with moderate to severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca. RESTASIS® demonstrated statistically 
significant increases in Schirmer we tting of [ADDRESS_1165789] was seen in approximately 
15% of RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion-treated patients versus a pproximately 5% of vehi cle-treated patients. 
Increased tear production was not seen in patients curre ntly taking topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammatory drugs or using 
punctal plugs.  No increase in bacterial or f ungal ocular infections was repor ted following administration of RESTASIS
®.

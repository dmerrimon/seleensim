Protocol Version Date: 19 September 2022 
  1.0   Research Aims:  
 1.1   Research Question:   
Does Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation (C- RFA) of the medial branch nerves  (MBN) 
compared to zygapophyseal (“facet”) joint injection of corticosteroid result in a greater response rate defined by [CONTACT_378089], functional improvement, and reduction of analgesic medication use in individuals with  lumbar facet 
syndrome? 
 1.2   Null Hypothesis:  
Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation (C- RFA) of the MBNs  compared to facet joint injection 
(FJI) of corticosteroid result does not result in a greater response rate defined by [CONTACT_378089], functional improvement, and reduction of analgesic medication use in individuals with lumbar facet syndrome. 
 1.3   Specific Aims:  
1.  Determine the proportion of patients with a successful  response (defined as 50% or 
greater improvement in index pain) to lumbar MBN C- RFA versus facet joint injection of 
corticosteroid at 3 months, and the duration of relief up to 2 years .  
2. Evaluate the functional improvement observed in both groups, as assessed by [CONTACT_378090] (ODI), the PROMIS Physical Function CAT (PF-CAT), and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC); determine the correlation between 
reduction in pain and improvement in function, as well as the correlation between the 
Version 2.0 19- SEP-2022  Page 2 of 13  
 ODI and the PF-CAT in this specific population, to both the anchor score (PGIC) as well 
as to each other (ODI vs. PF- CAT) .  
4.   Evalua te changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_378076], as assessed by 
[CONTACT_378091].   
5.   Evaluate differences in the proportion of patients with a successful treatm ent response in 
those who reported 100% relief from dual comparative diagnostic lumbar MBN  blocks 
relative to those with at least 80% improvement but less than 100% relief f rom the dual 
comparative blocks.  
5.  Report immediate, short-term, and long- term a dverse effects, using a standardized survey 
that includes a comprehensive query of known adverse events associated with systemic steroid effects.  
 
 
2.0   Research significance:  
 2.1   Background  
 Chronic, non-neurogenic low back pain (CLBP) is a common condition that affects many individuals across their lives. The lumbar facet joint has been implicated as an important source of CLBP, with a prevalence of 15-45%.
1,2,3,4 ,5 Elements of clinical history, physical examination, 
and imaging (radiographs, standard CT scan, standard MRI sequences) provide poor diagnostic specificity for pain of lumbar zygapophysial joint (Z-joint) origin.
6,[ADDRESS_473189] 
for the diagnosis of lumbar Z-joint pain is a positive response to dual comparative MBN blocks, 
which requires pain reduction ≥ 80% of concordant duration to that expected of two different 
local anesthetics on independent occasions.9,[ADDRESS_473190] a 
high positive predictive value for determining the clinical outcome of lumbar MBN RFA for the 
treatment of lumbar Z -joint pain; when patients are appropriately selected using this reference 
standard and rigorous MBN RFA technique is im plemented according to practice guidelines ,[ADDRESS_473191] outcome improvements, this literature is generally flawed by [CONTACT_378092](s) .
9  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_378077] (lumbar MBN RFA vs. facet joint corticosteroid injection), the two techniques have never been compared in an appropriately-designed head- to-head study. The sole outcome study
15 comparing these two treatment methods 
used an invalid selection protocol of one positive MBN block, requiring only 50% relief in pain and not of concordant duration with that expected by [CONTACT_378093]; in addition, a single RFA lesion was applied with a 20g conventional RFA electrode and fluoro scopic images 
were not published, so it is unclear if parallel electrode technique was used, as is necessary with 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_473192] call for improving such standards in research 
and clinical care by a multitude of experts representing  interventional pain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and radiology 
specialty societies .13,16,17,18 As such, an appropriately designed head- to-head trial in warranted. 
 Furthermore, while the conventional RFA modality has been studied extensively for MBN RFA, minimal outcome literature on the effectiveness of C -RFA technology has been published.
19 C-
RFA is similar in mechanism to conventional RFA: a thermal lesion is created by [CONTACT_378094] a target structure. In C-RFA, a constant flow of ambient water is circulated through the electrode via a peristaltic pump, maintaining a lowered tissue temperature by [CONTACT_40397] a heat sink. By [CONTACT_378095], a lower lesioning temperature is maintained, resulting in less tissue charring adjacent to the electrode, l ess tissue impedance and more efficient heating of target 
tissue  
20,21. The volume of tissue heated,  and the resultant thermal lesion size is substantially 
larger with C -RFA  22, conferring an advantage over conventional RFA23. Further, given the 
spherical geometry and forward projection the C-RFA lesions beyond the distal end of the electrode, the RFA probe can be positioned at a range of possible angles and still capture the target neural structure, whereas more fastidious, parallel positioning is required with conventional RFA.

investigators, i.e., the clinics of the University of Utah Orthopaedic Center and the University of Utah South Jordan Health Center. Secondary recruitment from marketing to primary care clinics and local media will also be implemented.  
 Participant Reimbursement Participants will be reimbursed $50 at 3-month follow -up, $50 at 1- year follow -up, and $50 at 2-
year follow-up. 
  Enrollment Process  Potential candidates will be approached in clinic or contact[CONTACT_378096] a screening evaluation if the potential candidate agrees. Eligibility is determined by [CONTACT_378097]. Qualifying volunteers will be asked to provide both written and verbal informed consent.   Patients may be compensated for their time and participation upon enrollment and for completion of follow- up intervals.

dult patien ts aged > 21 capable of understanding and providing consent in English and 
capable of complying with the outcome instruments used.  
2. A xial (non-radicular) back pain for at least 3 months ( i.e. Chronic Low Back Pain) that 
did not respond to conventional treatment such as physical therapy, oral analgesic agents, and non-invasive adjunctive treatments. The pain can be unilateral or bilateral. The pain can also include referred lower limb pain.  
3. Numeric pain rating score (NPRS) for back pain of 5/10 or greater at baseline evaluation.

 A pain diary with  appropriate diagnostic categories of relief will be provided (100% relief, 80% 
relief, etc. ), will be provided. The degree of pain at baseline is recorded and subsequent relief  is 
recorded at 15- minute  intervals for six hours.  
 
In order to qualify as a positive block, the subject must experience at least 80%  relief from 
baseline lasting at least one hour with lidocaine and two  hours with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. The patient is 
discharged from the recovery suite after 30 minutes, provided there are no advers e effects that 
require more attention.   The pain relief can include relief in a specified area, e.g. the pain relief can be relief on the right side only. It does not preclude a different diagnosis at a different site, e.g. upper lumbar area.   Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Focal neurologic signs or symptoms. 
2. Radiologic evidence of a symptomatic herniated disc or nerve root impi[INVESTIGATOR_378081].

  Power Analysis In the Dreyfuss et al
12 prospective cohort study of conventional RFA for the treatment of chronic 
lumbar facet joint pain, which used an identical diagnostic/selective MBN  block protocol (SIS 
guidelines9), to that of the proposed study, 87% of patients experienced at least 60% reduction in 
pain at 10-month follow-up. For the present power analysis, we will more conservatively estimate a success rate of 80%, using 50% relief in pain at [ADDRESS_473194] patients for facet joint 
injection of corticosteroid. However, Carette et al. used intra- articular injection of local 
anesthetic only (>50% relief considered “positive) in order to select patients for a randomized 
controlled trial of lumbar facet joint injection of corticosteroid versus saline .27 In this study, a 
42% success rate was observed at 3 months. For the present power analysis, we will more conservatively estimate a success rate of 50% at 3 months, as participants will be selected  by 
[CONTACT_378099]-articular diagnostic injection.  
 Given that the primary analysis will be categorical in nature (comparison  of the proportion of 
responders), with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 39 participants would be needed in each group (total 78 participants)  to detect a significant difference in the proportions between the 
two groups (80% vs. 50%) using a chi -square test .  However, in order to improve the power of 
the study beyond the minimally acceptable standard and to account for anticipated attrition , we 
propose to enroll 135 patients  in the trial. 
  Outcome Instruments  
Baseline Only:  
-  Demographics (age, sex, BMI), duration of back pain, nature of pain (i.e. bilateral, 
symmetrical, unilateral) , exact anatomic location of lumbar pain based on clinical 
diagnosis aided by [CONTACT_378100], confirmed by [CONTACT_378101]. 
 Baseline & Follow -up:  
- Percentage of relief with each of the MBN block procedures (from pain diary) 
-  NPRS back pain (7- day average)  
- Current NPRS  
- Oswestry Disability Index score - PROMIS Physical F unction Computer Adaptive Test (PF CAT) score 
-  PROMIS Global short- form 10  (Global-10) score 
- Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_105849] - Ancillary treatment log  
 Follow-up Only:  
-  Patient g lobal impression of change (PGIC)  
-  Adverse effects . Specifically  only: spi[INVESTIGATOR_158394], epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116], and neurological 
damages to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_263100](s) at the treated level(s).   
  Study Timeline  
Baseline:  
Participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study after consenting to and before receiving treatment. The baseline examination and all baseline questionnaires will be completed within 8 weeks before the index study trea tment procedure 
(facet joint steroid injection or medial branch radiofrequency ablation) as time is needed to obtain insurance authorization for all study procedures in the present study (all procedures in this 
Version 2.0 19- SEP-2022  Page 7 of 13  
 study represent usual care procedures: medial  branch blocks, facet joint injections, and medial 
branch radiofrequency ablation).  
 Follow-up:  Routine scheduled follow-up will occur at 1 month (+/ - 2 week s), 3 months (+/ - 4 weeks), 6 
months (+/- 6 weeks), 12 months (+/- 3 months), and 24 months (+/- 3 months ), at which times 
all follow -up measures will be obtained.  
 The 3-month follow-up will serve as the time point for the primary outcome analysis of the randomized trial and an intention- to-treat analysis will be used to evaluate for differences in 
outcomes between the two groups. The 3-month time point provides a reasonable ti meframe to 
evaluate the clinical effects of the lumbar MBN C- RFA  while also providing a humane 
timeframe for crossover to active treatment in those randomized to usual treatment. All subsequent follow-up periods are intended to evaluate long- term clinical outcomes of lumbar 
MBN C -RFA  and will be evaluated with an as-treated analysis.  
 The study start date and the outcome assessment timeline will begin at the date of the participant’s initial f acet-targeted treatment. After [ADDRESS_473195] faile d treatment 
(not meeting criteria for success, as described above) can be offered alternative treatment. Those who cross -over will be considered treatment failures  of the original treatment, by [CONTACT_108], and 
continue on the regular follow-up schedule. A new [ADDRESS_473196] that diminishes by > 50%. This can 
occur at any time following the 3-month follow-up, including the regularly scheduled follow-up intervals. Repeating the facet intervention procedure originally assigned beyond the 3-month follow-up does not reset the follow- up schedule. Patients are also free to choose alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_378083] 3 months. Patients may also develop new low back pain that is different from what is being evaluated, which will be noted.    Study Protocol   Treatments Procedures:  
 C-RFA Procedure  (Procedure as performed as standard of care clinical practice) 
During the C-RFA procedure, the participant will be positioned prone on a fluoroscopy table. S
terile precautions, including sterile preparation, drapes, and gloves, will be undertaken. A pre -
procedure time- out will be performed.  Vital signs will be recorded as per usual care for sedation 
procedures. Patients may be mildly sedated during the procedure, using intravenous midazolam 
and /or fentanyl. An C- RFA electrode – Coolief® Cooled Radiofrequency Kit (Halyard  Health 
Inc, Alpharetta, GA ), will be placed at  the junction of the transverse process and the superior 
articular process  in an ipsilateral oblique fluoroscopic view, touching bone, but then with 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_473197] projection of the cooled lesion. Appropriate 
positioning will be confirmed in oblique, anterior-posterior, and lateral fluoroscopic views, as is shown in the below figures per manufacturer guidelines:   
    
   Motor testing may  be performed   at each of the MBNs  per physician discretion. Sensory testing 
is not required, as this technique has been shown to have no influence on treatment outcomes.
28 
After appropriate electrode positioning, 1-4 mL  of 1-4% lidocaine might need to be used at a 
given medial branch nerve in order to affectively anesthetize it before lesioning (standard of care range) . This is done through an introducer needle for anesthes ia during the ablation. The C- RFA 
lesions will be performed by [CONTACT_378102][INVESTIGATOR_2855] C-RFA protocol with lesions performed with the RFA generator (generator is pre -programmed)
29. Once the procedure is completed, all needles 
will be removed. Following ablation, 0.25-1 mL  of 0.25 -0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_378084]. No corticosteroids will be 
injected.  
 For bilateral low back pain , a maximum of 4 facet joints (two on each side) will be denervated 
by [CONTACT_378103] 6 MBNs . For unilateral low back pain, up to 3 facet joints will be 
denervated by [CONTACT_378104] 4 MBNs . 
  FJI Procedure (Procedure as performed as standard of care cl inical practice)  
During the C-RFA procedure, the participant will be positioned prone on a fluoroscopy table. Sterile precautions, including sterile preparation, drapes, and gloves, will be undertaken.  
Using an oblique fluoroscopic view, the image intensifier will be rotated to optimize the 
posterior joint space opening. A spi[INVESTIGATOR_378085]. The needle position will be confirmed in both AP and oblique 
views. Approximately 0.2-[ADDRESS_473198] medium will be injected to confirm intra -
articular placement and no vascular uptake. The injection will be then completed with 0.5 mL  of 
40mg/ mL Kenalog and 0.5 mL  of 1-4% preservative-free lidocaine. This technique will be 
repeated for each facet joint injected . 

Version 2.0 19- SEP-2022  Page 9 of 13  
  
For bilateral low back pain , a maximum of 4 facet joints (two on each side) will be injected. For 
unilateral low back pain, up to 3 facet joints will be injected.  
  Group Assignments:  Patients will be  randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (C -RFA vs. FJI) at a 1:1 ratio. 
Participants  who reported  50% or more relief of their usual pain (NPRS score compared to 
baseline)  at the 3-month follow-up time point and who subsequently experience a treatment 
effect that diminishes by > 50% will be offered a repeat procedure. Duration of relief will be considered the time from the provision of the treatment  procedure until the participant returns to 
50% of their pre-treatment level of pain as reported during scheduled follow-up, or when a repeat treatment procedure is requested and performed.   Crossover:  Any time after the 3-month follow-up, any participant who has not obtained adequate pain relief can ask to cross over to alternative  treatment  group . In doing so, a new 2- year follow -up will 
begin for this participant  who is now placed in the alternative  treatment group for the long- term, 
as-treated outcomes analysis.  
 Co-interventions:  
Patients are allowed to receive usual care, including co -interventions, as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_1963]. Treatments related to the participant’s spi[INVESTIGATOR_378086].   Primary Outcomes:  
The primary outcome for the randomized trial is the proportion of responders, defined by a reduction in NPRS score ≥50%  at the 3-month follow-up.  
 Secondary Outcomes:  
1.  Physical function (ODI and PF CAT)  
2.  Global function (Global-10) 3.  Analgesic use (MQS III score
30) 
4.  Global impression of change (PGIC)  
5.  Adverse events  (Specifically only: spi[INVESTIGATOR_158394], epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116], and neurological 
damages to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_263100](s) at the treated level(s))   
 Blinding:  Participants  cannot be realistically blinded to their intervention. However, all assessors will be 
independent and blinded. Participants  will remain in their allocated groups throughout the study 
unless they meet the criteria for crossover treatment. In order to provide an unbiased assessment, the treating physician will  be different from the outcome assessor , a trained research assistant.  
 Data Management  Data will be collected on standardized case report forms and entered into a HIPAA -compliant 
electronic database ( REDC ap) that provides an appropriate interface with a robust statistical 
Version 2.0 19- SEP-2022  Page 10 of 13  
 package (Stata ver. 14.2, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, [LOCATION_003]). All study- related hard 
copy materials will be stored in locked file cabinets.  
 Data Analysis  Results of the randomized comparative trail will be determined by [CONTACT_378105] 3-month follow-up. At 3-month follow-up, prior to allowing crossover, overall treatment response rates (in the previously defined cate gories of failu re or success ) will be 
calculated for both treatment groups using an intention- to-treat analysis. For time periods beyond 
3 months, intention- to-treat and as -treated analyses will be performed with primary reporting 
based on the as- treated analysis to assess the long- term effectiveness of each treatment. In the 
intention -to-treat analysis, participants who cross- over will be treated as treatment failures of 
their original group assignment. In addition, a treatment benefit survival analysis will be performed .   
 Subgroup analyses will be performed to assess treatment response and long- term effectiveness in 
patients reporting 100% relief from lumbar MBN  blocks as compared with those reporting 
between 80% relief. Data will also be examined to identify any facto rs that predict treatment 
success and need for repeat treatment.  
 Secondary outcomes will be similarly evaluated. For the assessment of function and global quality of life, the proportions of those achieving and not achieving the established minimal clinically important differences (MCID) will be determined and compared between the two  
treatment groups at the 6-month follow-up. For long- term analysis of treatment effectiveness, an 
as-treated analysis will determine the proportion of participants  exceeding these response 
thresholds. In addition to these categorical outcomes, changes in group mean scores will be measured and compared .  
 Statistical Analysis  
Descriptive statistics and graphical displays will be used to examine the central tendency and distribution of each outcome variable. Data will be analyzed using Stata ( ver. 14.2, StataCorp 
LLC, College Station, TX, [LOCATION_003]).  An alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_473199] deviations or medians and interquartile ranges  (depending on the distribution 
of data) will be calculated for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions will be calculated for categorical variables. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic differences will be compared between the groups (C-RFA vs. FJI ) in order to ensure that the two  groups are equal in 
terms of observed as well as unobserved covariates other than the treatment provided to them.  In comparing groups (C -RFA vs. FJI ) with regard to categorical variables, Fisher’s exact tests 
will be used. Proportions and 95% c onfidence intervals will also be calculated in order to 
confirm that any differences between groups are truly distinguished. A proportion ratio will be calculated as the measure  of the effect size. For quantitative variables , independent t -tests or 
Wilcoxon- Mann -Whitney tests will be used to compare means or medians, respectively.  An 
effect size of r  will be calculated to examine the magnitude of a group difference.

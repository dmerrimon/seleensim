Confidential and Proprietary    Methodology:  
Double-blind Phase (DB)  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding evaluation of the 
efficacy and safety of OCA in subjects with PSC.  Approximately 75 subjects who provide 
written informed consent and meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:  1.5 mg titrating to 3 mg OCA, 5 mg titrating 
to 10 mg OCA, or placebo, in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_21047]’s dose will be 1.[ADDRESS_21048]’s  dose will be titrated  as follows, providing there are no limiting safety or 
tolerability concerns in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], whil e maintaining the trial blind:  the 
1.5 mg OCA treatment group will titrate to 3 mg , the 5 mg OCA treatment group will titrate to 
10 mg OCA, and the placebo group will remain on placebo.  DB treatment will continue for a  
further 12 weeks at that dose .   
Any subjects whose dose is not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, will remain on their starting treatment (1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo) for the remainder of the DB phase to Week 24. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_22054] 
(UDCA) use  and total bilirubin level (≤1.5x upper limit of normal [ULN] or >1.5x ULN but 
<2.5x ULN). 
Long-Term Safety Extension  Phase (LTSE)  
Following completion of participation in the DB phase, subjects will be asked  to reconfirm their 
consent for participation in the open- label long- term safety extension (LTSE) phase (a further 
24 months).   
Upon a subject’s completion of the DB phase, the trial blind will be broken in order to assign the 
starting OCA dose for the LTSE phase.  It is intended t hat subjects will commence treatment at 
5 mg OCA, except those subjects who completed treatment in the DB phase with 10 mg OCA who will continue at 10 mg OCA unless safety and tolerability warrant a dose reduction to 5 mg.   
• Placebo at end of DB   5 mg OCA in LTSE 
• 3 mg OCA at end of DB  5 mg OCA in LTSE  
• 10 mg OCA at end of DB   [ADDRESS_21049] to be titrated in line with the above schedules, this may be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
During the LTSE phase, subjects may titrate to higher doses of OCA, at a frequency not greater than 3 monthly (ie, at each of the scheduled LTSE visits), up to a maximum dose of 10 mg daily.  The guideline for an increase in the dose of OCA is based on tolerability and the goal of 
achieving an ALP level <[ADDRESS_21050].  Doses of OCA should be titrated as follows, unless 
clinically indicated:  1.5 mg to 3 mg, 3 mg to 5 mg, and 5 mg to 10 mg.  Intermediate doses

Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the Week 24 change from Baseline in ALP.  The primary 
efficacy analysis will compare the Week  24 change from Baseline in ALP between the OCA 
10 mg treatment group and placebo using an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model with 
fixed effects for treatment group and randomization strata, and Baseline as a covariate.   
Secondary efficacy analyses of hepatic biochemistry and function parameters will use the same 
ANCOVA models as the primary endpoints.  A hierarchical approach will be used for 
multiplicity adjustments.  If the primary efficacy analysis is statistically significant (p <0.05), the 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  18 Mar  2016 
 Page 12 
Confidential and Proprietary    following order will be used in the testing procedure to compare the change from Baseline in 
ALP between OCA and placebo:  
• Week 12:  OCA 5 mg treatment group (randomized to 5 mg for the initial 12 weeks followed by 10 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo  
• Week 24:  OCA 3 mg treatment group (randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 12 weeks 
followed by 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo  
• Week 12:  OCA 1.5 mg treatment group (randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 
12 weeks f ollowed by 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo 
If at any step the comparison is not statistically significant, then all subsequent comparisons will be exploratory rather than confirmatory.   
In addition, secondary efficacy analyses of ALP response ra tes, defined as ALP to <1.5x ULN, 
will compare OCA treatment groups vs. placebo at Week [ADDRESS_21058] stratified by [CONTACT_22055].  Missing 
values will be considered a non -response.  
Safety Analyses 
The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs) 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_20623], and 
similarly by [CONTACT_22056].  
Laboratory parameters and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_22057] -Baseline visit.  The change from Baseline will 
also be summarized .  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_22058] t group using 
frequency at each visit.  The shift from baseline will also be summarized.   Baseline is defined as 
the mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment (except for lipoprotein assessments where 
Baseline will be Day 0).    
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of OCA and other bile acids will be evaluated, including AUC
t, 
Cmax, and tmax.  An exposure response analysis of total plasma OCA (OCA and its conjugates) to 
biomarkers, such as change in ALP and change in bile acids, will be performed to help identify 
optimal doses for this patient population.   
Full details of the statistical methodology, analyses, and outputs will be detailed in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Interim Analysis  
An unblinded interim analysis for planning purposes will be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed the initial 12 -weeks of blinded treatment.  The trial will not be 
terminated early for futility.  The interim analysis will compare at Week 12, the same variable as 
will be analyzed for the primary endpoint:  the change from Baseline in ALP, between OCA treatment groups (1.5 mg and 5 mg) and placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for treatment group and randomization stra ta and Baseline as a 
covariate.  No adjustments to the alpha level will be made.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  [ADDRESS_21059] 
90% power to detect a treatment difference for change in ALP assuming the mean absolute 
change in ALP for OCA and placebo treatment groups are approximately -20% and -5%, 
respectively, with a pooled standard deviation of 16, based on a 2- sided independent [ADDRESS_21060] at an alpha level of 0.05.

Confidential and Proprietary    4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Overview of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Obeticholic Acid 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, life -threatening, chronic cholestatic liver disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_22060].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_21994], liver transplant is currently the only 
treatment shown to improve clinical outcome.  
PSC is usually diagnosed by [CONTACT_22061], with or without 
reported symptoms, and confirmed by [CONTACT_22062], typi[INVESTIGATOR_21995] (ERCP).  
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in most PSC patients, consistent with cholestasis; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma- glutamyltransferase (GGT) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] e levated as 
well, but not in all cases.  Bilirubin is often normal in early stage PSC but increases with progression of the disease.  The mean age at diagnosis is 40 years, and men are affected twice as often as women.   
PSC is a serious and life- threatenin g condition.  Median survival for PSC patients has been 
previously estimated as 8 to 12 years from diagnosis in symptomatic patients, depending upon 
stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis (Levy 2006, Worthington 2006, Lee  1995).  
Complications involving the biliary tree are common and include cholangitis as well as ductal strictures and gallstones, both of which may require frequent endoscopic or surgical 
interventions.  PSC is often complicated by [CONTACT_22063] , with 
cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) being the most common .  CCA drastically worsens mortality 
(Fevery 2007, Lazaridis 2006 ).  In a large Swedish trial, the 5-year survival rate for patients 
diagnosed with either CCA or gallbladder cancer was approximately 5% compared to 
>85% survival in PSC patients without hepatobiliary cancer ( Bergquist 2002).   
Obeticholic acid  (OCA) is a modified bile acid and is a potent agonist of the farnesoid X receptor 
(FXR).  OCA has marked anti-fibrotic and anti- inflammatory properties in animal models of 
liver disease.  In addition, the safety and tolerability of OCA has been evaluated in clin ical trials 
in the ‘sister’ cholestatic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).  Phase [ADDRESS_21075] shown that treatment with OCA resulted in highly statistically significant improvements in liver biochemistry associate d with cholestasis and was generally 
well tolerated.  These findings render OCA potentially useful for the treatment of PSC.   OCA has 
received orphan drug designation for the treatment of PSC in Europe and the [LOCATION_003]. 
4.2. Mechanism of Action of Obeticholic Acid 
For a detailed description of OCA’s mechanism of action please refer to the current OCA 
Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).   FXR is an essential  and pleiotropic regulator of a variety of 
activities involved in bile acid homeostasis ( Lefebvre 2009) .  Its activation affects genes that 
control bile salt synthesis and transport  (Makishima 1999, Wang 1999) ; activation of FXR 
reduces the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase 
(CYP7A1 ; the rate-limiting enzyme of bile salt synthesis) and the sinusoidal bile salt uptake 
pump, while inducing the bile salt export pump.  Activation of FXR in the ileum leads to 
increased release of fibroblast growth factor  19 (FGF-19) into the portal vein, transporting it to 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  18 Mar  2016 
 Page 25 
Confidential and Proprietary    the liver where it also acts as a brake on endogenous bile acid production by [CONTACT_22064]7A1 
(Cipriani 2011, Pols 2011).  In addition to being the key regulatory gatekeeper for bile acid 
synthesis, FXR has also been implicated as having a role in modulating immune response, 
decreasing portal hypertension, and potentially being anti-atherogenic ( Lefebvre 2009).  
Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the principal natural ligand of FXR in humans.  When 
cellular levels are already high , the negative feedback pathway inhibits the further synthesis of 
bile.  CDCA, and its epi[INVESTIGATOR_21996] ( UDCA), have a long history of use in of the 
dissolution of  cholesterol gallstones (although currently laparoscopic surgery is more typi[INVESTIGATOR_21997]).  In cholestasis, the primary mode of action of UDCA is thought to be choleretic, ie , 
facilitating bile flow  to relieve cholestasis rather than suppressing its synthesis and buffering the 
bile (Beuers 2006).  UDCA has no FXR agonist properties.  
OCA is structurally related to  CDCA and differs by [CONTACT_1121] a single ethyl group.  The 
chemical name [CONTACT_22167] 3α,7α-dihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5βcholan-24- oic acid.  It is also referred to 
as 6α-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid, or 6- ECDCA, and as an agonist it is approximately 100-fold 
more potent than CDCA in vitro (Pellicciari 2002 ).  OCA is also highly selective for FXR and 
does not bind other nuclear receptors, and with the exception of weakly activating the dedicated 
bile acid receptor TGR5, it does not activate any G- protein coupled receptors ( CEREP 2008 ).  
OCA is in clinical development in a series of chronic liver and metabolic disease indications in 
which the functions regulated by [CONTACT_22065].    
4.3. Nonclinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid 
Administration of OCA to rats (f or 6 months) and dogs (for 9 months) in repeat dose toxicity 
trials resulted primarily in adverse effects on the liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract at only the highest dose levels.  OCA was not genotoxic in a battery of 3 genotoxicity studies.  Reproduc tive 
and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated no adverse effects on fertility and embryo/fetal development at doses where OCA caused maternal toxicity.  
A summary of the toxicology studies is provided in the IB.  The nonclinical pharmacology 
experience with OCA is summarized below.  For more information on the nonclinical data for 
OCA, please refer to the current IB.  
4.3.1. Nonclinical Anti- fibrotic and Anti -inflammatory Properties  
In vitro exposure of both murine and human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to OCA represses 
fibrogenic α1(I) collagen and transforming growth factor- beta 1 (TGF -β1) expression by 60% to 
70%, indicating that OCA is a potent regulator of HSC mediated fibrogenesis.   
OCA significantly inhibits fibrogenesis and r everses liver cirrhosis, as determined by [CONTACT_22066] a thioacetamide (TAA)- induced liver injury model 
(Albanis 2005).  In addition, OCA inhibits NF κB–regulated pro-inflammatory genes in 
hepatocytes and in vascular cells, inhibiting induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF -α), and inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) 
and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( Li 2007, Wang 2008).  OCA also inhibits production of 
TNF-α by [CONTACT_22067], and inhibits 
differentiation of human monocytes into dendritic cells ( Gadaleta 2011).  Furthe rmore, OCA 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  18 Mar  2016 
 Page 26 
Confidential and Proprietary    inhibits production of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-17, and interferon-γ in lymphocyte-enriched 
human lamina propria cells ( Gadaleta 2011).  
4.3.2. Nonclinical Effects on Cholestasis  
The results of trials performed in rodent models of cholestasis involving the administration of 
chemical agents that severely injure bile ducts (such as carbon tetrachloride [CCl 4] or lithocholic 
acid [LCA]) provide evidence that OCA is effective in preventing or reducing cholestasis in vivo .  
In the LCA model, co-infusion of OCA fully reversed the impairment of bile flow and protected against liver cell injury (Pellicciari 2002 ). 
Results of other trials  have demonstrated that OCA significantly reduces fibrotic collagen 
synthesis in vitro and in various rodent models of chronic liver injury that involve fibrosis and 
eventual cirrhosis, consistent with the progression of PSC ( Albanis 2005, Mookerjee 2015).   
4.4. Clinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid 
To date, OCA has been evaluated in the clinic in a total of 25 completed and 8 ongoing trials , 
including patients with PBC and  other chronic liver diseases ( eg, portal hypertension and 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [ NASH]) and healthy volunteers.  Additional trials are also planned 
to further chara cterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)  properties of OCA 
as well as the safety and efficacy of OCA in subjects with PBC and  other chronic liver diseases . 
As of [ADDRESS_21076] one dose of OCA in 
completed or ongoing trials.  Overall, the PK profile of OCA is consistent with that expected of a 
bile acid.  Phase 1 PK trials demonstrated that OCA was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_21998]- OCA and tauro -OCA, respectively.  OCA and 
its conjugates were primarily eliminated via biliary excretion and plasma concentration -time 
profiles demonstrated multiple peaking with prolonged exposure, indicative of enterohepatic 
circulation.  Plasma concentrations of OCA and its conjugates peaked shortly after meals, 
consistent with gall bladder emptying into the duodenum as expected of a bile acid.   
Phase 2 Trial  747-201 evaluated 2 doses of OCA (10 mg and 50 mg) given as monotherapy 
versus placebo  in subjects with PBC.  S ignificant relative and absolute reductions in ALP were 
achieved with both doses of OCA versus placebo (p <0.0001).  Mean relative ALP reductions 
were 44.5% (OCA 10 mg) and 37.6% (OCA 50 mg) compared to + 0.4% with placebo.  Absolute ALP reductions were -233.5 U/L and -161.3 U/L with OCA doses of 10 mg and 50 mg, 
respectively compared to +11 U/L with placebo.  Further, significant improvements in GGT and in conjugated bilirubin were observed with both doses compared with placebo (p <0.05).  OCA doses of 10 mg and 50 mg resulted in decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) but the change did not achie ve statistical significance.  
Phase 2 trial  747-202 evaluated 3 doses of OCA (10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) versus placebo in 
subjects with PBC on a stable therapeutic dose of UDCA.  Overall, the data from 747 -202 were 
consistent with the monotherapy trial.  Statistically significant relative and absolute reductions in 
ALP were achieved with all 3 d oses of OCA versus placebo (p <0.0001).  Mean ALP reductions 
ranged from 21% to 25% compared to 3% with placebo.  Absolute ALP reductions ranged from approximately 65 U/L to 75 U/L versus 5 U/L for placebo.  Significant improvements were also 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  [ADDRESS_21077] at 10 mg and 25 mg, and in conjugated 
bilirubin (% change) at 25 mg and 50 mg. 
The long term safety extension ( LTSE) phases of both trials  (completed LTSE phase from 
Trial 747-202 providing exposures out to one year and ongoing LTSE phase of Trial 747-201 
providing exposures up to approximately 4.5 years to date ) support the long -term safety of OCA 
and demonstrate a durable therapeutic response.  
Phase 3 Trial 747-301 evaluated 2 OCA treatment arms (10 mg and 5 mg titrating to 10 mg based on efficacy and tolerability) versus placebo in subjects with PBC on a stable therapeutic 
dose of UDCA or who could not tolerate UDCA.  The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
proportion of subjects who achieved an ALP <1.67x upper limit of normal (ULN) with a minimum 15% reduction in ALP and a normal bilirubin after 12 months of treatment.  Both 
OCA treatment groups showed statistically significant d ifferences (p <0.0001) versus placebo for 
the composite endpoint at all post-baseline timepoints with 47%, and 46% achieved the endpoint 
at 12 months in the 10 mg and titration groups compared to 10% with placebo.  Consistent with 
the Phase 2 trials, statistically significant relative and absolute reductions in ALP were achieved 
in both treatment groups (p <0.0001).  Mean ALP reductions were 39% and 33% compared to 5% with placebo.  
Overall, OCA has been demonstrated to be safe and generally well tolerated in PBC patients.   
The primary adverse event (AE) shown to be related to OCA is pruritus.  This reflects a drug and 
dose related exacerbation of the most common symptom of PBC and is thought to be due to the 
choleretic effect of OCA that increases bile flow  and hepatic clearance, but may also increase 
exposure to a pruritogen present in the bile that can induce pruritus in susceptible patients.  Of 
note, UDCA therapy initiation also can induce pruritus in patients, which can be ameliorated by 
[CONTACT_22068].   Pruritus has also been observed in clinical trials with OCA in other indications, 
but with a much lower frequency than that observed in subjects with PBC.  Other potential risks 
identified include liver toxicity at high doses.  Detailed clinical information can be found in the 
OCA IB.  
4.5. Summary of Known Potential Risks with Investigational Product 
Investigators are referred to the current IB for a thorough presentation of the safety data associated with OCA.  An overview is as follows:  
Pruritus is a common symptom of chronic cholestatic diseases such as PBC and PSC.  In subjects 
with PBC, treatment with OCA has been shown to cause a dose-dependent exacerbation of this 
common symptom and similar results can be expected in subjects with PS C.  Pruritus has also 
been observed in clinical trials  with OCA in other indications and in healthy volunteers, but at  a 
lower frequency and at higher doses than that observed in subjects with chronic cholestasis.  Investigator guidance for pruritus manage ment strategies are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the 
protocol. 
Other potential risks include liver toxicity , especially at higher doses of OCA, which is 
consistent with nonclinical findings and the chemical characteristics of OC A as a bile acid and 
detergent.  An increase in liver function tests and hepat obiliary AEs, including jaundice, ascites 
and acute cholecystitis were observed in subjects with PBC and NASH who were treated at 
doses that are several fold higher (primarily 20 mg to 50 mg daily) than those studied in this 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  18 Mar  2016 
 Page 28 
Confidential and Proprietary    protocol (1.5 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) doses.  This is an important potential risk in subjects 
with PSC, where there is the possibility of dominant strictures of intra - and extra-hepatic bile 
ducts that could restrict bile flow.  In order to monitor bile duct patency, the trial protocol requires that sites perform an ultrasound at Screening, at the end of the DB phase, and annually in the LTSE.  Consistent with this potential risk, the present trial excludes subjects who have 
had, or who are suspected of having, a recent dominant stricture ( Section 7.3).  In addition, the 
trial calls for mandatory discontinuation of investigational product in those subjects whose liver 
chemistry (AST , ALT and or bilirubin) di splay clinically significant increases following the 
initiation of therapy ( Section 7.4.1).  The doses used in the present trial (1.5 mg to 10 mg) are 
amongst the lowest doses of OCA tested to date in a clinical set ting. 
Lipoprotein changes have also been observed with OCA dosing in s ubjects with PBC (including 
a decrease in high -density lipoprotein [HDL]).  The clinical significance of these lipid findings 
remains unclear and is being studied further.  Notably, despi[INVESTIGATOR_21999], they generally remained within normal limits.  The relevance of these findings to subjects 
with PSC is unclear  and will be investigated further in this trial.  
In addition, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review safety data from the 
present trial as well as other ongoing OCA trials  at approximately quarterly intervals but at least 
every [ADDRESS_21078]  
4.6.1. Rationale for Trial Design 
Rationale for Treatment Indication  
PSC is a rare, chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by [CONTACT_22069], 
fibrosis, and destruction of the intrahepatic and extra- hepatic bile ducts with no identifiable cause 
(Eaton 2013 , Hirschfield 2013).  PSC disease progression can vary, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_22000]; fibro sis and commensurate inflammatory responses induce a progressive spread of the 
fibrotic condition.  No treatment to  date, aside from liver transplant, has been associated with an 
improvement in clinical outcome.  As such, the unmet medical need for PSC is very high. 
Drugs that can improve bile acid flow (reducing toxic bile acid concentrations in hepatocytes) 
and have anti -inflammatory and anti- apoptotic effects should have beneficial effects in PSC.  
UDCA, which is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_22001], is often used for the 
treatment of PSC due to improvements in liver biochemistry following initiation of ther apy. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_22002], UDCA has not been shown to improve transplant 
free survival and, at high doses, has been associated with increased risk for serious complications (Lindor 2009).  Consequently, The Eu ropean Association for the Study of the Liver ( EASL) does 
not provide a recommendation for the use of UDCA for the treatment of PSC, and The American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD) recommends against its use ( EASL 2009, 
Chapman 2010).  However, as there are no approved drugs for the treatment of PSC, some 
physicians treat patients with UDCA, typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day. 
FXR has been shown to be an essential regulator of bile acid homeostasis with its activation 
being associated with decreased bile acid synthesis (Lefebvre 2009) .  FXR is the nuclear receptor 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  [ADDRESS_21079] anti-fibrotic and anti- inflammatory properties as well 
as being effective at reducing cholestasis ( Section 4.3).  Clinical data from trials in PBC showing 
marked reductions in liver biochemistry associated with cholestasis further support the rationale for evaluating OCA as a treatment for PSC ( Section 4.4). 
Rationale for Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The cholestatic conditions of PSC and PBC are both characterized by [CONTACT_22070].  While UDCA did not show a treatment effect on clinical outcomes ( Lindor 1997, 
Olsson 2005), follow up analyses showed that robust improvements in ALP, the achievement of 
normalized ALP levels or levels <1.5x ULN were associated with improved prognosis 
(Lindstrom 2013, Al Mamari 2013, Talwalkar 2013).  Evaluation of OCA in PBC subjects has 
shown OCA to be associated with a clinically and statistically significant reduction in ALP.  As 
such, this first trial of OCA in subjects with PSC will evaluate therapeutic response in terms of 
change from Baseline in ALP .  Categorical improvements (ie, normalization or <1.5x ULN) will 
also be evaluated as secondary endpoints.  
4.6.2. Rationale for Doses 
This trial is intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a range of doses of OCA in subjects with PSC with an overall goal of identifying doses that are therapeutic and generally well tolerated.  Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 dose groups:  1.[ADDRESS_21080] been established in healthy subjects and subjects with PBC (another 
cholestatic liver disease), at doses up to 50  mg once daily, and in subjects with alcoholic 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension at doses up to 25 mg.  In healthy subjects, 12 days dosing of up 
to 100 mg per day was safe and well tolerated.   
As demonstrated in the Phase 2 PBC trials, OCA can significantly reduce ALP levels at doses of 
10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg, but with an increase in the incidence and severity of pruritus at higher dose levels.  The Phase 3 PBC trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of OCA at lower doses of 
5 mg (titrated to 10 mg after 6 months based on efficacy and tolerability) and 10 mg; both 
treatment groups exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in liver biochemistry and were safe and generally well -tolerated.  Starting patients on 5mg OCA and titrating to 10mg based on 
the clinical response appears to be an appropriate dosing strategy in patients with PBC.  
Building on these data from patients with PBC, we plan to use the same titration dosing strategy for patients with PSC.  This considered approach provides a means for the treating physician to 
carefully manage tolerability issues while still providing an opportunity for efficacy.  The 
titration arm of 5 mg to 10 mg OCA is well-within the range shown to be safe and effective in PBC patients and in healthy volunteers.  However, given the detergent properties of OCA and 
the potential for dominant intra - and extra- hepatic strictures that could lead to bile acid retention 
in subjects with PSC (Section  4.5), evaluation of additional titration arm with 1.5 mg titrating to 
3 mg OCA (ie, ≤10 mg daily) is warranted.   
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:  [ADDRESS_21081] of the trial design targets doses known to be therapeutic for PBC (5 mg 
and 10 mg), another cholestatic liver disease, but also incorporates lower doses to 1) Allow 
identification of the minimally safe and effective dose, and 2) Further characterize the 
exposure-response relationship in this patient population.  The nested dose-rising approach allows for a more  robust characterization of the value of titration to address potential tolerability 
concerns and the exposure- response relationship by [CONTACT_22071] -subject variability.  The 
nested dose- rising approach also limits the needed number to treat which is important given the 
rarity of the disease and limited pool of patients from which to recruit, and minimizes the 
number of patients unnecessarily exposed to study medication. 
Rationale for P lacebo 
There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22004]. 
As such, the use of a placebo control is warranted to maintain the study blind and scientific 
validity of the trial.  UDCA is used by [CONTACT_22072].  However, EASL does not provide a recommendation regarding UDCA use in 
PSC, and AASLD recommends against its use ( EASL 2009 , Chapman 2010).  Based on this 
guidance, UDCA would not be an appropriate active control.  However, the Sponsor does 
recognize that UDCA is used in this orphan disease, and patients who are currently taking 
UDCA may be eligible to participate in the trial ( Section 7.2).  Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_22073], then randomized, in equal proportions, to each of the 
treatment groups ( Section 8.4.1).  
Rationale for Duration of D osing 
In the Phase 2 PBC trials with OCA, the double-blind (DB) evaluation of the reduction in ALP associated with OCA treatment was evaluated over 85 days.  Significant reductions in ALP were 
observed as early as 2 to 4 weeks with maximal reductions (at a single dose level) apparent by 
8 weeks.  Due to similarities in the cholestatic etiology of PSC and PBC, it is anticipated that a similar evaluation period will be sufficient to evaluate OCA in PSC.  As such, the present trial 
will evaluate each dose over 12 week periods.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN 
6.1. Overall Trial Design  
Double-blind phase  (DB) 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding evaluation of the 
efficacy and safety of OCA in subjects with PSC.  The trial design is shown in Figure 1 and the 
schedule of trial procedures for the DB phase is presented in Table 1.  Approxi mately 75 subjects 
who provide written informed consent and meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:  1.5 mg titrating to 3.0 mg 
OCA, 5 mg titrating to 10 mg OCA, or placebo in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_21082]’s dose will be 1.[ADDRESS_21083]’s dose will be titrated  as detailed in Section 6.4.1 and 
DB treatment will continue for a  further 12 weeks at that dose.   
Randomization will be strat ified by [CONTACT_22074] (≤1.5x ULN or >1.5x ULN but <2.5x ULN). 
Long-Term Safety Extension  Phase (LTSE)  
Following completion of participation in the DB phase, subjects will be asked to reconfirm their 
consent for participation in the LTSE phase (a further 24 months).  The schedule of trial 
procedures for the LTSE is shown in Table 2. 
Upon a subject’s completion of the DB phase, the trial blind will be broken in order to assign the starting OCA dose for the LTSE phase.  It is intended that subjects will commence treatment at [ADDRESS_21084] to be titrated in line with Table  4, this may be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor.

6.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 75 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be included in the trial.  
6.3. Treatment Assignment 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and will initiate treatment with  
1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or matching placebo.  Randomization will be in accordance to  a 
1:1:1 ratio (ie , 25 subjects/group).   
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_22078], according to defined stratification criteria (Section  8.4.1) an d then 
randomized in equal proportions  to each of the treatment  groups.  
6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria and Dose Titration  
6.4.1. Double-Blind Phase  
Following randomization, subjects will administer the assigned, blinded treatment once daily for 
[ADDRESS_21101]’s dose will be titrated  as follows, providing there are no limiting 
safety or tolerability concerns in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], while maintaining the trial blind:   
the 1.5 mg OCA treatment group will titrate to 3 mg , the 5 mg OCA treatment group will titrate 
to 10 mg OCA, and the placebo group will remain on placebo.  DB treatment will continue for a  
further 12 weeks at that dose .   
Any subjects whose dose is not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, will remain on 
their starting treatment (1.5  mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo) for the remainder of the DB phase 
to Week 24. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21102]’s completion of the Week 24 visit, at the end of the DB phase, the trial blind will 
be broken in order to assign the starting OCA dose for the LTSE phase.  It is intended that 
subjects will commence treatment at 5 mg OCA, except those subjec ts who completed treatment 
in the DB phase with 10 mg OCA who will continue at 10 mg OCA ( Table 4) unless safety and 
tolerability warrant a dose reduction to 5 mg.

1.[ADDRESS_21103] to be titrated in line with the above schedules, this 
may be discussed with the Medical Monitor.    
During the LTSE phase subjects may titrate to higher doses of OCA, at a frequency not greater 
than 3 monthly (ie, at each of the scheduled visits), up to a maximum dose of 10 mg daily.  The 
guideline for an increase in the dose of open- label OCA is based o n the goal of achieving 
ALP <1.5x ULN and tolerability.  Doses of OCA should be titrated as follows, unless clinically 
indicated:  1.5 mg to 3 mg, 3 mg to 5 mg, and 5 mg to 10 mg.  Intermediate doses (eg, 6.5 mg) may be considered as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737].  Dose should not exceed [ADDRESS_21104] to a prior dose or dosing frequency and this 
should be discussed with th e Intercept Medical Monitor in advance.  
6.4.3. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_22005] (DSMC) will review safety data from this  trial as well as 
other ongoing OCA trials at approximately quarterly intervals but at least every 6 months.  
Adjustments to or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_22006]-defined doses may be considered based on DSMC 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 41 
Confidential and Proprietary    evaluation of OCA safety and tolerability .  At a minimum, the occurrence of 2 life threatening 
serious adverse events (SAEs) or an SAE resulting in death will trigger an unscheduled and 
unblinded review of the data by [CONTACT_22079].  Section 6.5 
details the criteria for trial termination.  Reasons for discontinuation of individual subjects are 
noted in Section  7.4.1 and Section 7.4.2. 
6.5. Criteria for Trial Termination 
The Sponsor r eserves the right to terminate the trial at any time.  Additionally, it is agreed that, 
for reasonable cause, the Investigator may terminate the trial at his/her site at any time.  
It is normal procedure to review the emerging safety data.  As a result of such a review or a recommendation by [CONTACT_6802], it may be necessary to stop the trial before all subjects have 
completed the trial.  In addition, the Sponsor may terminate the trial at an investigational site at 
any time (eg, due to the quality of data) , as determined by [CONTACT_22080] . 
The Investigator and/or Sponsor (or designee) must notify the IRB /IEC of discontinuation of a 
site or the trial and the reason for doing so.  Local requirements for not ification of trial 
termination will be adhered to.  
7. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF S UBJECTS  
7.1. Subject Population  
Approximately 75 subjects with PSC will be randomly assigned to treatment groups using an 
interactive web response system (IWRS).  Up to 50% of the trial population may be taking 
concomitant UDCA.  Once this cap is reached, only those subjects who have not been treated 
with UDCA for at least  3 months prior to and including Day 0 may be enrolled.  In addition, a 
maximum of 25% of enrolled subjects will have a total bilirubin between >1.5x ULN and <2.5x ULN  
at Screening.  Prospective subjects will be identified primarily from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or 
physician’s database of PSC subjects, or may be referred from other physicians.  Subjects may self-refer themselves to an Investigator if they become aware of the trial through local, national 
or international PSC patient societies, forums and networks or websites (eg, www.clinicaltrials.gov).  
7.2. Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects must meet all of the following to be eligible to participate:  
1. Male or female aged [ADDRESS_21105] a diagnosis of PSC (based on cholangiography at any point in time) 
4. ALP at Screening ≥2x ULN.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 42 
Confidential and Proprietary    5. Total bilirubin at Screening <2.5x ULN.  
Note 1:  Subjects will be stratified according to total bilirubin level and no more than 
25% of subjects recruited will have a total bilirubin >1.5x ULN and <2.5x ULN a t 
Screening.  
6. For subjects with concomitant IBD:  
a. Colonoscopy (if subject has a colon) or other appropriate endoscopic procedure 
within 12 months of Day 0 confirming no dysplasia or colorectal cancer 
b. Subjects with Crohn’s Disease (CD) must be in remission as defined by a Crohn’s 
Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <150.   
c. Subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) must either be in remission or have mild disease. Remission is defined as a partial Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual sub- score 
exceeding 1.  Mild disease is defined as a partial Mayo score ≤[ADDRESS_21106] been stable for ≥[ADDRESS_21107] 
exceeded 20 mg/kg/day during this time.  
Note 2:  Subjects not taking UDCA at Day [ADDRESS_21108] taken UDCA for ≥[ADDRESS_21109] not take UDCA during the DB period.  Subjects 
will be stratified according  to UDCA use, and no more than 50% of subjects 
administering UDCA at Day 0 will be enrolled.  
8. Subjects being administered biologic treatments (eg , anti-TNF or anti -integrin 
monoclonal antibodies), immunosuppressants , systemic corticosteroids , or statins, must 
have been on a stable dose for ≥3 months prior to, and including, Day 0  and should plan 
to remain on a stable dose throughout the trial.  
9. Contraception:  f emale subjects of childbearing potential  must use ≥1 effective method 
(≤1% failure rate) of contraception during the trial and until [ADDRESS_21110] (including LTSE doses).  Effective  methods of 
contraception are considered to be those listed below : 
• Barrier method, ie , (a) condom (male or female) with spermicide or (b) diaphragm 
with spermicide; or  
• Intrauterine device ; or

Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21114] to restart dosing is documentation of a negative 
serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) test.  However, this is not in and of itself a guarantee for being allowed to continue in t he study.  For reporting purposes, pregnancy is not 
considered a SAE but is reported on the Pregnancy Notification Form (see Section 11.1.9). 
Clinical Laboratory Values 
Development of the following clinical laboratory values, without explanation, during the course 
of the DB and LTSE phases of the trial mandates investigational product discontinuation: 
• AST and/or ALT >3x ULN AND 2x the Baseline value OR 
• Two consecutive measurements of total  bilirubin > ULN AND >2x the Baseline value 
in the absence of evidence of new biliary obstruction.  
The term “Baseline” within this protocol, unl ess otherwise specified, is intended to mean, 
“pretrial” or “ pretreatment” (of investigational product ).  It refers to values obtained 
during the Screening, retests, or Day [ADDRESS_21115]’s first dose of 
investigational product. 
If a subject is required to discontinue investigational product due to an increase in AST , ALT, or 
bilirubin, the subject must be followed at appropriate intervals until these parameters have 
returned to within the normal range or pretrial values , and/or are stable or there is are stable, or 
there is no ongoing clinical concern.  
IBD Flares 
Subjects who experience 3 or more IBD flare -ups in one year during the study will be 
discontinued, where “flare” is defined as follows:  
• For UC flare:  as a partial Mayo Sco re ≥5, and  
• For CD flare:  as a CDAI ≥[ADDRESS_21116] should be discontinued from the study if:  
• The subject decides that it is in his/her best interest.  It is fully understood that all 
subjects volunteer for the trial and that they may withdraw their consent to continue 
in the trial at any time.  
• The Investigator considers that it is advisable or in the best interest of the subject.  
• There is a major violation of the clinical trial protocol for the subject  that would 
jeopardize the subject’s safety and/or data quality.  
• There is significant n oncompliance of the subject that would jeopardize the subject’s 
safety and/or data quality .

subject’s safety and/or data quality . 
• The subject is consistently unable to provide blood or urine samples. 
• There is an occurrence of clinical or laboratory AEs considered by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to 
be clinically important, such that they would jeopardize the subject’s safety. 
A reasonable effort must be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject fails to return for 
his/her final visit or is discontinued from the trial.  This information and date must be recorded 
on the appropriate case report form ( CRF). 
Bacterial Cholangitis  
It is anticipated that 10% to15% of subjects may experience bacterial cholangitis at some point during participation in the trial ( Lee 2002).  Bacterial cholangitis is generally associated with 
elevation of serum bilirubin, ALP, and transaminases in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and positive diagnostic imaging tests.  Local guidelines should be followed for the management of pa tients with acute bacterial cholangitis.  In the absence of such local guidelines, 
the following guidelines should be followed if acute cholangitis is suspected:  
• Diagnosis of acute cholangitis should be established based on a combination of typi[INVESTIGATOR_22007], laboratory data, and imaging findings.  Subsequent to an 
intervention to relieve biliary obstruction ac ute cholangitis may occur with typi[INVESTIGATOR_22008], right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice (also known as the Charcot triad).  Further confirmation of the 
diagnosis should then be made via laboratory data (eg, elevated C- reactive protein 
levels and/or leukocytosis) and abdominal imaging tests (magnetic resonance 
cholangiopancreatography).   
• Treatment of acute cholangitis should be directed towards treatment of the biliary 
infection and relieving obstruction.  Therefore, treatment is comprised of systemic 
antibiotic therapy and biliary drainage procedures, with appropriate supportive care.  
• Antibiotic agents should be administered empi[INVESTIGATOR_22009].   Blood and 
bile cultures should also be performed at the earliest opportunity and prior to initiating antibiotic treatment, if possible. 
• The selection of an antibiotic agent should be based on likely infecting bacteria, the severity of the disease, and the presence of comorbidities.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_22010].   The use of amoxicillin/clavulanate a nd other antibiotic treatments with 
potential for hepatotoxicity should be avoided. 
Investigational product may be interrupted at the discretion of the Investigator.  Discontinuation 
from the trial is not mandatory in cases of bacterial cholangitis unless signs and symptoms do not 
resolve within a clinically reasonable timeframe (typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 1 month or as agreed upon with the Medical Monitor) or the cholangitis becomes life -threatening in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_22011] M edical Monitor.  In any event, investigational product should not be restarted 
until signs and symptoms have resolved and the subject’s liver biochemistry has returned to pre-cholangitis level s.   
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21117] with ≥[ADDRESS_21118] experiences an IBD flare during the trial (post-Day 0), he/she may remain on investigational product but this should be discussed with the M edical Monitor and IBD flares 
should be treated as follows (but adjusted based upon local guidelines and standards of care, disease severity and personal patient preferences, as appropriate):   aminosalicylates alone (high 
dose if appropriate) or with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_22012]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or intravenous 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressant therapy, including anti-TNF therapy.  Surgery may be 
required in severe cases that are refractory to medicinal treatment.  
Subjects who experience [ADDRESS_21119]

flow.  If the investigational product has been interrupted and the subject  does not show 
improvement within [ADDRESS_21120] administration or to continue in the trial. 
Pruritus 
Pruritus is a common symptom in  PBC but less  common in PSC (Chapman 2011).   Investigator 
guidance for pruritus management strategies are outlined in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol.  
Subjects who experience one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_22013] , despi[INVESTIGATOR_22014]  [IP_ADDRESS], 
should be discontinued from the trial . 
7.4.3. Subject Discontinuation Notification  
The Investigator must notify the Intercept CRA by [CONTACT_22083].  The date when the subject is 
withdrawn and the primary reason(s) for discontinuation must be recorded in the CRF ; additional 
information may be requested by [CONTACT_22084] a discontinuation narrative.  A subject 
will be considered “lost to follow-up” (fail to return for a visit) only after reasonable, 
documented attempts to reach the subject prove unsuccessful.  In all cases, a reasonable effort must be made to determine the reason(s) that a subject fails to return for required trial visits or discontinues from the trial.  This information must be documented in the CRF. 
If a subject is withdrawn from either the DB phase or the LTSE phase of the trial early 
(regardless of the cause), all of the End of Treatment  (EOT) evaluations are to be performed at 
the time of withdrawal, and as close as possible to the administration of the last dose of 
investigational product, to the extent possible. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21121] Treatment Regimen 
Subjects enrolled in the trial will be treated with OCA and/or placebo.  On Day 0, subjects will 
be randomized to one of the following treatments:  placebo, 1.5 mg OCA, or 5 mg OCA.  
Because there are 2 different sizes of tablet used in this trial (1.5 mg OCA tablet and matching 
placebo are smaller than the 5 mg OCA and matching placebo), in the DB phase all subjects 
randomized to receive OCA will be administered with both OCA and placebo tablets, whereas subjects randomized to placebo will receive only placebo tablets (ie, a double-dummy approach).  
In order to maintain the blind, the daily treatment regimen for each effective dose is shown in  
Table 6.  At the Week [ADDRESS_21122] whose dose is not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, will remain on their starting treatment (1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo) for the final 
[ADDRESS_21123] 12 weeks of the DB phase, subjects will be instructed to administer 2 tablets daily  with water :  one 1.5 mg 
(small) tablet and one 5 mg (big) tablet.   During weeks 12 through 24 of the DB phase, subjects 
will be instructed to administer four tablets daily:  two 1.5 mg (small) tablets and two 5 mg (big) 
tablets. 
During the LTSE subjects will administer open- label OCA as  described in Section  6.4.[ADDRESS_21124] will be administered on the 
day prior to their LTSE Month 24 visit.

8.2. Concomitant Medications  
Relevant information about all concomitant drugs (including prescribed, over- the-counter, or 
herbal preparations) taken prior to (ie, within 30 days of Screening) and during the trial must be 
recorded in the source documents and CRF , as well as any dose or dose regimen changes that 
occur during the trial. 
8.2.1. Ursodeoxycholic A cid 
Subjects taking UDCA  at Day 0 should maintain this dose and the timing of administration of 
UDCA for the duration of the DB phase of the trial (24 weeks).  Subjects who are not taking 
UDCA on e ntry into the trial should not initiate UDCA therapy at any time during their 
participation in the DB phase of the trial.  
During the LTSE phase, UDCA may be used as considered clinically appropriate, provided the dose of UDCA does not exceed 20 mg/kg/day. 
8.2.2. Bile Acid Sequestrants  
While systemic or enteral therapy for pruritus is an exclusion criterion at trial entry, the treatment 
of pruritus during the trial is permitted if required.   
Bile acid sequestrants (BAS), aluminium hydroxide, or smectite- containing  antacids should be 
administered at least [ADDRESS_21125] (ie, they should be used [ADDRESS_21126] administration).  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21127] 4 hours apart from UDCA (ie, they should be used 4 hours prior to or 4 hours after 
UDCA administration).  
8.2.3. Prohibited Medications  
Administration of the following medications is prohibited as specified below unless discussed and agreed with the M edical Monitor:  
• Systemic or enteral therapy for pruritus in the [ADDRESS_21128] adm inistration . 
• Administration of antibiotics within 1 month of Day 0 (unless subject is on a stable prophylaxis dose for at least 3 months prior to Day 0) , except if administered for 
acute cholangitis whereby [CONTACT_22086] 3 months of Day 0.  
• NOTE:  Antibiotics are permitted as required during participation in the trial except amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) which has restrictions as detailed below.  
• Prohibited from 6 months prior to Day 0 and throughout the LTSE phase of the trial  
unless as noted to discuss with Medical Monitor :  
− Fenofibrate or other fibrates  
− Potentially hepatotoxic drugs (including α-methyl-dopa, sodium valproic acid, 
isoniazide, or nitrofurantoin)  
− Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) should not be used unless there are no other 
treatment options (this should be discussed with the M edical Monitor in advance 
of their use in this situation, where possible).  Augmentin is also discouraged in the treatment of cholangiti s but is not outright excluded ( Section 7.4.2). 
Subjects being administered the following medications at Day [ADDRESS_21129] been on a stable dose for ≥3 months prior to, and including, Day 0 and remain on a stable 
dose throughout the trial:  
• Anti-TNF and anti-integrin antibodies 
• Immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine, colchicine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, pentoxifylline) 
• Corticosteroids  
• Statins 
8.3. Treatment Compliance 
The Investigator should assess the subject’s compliance with dosing of investigational product 
on an ongoing basis and at each contact [CONTACT_22087] ; this should be confirm ed by [CONTACT_22088] (ie, count of returned tablets) during subjects’ on site visits.  
Subjects should be instructed to retain all bottles of investigational product, even if empty, and to 
return them to the Investigator at the subsequent visi t.  The Investigator  or designee should 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21130]’s dosing compl iance she/he should discuss this 
with the subject, assess the reasons for noncompliance and the likelihood that the subject will 
remain noncompliant, and notify the Sponsor accordingly.  Continued trial eligibility should be 
assessed. 
8.4. Randomization and Blinding 
At Day 0, after review of Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, subjects will be allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio based on a predefined randomization code (generated by [CONTACT_12066]) using the IWRS, which will serve as the registration system for subjects at Screening, Day 0, and entry into the LTSE phase.  The IWRS will serve as an investigational 
product inventory and management system and may be integrated with the trial database.  
The Investigator or designee will be required to register the subject in the IWRS and may be 
prompted to provide subject data necessary to randomize and allocate the subject to treatment.  
A randomization number will be assigned and investigational product disp ensing information 
(eg. bottle number[s]) will be provided while maintaining the trial blind.  The subjects, 
Investigator, and trial site staff will be blinded to the subject’s treatment allocation during the 
subject’s participation in the DB phase of the trial.   The IWRS system will facilitate the 
unblinding of an individual subject at the time the subject completes the DB phase and enters the 
LTSE phase of the trial (ie, subjects’ treatment allocations are unblinded one-by-one.   
8.4.1. Stratification  
In order to ensure that factors which could potentially affect treatment response are randomized 
in equal proportions to the different treatment groups, subjects will be stratified by  [CONTACT_716]: 
• The presence or absence of concomitant UDCA use, where no more than 50% of 
subjects recruited will be administering UDCA as part of standard of care at Day 0  
• Total bilirubin level, where no more than 25% of subjects recruited will have a total 
bilirubin >1.5x ULN and <2.5x ULN at Screening  
8.4.2. Unblinding Procedures – Emergenc y Unblinding  
For the DB phase of the trial, treatment assignment will be made available to the Investigator for 
emergency use only through the IWRS.  When possible, the M edical Monitor should be 
consulted in the event that a medical emergency necessitates unblinding (ie, in situations where 
knowledge of the blinded treatment is necessary for further medical management of the subject).  If it is not reasonable to inform the Medical Monitor in advance of unblinding, the Investigator 
must promptly document in the subject’s source record and should subsequently contact [CONTACT_22089] (such as 
accidental unblinding or unblinding due to an SAE).  Procedures for unblinding a subject’s 
treatment will b e provided separately to the I nvestigator.  Similarly, if the Medical Monitor 
breaks the blind for the purpose of evaluating an emergent safety issue, the M edical Monitor will 
document within trial documentation the rationale, circumstances, and the person or persons being informed about the unblinding. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 52 
Confidential and Proprietary    The DSMC (refer to Section 12.6.2) will have access to the IWRS and will be able to unblind 
individual subjects.  Refer to Section  12.6.2 for further details regarding DSMC access to 
blinded and unblinded data.  The DSMC will document, in the closed session DSMC minutes 
(which will be made available to the Sponsor only after the database is locked and the trial is unblinded), details about any unblinded subject data reviews.  Cases of premature unblinding 
(as noted above) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6802]. 
Access to treatment assignments will also be made available through the IWRS to the 
appropriate, named individual(s) responsible for reporting SAEs and suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the regulatory a uthorities.  
8.5. Assignment of Site and Subject Numbers  
8.5.1. Site Numbers  
Each trial site selected to participate in this trial will be assigned a Site Number by  [CONTACT_1034].  
The Site Number will be used to identify the site and or Investigator within trial documents.  
This number will also  be recorded in the CRF . 
8.5.2. Subject Numbers  
Subjects will be identified by a [ADDRESS_21131]  will be assigned the next sequentially 
available number  (eg, 001, 002, 003, etc).  
8.6. Visit Procedures  
8.6.1. Visit Windows  
All trial visits during the DB period are relative to Day 0 (eg, if the Week 6 visit occurs 4 days 
late, the Week  12 visit should still be 12 weeks from Day 0).  The Screening visit should occur 
≤30 days (ie, Day - 30 to Day -1) pri or to the Day 0 visit.  All visits during the DB treatment 
period should occur within ±1 week of the indicated time.  The exception to this is the Week 2 
visit, which should occur within ± 3 days of the indicated time.  
During the LTSE period, visits are relative to LTSE Day 1 (which is also the DB Week  24 visit) 
and all visits during th is period should occur within ±[ADDRESS_21132] which should occur within ± 3 days and the Follow-Up visit, which 
should occur within ± [ADDRESS_21133]

written information, and the informed consent form (ICF).  The subject will be given sufficient 
time to consider the trial before deciding whether or not to participate, in line with local 
requirements where applicable.  The subject will be informed that participa tion is voluntary and 
that her/his future medical treatment will not be compromised by [CONTACT_22090]/he can withdraw from the trial at any time.  The subject must be willing and able to

provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_22015]. 
At selected trial sites, subjects will have the option to consent to participate in an additional PK 
and bile acid assessment.   
As part of the consenting process, the Investigator or designee will describe the intention for and 
implications of providing blood samples for the analysis of RNA to each subject.  Subjects who 
agree to provide these samples will be required to sign a separate ICF and will be provided with 
a copy of this, in addition to the overall study ICF.  The samples will be stored for up to 1 year after the end of the study. 
8.6.3. Screening Procedures ( Within 30 Days of Day 0) 
The Screening visit assessm ents must be performed within ≤30 days (ie, Day -30 to Day -1) prior 
to Day [ADDRESS_21135] meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.   
Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria during Screening may undergo repeat Screening 
assessments (one repeat only) at any time after 30 days from their initial date of consen ting for 
the trial.  Re -screened subjects will be allocated a new screening number.   
The term “Baseline” within this protocol, unless otherwise specified, is intended to mean, 
“pretrial” or “ pretreatment” (of investigational product ).  It refers to values obtained during the 
Screening, retests, or Day [ADDRESS_21136]’s first dose of investigational product.  The 
statistical o r calculated definition(s) of “B aseline” to be used in the analyses of the data may be 
different and will be further defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for this trial.  
Screening v isit procedures are as follows:  
• The subject is to review  the PIS and sign the ICF.  Written informed consent must be 
obtained from the subject before performing any trial related procedures, including 
Screening procedures.   (Note:  Collection of AEs commences from the point the 
subject signs the consent form.) 
• Assign subject number. 
• Collect medical  history. 
• Record prior (within 30 days of Screening ) and current c oncomitant medications .

9. INVESTIGATIO NAL PRODUCT MATERIALS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
9.1. Investigational Product  
For the purpose of this protocol, the term “investigational product” describes both OCA and 
placebo tablets.  
The investigational product used for this trial will be 1.5 mg and 5 mg OCA and matching 
placebo tablets.  The 1.5 mg OCA tablet and matching placebo are white, round tablets with no markings.  The 5 mg OCA tablet and matching placebo are white, round tablet s debossed with 
“INT” on one side and “3547” on the other side.  OCA tablets contain the following inactive 
ingredients:  microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate.   
All investigational product will be provided as a tablet for oral administration  and provided in 
high density polyethylene bottles with an induction seal and child resistant c losures.  The 1.5 mg 
OCA tablet and matching placebo are smaller tablets (approximately 6 mm diameter) and will be 
provided in 40 cc bottles.  The 5 mg OCA and matching placebo (approximately 8 mm diameter) 
and will be provided in [ADDRESS_21159] will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP). 
9.2. Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling 
The packaging and labeling of investigational product supplies will be performed according to 
GMP standards by a designated qualified vendor.  A designated vendor will also be responsible 
for the distribution of the investigational product to the Investigator and, where applicable, for 
providing the Qualified Person release of the investigational product. 
Investigational product will be packaged and labeled as single bottles containing [ADDRESS_21160] bottles will be blinded.  Each bottle will be labeled with a 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21161] should be stored in the containers in which it is  received from the 
Sponsor’s supplier, at 15 °C to 25°C. 
9.4. Investigational Product Administration 
Subjects will be instructed to begin dosing on the day after the Day 0 visit (ie, on Day 1).  Investigational product administration should occur at approximately the same time of day 
throughout the duration of the trial.  Subjects must be i nstructed to swallow the indicated number 
of tablets whole with water ; they must not chew, divide, or crush the tablets.  
9.4.1. Investigational Product  Dispensation  
On Day 0, after confirmation of subject eligibility, the Investigator or designee will dispense investigational product to the subject.  Subjects will receive [ADDRESS_21162] should be instructed to take it later the same 
day, as soon as they remember.  Missed doses should not be taken on a subsequent day (ie, the 
subject should not take more than the prescribed daily dose, as directed).   
9.4.3. Overdose  
The maximum dose of OCA that has been given to humans is [ADDRESS_21163] enrolled in the trial, general medical supportive measures should be provided, including observation and follow-up (eg, serum chemistry) as appropriate.  Due to the extensive enterohepatic recirculation of OCA 
it is likely that it will take several days before blood (and organ) co ncentrations of the drug will 
decrease.  Treatment with cholestyramine ( eg, Questran™), colesevelam ( eg, Welcol™) and 
other BAS  is recommended given that they should bind and eliminate the drug in feces.  The 
Sponsor should be notified immediately in the event of a significant overdose. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21164] be stored under the appropriate storage conditions until verification of the contents is 
possible (ideally, within 1 business day from receipt).  The pharmacist or designee should verify 
the investigational product against the shipment documentation.  The pharmacist or designee should contact [CONTACT_22095].  
All investigational product will be provided for use only in this trial and is not to be used for any 
other purpose.  The Investigator or designee will maintain a full record of investigational product 
accountability, including records of individual subject dispensing, missed doses, tablets/bottles 
returned at each visit, and final return or disposition (as directed by [CONTACT_1034]).  
The trial monitor, also known as the Clinical Research Associate (CRA), will review 
accountability records against investigational product dispensed an d that remaining in stock, 
during on site monitoring visits and when the trial is completed, or if it is prematurely terminated.  The CRA will retrieve documentation detailing and confirming the return to depot 
or destruction of the investigational product by [CONTACT_21655] . 
10. ASSESSM ENTS OF EFFICACY  
10.1. Sample Collection  
Blood samples for the assessment of efficacy will be collected at visits indicated in the Schedule 
of Trial Procedu res (Table 1 and Table  2, Section  6.1).  The complete list of planned assessments 
can be found in Appendix A .   
Fasting (8 hours) blood samples are required for efficacy analyses.  For consistency, subjects will be instructed to attend each of their at- site visits in a fasted state and subjects should remain 
fasted until their blood samples have been collected.  At each visit , the Investigator or designee 
will verify that the subject has fasted for at least [ADDRESS_21165] reports having eaten (water is permitted) within [ADDRESS_21166] that fasting 
is required prior to onsite visits.  
Fecal samples will be collected in a subset of subjects for the assessment of GI inflammation, at visits indicated in the Schedule of Trial Procedures.  
Instructions concerning the number and type of samples, including the PK assessments, to be 
collected at each visit, the required sample volumes, sample collection methods, sample 
processing, labeling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22016] a trial-specific laboratory manual.  All 
necessary collection supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_22096].   
10.2. Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy assessment is serum ALP.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 74 
Confidential and Proprietary    10.3. Secondary Assessments 
Hepatic Biochemistry and Indices of Function  
Hepatic biochemistry and indices of function will be assessed by [CONTACT_22097]:  
ALP, ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, and international normalized ratio (INR) 
Hepatic and GI Inflammation, Hepatic Disease and Fibrosis 
Hepatic and GI inflammation, hepatic disease, and fibrosis will be assessed by [CONTACT_22098]:   
Autotaxin and  its metabolites, calprotectin, C -reactive protein (CRP), Cytokeratin -18 (CK-18), 
ELF markers, transient elastography (TE), Immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, Immunoglobulin M 
(IgM), Interleukin -6 (IL-6), Interleukin -12 (IL-12), Interleukin-23 (IL-23), transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF -β), tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF -α). 
The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF™) test is a blood test that measures hyaluronic acid (HA), 
procollagen-3 N-terminal peptide (P3NP), and a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), as a measure of hepatic fibrosis.  
Transient Elastography (TE) is an assessment of hepatic fibrosis using a Fibroscan
® TE device 
(Echosens, Paris, [LOCATION_009]) that measures hepatic stiffness.  It is a validated and non- invasive 
measure and will be performed at trial sites that have the equipment.  Trial sites must have staff 
trained in the use and data interpretation of the device.  
GI inflammation will be assessed by [CONTACT_22099]. 
FXR Activity  
FXR activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_22100]- 19 (FGF-19) concentrations. 
Disease-Specific Symptoms  
Disease-specific symptoms of IBD and pruritus will be assessed using the partial Mayo score (only for subjects with UC), CDAI (only for subjects with CD) and as a Pruritus VAS and 5-D 
itch questionnaire, respectively.  
IBD Symptoms  
• Partial Mayo Score  
The partial Mayo score will be performed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator at specified visits to assess 
symptoms associated  with IBD ( Rutgeerts 2005 ).  The full Mayo scoring system includes 
questions related to stool frequency and rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings, and the physician’s global assessment.  The partial score does not include an endoscopy and will be used in this trial.  
Details of the partial Mayo Ulcerative Colitis Score are shown in Appendix B . 
• CDAI 
The CDAI will be performed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator at specified visits to assess symptoms 
associated with CD (Best 1976) and will be based on the subject’s recount of their symptoms in 
addition to hematocrit and body weight measurements.  Details of the CDAI are shown in Appendix F . 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21167] visit ; and subjects with CD should complete the diary in the [ADDRESS_21168]’s medical records 
for SDV and retain th e diary cards.  Pertinent aspects of these data will be recorded in the CRF.  
Data from the Screening period diary card will be recorded at Day 0 . 
Pruritus 
In addition to the assessment of pruritus as an AE with mild, moderate and severe categories, 
pruritus will be specifically assessed by [CONTACT_22101]: 
• Pruritus VAS  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Pruritus VAS to assess any experiences of pruritus during the trial; they will be asked to initial and date to document confirmation of their responses, and 
the questionnaires should be filed in the subject’s trial records.  Details of the Pruritus VAS are shown in Appendix C . 
• 5-D Itch Questionnaire  
This is a questionnaire that has been validated in several different diseases.  It assesses symptoms in terms of 5 domains:  degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution ( Elman 2010).   
10.4. Additional Exploratory Assessments  
Gut Microbiome Genetic Profile 
The gut microbiome will be assessed from fecal samples provided by [CONTACT_22102].  
Genetics Study  
RNA expression resulting from treatment with OCA will be assessed at indicated timepoints during the trial.  Subjects will be permitted to decline to provide a blood sample for the genetics 
study, without affecting their involvement in the trial.  IRB/IEC review and approval will be required and willing subjects must specifically consent to participate in this evaluation.  The 
samples will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_21169] Research Questionnaire will be administered upon completing participation in the DB 
phase – either at the DB Week [ADDRESS_21170]’s perception of 
the trial and asks subjects if they felt that their participation in the trial was wo rthwhile and 
whether they would recommend a similar trial to a family member.   The Subject Research 
Questionnaire is included in Appendix E . 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21171] of the trial.   
OCA and its conjugates will be assessed at indicated visits and times (see Table 1 and Table 2).  
In addition, total bile acids, UDCA, OCA, CDCA, LCA, cholic acid , deoxycholic acid 
(conjugated and unconjugated forms) and C4 will also be a nalyzed. 
Following collection of the fasted laboratory samples ([ADDRESS_21172]) at Week 12 and 
Week 24 (as noted in Table  1), subjects who are pa rticipating in the PK/bile acid assessment will 
each receive a single dose of their allocated investigational product with approximately 240 mL 
of water.  At Week 12, subjects will receive their dose assigned prior to titration (ie, the lower dose of investigational product).  Serial blood samples will be obtained for measurement of OCA 
and its conjugates prior to dosing and at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and [ADDRESS_21173].  After approximately  1 hour postdose, subjects will be fed a meal replacement drink .  
As a secondary efficacy analysis, an exposure response analysis of total plasma OCA (OCA and 
its conjugates) to biomarkers, such as change in ALP and change in bile acids, will be performed 
to help identify optimal doses for this patient population. 
11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety will be monitored and assessed by [CONTACT_2695]/SAEs, medical history, physical examination, vital signs measurements, ECG results, and clinical laboratory assessments.  
11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
11.1.1. Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
Adverse events (AE) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the investigational product in humans, whether or not considered related to investigational 
product.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with any use of the investigational product, without any judgment about causality and 
irrespective of route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.   
AEs include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency 
of condition(s) present at the start of the trial; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; 
(3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21174] or asking about the 
occurrence of any specific symptom.  The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of 
the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  The diagnosis and not the individual signs/symptoms should be documented as the AE.  For example, if the underlying disease process is a str oke, it would not be appropriate to record the AE by [CONTACT_22103] “sudden numbness, dizziness, and difficulty speaking.”  The AE medical term of “stroke or cerebrovascular accident” should be recorded as it more accurately describes the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of either the I nvestigator  or Sponsor , it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• Is immediately life threatening ; 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity ; 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect; 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• Routine monitoring of the studied indication and not associated with any deterioration in condition or AE; 
• Elective treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen; 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_22017].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any event not present prior to the initiation of the investigational product or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to the investigational product. 
11.1.2. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The Investigator will document her/his opi[INVESTIGATOR_22018]  7.  An AE for which there is a 
‘reasonable possibility’ that the investigational product caused the AE is otherwise referred to as 
suspected adverse reaction (SAR).   ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE.   
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigat ional product is determined to be 
“possible”, “probable” or “definite” the event will be considered to be related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 78 
Confidential and Proprietary    Table 7: Relationship of AEs to Investigational Product 
Relationship Description  
Definite A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product  or in which the investigational product  level has been 
established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_22019] , and reappearance of the reaction 
on repeated exposure.  
Probable  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected investigational product; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_22020]; and that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state. 
Possible A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; but that could readily be produced by a number of 
other factors.  
Unlikely A reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that does not follow a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; and that could reasonably be 
explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
11.1.3. Recording Adverse Event Severity  
AEs must be graded for severity (ie, intensity).  A severity category of mild, moderate, or severe, 
as defined in  Table [ADDRESS_21175] be entered on the AE CRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” 
used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”  T he assessment of severity is 
made regardless of investigational product relationship or of the seriousness of the AE. 
Table 8: Severity of AEs  
Grade Clinical Description of Severity  
1 = Mild Causing no limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience slight 
discomfort.  
2 = Moderate Causing some limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience annoying 
discomfort.  
3 = Severe  Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the subject may experien ce 
intolerable discomfort or pain.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Pruritus (as an AE)  
Pruritus was the most common AE seen in the Phase [ADDRESS_21176] experienced within ≤3 months of 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 79 
Confidential and Proprietary    Screening , pruritus requiring systemic or enteral treatment are excluded from participating  in this 
trial.  
To ensure consistency in reporting, the following guidelines for assessing severity of pruritus 
should be used both for AE reporting and during pretreatment as sessment.  As pruritus is a 
subjective symptom, clinical judgment should be used to determine its severity and management.  
Subjects who experience a treatment emergent AE of severe pruritus should not be titrated to a 
higher dose. 
Table 9: Severity of Pruritus  
Pruritus Grade  Clinical Description of Severity for Pruritus  Titration Eligibility 
Guideline  
1 = Mild Generally localized; causing no limitation of usual activities 
or minimal sleep disturbance; the subject may  experience 
slight discomfort.  Medicinal intervention is not indicated. Yes 
2 = Moderate Intense or widespread; causing some limitation of usual activities or sleep disturbance; the subject may experience 
annoying discomfort.  Medicinal intervention may be 
indicated.  Yes; use clinical 
judgment  
3 = Severe  Intense or widespread and interfering with activities of daily 
living (ADL), ie, causing inability to carry out usual activities, or severe sleep disturbance; the subject may experience intolerable disco mfort. Medicinal intervention is typi[INVESTIGATOR_22021].  No 
In the phase 2 PBC trials, Investigators tried a number of different approaches to help relieve 
pruritus symptoms.  Severe pruritus typi[INVESTIGATOR_22022] (ie, within the first 2 weeks a fter starting therapy ).  In the 747-202 trial, about 80% of the patients who were started 
on BAS or other drugs or interventions during the trial completed the trial as planned.  In the Phase 3 trial, similar approaches were employed in addition to evaluation of lower doses:  27% of subjects in the 10 mg group added a BAS compared to 20% of subjects in the titration arm and 
11% of placebo subjects.  Consistent with the use of lower doses and pruritus mitigation 
strategies withdrawals due to pruritus were minimized ([ADDRESS_21177] in the titration arm and 7 in the 
10 mg OCA arm withdrew due to pruritus compared to none in the placebo arm ). 
Since pruritus is such a subjective symptom (and the most common symptom in PBC patients), clinical judgment needs to be applied to the management of each subject.  However, the following recommendations are made for the management of subjects experiencing significant 
pruritus in this PSC trial: 
• Prescribe BAS, eg, cholestyramine, colestipol, colestimide, or colesevelam.  The 
greatest experience to date has been with cholestyramine.  Theoretically, colesevelam 
may be more palatable (tablet) and more effective.  Patients taking BAS should be instructed to stagger their dosing of investigational product and UDCA ensuring at least [ADDRESS_21178] (and UDCA).   
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 80 
Confidential and Proprietary    • Dose frequency modification:  Less frequent dosing of investigational product (eg, on 
alternate days) may be tried, after which subjects may return to their original daily 
dose, if and as tolerated.   
• Drug holiday:  A drug holiday is defined as an I nvestigator ‘prescribed’ complete 
interruption of dosing for 1 or more consecutive days (ie, non-daily dosing does not constitute a drug holiday).  For subjects with severe pruritus, instruct the subject to 
stop taking investigational product until the pruritus subsides to an acceptable level at 
which time it should be restarted (likely, on a modified, alternate day dosing schedule).  Details of drug holidays and/or nondaily dosing regimens should be 
recorded in the CRF.  Such cases should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22023].  
11.1.4. Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE data will be collected from the time that signed informed consent is obtained until the subject 
fully completes her/his trial participation of the trial.  
All AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator  to be related or unrelated to the investigational 
product, must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
Investigator ’s normal clinical practice and on the AE CRF.   Each AE is to be evaluated for 
duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and r elationship to the 
investigational product. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the Investigator accepts all legal responsibilities for 
immediate reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor.  Immediate reporting implies  within [ADDRESS_21179] be reported to the Sponsor.  SAEs are reported by [CONTACT_22104].  Entering the SAE data into the EDC system will automatically 
notify the Sponsor of the event.  In the event that the EDC system is inaccessible, an SAE may 
reported by: 
• E-mail to the SAE email address:  [EMAIL_380]  
• Fax using a paper SAE report form:  +[PHONE_352] 
• Telephone:  + [PHONE_351] 
If an SAE is repo rted by [CONTACT_12221], an SAE Report form must also be completed in the 
EDC system as soon as the EDC system is accessible.  At a minimum, the following information 
should be provided at the time of the initial report:   
• Subject number  
• Event term  
• At least 1 criterion classifying the event as serious  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 81 
Confidential and Proprietary    • Name [CONTACT_22168]   
• Causal relationship to the investigational product 
The Investigator will assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product.  
The Sponsor, will also assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product 
in addition to assessing the overall safety profile of the investigational product.  The Sponsor will 
notify the appropriate regulatory agencies as well as all partic ipating Investigator s of 
investigational new drug (IND)  Safety Reports/Expedited S afety Reports that occur during the 
trial within the time frames required by [CONTACT_22105].  An SAE assessed with possible, 
probable, or definite causal relationship  to the investigational product and unexpected according 
to the IB Reference Safety Information (RSI), is known as a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  The Investigator must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs using the SAE reporting 
method described above. 
Following the initial report, any additional information obtained by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator about the 
SAE must be reported promptly to the Sponsor in the same manner as described above for the 
initial SAE report.  Any supporting source documentation should be faxed to +[PHONE_352] or 
emailed to [EMAIL_380] as soon as possible.   
The Investigator is responsible for submitting Safety Reports/Expedited S afety Reports received 
from the Sponsor to her/his local IRB/IEC , in compliance with  the local country requirements.  
For the European Union, the Sponsor will notify the regulatory agencies and report S[LOCATION_003]Rs via the Eudra Vigilance database within 7 calendar days of a S[LOCATION_003]R involving death or a life-
threatening S[LOCATION_003]R, and all other S[LOCATION_003]Rs within 15 calendar days.   Documentation of the 
submissions to IRBs/IEC s and health authorities (as applicable)  must be retained in the 
appropriate trial file(s).  As instructed by [CONTACT_1034], S afety Reports/Expedited S afety Reports 
should be retained in the appropr iate Investigat or site trial files, or with the IB.  
11.1.5. Anticipated Serious Adverse Events Associated with PSC  
There are a number of events which are commonly associated with PSC and for the Sponsor’s 
regulatory reporting purposes, these events are considered to be ‘Expected’ in this patient 
population and are listed in the IB.   
The Investigator remains responsible for reporting to the Sponsor all SAEs including the events 
identified here: 
• GI and hepatic malignancie s including CCA, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer  
• Ascites 
• Cholecystitis 
• Cholangitis (including bacterial cholangitis) 
• Pancreatitis  
• IBD and IBD flare  (including UC and CD)  
• Bile duct strictures (dominant or otherwise)

11.1.6. Additional Investigator Responsibilities for SAEs  
The safety data recorded in the CRF represent the official record of all AEs and SAEs reported in 
the trial.  The Investigator should comply with requests by [CONTACT_941] M edical Monitor or other Sponsor 
personnel to record the SAE on the subject’s AE CRF.  Other supporting documents such as 
radiology reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], and autopsy reports should also be provided, 
when appropriate.  Additionally, upon request by [CONTACT_1034], the Investigator should provide 
input into the SAE narrative and provide timely information to ensure prompt follow-up and 
closure of the SAE report.  
The Investigator and supporting personnel responsible for subject care should discuss with the 
Medical Monitor any need for supplemental investigations of SAEs.  The results of these 
additional assessments must be reported to the Medical Monitor.   
11.1.7. Notification of Post- Trial SAEs  
If an Investigator beco mes aware of an SAE that may be attributable to the investigational 
product at any time after the end of the trial, the Sponsor shou ld be notified immediately 
(ie, within 24 hours). 
All SAEs that occur within [ADDRESS_21180] be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours by [CONTACT_22106]  [IP_ADDRESS].

All AEs must be followed during the course of the trial until the AE resolves, is no longer of clinical concern, has stabilized or is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow up.  
AEs ongoing at the final visit that are deemed to be ‘possibly, probably, or definitely’ related or 
of other clinical significance must be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the safety of the subject or until the event stabilizes, resolves, or is no longer of clinical concern.  If resolved, a resolution date for the AE should be documented on the CRF .  The Investigator 
must ensure that follow- up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the 
nature and/or causality of the AE.  This m ay include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
or consultation with other healthcare professionals, as considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_3786]. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 83 
Confidential and Proprietary    All subjects showing possible drug-induced liver injury should be followed until all 
abnormalities return to normal or to the baseline state.  Drug -induced liver injury may develop or 
progress even after the causative drug has been stopped.  Results should be recorded in the CRF.  Note that longer follow -up can sometimes reveal an off -drug repetition of what had appeared to 
be drug-induced liver injury, indicating that liver injury was related to underlying liver disease.  
11.1.9. Pregnancy and Follow -Up  
Pregnancies are not considered SAEs in and of themselves; however if a female trial participant 
becomes pregnant while she is enrolled in the clinical trial  investigational product must be 
stopped immediately.  The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s 
awareness of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_22107] + [PHONE_352] or [EMAIL_380] .  
The subject must be followed by [CONTACT_22108].  The Investigator 
should notify the Sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_22109].  The mother (and infant) will be followed as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator  and the M edical Monitor. 
The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_22110], in advance, any subject 
whose pregnancy is early terminated and would like to continue to participate in the trial.  A minimum requirement for allowing the subject to restart dosing is documentation of a negative 
serum β-hCG test.  However, this is not in and of itself a guarantee for being allowed to continue 
in the study. 
11.2. Other Safety Parameters  
11.2.1. Medical History/Demographics  
A complete medical history will be obtained from the subject at s creening.  Demographic 
characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, etc) will be recorded , as will any historical or on 
study data on colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (mucosal and histological) within the last [ADDRESS_21181] for clinical findings, the Investigator  or designee will perform a physical 
examination at the time  points specified in the Schedule of Trial Procedures ( Table 1 and 
Table 2).  If clinically significant abnormalities are observed before administration of the first 
dose of investigational product on Day 1, they should be reported as adverse events.  If clinically 
significant abnormalities are observed after the first administration of investigational product on 
Day 1, the Investigator should assess and decide if they are new adverse events and report them accordingly.  The physical examination should include the following  at a minimum:   
• General appearance  
• Height (Screening visit only) 
• Weight 
• Skin

11.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at indicated visits: oral temperature, sitting heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_22024] (BP).  When taking heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_22025], 
subjects should be seated quietly for a minimum of [ADDRESS_21182] ID number, date and time.  
11.2.5. Laboratory Assessments  
All laboratory tests will be analyzed by a Central Laboratory (except urine or serum pregnancy 
tests).  Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed or tested, according to the SOP of 
the testing facility  and all samples will be collect ed while the subject is fasting.  Full instructions 
concerning the number, volume, and type of samples to be collected at each visit will be detailed in the trial- specific laboratory manual.  The manual will also include details of sample collection 
methods, labelling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22026]. 
Fasting (8 hours) blood samples are required for lipid, glucose (serum chemistry), and bile acid 
analyses.  For consistency, subjects will be instructed to attend each of their onsite visits (except Screening) in a fasted state and subjects should remain fasted until their blood samples have been 
collected.  At each visit the Investigator or designee will verify w hether the subject has fasted for 
at least [ADDRESS_21183] reports having

• Urine dipstick (pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood) 
All subjects with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormal values are to be 
followed regularly until the values return to normal ranges; until a valid reason, other than test-article related AE, is identified; or until further follow -up is deemed medically unnecessary.  
Urine based β-hCG pregnancy tests will be performed in female subjects of childbearing 
potential per protocol specified visits.  Additionally, in accordance with local country or site 
requirements, additional urine pregnancy tests may be performed.  If a urine pregnancy test is 
positive, a serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the result.  If positive, the 
Sponsor must be notified and the subject will be followed as outlined in Section 11.1.9 until 
pregnancy outcome.  
12. STATISTICS  
12.1. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be used: 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All randomized subjects who receive any amount of investigational product will be included in 
the ITT population.  Treatment assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.  The ITT 
population will be used for the analysis of all efficacy data.  
Week 12 Completer Population 
Completer population will include all ITT subjects who complete the DB Week 12 ALP 
assessment.  Treatment assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.     
Week 24 Completer Population Completer population will include all ITT subjects who complete the DB Week 24 ALP 
assessment.  Treatment assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.     
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21185] 9 0% 
power to detect a treatment difference for change in ALP assuming 20% dropout and the mean 
absolute changes in ALP for OCA and placebo treatment groups are approximately - 20% 
and -5%, respectively, with a pooled standard deviation of 16, based on a 2- sided independent 
2-group t-test at an alpha level of 0.05.  
12.3. Efficacy Analysis 
One of the primary objective s of this proof of concept trial is to evaluate the efficacy of OCA in 
subjects with PSC.  The primary population for efficacy analys es is the ITT population.  
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using the Completer population. 
12.3.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint i s the Week 24 change from Baseline in ALP.  Th e primary 
efficacy analysis will compare the Week 24 ch ange from Baseline in ALP between OCA 10 mg  
treatment group and placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed 
effects for treatment group and randomization strata, and Baseline as a covariate.   
12.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Secondary efficacy analyses of hepatic biochemistry and function parameters (eg, ALT, AST, 
and GGT)  will be summarized by [CONTACT_22111] -Baseline visit.  The change from Baseline will also  be summarized.  
Baseline is defined as the mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment.  Hepatic 
biochemistry and function parameters will be analyzed  using the same ANCOVA model as 
specified for the primary efficacy analysis. 
A hierarchical appr oach will be used for multiplicity adjustments.  If the primary efficacy 
analysis is statistically significant (p <0.05), the following order will be used in the testing 
procedure to compare the change from Baseline in ALP between OCA and placebo:  
• Week 12:  OCA 5 mg treatment group (randomized to 5 mg for the initial 12 weeks 
followed by 10 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo 
• Week 24:  OCA 3 mg treatment group (randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 12 weeks followed by 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo  
• Week 12:  OCA 1.5 mg treatment group (randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 
12 weeks followed by 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo 
If at any step a comparison above is not statistically significant, then all subsequent comparisons 
will be ex ploratory rather than confirmatory.   
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 87 
Confidential and Proprietary    In addition, secondary efficacy analyses of ALP response rates, defined as ALP to <1.5x ULN, 
will compare OCA treatment groups and placebo at Week [ADDRESS_21186] stratified by [CONTACT_22055].   
Hepatic stiffness measurements (based on TE) will be summarized by [CONTACT_22112] -Baseline visit.  The ELF score and its 
components (HA, P3NP, T1MP-1) and the other markers of fibrosis and/or inflammation will be 
summarized based on available data by [CONTACT_22113] -Baseline visit.  The change from Baseline will be analyzed using the 
same ANCOVA model as specified for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Subgroup analyses will be evaluated as deemed appropriate, including but not limited to, those subjects who start antibiotics after first dose of investigational product.  
Full details regardin g the planned analyses, methods, and outputs for the trial will be included in 
the SAP. 
12.4. Pharmacokinetics 
PK parameters will be determined for OCA, glyco -OCA, tauro -OCA, and total OCA (OCA plus 
conjugates).  PK parameters, including the following, will be calculated using non-compartmental methods where appropriate:  
• C
max:  maximum concentration (observed) 
• tmax:  time to C max  
• AUCt:  area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_21187] sampling time 
with measurable analyte concentration, calculated  by [CONTACT_22114]- response assessment will be made comparing endpoints such as ALP and bile acids 
(eg, change in ALP relative to baseline) to the average exposure of total OCA (eg, AUC or C ss 
[steady-state concentration]) to help define an appropriate dose of OCA in this patient 
population.   
Full details regarding the planned analyses, methods, and outputs for the trial will be detailed in 
the SAP. 
12.5. Safety Analysis  
12.5.1. Adverse Events  
A treatment emergent AE ( TEAE) is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or 
worsened in severity following initiation of investigational product.  AEs occurring between the 
signing of informed consent but prior to first dose of investigational product are considered  
pretreatment AEs.  Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], system organ 
class, and preferred  term defined using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA).  The number of events, the number of subjects, and the percent of subjects w ho 
experienced at least one TEAE will be presented for each system organ class and for each 
preferred term by [CONTACT_1570].  TEAEs that lead to early  withdrawals , serious TEAEs , and 
TEAEs by [CONTACT_22115].   Additional det ails 
will be provided in the SAP.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21188], and visit, including 
scheduled and unscheduled/repeat measurements.  Laborat ory assessments that are outside of 
normal ranges will be flagged.  Baseline values, the values at each visit, and changes from 
Baseline values will be summarized for each of the quantitative laboratory assessments by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Baseline is defined as the mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment 
(except for lipoprotein assessments where Baseline will be the fasted Day 0 assessment).    
12.5.3. Additional Safety Analysis  
Additional safety assessments include vital signs and ECGs.  V ital signs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_22113] -Baseline visit.  
The change from Baseline will also be summarized.  ECGs will be summarized by [CONTACT_22116].  The shift fr om baseline will also be summarized.   Baseline 
is defined as the mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment.    
12.6. Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
12.6.1. Interim Analysis  
An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 50% of subjec ts have 
completed the initial 12 -weeks of blinded treatment.  The trial will not be terminated early for 
futility.  The interim analysis will compare at Week 12, the same variable as will be analyzed for the primary endpoint, the change from Baseline in ALP, between OCA treatment groups (1.5 mg 
and 5 mg) and placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for 
treatment group and randomization strata and Baseline as a covariate.  No adjustments to the alpha level will be made.  
In addition, once all subjects have completed the DB phase of the study, the DB database will be locked, unblinded, and full analyses will be performed.  The specific details of both the interim and end of double-blind analyses will be documented in the SAP. 
12.6.2. Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
An independent DSMC will review safety data from this trial, as well as other ongoing OCA 
trials at approximately quarterly intervals, but at least every 6 months.  The DSMC includes internationally recognized hepatologis ts, pharmaceutical physicians and statistician(s).  All have 
considerable experience with clinical trial conduct and DSMCs, prior to joining the OCA DSMC.  Candidates are screened for conflicts of interest and any candidate found to have such a conflict is not offered membership.  Conflicts of interest are assessed regularly, and if members 
are found to have a new conflict of interest they w ill be replaced.  The DSMC meets 
approximately quarterly at scheduled meetings and ad hoc meetings are convened, as 
appropriate.  The DSMC reviews all Intercept -sponsored Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Members of the 
DSMC will no t be allowed to participate as Investigator s in this trial and will not otherwise 
consult for the Sponsor.   
SAE information will be provided to the DSMC on an ongoing basis as SAEs occur.  Adhoc 
(closed) DSMC meetings for review of unblinded data from subjects who experience SAEs, as 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 89 
Confidential and Proprietary    requested by [CONTACT_22117], will be arranged.  The DSMC will review data on a periodic basis to 
ensure the safe and proper treatment of subjects.  Based on review of these data, the DSMC will 
advise the Sponsor on the validity and scientific merit of continuing the trial.   
The DSMC  operates under an appropriate charter (in compliance with relevant regulatory 
guidance) that defines its organization and operation and includes specific procedures for each 
trial.  The DSMC will prepare written minutes of both its open and closed sessions for each trial.  
The closed minutes will be made available to the Sponsor only after the database is locked.  
Data listings provided to the DSMC do not contain individual patient treatment information; 
however, the DSMC will have access to the database an d may unblind individual subject  data as 
appropriate.  Summary tables reviewed by [CONTACT_22118] “dummy” labels, ie, the actual treatment groups are used, but are not identified. Data 
reviewed during the meetings will include, at a minimum, disposition, demographics, exposure, 
clinical laboratory results, MedDRA coded AE s, and AEs leading to early withdrawal of study 
drug.  At ea ch meeting, detailed narratives of interval SAEs (including events resulting in death) 
are reviewed by [CONTACT_22119] a cumulative list of all SAEs. 
The DSMC may request additional analyses if deemed necessary to fulfill the mission of the 
DSMC.  The DSMC will determine if an unscheduled meeting is necessary based on the 
additional data.  At a minimum , the occurrence of 2 life threatening SAEs or an SAE resulting in 
death will trigger an unscheduled and unblinded review of the data by [CONTACT_6802]. 
All Investigator s and responsible IRB s/IECs will be informed of any decisions made by [CONTACT_22120], which alter the 
conduct of this trial.  The Investigator s will inform the subjects of such actions and the protocol, 
PIS and consent will be revised, as appropriate.  
13. DIRECT ACCESS TO S OURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
13.1. Trial Monitoring  
Trial records at each site will be monitored at regular intervals by a representative of the Sponsor, the CRA.  The role of the CRA is to aid the Investigator in the maintenance and documentation of complete, accurate, legible, well organized, and easily retrievable data.  In 
addition, the CRA will ensure the Investigator 's understanding of all applicable regulations 
concerning the clinical evaluation of the investigational product and will ensure an understanding 
of the protocol, reporting responsibilities and the validity of the data.  This will include ensuring 
that full and appropriate essential documentation is available.  
In order to perform this role, the CRA must perform source data verification and as such must be 
given access to the subject’s primary source documentation (eg, paper or electronic medical records such as consent to participate in the trial, visit dates, scr eening and randomization 
numbers, demographic information, medical history, disease history, physical examination, vital 
signs, laboratory assessments [copy of laboratory reports], AEs, concomitant medications, dates 
of dispensing investigational product, ECGs, etc) that support data entries in the CRF.  The CRF  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21189] be completed promptly after each visit to allow the progress and results of the trial to be 
closely followed by [CONTACT_941] M edical Monitor. 
13.2. Investigator Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator should understand that it may be necessary for the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC,  and/or 
a regulatory agency to conduct one or more site audits during or after the trial and agrees to 
allow access to all trial related documentation and information and be available for discussion 
about the trial.   
14. QUALITY C ONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Logic and consistency checks will be performed on all data entered into the CRF  or ultimately 
transferred into the database to ensure accuracy and completeness.   
Training sessions, r egular monitoring of the trial at the trial site by [CONTACT_22121] (eg, CRA), instruction manuals, data verification, cross checking, and data audits will be performed to ensure quality of all trial data.  Investigators’ meetings and/or onsite trial initiations will be performed to prepare I nvestigator s and other trial site personnel for appropriate 
collection of trial data.  
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor may conduct a quality assurance audit.  Please see Section 13.[ADDRESS_21190] be approved or given a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_22027] I RB/ IEC as 
appropriate.  The Investigator must submit written IRB/IEC approval to Intercept before he or 
she can enroll an y subject into the trial.  The Investigator is responsible for providing the IB and 
any other available safety information and information about payments and compensation 
available to trial subjects to the ethics committee for review.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB /IEC of any amendment to the protocol in 
accordance with local requirements.  A favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_22028], unless the amendment is necessary to reduce immediate risk to 
trial participants.  In addition, the IRB / IEC must approve all advertising used to recruit subjects 
for the trial.  The protocol must be reapproved by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC upon receipt of amendments and 
annually, as local regulations require.  
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any SARs  any other 
trial conducted with the investigational product .  The Sponsor will provide this information to 
the Investigator. 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 91 
Confidential and Proprietary    Progress reports and notifications of SARs will be provided to the IRB/IEC according to local 
regulations and guidelines.  Investigators or the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports to 
the IRB/IEC as requested, as a minimum annually, and after the trial is complete.  
15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial  
The trial will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013) and are 
consistent with ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements. 
15.3. Written Informed Consent 
The Investigator (s) at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and 
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and benefit of the trial.  Subjects 
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the trial at any time.  The subject 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided. 
The subject’s signed and dated  ICF must be obtained before conducting any trial procedures. 
The Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF.  A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the subject.  
15.4. Subject Confidentiality and Data Protection  
All information obtained during the conduct of the trial with respect to the subject will be 
regarded as confidential and confidentiality of all subjects will be maintained.  Monitors 
(eg, CRA, Medical Monitor), auditors, and inspectors will require access to a subject’s medical 
notes for the purpose of source document verification, but the subject’s confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  An agreement for disclosure of any such information will be obtained in writing and is included in the statement of informed consent.  The trial data shall not be disclosed 
to a third party (with the exception of auditors and/or regulatory authorities) without the written 
consent of the Sponsor .  All data shall be secured against unauthorized access.  
The Investigator will maintain a list of subjects ’ names and identifying information (eg, subject’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965], unique subject number).  This list will not be collected by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The written information sheet will explain that trial data will be stored in a computer database, 
maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national da ta protection legislation.  All data 
computer processed by [CONTACT_22122]/randomization code/subject initials/site number, only.   
When personal data on subjects are stored or processed by [CONTACT_22123], the data must be protected 
to prevent their disclosure to unauthorized third parties.  The pertinent sections of the data 
protection laws in which the country is being conducted will be complied with in full. 
The written PIS will explain that, for data verific ation purposes, authorized representatives of the 
Sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC  may require direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22029], including subject’s medical history.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21191] instructions for the trial 
site staff and a telephone number where he or she can be reached.  
Named physician(s) will be responsible for the medical follow -up of subjects, as applicable.  
16.1. AE Reporting  
The Investigator is responsible for recording AEs reported by [CONTACT_22124].  In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the I nvestigator 
accepts all legal responsibilities for immediate reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor. 
16.2. Protocol Deviations 
The Investigator is not permitted to deviate from the protocol in any significant way without 
proper notification to the Sponsor (or designee).  Only the Sponsor may amend the protocol.  
Any change in trial conduct consider ed necessary by [CONTACT_22125], who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change and obtain regulatory approval.  The only exception is when the Investigator considers a subject ’s safety to be compromised if immediate action is not taken. 
16.3. Regulatory Documentation  
The following regulatory documentation must be completed or provided and maintained: 
• Approved PIS and ICF (all versions)  
• IRB/IEC approvals (of protocol/amendments, subje ct questionnaires, etc)  
• Form FDA 1572  
• Current medical license  (US) 
• Curriculum vitae  
• Laboratory certification and reference ranges  
• Financial disclosure forms 
16.4. Ethics Review  
Please see Section 15.1 for th e Investigator ’s responsibilities regarding ethics review.  
16.5. Archiving and Record Retention  
The Investigator should retain all correspondence relating to this trial in the Investigator Site File 
(ISF).  Any trial documents stored elsewhere should have their location referenced in the ISF. 
All Sponsor-specific essential documents relating to the trial, including the ISF itself, source 
documents and subject medical files (retained per country specific regulations), completed trial subject log, and confidential subject identificatio n list will be retained by [CONTACT_22126] 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21192].  These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed by [CONTACT_1034].  In the event that storage of records becomes a problem at any time during this period, the Sponsor should be consulted for 
assistance.   At the end of the minimum period, the Investigator should obtain written 
authorization from the Sponsor prior to the destruction of any records.  The Investigator will 
notify the Sponsor if ownership of documents or responsibility for the trial site is transferred.   The Sponsor will inform Investigators should it become aware of any changes in 
storage requirements.  
17. PUBLICATION POLICY 
The Sponsor intends to p ublish the results of all of the clinical trials that it sponsors consistent 
with the Declaration of Helsinki (64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, 
October 2013). Consistent with the recommendations of the editors of several leading medical journals, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), authorship of 
publications resulting from Intercept sponsored studies should fairly recognize the activities of 
those that have made a significant contribution to the trial 
(http://www.icm je.org/ethical_1author.html, accessed May 22, 2013).  Thus, it is anticipated that 
authorship will reflect the contribution made  by [CONTACT_22127], the Investigators, and 
others involved, such as statisticians.   
In recent years, issues about confli cts of interest and accuracy of the trial data have been raised in 
the medical press.  Accordingly, the Sponsor has developed publication guidelines for clinical 
trials that are appropriate for this trial.  Key issues include the following:  
• Clinical Trial Registries (eg, clinicaltrials.gov):  A description of the trial and relevant design elements (eg, basic design, objectives and endpoints, sample size, trial population, and key inclusion/exclusion criteria) and results (when available) will be 
published o nline in a manner consistent with applicable regulatory guidelines.  
• Overview:  Investigator s, reviewers, and editors will have the right to audit the data to 
verify its accuracy.  
• Responsibility:  Each I nvestigator  is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of 
all data from her/his site.  The Sponsor (or its representatives) is responsible for the 
accuracy of the data entered into the trial databases and the analyses conducted.  
• Data Management:  The Sponsor will establ ish data management and the SAP.  The 
Investigators will have the opportunity to provide input into the plans.  The 
Investigators will have the right to review the audit reports and data resolution 
decisions prior to the establishment of a clean file.  The Investigator s will have the 
right to appoint appropriately qualified auditors, with GCP experience, to audit the 
Sponsor’s data prior to the establishment of a clean file.  The Investigator s must 
provide adequate notice (at least 2 months) to the Sponsor of their intention to audit a trial.  The audit should be conducted in a timely manner to allow the resolution of discrepancies before a clean file is established.  The Investigator s will bear all the 
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21193] be conducted in such a 
manner as to minimize the time to create the clean file.  
• Authorship:  Interc ept, in collaboration with the Investigator s, will establish the 
appropriate authorship and responsibility for drafting trial documents in accordance with the principles of the ICMJE.  All manuscripts will be reviewed and agreed upon 
before submission for publication by [CONTACT_15064].   
• Single Center Publication and Additional Publications:  This is a multicenter trial and 
is designed to be published with complete data from all the trial sites.  Single center 
publications are therefore not considered appropriate.  Any such publications should clearly state that the data are ‘extracted’ from a multicenter trial and that the trial was 
not intended, or statistically powered, for data presentation by a single trial site.   
• Intercept Review of External Manuscripts:  Consistent with this, Investigator s must 
submit any draf ts of any publications or presentations that may arise from this trial to 
the Sponsor for review and approval and to ensure consistency with the policy in this protocol at least [ADDRESS_21194] facts and to 
represent its, or the Publication Committee’s, opi[INVESTIGATOR_22030].  
• Confidentiality:  Investigator s will conduct all interactions with the compan y and 
with third parties consistent with the executed confidentiality agreements.  While publication, by [CONTACT_7586], presents the critical scientific data in a public forum, some information (such as future plans, results of nonclinical studies or chemical formulae)

Synopsis, 
Statistical Methods: Efficacy Analyses The co-primary efficacy endpoints are the absolute 
changes from Baseline in ALP at Week 12 and 
Week 24.  The primary efficacy analysis at Week 12 will 
compare the absolute change from Baseline in ALP 
between OCA treatment groups ( 1.5 mg and 5 mg) and 
placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for treatment group and randomization strata and Baseline as a covariate.  The primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 will compare the absolute change from Baseline in ALP between OCA treatment groups (3 mg and 10 mg) and placebo using the same ANCOVA model as the Week 12 analysis.   
 
The co-primary endpoints will be tested using a 
hierarchical approach to control the overall 
significance level for multiple visit and dose comparisons.  
  
Secondary efficacy analyses of hepatic biochemistry 
and function parameters will use the same ANCOVA 
models as the primary endpoints.  
  
In addition, secondary efficacy analysis  of ALP response 
rates, defined as ALP to < 1.5x ULN, will compare OCA The primary efficacy endpoint is the Week 24 change 
from Baseline in ALP .  The primar y efficacy analysis 
will compare the Week 24 change from Baseline in 
ALP between the OCA 10 mg treatment group  and 
placebo using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with fixed effects for treatment group and 
randomization strata and Baseline as a covariate.  
Secondary efficacy analyses of hepatic biochemistry 
and function parameters will use the same ANCOVA 
models as the primary endpoints.  A hierarchical 
approach will be used for multiplicity adjustments.  If 
the primary efficacy analysis is statistica lly significant 
(p <0.05), the following order will be used in the testing 
procedure to compare the change from Baseline in ALP between OCA and placebo:  
• Week 12:  OCA 5 mg treatment group 
(randomized to 5 mg for the initial 12 weeks followed by 10 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. 
placebo 
• Week 24:  OCA 3 mg treatment group 
(randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 12 weeks followed by 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. placebo  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   [ADDRESS_21202] stratified by [CONTACT_22130].  Missing values are 
considered a non- response. • Week 12:   OCA 1.5 mg treatment group 
(randomized to 1.5 mg for the initial 12 weeks 
followed b y 3 mg for the latter 12 weeks) vs. 
placebo 
If at any step the  comparison is not statistically 
significant, then all subsequent comparisons will be 
exploratory rather than confirmatory.   
In addition, secondary efficacy analyses of ALP resp onse 
rates, defined as ALP to <1.5x ULN, will compare OCA 
treatment groups vs. placebo at Week [ADDRESS_21203] stratified by [CONTACT_22130].  Missing values will 
be considered a non- response.  
An unblinded interim analysis for planning purposes will be conducted after approximately 50% of patients 
have completed the initial 12 -weeks of blinded 
treatment.  The trial will not be terminated early for 
futility.  The interim analysis will compare at Week 12, 
the same variable as will be analyzed for the primary 
endpoint, the change from Baseline in ALP, between OCA treatment groups (1.5 mg and 5 mg) and placebo 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
fixed effects for treatment group and randomization strata and Baseline as a covariate.  No adjustments to 
the alpha level will be made.

intervention to relieve biliary obstruction acute cholangitis may occur with typi[INVESTIGATOR_22035], right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice (also known as the Charcot triad).  Further confirmation of the 
diagnosis should then be made via 
laboratory data (eg, elevated C- reactive 
protein levels and/or leukocytosis) and abdominal imaging tests (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; MRCP).   
• Treatment of acute cholangitis should be 
directed towards treatment of the biliary 
infection and relieving obstruction.  
Therefore, treatment is comprised of systemic antibiotic therapy and biliary drainage procedures, with appropriate supportive care.  
• Antibiotic agents should be administered

Synopsis, Long-
Term Safety Extension Phase (LTSE) Following completion of participation in the DB  
phase, subjects will continue in the study in the  open-
label long- term safety extension ( LTSE) phase for a 
further [ADDRESS_21239]’s completion of the DB phase, the 
trial blind will be  broken in order to assign the 
starting OCA dose for the LTSE phase.  It is intended 
that subjects will commence treatment at [ADDRESS_21240] to be titrated in line with the below 
schedule, this should be discussed with the medical 
monitor  
• Placebo at end of DB   5 mg OCA in 
LTSE 
• 3 mg OCA at end of DB  5 mg OCA in 
LTSE 
• 10 mg OCA at end of DB   10 mg OCA 
in LTSE 
Those subjects who did not up- titrate their dose at 
Week 12 in the DB phase can remain on their DB 
dose, or commence at 5 mg at the decision of the 
investigator based on safety and tolerab ility of the 
DB dose at Week 24 . Following completion of participation in the DB  
phase, subjects will be asked to reconfirm their 
consent for participation  in the open-label long-
term safety extension ( LTSE) phase ( a further 
24 months ).   
Upon a subject’s completion of the DB phase, the 
trial blind will be broken in order to assign the 
starting OCA dose for the LTSE phase.  It is intended that subjects will commence treatment at 5  mg OCA, 
except those subjects who completed treatment in the DB phase with 10 mg OCA who will continue at 10 mg OCA unless safety and tolerability warrant a 
dose reduction to 5 mg. 
• Placebo at end of DB   5 mg OCA in 
LTSE 
• 3 mg OCA at end of DB  5 mg OCA in 
LTSE 
• 10 mg OCA at end of DB   [ADDRESS_21241] to be titrated in line with the above schedules, this may be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
Protocol 747-207 Version 5:   18 Mar 2016 
 Page 143 
Confidential and Proprietary    Section Original Text Revised Text  
During the LTSE phase, subjects may titrate to higher  
doses of OCA, at  a frequency not greater than 
3 monthly (ie, at each of the scheduled LTSE visits), 
up to a maximum dose of 10 mg daily.  The guideline 
for an increase i n the dose of OCA is based on 
tolerability and the goal of achieving an ALP level 
<1.5x the ULN.  Doses of OCA should be titrated as 
follows, unless clinically indicated:  1.[ADDRESS_21242] to a prior dose or 
dosing frequency and this should be discussed with 
the Intercept medical monitor in advance. 
A few Sponsor representatives may be unblinded 
during the trial.  If there are any findings regarding

Nonclinical Effects on Cholestasis The results of trials performed in rodent models of 
cholestasis involving the administration of chemical 
agents that severely injure bile ducts (such as carbon 
tetrachloride [CCl
4] or lithocholic acid [LCA]) 
provide evidence that OCA is effective in preventing 
or reducing chol estasis in vivo.  In the LCA model, 
co-infusion of OCA fully reversed the impairment of 
bile flow and protected against liver cell injury (Pellicciari  2002, Vairappan 2009
). 
Results of other trials  have demonstrated that OCA 
significantly reduces fibrotic collagen synthesis in 
vitro and in various rodent models of chronic liver 
injury that involve fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis, 
consistent with the progression of PSC (Albanis 2005, Vairappan 2009

Section 5.4 Clinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid  To date, OCA has been evaluated in the clinic in a 
total of 17 completed and ongoing trials , including 
patients with PBC and  other chronic liver diseases 
(eg, portal hypertension and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [ NASH]) and healthy volunteers.  
Additional trials are also planned to further

in clinical trials with OCA in other indications  and in

higher (primarily 20 to 50  mg daily) than those 
studied in this protocol (1.5 m g, 3 mg, 5 mg, and 
10 mg) doses.  This is an important potential risk in 
subjects with PSC, where there is the possibility of 
dominant strictures of intra - and extra -hepatic bile 
ducts that could restrict bile flow.  In order to monitor 
bile duct patency, the trial protocol requires that sites 
perform an ultrasound at the end of the DB phase and thereafter annually in the LTSE.  Consistent with this 
potential risk, the present trial excludes subjects who have had, or who are suspected of having, a recent dominant stricture (Section  8.3).  In addition, the trial 
calls for mandatory discontinuation of investigational 
product (IP) in those subjects whose liver chemistry

Unblinding  
For the DB phase of the trial, treatment 
assignment will be made available to the Investigator for emergency use only through the 
IWRS.  When possible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted in the event that a medical emergency necessitates unblinding (i e, in 
situations where knowledge of the blinded treatment is necessary for further medical management of the subject).  If it is not reasonable 
to inform the Medical Monitor in advance of unblinding, the Investigator must promptly 
document in the subject’s  source record and 
should subsequently contact [CONTACT_22147] (such as accidental unblinding or 
unblinding due to an SAE).  Procedures for 
unblinding a subject’s treatment will be provided separately to the Investigator.  Similarly, if the 
Medical Monitor breaks the blind for the purpose 
of evaluating an emergent safety issue, the Medical Monitor will document within trial 
documentation the rationale, circumstances, and

the person or persons b eing informed about the 
unblinding.  
The DSMC (refer to Section 13.6.2) will have 
access to the IWRS and will be able to unblind 
individual subjects.  Refer to Section  13.6.2 for 
further details regarding DSMC access to blinded 
and unblinded data.  The DSMC  will document, in 
the closed session DSMC minutes (which will be 
made available to the Sponsor only after the 
database is locked and the trial is unblinded), 
details about any unblinded subject data reviews.  Cases of premature unblinding (as noted above)  
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6802].  
Access to treatment assignments will also be made available through the IWRS to the appropriate, 
named individual(s) responsible for reporting 
SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the regulatory authorities.

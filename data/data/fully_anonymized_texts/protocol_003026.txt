Protocol #:  15-[ADDRESS_1099401] Title:  The effects of a preoperative exercise intervention during neoadjuvant 
therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer     
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_796996] , PhD  
Version Date:  7-20-16       
 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:   
 
The long -term goal of this investigation is to improve the health status of patients with pancreatic 
and other advanced cancers. The first specific aim will examine the feasibility of implementing a 
preoperative exercise intervention in patients with pancr eatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant 
treatment. Two additional specific aims will test the novel hypothesis that preoperative exercise 
during neoadjuvant treatment will maintain or improve physical fitness and function, and improve 
postoperative outcomes, w ith potential mediation by [CONTACT_797021].  
 
AIM 1 : To investigate the feasibility of providing a preoperative exercise intervention during 
neoadjuvant therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.  
Objective : Assess the accrual rate of patients able and willing to participate in a 
preoperative exercise program, as well as the adherence of enrolled patients to the 
preoperative exercise program. Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_105] -serious and serious 
advers e event rate and type.  
AIM 2 : To investigate the effects of preoperative exercise during neoadjuvant therapy on physical  
fitness and function, as well as postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796997].  
Hypothesis 1: Preoperative exercise will result  in improved or maintained physical  fitness 
and function, during and after treatment, compared to a non- exercising control group 
(standard care).  
Hypothesis 2: Preoperative exercise will result in reduced postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796998] e of readmission compared to standard care.  
Exploratory AIM : To investigate how subjective and objective measures of psychological stress and 
systemic inflammatory markers change in response to preoperative exercise during neoadjuvant 
therapy and to determ ine relationships to postoperative outcomes.  
Hypothesis 1: Measures of psychological stress and systemic inflammatory markers will 
decrease in response to preoperative exercise compared to standard care.  
Hypothesis 2: Preoperative measures of psychological  stress and systemic inflammatory 
markers will be positively correlated with postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796999].  
 
II. Background and Significance :  
 
The Problem: Interventions to improve health status in patients with pancreatic cancer are 
understudied. Health, as defined by [CONTACT_38375], is “ a complete state of physical, 
mental, and social well -being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”  Pancreatic 
cancer is often diagnos ed at an advanced stage, which has resulted in a 5- year survival rate of less 
than 5%1. As such, most research has focused on the disease and curative components of 
treatment, and not the overall health status of the individual. Investigations of exercise in cancer 
survivors, an intervention able to address and improve most aspects of health, have specifically 
focused on cancer populations with high survival rates2. Furthermore, advances in the medical 
treatment of pancreatic cancer have increased 5 -year survival rate to 10- 30% in patients who 
Protocol Template Page 2  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 receive surgery3, making this a growing clinical population in which interventions to im prove health 
status are understudied.  
 
The Population: Patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.  Pancreatic 
cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer -related death in the [LOCATION_002], resulting in an 
estimated 37,390 deaths in [ZIP_CODE]. Neoadjuvant therapy (preoperative chemotherapy and radiation) 
is often prescribed to a subgroup of patients to improve their response to surgery, the best known 
treatment for the disease. This therapy, however, can reduce physical fitness  and function, 
decreasing the health status of the patient during and after treatment. Reduced preoperative 
cardiopulmonary fitness may also lead to increased postoperative complications5, resulting in 
further decreases in health status.  
 
The Intervention: A preoperative exercise program during neoadjuvant treatment, which can 
improve patient health status during and after treatment.  Preoperative exercise has been shown to 
be safe and effective at improving physical fitness and function, vital components of overall health, 
in patients with other cancer diagnoses undergoing neoadjuvant therapy6, but has not been 
investigated in patients with pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a gap i n the research exists surrounding 
interventions to improve health status in the growing clinical population of pancreatic cancer survivors. The preoperative neoadjuvant treatment period allows implementation of an exercise 
program likely to maintain or improve cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength, improving postoperative outcomes and health status, and improved physical function has also been 
associated with decreases in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796997]
7. Beneficial effects of 
preoperative exercise may be mediated by [CONTACT_797022] . Both increased psychological stress and systemic inflammatory markers 
have been associated with accelerated disease progression and worsening health status8,9. Both 
are beneficially affected by [CONTACT_14759]9,10, possibly contributing to the overall effects of the exercise 
intervention. Regar dless of effects on disease progression, the beneficial psychological effects of 
exercise11 can contribute to improved health status . 
 
Preoperative exercise is a safe intervention in patients with advanced cancer . Exercise programs, 
both pre and postoperative, have been safely implemented in a wide variety of cancer survivors, 
with few to no adverse events reported12. Although no studies of preoperative exercise programs 
for patients with pancreatic cancer have been published,  postoperative exercise programs in this 
population have reported no adverse events10,13. A survey of colorectal surgeons agreed that 
suitable preoperative exercise programs pose no risk to elderly colorectal cancer patients14, and a 
systematic review of exercise during neoadjuvant treatment stated that preoperative exercise was a safe and feasible intervention
6. 
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
No preliminary studies have been carried out  examining preoperative exercise in patients with 
pancreatic cancer. The preoperative exercise intervention, however,  will be administered through 
the BFitBWell Cancer and Exercise Program at the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center. This 
program has successfully provided individualized exercise interventions to over [ADDRESS_1099402] -program measures of physical fi tness were collected in two of these 
patients, both showing improvement. Measures of strength and physical function improved in the 
majority of patients and 4 of 6 patients reported measurable decreases in fatigue.  
 
Protocol Template Page 3  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Based on discussions with physicians at the University of Colorado  Cancer Center, approximately 
100 patients are diagnosed and treated there each year who would be potential participants in the 
proposed study.  
 
IV. Research  Methods  
 
A. Outcome  Measure (s):   
 
Physical fitness and function outcomes:   
The primary outcome of physical fitness and function will be the 400-meter walk time,  which  is 
a validated measure of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_797000]. The test assesses the time it 
takes a participant to independently walk [ADDRESS_1099403] was developed to assess 
functional walking and exercise capacity in older adults, as distance was found to be more motivating than time (compared to the [ADDRESS_1099404]). This test has been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and functional limitations
16, and has been used to 
assess functional walking and exercise capacity in cancer populations17. 
 
Secondary measures of physical fitness and function include:  
 Lean muscle mass and body composition . This will be assessed utilizing a dual -energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (D XA) scan. This is the gold standard measure of body composition and 
commonly used in studies of exercise interventions in cancer survivors
18. The potential 
preservation of lean muscle is an important assessment in this population as improved muscle quantity and quality has been associated with improved postoperative outcomes in patients 
with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery
19. 
 
Gait speed is an easily implemented measure linked to a variety of functional outcomes in 
multiple populations20. It will be measured during the middle [ADDRESS_1099405] trial recorded, according to NIH guidelines21. 
 
The Timed Up and Go (TUG) times participants as they rise from a chair, walk [ADDRESS_1099406] (SCT)  records the time taken to ascend and descend a single flight of 
stairs. It correlates with the TUG25, but as a higher level task, reduces possibilities of a ceiling 
effect during data processing and has been utilized in previous studies of cancer survivors18. 
One trial is performed.  
 
The Single Limb Stance (SLS)  test records how long participants can balance on one leg, with 
a cap at [ADDRESS_1099407] time recorded. This is a valid and reliable measure of balance and postural stability
26. 
 
The 30 sec Sit -to-Stand  (30StS)  test is associated with strength and functi on of the lower 
extremities  and records the number of times participants can go from a seated position to a 
standing position in [ADDRESS_1099408] that has been used previously to 
assess strength and function in cancer survivors18. 
 
Grip strength will be assessed on both the dominant and non- dominant hands using grip 
dynamometry. This is a valid and reliable measure28 that has been associated with physical 
function, health, gross strength, and survival in cancer survivors29.  
Protocol Template Page 4  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Average daily step count  (ADSC)  will be assessed using pedometers . Pedometers  will be 
given to participants for [ADDRESS_1099409] any periods of time that the pedometer was not w orn. ADSC  will be assessed as 
average step count per day worn.  
 
Postoperative outcomes:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797001].  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797002] a patient is rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_797003] a surgical complication within [ADDRESS_1099410] of inpatient physical activity 
and basic mobility30. 
 
Questionnaire/Psychological Outcomes  Assessment : 
 
Fatigue will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue 
scale (FACIT -Fatigue), a validate measure of fatigue in cancer survivors31. 
 Health -related Quality of Life (HRQOL)  will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy -General form (FACT -G)
32. This form provides information on the physical, 
social, emotional, and functional well -being of patients with cancer . 
 
Subjective psychological stress will be assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)33, 
which assesses perceived stress  based on individual and environmental stressful events, 
focusing on experiences in the last month.  Depression will be assessed using the Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D)34. 
 Prior physical activity level  will be assessed with the Godin Physical Activity Questionnaire. 
This measure is a self -report estimate of leisure physical activity for the prior month. Prior 
physical activity level will be compared between groups and cons idered as a potential factor to 
control for in statistical analyses.  This will only be collected at the first assessment.  
 
Objective Stress Assessment:  
 
Heart rate variability  (HRV) will be used as an objective measure of stress, both physiologic 
and psychological. HRV will be assessed in four different conditions. Electrocardiography 
(ECG) will be recorded during a 10 minute baseline period (seated), a 5 minute orthostatic 
challenge (sit-to-stand), a 5 minute cognitive dissonance period (standard Stroop Task), and a 
5 minute cancer -salient dissonance period (cancer -related Stroop Task)35. The standard 
Stroop Task involves naming the color a word is printed in. The words are usually a color word (e.g. “Red”, “Blue”) and sometimes do not match the color the word is printed in. The cancer -
related Stroop Task also requires participants to name [CONTACT_242600] a word is printed in, except 
words will either be neutral words or words related to cancer (e.g. “Malignancy” , “Chemo” ). 
Participants will be told prior to performing either task that the tasks are designed t o be 
challenging and possibly evoke emotion. The standard Stroop and cancer -related Stroop will 
be performed in a random order between participants, but kept constant across Visits within 
participants , and separated by a [ADDRESS_1099411] period.  Both time and fr equency domain HRV 
measures will be calculated from the ECG signal for each period offline, quantifying overall autonomic tone (assessed by [CONTACT_797023]) , 
parasympathetic tone (the high frequency component of HRV) , and changes fr om baseline for 
each condition.

CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
  
Biomarker Assessment:  
 
Systemic markers of inflammatory status  will be assessed by [CONTACT_797024]-inflammatory 
cytokines:  serum C -reactive protein, associated with postoperative outcomes in patients with 
panc reatic cancer36, interluekin -6, potentially involved in the development and progression of 
cachexia37, and soluble tumor -necrosis factor receptor 1, a possible indicator of exercise -
induced changes in systemic inflammatory status38, and an anti -inflammatory cytokine, 
interleukin -10, involved in exercise -induced pathways39. Blood samples will be drawn at the 
same time as other blood draw s performed as part of standard care  at the University of 
Colorado Cancer Center , to reduce patient burden. If these routine blood draws do not occur 
within a one week window of the assessment, blood draws will be performed at the Clinical and 
Translational Research Center on the Anschutz Medical Campus , where all sample analyses 
will be performed.  
 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled 
 
The potential participant population will be individuals who receive a diagnosis of borderline -
resectable pancreatic cancer  (adenocarcinoma) , being treated at the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797004].  These inclusion and exclusion criteria will apply to participants in both groups.  
 
Inclusion Criteria: Recent (< 4 week ) first diagnosis of a borderline- resectable pancreatic  
adenocarcinoma, assigned  to receive neoadjuvant therapy  and surgery  at University of 
Colorado  Cancer Center,  physician clearance to participate in exercise program , and age 21 -
80 years .  
 
Exclusion Criteria: Any significant comorbid conditions that would interfere with or preclude 
participation in an exercise intervention, including orthopedic conditions such as advanced osteoarthritis, mobility -limiting amputations or chronic injuries, or mobility -limiting acute 
orthopedic injuries;  advanced rheumatoid arthritis; widespread chronic pain conditions such as 
fibromyalgia; pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease,  
emphysema, interstitial lung disease, use of supplemental oxygen; known cardiovascular 
disease,  uncontrolled hy pertension, or new cardiac event within the past 6 months . Participants 
with a second cancer diagnosis at the time of enrollment will be excluded.  
 
Sample size estimation: No studies have previously investigated the effects of preoperative 
exercise in pati ents with pancreatic cancer. In patients with lung cancer, a preoperative 
exercise program reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797005] 4 days compared to usual care
40. Based 
on this difference, with a SD of 3, 12 participants would be required in each the experimental and control groups  (α = 0.05, β = 0.90
41). To account for overall attrition, groups will be 
increased by 3 participants each, based on a study of preoperative exercise after neoadjuvant 
treatment in patients with rec tal cancer showing an overall attrition of 28%42. A total of 30 
participants (15  per group) will be recruited for this study.  
 
C. Study Design and Research Methods    
 
This is  a prospective, non -randomized, parallel group, intervention control trial , patterned on a 
similar pi[INVESTIGATOR_797006]42. 
 
Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111455]. Patients 
with a recent diagnosis (< 4 weeks) of pancreatic cancer will be given information on the study 
by [CONTACT_797025].  If yes, 
physicians will have patients complete a HIPAA A form  to provide study personnel with their 
name.  Study personnel will access the patients’ medical records to evaluate the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . If these criteria are met, research personnel will meet with the 
Protocol Template Page 6  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1099412] the option of combining the familiarization session and 
Visit 1.  All data collected during screening will be destroyed and recollected after obtaining 
written consent in patients choosing to participate.  If the inclusion/exclusion criteria are not met 
after review of the health record, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_797026].  
 Group Assignment : Volunteers  meeting the inclusion and exclusion  criteria and willing to 
participate in the exercise intervention wi ll be assigned to the exercise group. The standard of 
care, non -exercise control group will comprise volunteers who meet the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria but are unable to commit to participation in the exercise intervention for practical 
reasons  (e.g. barriers in transportation or home location) . The use of a non- randomized study 
design is to maximize patients participating in the exercise program to determine accrual rate, program adherence, and safety while still allowing a non- exercise control group.  
 
Protocol:  
 
Figure [ADDRESS_1099413] assessments and the 
exercise investigation explained in -depth.  There will be four time points for data collection: pre-
intervention (Visit 1), post -intervention and preoperative (Visit 2), 30- day postope rative (data 
retrieved from electronic health record), and follow -up (Visit 3).  
 Assessments:  All assessments will be performed at the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center . 
Participants will also complete the Godin Physical Activity Questionnaire during Visit [ADDRESS_1099414] fatigueing assessments 
performed at the end of the session. The order will be: SLS, TUG, grip strength, 30StS, SCT, 
gait speed, 400MWT. All tests will be performed by [CONTACT_941] s ame investigator at all time points . 

Protocol Template Page 7  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1099415] t wo options 
for completing questionnaire data at each assessment: 1) com pletion of questionnaire data via 
emailed REDCap survey at the Health and Wellness Center via provided computer or tablet, 2) 
completion of printed questionnaires provided at the functional assessment. Data obtained 
from participants completing printed questionnaires will be entered in the REDCap system by  
[CONTACT_797027], following which hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_793635].  
 
If participants will not receive a standard blood draw as part of their medical care within a one-
week window of the visit, they will be transported t o the CTRC where the necessary blood draw 
will be performed.  
 
Thirty days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], the participants’ electronic health record will be reviewed 
to retrieve data about initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157426] 30- day unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]. 
Visit [ADDRESS_1099416] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. This is the time at 
which some patients may begin more chemotherapy or radiation treatment (adjuvant therapy), 
and Visit 3 will be performed prior to this to avoid confounding ef fects of the therapy.  
Exercise Intervention: Participants will start the exercise program within four weeks of their 
diagnosis and decision to undergo neoadjuvant treatment and continue until surgery . 
Participants will continue  to receive the standard medical  care (described below)  provided at 
UCCC . Individual exercise sessions in this program implement a “whole body” approach and 
consist of a 10- min cardiovascular  warm -up and 50 minutes  of cardiovascular endurance, 
resistance, and flexibility exercises  (session components) . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_797007], stationary cycling, and stationary  
rowing. Resistance training includes  exercises using body  weight, free  weight s, and weight 
machine s targeting increased strength of the large upper and lower extremity muscle groups 
and core stability. Flexibility exercises target major muscle groups activated during the 
exercise . Target  intensity of exercise will be based on the Ameri can College of Sports Medicine 
(ACSM) recommendations for cancer survivors2: 40-85% heart rate reserve for cardiovascular 
endurance exer cises; 60 -70% one repetition maximum for resistance exercises; and a rate of 
perceived exertion of 12 -16 on a 6- 20 Borg scale for all activities . 
Exercise Adaptations:  Prior to the start of exercise sessions, participants will be  questioned on 
significant changes in symptoms or  the presence of new symptoms (such as nauseau or 
fever), which will used to modify the exercise session (intensity and components)  for that day  
to allow maximum symptom- limited participation . Participants will be encouraged to complete 
three sessions per week for at least eight weeks during neoadjuvant therapy.  Exercise 
intensity, components , and time will be rec orded for each exercise session to guide the 
exercise specialist in making appropriate exercise adjustments (progression, maintenance, or reduction). Exercise programs have been found to be safe in cancer survivors, even during life-
threatening treatments2, but safety has not been investigated specifically in the current 
population. Common risks may include muscular fatigue and soreness, as well as transient 
increases in treatment -related symptoms. Rarer risks include the possibility of injury due to 
unknown bone metastases or acute cardiac events. Intensity and acute changes in symptoms will be closely monitored to decrease these risks.  
Participants will schedule their sessions with the exercise specialists administering the 
program, typi[INVESTIGATOR_797008] 8AM and 4PM, Monday through Friday, at the 
Protocol Template Page 8  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Anschutz Center for Health and Wellness. Adherence will be measured as the percent of 
scheduled sessions attended. Exercise sessions will also be individualized to participants on a 
day to day basis, with time and intensity not exceeding that listed above.  Prior to the start of 
exercise sessions, participants will be questioned on signifi cant c hanges in symptoms or 
presence of new symptoms (such as nauseau or fever), which will be used to modify the exercise session for that day. Exercise intensity, type, and time will be recorded for each 
exercise session.  
 Standard Care:  Participants in the Standard Care group will receive no exercise intervention, 
but will continue to receive standard follow -ups, treatments  and services  from their oncology 
team.  The services that participants receive as standard care include their medical care, 
symptom c ontrol, social work er support , and nutrition.  
 Participants in all groups will receive $50 reimbursement for each Visit completed, totalling 
$150.00 for all three Visits.  
 D. Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools:  
 
Risks of exercise  and assessments : Certain risks are associated with performing exercise in 
any population, as well as specifically in cancer survivors.  The likely risks  of exercise include  
muscular fatigue and/or soreness, acute  increase in fatigue,  joint stiffness or soreness, and 
possible acute increas e in treatment - or cancer -related symptoms . The more serious risks  
include fracture associated with unknown bone metastases, development of ventricular 
arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and death.  
 
Justifications and Protection : For adults in the general population and for cancer survivors in 
particular the benefits of exercise training outweigh the risks . Exercise interventions have been 
shown to be safe in multiple cancer survivor populati ons12. The discomforts of exercise trai ning 
and testing will be explained to the participants . Participants will be informed that they can 
choose to withdraw or not participate in some or all portions of the study at any time for any 
reason. Before, during, and at the conclusion of  each exercis e training and testing session, 
study personnel will ask participants about new or worsening signs and symptoms. Every 
exercise session will be supervised by [CONTACT_797028] -certified . Exercise intensity and types of exercise will 
be adapted for each individual participant to match their capacity throughout the study. 
Exercise tests and training will be of submaximal intensity. Exercise intensity will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_797029], and participants will be 
monitored for symptoms including chest pain, acute shortness of breath at rest, or dizziness. 
Patients will be instructed to stay well -hydrated, and will be monitored for symptoms of 
dehydration including headache, confusion, tachycardia, significantly increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and changes in skin elasticity.  Patients with diabetes will be monitored for symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, encouraged to bring snacks to assessments and exercise sessions, and snacks 
and juice will also be stocked by [CONTACT_2710].  
 
After provi ding written informed consent, each participant will be asked to provide clinical 
provider contact [CONTACT_3031]. In the event of an emergency, study personnel  will call [ADDRESS_1099417] the 
designated clinical provider if an emergency arises (after first responders are summoned) or a 
participant exhibits or reports exacerbation of symptoms. In the case of a medical emergency, 
the participant must be cleared for exercise by [CONTACT_797030].  
 
The risks of the venipuncture are m omentary discomfort from the needle stick, excessive 
bleeding, light -headedness with insertion of needle, and infection or hematoma at the site of 
Protocol Template Page 9  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 the blood draw.  The risks of hematoma and infection will be minimized by [CONTACT_797031].  
 
The risks of DXA (to as sess body composit ion) involve s exposure to ionizing radiation. The 
DXA scans at 3 times during the study involve a total effecti ve radiation exposure of about 3 
mrems. DXA involves <1% of the annual maximum non- therapeutic radiation exposure to the 
whole body recommended by [CONTACT_1622] (5000 mrem/year). This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_797032], thereby [CONTACT_377776].   
 
The r isk of the heart rate variability (HRV) test ing is a possible brief increase in perceived 
stress and physiologic arousal induced by [CONTACT_797033]. Participants will be warned of this  possi ble increase in stress and arousal. The change will be 
no different than that occurring while performing difficult cognitive tasks on a daily basis. The 
Stroop Task has been previously used to effectively and safely evaluate HRV changes
43. The 
ECG electrode adhesive may cause localized skin redness and discomfort.  
 
Confidentiality and privacy : The use of questionnaires and collection of personal medical 
information poses a risk to confidentiality and privacy and may cause embarrassment.  
These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_290703], 
when possible, and by [CONTACT_290704] a private 
setting.  Direct data entry into a secure website using REDCap software will be coded with a 
unique participant number.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring : Research personnel will monitor safety concerns on an ongoing 
basis as data is collected and analyzed. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_797009]. A medical safety officer ([CONTACT_433652]), who is not an 
investigator on the study, will review the safety of the study after enrollment of every [ADDRESS_1099418] annually. Study participants will be informed that they can choose to stop the study (exercise intervention or assessment s) at any time. If study 
personnel deem that the participant is no longer physically capable of performing the exercise intervention or assessments, the participant will be discontinued from the study. The overall 
protocol will be discontinued if the PI, r esearch team, and safety officer agree that participants 
in the exercise group are experiencing significant negative outcomes, not experienced in the 
non-exercise ( control ) group, attributed to the exercise intervention  or testing.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_797010] 5 days of 
occurrence. Unanticipated problems and adverse events are defined as by [CONTACT_318453].  
    
E. Potential Scientific Problems:   
Potential Problems and Solutions : Given that no previous studies of pr eoperative exercise 
programs exist in patients with pancreatic cancer, the power analysis for the current study was based on the outcomes of a study of preoperative exercise in patients with lung cancer. It is possible that the estimated sample size here w ill not provide enough power to detect 
differences in postoperative outcomes. Regardless of statistical significance, outcomes from 
this study will  provide the basis to allow future studies in this population that are adequately 
powered.  Study groups will not be randomized, resulting in a potential selection bias and 
baseline differences . The decision to design the study as a non- randomized trial was made to 
improve recruitment for the target patient population and the short duration of the funding 
period. Analysis of the number of participants who are willing and able to participate in an 
exercise intervention at the AHWC will determine if a randomized trial is feasible and allow a 
better estimate of a realistic enrollment period. We will interpret our enrollment activity as 
Protocol Template Page 10  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 follows: if less than 70% of anticipated enrollment is achieved, we will conclude that additional 
study sites will be needed to enroll sufficient numbers of patients treated with neoadjuvant 
therapy for pancreatic cancer for formal hypot hesis testing in a RCT.  
The individualized nature of the exercise program  precludes rigorous control of exercise 
components  between participants.  An individualized exercise program may increase 
adherence and will  allow adaptability to acute changes in the patients’ health status due to 
treatment - or disease- related symptoms. The neoadjuvant therapy period will vary between 
participants, resulting in a variable duration of the exercise intervention. The duration of exercise must remain variable to avoid deconditioning that would be caused by a long lapse 
between the end of the exercise intervention and surgery. Most patients complete [ADDRESS_1099419] 
these factors as covariates in the analyses of the fitness, function, and stress outcomes.  
 
F. Data Analysis Plan:  
 The timeline for this protocol is estimated at 2 years. Data collection (participant recruitment and intervention) is estimated at 1 - 1.5, after which data will be analyzed and manuscripts 
prepared.   
Data Analysis and Anticipated Outcomes : Groups will be compared on demographic variables 
such as age and gender. Variables that differ significantly will be included in planned analyses 
as covariates. Statistical significance will be defined as α ≤ 0.05, however, results will be 
interpreted cautiously as is warranted for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]
44. As we expect to be underpowered to 
test for statistical interactions, multiple tests will be used to assess differences in baseline 
measures, change scores, and postoperative outcomes between groups. Change scores will 
be calculated as the difference between Visit [ADDRESS_1099420] k -sample permutation tests, which are well su ited for small sample sizes 
as they do not rely on typi[INVESTIGATOR_797011] -theory methods
45.  
Aim 1 : The feasibility of implementing this intervention will be assessed by [CONTACT_797034]’ adherence to the prescribed exercise program  (percentage of 
scheduled sessions attended) . Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_797035]-serious and 
serious adverse event s and relatedness of the events to exercise, as described by [CONTACT_318453] . 
Aim 2 : Hypothesis 1 – Baseline physical fitness and function measures and change scores  
will be compared between groups  using exact k -sample permutation tests . We anticipate a 
significant difference in the changes from Visit 1 to Visit 2, with the Exercise group 
demonstrating maintained or improved physical fitness and function compared to t he Control 
group, with no differences in baseline measures.  A secondary analysis will be used to 
describe the trajectory of changes in physical function from visits 1, 2, and 3.  
Hypothesis 2 – Postoperative outcomes will be compared with exact k -sample per mutation 
tests  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]) or Fisher’s exact  tests (hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]) between the 
Exercise  and Control groups . We anticipate the Exercise  group to have a significantly lower 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797012] c ompared to the Control  
group.  
Exploratory Aim : Hypothesis 1 – Baseline psychological stress and systemic inflammatory 
status measures and change scores  will be compared between groups  using exact k -sample 
permutation tests . We anticipate a significant diff erence in change scores, with the Exercise 
group demonstrating decreased (improved) psychological stress and improved systemic inflammatory status (decreased CRP, IL- 6, sTNFR1 and IIS; increased IL- 10) compared to 
the Control group, with no differences in baseline measures.  
Hypothesis 2 – Spearman correlations  will be performed between  preoperative measures of 
psychological stress and systemic inflammatory status  and postoperative variables. We 
Protocol Template Page 11  
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 anticipate a significant negative correlation between psychological stress and systemic 
inflammatory status  and postoperative outcomes, with lower levels of stress and inflammation 
associated with improved outcomes in all participants.  
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
 
Aim 1:  The feasibility of future, larger scale implementation of the preoperative exercise 
program will be assessed primarily by [CONTACT_797036], demonstrating patients’ ability and willingness to complete the program. The future study of the intervention will be assessed through the measurement of patient accrual, which will provide a reference 
for the necessary time frame of future studies.  
 
Aim 2:  The analyses performed in this aim will reveal 1) how a preo perative exercise 
intervention a ffects physical fitness and physical  function prior to and after surgery, and 2) 
whether  a preoperative exercise program is associated with improved postoperative 
outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment.  These 
analyses will also illustrate typi[INVESTIGATOR_797013].  
 
Exploratory Aim:  The analyses performed in this aim will reveal 1) how a preoperative 
exercise intervention effects subjective and objective measures of psychological stress, 
autonomic function, and systemic inflammation prior to and after surgery, and 2) whether 
these preoperative measures predict postoperative outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoi ng neoadjuvant treatment. These analyses will also illustrate typi[INVESTIGATOR_797014]. Results from this aim may also lead to the development of novel interventions, if 
measures are predictive of outcom es but not adequately changed by [CONTACT_14759].  
 
Outcomes from this study will add to the growing body of literature on the effectiveness of 
preoperative exercis e programs in cancer survivors, as well as demonstrate the potential 
effectiveness of an exercise intervention in patients with pancreatic cancer, where there is limited evidence. By [CONTACT_797037], it allows future studies to tailor exercise program components to 
focus on the medi ators most strongly associated with positive outcomes.

Study Title:    Effects  of a preoperative  exercise  intervention during neoadjuvant therapy in 
patients with pancreatic  cancer
You are being asked  to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information 
about the study. A member of the research team will describe this study to you and 
answer all of your questions. Please read the information  below and ask questions 
about anything  you don’t understand before deciding whether or  not to take  part. 
Why is this study  being done?
This study  plans to learn  more  about  whether the effects  of providing a personalized  
exercise program  to patients recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer  can improve 
their health and tolerance to cancer treatment. The exercise program will take place  
before surgery, while you are receiving  chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy to 
improve your response  to surgery. We anticipate  that the exercise  program will 
improve your fitness, ability to move,  and response to surgery.
You are being asked to  be in this research study because  you have recently  been 
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and plan on  receiving  neoadjuvant treatment and 
surgery at the  University of Colorado Cancer  Center.
Other people in this study
Up to 30 people from your area will participate in the study. This study is not being 
performed in any other locations. 
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study,  you will receive  physical fitness and function testing at several 
times (now, before surgery, and 6 weeks after surgery). These tests  are performed 
only as a part of this research study and are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_797017]. You  will need to  travel to the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center 
for 1 visit at each assessment time  (totaling  3 assessment visits). There  will also  be 
a familiarization  session, which may or may not be combined with the first 
assessment. At the familiarization  session, we will go over the study in detail  and 
you will fill out an additional questionnaire with demographic and medical history 
information.
There are four components to  each assessment: questionnaires, heart rate  
variability testing, functional testing, and body  composition testing.

Page 2 of  8 Initials______The questionnaires at  each assessment can  be filled out in one of two ways: on a 
computer or tablet  at the  Wellness Center, or on  a provided paper  copy at the 
Wellness Center. If completed at home (on a  device or  paper), this must be done 
within one week  of the functional testing (and returned to the Center if on paper). It 
will take about [ADDRESS_1099429] your heart beat while  you are quietly sitting, standing, or performing  cognitive 
tasks for 5-10 minute periods of time. The cognitive tasks require you to identify the 
color of words on a screen. Sometimes  the words will be different color name,  
random objects, or medical terms related  to cancer. These tasks  are designed to be 
difficult and evoke some emotion.
During functional  assessments, you  will perform tasks  designed to measure how  
well you can  move  and perform  daily  tasks. These include: balancing on one leg, 
rising from a chair and  sitting in a chair,  grippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a force measuring  device as  hard 
as possible, going up and down stairs, and walking  (short, timed walking  in 10 meter  
intervals, and one timed 400 meter [a quarter mile]  walk). You will also be given an 
activity monitor that is worn on  your  upper arm during this  session. We will ask  you 
to wear this monitor for a week  and then return  it. It will measure how  many steps  
you take each day.
To assess  body composition,  we will perform up to [ADDRESS_1099430] that is based on a 
“whole-body” approach to exercise.  Sessions  will include aerobic (walking, treadmill, 
bike, rowing machine), resistance  (machines, free weight, and body weight), and 
flexibility (stretching) exercises. You  will wear  a heart rate monitor  and activity  
monitor during these sessions to help monitor  the intensity of your exercise. These  
sessions will be scheduled  for 2-3  times a week  from initiation of the program to your 
date of surgery, and  you will be  required to travel to the  Wellness Center  for these 
sessions. Sessions  need to  be scheduled between 8AM and 4PM.

Page 3 of  8 Initials______What are the possible discomforts or risks?
Discomforts you may experience while in  this study include  muscle fatigue and 
soreness, acute  increase in fatigue, or joint  stiffness or  soreness. These  are 
commonly associated  with any  exercise  program and exercise  intensity will be 
monitored to decrease  these symptoms as much as possible. Any of these 
discomforts may be experienced in  response  to assessments, as  well as exercise  
sessions. It is  very important that  you inform whoever you are with if you have any 
change in symptoms  during assessments  and exercise sessions. If getting blood 
drawn as part of  the study, you may  feel a momentary  sharp pain. 
The DEXA  scan  for measuring your muscle  and fat  uses x-ray  and exposes you to 
radiation. Your natural environment  has some radiation in it. Each DEXA  scan will 
give you about the same  amount of radiation that you would get from your 
environment in [ADDRESS_1099431]. The patches  may cause redness or  soreness  of the  skin.
Rare risks include:
Exercise testing and assessment: 1) acute cardiovascular event, 2)  musculoskeletal 
injury, 3) dehydration, 4) excessive bleeding, and 5)  possible  fracture due to 
unknown bone  metastasis.
Blood draw  risks are possible light-headedness  with insertion of needle during  blood 
draw, and possible infection  or bruising at  the site of the blood draw.
Careful monitoring of the intensity of  exercise  sessions  as well as  any symptoms  
experienced will be done to minimize the  occurrence of associated rare risks. When 
a blood draw is performed sterile procedures will be used to minimize the  risk of 
infection.
There is a risk that  people outside of the  research team will see your research  
information.  We will do all that we can  to protect your information,  but it cannot be 
guaranteed.
You may not be in this  study if you are pregnant, the  particular treatment or  
procedures involved  in the study  may involve risks to the embryo or fetus which  are 
currently unclear.
The study may include risks that are unknown  at this time.

localization to guide ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation.  We also aim to clarify the network of innerva tion between GP to 
clarify the optimal ablation strategy.  
2.2 Background  
Autonomic cardiac innervation arises from the brainstem and travels to the heart via the cervical and thoracic stellate gangl ion 
(sympathetic system) and the vagus nerve (parasympathetic system). The two systems combine to innervate the heart in a dense network 
of post -ganglionic axons called the ganglionated plexi (Hou Y, et al). These ganglionated plexi are located at the base of the heart in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618666] (Goudis CA, et al; Armour JA, et al).  
 
With direct visualization of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_683448], autonomic modulation with injectio n of botulinum 
toxin has been shown to reduce short and long term burden of atrial fibrillation (Romanov A et al; Waldron et al).  Several techniques 
have been proposed to identify the ganglionated plexi at the time of endocardial procedures. Anatomic approaches have been ut ilized 
targeting classical regions of autonomic innervation, although this procedure has several limitations inc luding individual anatomic

variation.  In addition, high frequency stimulation mappi[INVESTIGATOR_683449] (Kim MY, et al; H u F, et al). 
This technique is limited by [CONTACT_683467] m, which is especially 
relevant for non -atrial fibrillation ablation procedures where such mappi[INVESTIGATOR_683450]. More recently, techniques 
to evaluate local electrograms have been developed based on the principle that fractionated electr ical activity may be noted in the 
endocardium beneath ganglionated plexi due to the inter -myocardial nerve fibers that interrupt normal myocardial -to-myocardial 
conduction (Pachon M JC, et al; Lellouche N, et al).  
 
We have recently shown that there is an association between left atrial epi[INVESTIGATOR_683451] d 
electrogram fractionation (Zghaib T, et al). This association is consistent with other descriptions of local electrograms at the site of 
successful ablation of ganglionated plexi.  Given the routine nature of pre -procedure imaging, which is frequently performed prior to 
atrial fibrillation ablation to clarify relevant anatomy, and the ability to identify this epi[INVESTIGATOR_683452], we anticipate CT can 
provide a safe, non -invasive option to locate these regions and guide appropriate intervention.  Ablation targeting ganglionated plexi 
have been used to treat atrial fibrillation as well as vasovagal syncope, sinus node dysfunction , and heart block. A simple and reliable 
method of identifying ablation target could improve the safety and efficacy of these procedures.  
 
Update to 1/23/24 version: Although tragus stimulation has been frequently utilized, there is evidence to suggest more robust  vagus 
nerve innervation in the region of the cymba concha  (Frangos et al 2015; Rong et al 2012; Courties et al 2022).  For this reason, electrodes 
positioned in this area may have more consistent physiologic effects related to vagus nerve stimulation.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_925430] likely increased risk from high frequency 
stimulation is the induction of atrial fibrillation, which is common as part of routine ablation procedures and does not pose  significant 
risk. We do not anticipate these risks to be significant modified by t he additional ablation targeting ganglionated plexi, which are 
located in regions frequently targeted in ablation of atrial fibrillat ion and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_683453].

2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
2.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
As discussed above, potential risks of ablation of ganglionated plexi include the risk factors associated with catheter ablat ion for atrial 
fibrillation as discussed above. An additional theoretical  risk includes increased sinus rates following vagal denervation, which has 
been described as transient in the literature and not seen in our own experience.  Potential risks of ear stimulation include local 
discomfort or skin irritation/burns. Potential risks of high frequency stimulation include pain, which will  not be perceived given the 
use of general anesthesia, and the induction of atrial fibrillation, which routinely occurs during atrial fibrillation ablati ons. 
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
Potential benefits include the reduction in burden of atrial fibrillation by [CONTACT_683468].  In addition, 
societal benefits include the development of procedural techniques that may improve treatment of atrial fibrillation, vasovagal 
syncope, and other conditions.  
2.3.3  Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
The risks of participating in the study are not significant beyond the risks associated with routine clinical care (including  pre-
procedural CT imaging, atrial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_17527]). Therefore , the potential benefits to the individual subject and to society 
outweigh the risks of participating in the study.

STUDY INTERVENTION  
4.8 Study Intervention(s) Administration  
4.8.[ADDRESS_925433] GP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_683455] (Natus) Cortical Stimulator (see attached) with 12V output at 20Hz 
frequency with 10ms pulse duration with at least 3grams of contact [CONTACT_17611]. Stimulation will be provided for up to 10 seconds o r until 
vagal response is noted  (>2s ventricular asystole, AV block, or R -R interval increase by [CONTACT_2669] 50%) . Natus stimulator had FDA 
clearance (K072964) for cortical stimulation.  Prior to ablation, baseline ear vagus nerve stimulation will be performed  via stimulation 
of bilateral cymba concha  to document response  using Parasym tragal stimulator (IDE information attached) . Ablation of mapped GPs 
will be performed using standard ablation catheter with routine approaches to ablation energy delivery and monitoring  (see below 
flowchart) . Foll owing ablation  of each GP , local HFS will be repeated  in all GP regions  and ear vagus nerve stimulation will be 
repeated  via bilateral cymba concha . After all GP are ablated, a ll patients be given IV atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (0.04mg/kg max: 4mg) to assess global 
vagal tone. Following this, patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation using standard equipment  and techniques .   
Devices will be obtained from the manufacturer (Natus and Parasym respectively) and will be stored in a secured laboratory sp ace. No 
particular temperature or climate requirements are present for either device.  All devices will be labeled according to the  manufacturer 
guidance and will be returned to the manufacturer in the event of any device failure.  Devices will be stored and managed in 
compliance with OCR guidelines.

5 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
5.1 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Pregnancy  
• Significant  non-compliance  with follow -up visits  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continue d 
participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further 
study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subje cts 
who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not undergo ablation  may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed 
consent form and  are randomized and undergo ablation , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study , 
will not  be replaced.]  
5.[ADDRESS_925434] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 3 months  and counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue i n 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_151525] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address 
or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a 
primary reason of lost to follow -up.

6 STUDY  ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURES  
6.1 Efficacy Assessments  
• Elimination of local HFS response and ear vagus nerve stimulation will determine acute procedural efficacy  
• Loop recorder or ambulatory monitors interrogations to evaluate presence and burden of atrial fibrillation  
• History to identify symptomatic atrial fibrillation and to identify epi[INVESTIGATOR_683456]  
6.2 Safety and Other Assessments  
• Physical examination will be performed following the ablation procedure to identify any procedural complications including 
vascular or neurological injury.  
• Repeat examination and history will be performed at follow -up visit to identify any potential procedural complications.  
6.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
6.3.1  Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention  in humans, whether or not 
considered intervention related. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
A pre-existing condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity or the char acter of the condition changes.  
6.3.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)

Atrial Fibrillation  Page 20 of 37 
 
   
Confidential and Proprietary Information of Saman Nazarian  
    
Adverse events are classif ied as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that, in the view of either the i nvestigator or 
the sponsor, is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  when the event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
• required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage ( for devices  only) 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but  are clearly o f major clinical significance. They 
may jeopardize the subject and  may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious ou tcomes noted above. For example, drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355] . 
6.3.3  Classification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Event  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines wil l be used to describe 
severity.  
 
  
Protocol 844182   
Prospective Evaluation of Computed Tomography Guided Ablation of Cardiac Ganglionated Plexi in Patients with 
Atrial Fibrillation  Page 21 of 37 
 
   
Confidential and Proprietary Information of Saman Nazarian  
    
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may 
cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe 
events are usually potentially  life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to 
“serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to procedure  assessed by [CONTACT_683470]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be gra ded using 
the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be considered . 
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the GP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_683457] , there is a reasonable possibility that the procedure  
caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the procedure  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the  procedure  and the AE.  
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the procedure  caused the event, there is no 
temporal relationship between the procedure  and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
The primary investigator  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previous ly described 
for the procedure.  
 
 
  
Protocol [ADDRESS_925435], or other assessments. Information on all adverse events 
will be recorded in the source documentation. To the extent possible, adverse events will be recorded as a diagnosis and sym ptoms 
used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event.  
As much as possible, each adverse event or follow -up information will be evaluated to determine:  
1. Severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -5) 
2. Duration (start and end dates)  
3. Relationship to the study treatment or process – [Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No (unrelated/ not suspected) or 
Yes (a suspected adverse reaction)]. If yes (suspected) - is the event possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
investigati onal treatment?  
4. Expectedness to study treatment or process – [Unexpected – if the event severity and/or frequency is not described in the 
investigator brochure (if applicable) or protocol].  
5. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment or process (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, 
permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)

6. Whether medication or therapy taken (no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, concomitant medication/non -drug 
therapy)  
7. Whether the event is serious  
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the  study 
treatment, the in terventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 
 
6.3.5  Adverse Event Reporting  
Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be reported from the time of informed consent until study completion.  
Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (e .g., relationship to study product (s) or study procedure (s) or disease progression) must 
be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_925436] be reported to the Sponsor as a follow -up to the original  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. A SAE considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
New information regarding the SAE will be reported as it becomes available and in the same manner that the initial SAE (i.e. SAE 
form ). The investigator must follow the event to resolution or until the event is deemed and documented irreversible, whichever i s 
longer.

Investigator  Reporting: Local Reporting Requirements  
The investigator will report AEs and SAEs to the  IRB/EC of record and other local regulatory groups per the local requirements.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_925437] (IRB) . The study sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an unanticipated 
adverse device effect and shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and to all reviewing 
IRBs and parti cipating investigators  per the applicable regulation.  
6.4 Unanticipated Problems  
6.4.1  Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others t o 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -
related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
and (b) the  characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that  the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and

[IP_ADDRESS]  Consent Procedures and Documentation  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the 
individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the participan t will be asked to 
read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions th at may 
arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the pu rposes, procedures, and 
potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the 
written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study wi th their 
family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to  participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to 
any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants must be inf ormed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the particip ants for 
their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and the 
form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be 
protected by [CONTACT_683474].

interventions. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addi tion to the clinical 
information relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated  will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any un authorized third party without 
prior written approval of the sponsor.  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), regulatory 
agencies or pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required to be maintain ed by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the partic ipants in this 
study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_10414]. At the end of 
the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_302673] g IRB, Institutional 
policies, or sponsor requirements.  
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be transmitted to and stored in 
our Data Coordinating Center.  This will not include the participant’s contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants 
and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management  systems 
used by [CONTACT_683476]. At the end of the st udy, all study databases will be de -
identified and archived.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_925439] of the trial is in compliance with the currently a pproved 
protocol/amendment(s), with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and with applic able 
regulatory requirement(s).  The primary investigator and co -investigator will be responsible for clinical site monitoring.  
8.1.7  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
All monitoring and audits are to be performed according to ICH GCP E6(R2).  
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen collection, docume ntation 
and comp letion. An individualized quality management plan will be developed to descri be a site’s quality management.  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on the 
database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolut ion. 
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and dat a are 
generated , and specimens are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory 
Practices (GLP), Go od Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the pu rpose of 
monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].  
 
  
Protocol [ADDRESS_925440] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_683463].  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be 
consistent with the data re corded on the source documents.  
Clinical data (including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical lab oratory 
data will be entered into our data collection system.  The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as 
automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered d irectly from 
the source documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Records Retention  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_925441] approval of a marketing application in an Internat ional 
Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or 
until at least [ADDRESS_925442] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the trial. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written con sent of the 
sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.

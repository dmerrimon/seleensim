Study ID: [REMOVED] 
  Document Date:  [ADDRESS_1126875] ion (HFpEF) Symptoms.
  
The public burden of heart failure (HF) is manifested by [CONTACT_813752] ($39.2 billion in healthcare-related 
costs/year) in the US,1 while the personal burden of HF includes debilitating symptoms.2 It is estimated that 
there is a 20% lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_813716] 40 and that 870,000 new cases will be diagnosed yearly in adults who are 55 years of age or older.
3 In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration reported that “the burden 
of HFpEF was considerable and is projected to worsen” and “there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_813717].”
4 Beginning January 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began 
reducing payments to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813718] 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Of the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15538], more than 50% have diastolic HF, which is termed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
[ADDRESS_1126876] a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than 45 to 50% and symptoms 
that include lack of energy (fatigue), shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and reduced quality of life.6, [ADDRESS_1126877] recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) HF guidelines for 
HFpEF acknowledge “huge gaps” in understanding effective treatments for patients with HFpEF.8 This study 
will provide an opportunity to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative approaches for reducing symptom burden in patients with HFpEF.  
 A.2. Improved Scientific Knowledge and Clinical Practice in Measuring HFpEF. This study of ubiquinol 
(CoQ10, a type of coenzyme Q10) and D-ribose in patients with HFpEF will significantly improve scientific understanding of myocardial bioenergetics. Ubiquinol and D -ribose are naturally produced in the body.
9-11 One 
of the main functions of these products is to promote cardiac energy metabolism by [CONTACT_813753] (ATP) production (Figure 1).
12 Ubiquinol and D -ribose exert 
this physiological benefit of enhancing cardiac function via two different bioenergetic pathways.
13-15 
As an efficient electron carrier, ubiquinol plays an important role in transporting electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC), which produces the proton gradient needed for phosphorylation of ADP and creating ATP. In contrast, D -ribose provides a 
source for synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to ensure there is sufficient ADP to form 
ATP.
16-18 Therefore, administering these supplements should augment ATP synthesis, increasing both cellular 
and behavioral energy. The potential benefits of administering ubiquinol and/or D -ribose to patients with 
HFpEF are increased myocardial energy and diastolic relaxation, which would significantly reduce their cardiac symptoms. We plan to measure HFpEF symptoms using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), Vigor scale, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Biological measures will include myocardial wall m otion, 
lactate/ATP ratio, and B -type natriuretic peptides (BNP).  
 A.3. Using Biobehavioral Symptom Science. Novel discoveries in biobehavioral symptom science require 
integration of information from the patient's biologic processes, physiologic pathways, and behaviors to treat and manage symptoms of diseases such as HFpEF.
19, 20 We plan to use biobehavioral symptom science to 
identify complex symptoms that can be characterized with biological and clinical data. In this study, symptoms of HFpEF patients that result in a person’s feeling a lack of energy will be measured using a questionnaire to evaluate the patient’s level of vigor and overall health status. We will also measure their lactate/ATP ratio, cardiac  performance, B -type natrieutric peptides, and conduct a 6MWT. This study could assist in illuminating 
a therapeutic clinical intervention (ubiquinol and/or D -ribose) for patients with HFpEF by [CONTACT_813754][INVESTIGATOR_813719].  
 A.4. Technologies and Treatments That Could Reduce the Symptoms of HFpEF. We plan to use a 
sophisticated echocardiographic software program called speckle tracking to measure myocardial wall tension and m otion to evaluate diastolic function. In addition, we will quantify our term “energy” using point -of-contact 
[CONTACT_813755]/ATP ratio and BNP concentration. The two important outcomes for patients with HFpEF are improved heart function and patient energy. If a patient with HFpEF takes ubiquinol and/or D -

ribose, we hypothesize that the increased cellular bioenergetics would decrease myocardial stiffness, resulting 
in improved cardiac output and level of vigor. With more energy, the patient should have improved health status in the five KCCQ domains (i.e., clinical summary, functional status, self -efficacy, social interactions, 
quality of life). Thus, if the aims are achieved, patients with HFpEF will have successful symptom management and improved assessment of diastolic function. In addition, we will determine whether the comparative 
effectiveness of the treatments will maintain or increase ATP levels, prevent additional stiffness of the heart, 
and thus improve cardiac function, thereby [CONTACT_813756]. A reduced myocardial tissue content of CoQ10 
has been demonstrated in patients with HF, correlating with the severity of symptoms and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction.
21 According to Sharma (2016), the pathophysiological rationale for the use of CoQ10 in 
HFpEF exists, and well -conducted clinical trials will be required to demonstrate how CoQ10 decreases the 
signs and symptoms in this population.22 This study will produce new knowledge that will provide information 
about comparative benefits and outcomes that is significant to patients with HFpEF and that will help these patients make informed critical decisions about using ubiquinol and/or D -ribose.  
 B. INNOVATION
 
B.1. New Applications of Theoretical Concepts to Address HFpEF Symptoms. This study is a novel design to compare ubiquinol and/ or D-ribose as supplemental treatments for HFpEF using a biobehavioral 
model (Figure 2). A deficiency in ubiquinol and/or D -ribose is an underlying pathophysiologic mechanism that 
results in cellular energetic impairment that diminishes ATP production and decreases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca
2+-
ATPase.23 This results in decreased actin-myosin cross -
bridge detachment, which is reflected in increased diastolic stiffness and decreased ventricular compliance. In addition, increased free radical production in HFpEF can result in damage to mitochondria and nucl ei.
24 We will examine the 
bioenergetics of ubiquinol and/or D -ribose in patients with 
HFpEF both behaviorally (health status per KCCQ and Vigor scale) and biologically (6-minute walk test, 
echocardiographic imaging, lactate/ATP ratio, and BNP 
measurements). With emphasis on patient -centered care, it 
is important to assess patient perception of changes in health status and level of vigor as ubiquinol and/or D -ribose 
is administered. To our knowledge, the effects of combining ubiquinol and D -ribose in HFpEF patients have not been 
published and thus are innovative because of their 
synergistic potential.  
 
B.2. Patient -centered Perspective.  Since HFpEF is related to changes in cellular bioenergetics, it is important 
to evaluate behavioral measures of energy such as the Vigor scale as well as biological clinical outcomes. After meeting with 30 HFpEF patients and 10 caregivers, we found they were extremely interested in the 
question of whether ubiquinol, D -ribose, or both could improve their health status (i.e., reduce their shortness 
of breath, increase their ability to perform daily activities, etc.) and their energy levels. With the advanced speckle tracking echocardiogram images, lactate/ATP ratio, and BNP measurements, we can answer that 
question. Our data will help us compare the effectiveness of ubiquinol and D -ribose with usual treatment in this 
patient population.  
 
B.3. Potential Impact of Racial/Ethnic and Cultural Differences. Studies raised concerns that the incidence 
of HF might vary among different racial/ethnic groups.
25, 26 Thus, in this study we will oversample minorities as 
reviewers suggested, which will enable us to examine the relationship between HFpEF and racial/ethnic differences. Most of the data regarding treatments for HFpEF are derived from White populations,
27 and 
therefore it is important to include other racial/ethnic groups and examine whether the effects of ubiquinol and/or D -ribose follow similar patterns to those among whites.  
 B.4. Translational Research.  This is our opportunity to translate what we have observed in the laboratory and 
in the cardiovascular clinic to decrease patients’ debilitating symptoms of HFpEF. In a rat model, we have observed a significant decrease in myocardial nuclear damage (apoptosis) and mitochondrial superoxide

damage as assessed by [CONTACT_813757]. In the clinic setting, we have observed significant improvements in cardiac function leading to improved symptoms in patients with HFpEF who received ubiquinol and/or D -ribose. Translating these significant findings via a human 
study will provide essential data to support the use of these supplements in clinical practice.  
 
B.5. Advanced Echocardiographic Imaging. In this study we will use a novel software program termed 
speckle tracking with an echocardiographic instrument to assess cardiac function in HFpEF patients with and 
without administered ubiquinol and/or D -ribose. Speckle tracking echocardiography is an innovative technique 
that measures myocardial velocities and deformation parameters such as strain, strain rate, and torsion. These parameters provide superior  assessment of diastolic function relative to conventional echocardiography. Using 
this advanced echocardiographic imaging method to objectively measure the effectiveness of ubiquinol and/or D-ribose in HFpEF patients is innovative and provides highly spec ific data for clinicians and researchers.  
 B.6. Use of Biomarkers with Imaging. Our study is innovative because of its unique strategy of evaluating biomarkers (BNP, lactate/ATP ratio) with advanced cardiovascular imaging (speckle tracking echocardiogram) to assess a treatment (usual care, ubiquinol, and/or D -ribose) for a major healthcare problem (HFpEF). We will 
use biomarkers to evaluate the comparative effects of usual care, ubiquinol, and/or D -ribose. Our use of 
handheld on-site measurement of lactate/ ATP ratio in patients with HFpEF is pi[INVESTIGATOR_813720], the major mechanism for HFpEF, available in [ADDRESS_1126879] population, > 50 years of age, male and female with HFpEF, will be enrolled from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration (HERON) database, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813721] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335032]), and chronic HF clinic at the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (KUH): 69 in the control (placebo) group; 69 in the ubiquinol group; 69 in the D -ribose group; and 69 in the ubiquinol plus D -ribose 
group, (total = 276). HERON provides clinical/translational investigators with the numbers of patients at KUH 
who meet the inclusion criteria for clinical trials and contact [CONTACT_813758]’s 
Frontiers participant registry. Based on the HERON, there will be approximately 7,100 subjects with HFpEF available to be screened for enrollment in this study. As suggested by [CONTACT_241244], we will oversample minority populations to increase the generalizability of data for minority groups (30% Black/African Americans (AA), 30% Hispanic/Latino, 30% White, and 10% American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander). In addition, two nurse practitioners and a cardiologist on this application who work in the outpatient HF clinics will refer patients to the research team. All patients included in this study will: be 50 
years old or older; have left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50%  documented by [CONTACT_813759] 
12 months of enrollment; be diagnosed with HFpEF within a 12-month period;, have symptoms of dyspnea and [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Classification II or greater symptoms, have a diagnosis of  HFpEF defined by [CONTACT_080]: (1) previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405352] (pulmonary venous 
hypertension, vascular congestion, interstitial edema, or pleural effusion) of pulmonary congestion, (2) invasive hemodynamics, (3) echocardiographic evi dence of diastolic dysfunction, (4) elevated NT -pro (>400 pg/ml) or 
BNP (>200 pg/ml), or (5) no use of intermittent sublingual nitroglycerin within 12 months; have willingness to provide informed consent; have a telephone or reliable phone contact; and have their own means of 
transportation to the study site. Patients will be excluded  based on any of the following criteria: (1) acute 
coronary syndrome in the past 12 weeks; (2) significant valvular heart disease;(3) severe cardiac fibrosis 
(galectin-3 level > 26 ng/ml); (4) constrictive pericardium; (5) pulmonary fibrosis; (6) congenital heart disease; 
(7) hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy; (8) heart transplant; (9) left ventricular assist device; (10) HF associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813722] r oom visit within past 30 days; (11) recent percutaneous coronary 
intervention; (12) significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction; (13) severe cognitive impairment; or (14) consumption of any CoQ10 (ubiquinol) or D -ribose supplements. Hepatic and renal dysf unction will be defined 
as an ICD -10 code with diagnosis of renal and/or hepatic failure in the patient’s healthcare record. For 
retention we will schedule the sessions at a convenient time for each participant. Part of the recruitment plan includes subjects’ preferences for conducting telephone calls and collecting data. All subjects will be asked to 
  
 
 
come to the Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CTSU), a newly renovated facility with private examination 
rooms, pharmaceutical rooms, and storage area (for echocardiogram, i -stat instrument, etc.), and computer 
access to the Velos eResearch for patient data. The facility has plentiful free/close parking.  
 C.2. Study Design and Materials. Both HFpEF patients and stakeholders had a meaningful influence on the study design. We held focus groups, made individual phone calls, and had in-person meetings with patients 
with HFpEF. Our Stakeholder Advisory Panel (SAP) consists of diverse individuals including patients, 
caregivers, clinicians, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367596] (Appendix 1) who have met three times. The patients and caregivers were particularly interested in whether ubiquinol, D -ribose, or both could enhance health status, 
decrease symptoms, and improve energy levels. We invited 30 HFpEF patients and their  caregivers to provide 
input and feedback regarding the development of our research hypotheses and methods. We found their opi[INVESTIGATOR_813723] -centered study.

Based on the power analyses (see C.5.), this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial will have a total sample size of (N) = 276. All participants will receive usual care for HFpEF. Efforts will be made to recruit 50% females, which is the actual proportion of HFpEF patients in Kansas C ity. 
N1 = 69 subjects: Control, receive no ubiquinol and no D -ribose; placebo capsules & powder per day. 
N2 = 69 subjects: Ubiquinol group, receive 600 mg of ubiquinol/day, D -ribose placebo powder per day. 
N3 = 69 subjects: D -ribose group, receive 15 g of D -ribose/day, placebo capsules for ubiquinol per day. 
N4 = 69 subjects: Ubiquinol + D -ribose group, receive [ADDRESS_1126880] Protection Program to ensure our consent form complies with the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) federal guidelines and obtain informed consent from eligible patients (Appendix 
10).  Patients that have consented will be provided a 1-week supply of placebo ubiquinol pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (instructed to take 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/day) and placebo D -ribose powder (instructed to take 3 scoops/day) as a pre-randomization run-in 
period to evaluate compliance to the supplements.  Patients will be scheduled for an appointment at the CTSU in 1 week following the run-in period.  Patients that demonstrate an 80% compliance rate of ubiquinol intake (as evidenced by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692]) and an 80% compliance rate of D -ribose powder intake (as evidenced by [CONTACT_813760]) will be eligible to be randomized into a group assignment. The enrolled patients with 80% 
compliance will then be randomized into four groups (69 subjects in each group)  to receive ubiquinol (600 mg 
daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), ubiquinol plus D -ribose, or placebo for a period lasting [ADDRESS_1126881] a certificate of analysis from the 
manufacturer (Appendix 9). The Project Director will receive the identified list of recruited subjects from the 
Principal Investigator (PI) and will randomly assign subjects to one of the groups using a list created by a computer -based random number generator. All supplements and the placebo will be indistinguishable in 
packaging and will be distributed by [CONTACT_813761] [INVESTIGATOR_813724] a treatment or placebo group will be concealed from both subjects and research personnel.

Approximately [ADDRESS_1126883]’s visit to the CTSU. Follow -up calls will occur at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1126884] of placebo and treatment subjects, will call and ask if there are any problems with consuming the ubiquinol and/or D -ribose. The Project Director and Research Associate will 
conduct a phone follow -up interview at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1126885] information for a tobacco/smoking cessation program. Diabetes mellitus will be determined by a history of the disease or use of medication for diabetes. Hypercholesterolemia will be defined as a fasting total serum cholesterol level ≥ 4.9 
mmol/l or use of medication. Hypertension will be defined as either systolic or diastolic blood pres sure ≥ 140/90 
mmHg or use of hypertensive medications.  
 
C.3. Aims and Hypotheses.  
 AIM #1: To determine the effects of oral ubiquinol, D -ribose, or a combination of the two administered during      
12 weeks on symptoms accompanying low bioenergetics in patients with HFpEF.  
 Hypothesis #1. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will enhance the 
health status of patients with HFpEF as measured by [CONTACT_110615] (KCCQ).  
 Primary outcomes of the study are patient -centered, thus the measurement of health status will be a priority. 
Bioenergetics has both biological and behavioral components. The biological component (i.e., improved heart function) and i ts measurement will be discussed below (Aim #2). In this section we will discuss the behavioral 
component that relates to patients’ perceptions of their health status (i.e., symptoms) and the impact of their health status on daily functioning (e.g., hobbies, work, and energy).  
 We will assess patients’ perceptions of their symptoms using the KCCQ, a self -administered questionnaire that 
measures patients’ perceptions of five domains of their health status relevant to HFpEF.
28 These domains are: 
(1) physical limitations, (2) symptoms, (3) self -efficacy, (4) quality of life, and (5) social interference. The KCCQ 
consists of [ADDRESS_1126886] work, or climbing a flight of stairs, patients are asked to check a 
response that indicates the degree to which HF has limited their ability: “Extremely Limited,” “Quite a bit 
Limited,” “Moderately Limited,” “Slightly Limited,” “Not at all Limited,” or “Limited for other reasons or did not do the activity.” Another item is: “Over the past 2 weeks, how many times has shortness of breath limited your ability to do what you wanted?” Response alternatives are: “All of the time,” “Several times,” “At least once a day,” “3 or more times per week but not every day,” “1-2 times per week,” “Less than once a week,” and “Never over the past 2 weeks.”  The KCCQ takes only 4 to 6 minutes to complete and has been used in more than a 
hundred studies. It has excellent psychometric properties and clinical usefulness including: (1) high test -retest 
reliability; (2) high internal consistency within each area (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.78 to 0.90); (3) patients’ scores concerning their health status correlate well with objective measurements of their functional capacities; and (4) the scale’s sensitivity for detecting clinical changes in HF patients is significantly greater than that of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Scale.  We will use the KCCQ to compare the changes in health status of patients with HFpEF taking ubiquinol, D -ribose, ubiquinol + D -ribose, or placebo.  
 
  
 
 
Hypothesis #2. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will increase the 
level of vigor in patients with HFpEF as measured by [CONTACT_813762] (POMS).  
 
Using the Vigor subscale from the P OMS questionnaire,29-31 patients will rate themselves on eight adjectives 
(lively, active, energetic, cheerful, alert, full of pep, carefree, and vigorous) on a five-point scale (0 = not at all, 
1 = a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = extremely). The Vigor scale has very high internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90), and it takes only [ADDRESS_1126887] been sitting quietly for 10 minutes at the beginning of each visit (baseline and 12 weeks). The total time for patients to complete both questionnaires will be [ADDRESS_1126888] and complete the KCCQ and POMS Vigor scale for them if given verbal consent.  
 AIM #2: To determine the effects of oral ubiquinol, D -ribose, or a combination of the two over 12 weeks on 
biological measures in patients with HFpEF.  
 
Hypothesis #3. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will improve left 
ventricular diastolic function measured by [CONTACT_813763].  
 
HFpEF is characterized by a stiff left ventricle (decreased compliance) that results from impaired relaxation. This decreased compliance leads to increased end-diastolic pressures. Signs and symptoms of diastolic HF are similar to those of patients with systolic dysfunction.
35 One difference is that the pathophysiologic 
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_813726].36 The 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines for treatment of 
patients with chronic HFpEF include beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
[ADDRESS_1126889] been shown to be effective in systolic HF; however, clinical trials have 
failed to demonstrate decreased morbidity and mortality in HFpEF.37 These data support the need for studies 
that target different and novel mechanisms in HFpEF.38, 39 Thus, we believe our proposal will address the 
pathophysiology underlying HFpEF with a treatment that would reduce its signs and symptoms.  
 Diastole is the phase in the cardiac cycle when the left ventricle fills and prepares for systole. At normal heart 
rates, diastole comprises t wo-thirds of the cardiac cycle.
40 Diastolic filling is influenced by [CONTACT_813764], by [CONTACT_813765] -dependent process of active relaxation, and atrial systole.36 
Relaxation of cardiac muscle requires higher amounts of ATP than systole.41, 42 Diastolic dysfunction is the 
major pathological mechanism of HFpEF, in which there is impairment in left ventricular relaxation because of 
increased stiffness and decreased compliance. Higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure results in increased pulmonary pressures, pulmonary congestion (dyspnea), elevated plasma BNP, and subsequent heart failure.
43 The increased ventricular stiffness is attributable to the increase in cytoplasmic calcium resulting 
from decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. The elevated cytoplasmic calcium results in 
impairment of detachment of the actin/myosin cross bridges.44, 45 The decreased end-diastolic volume (EDV) 
reduces stroke volume (SV) resulting in a compensatory increase in heart rate to maintain an adequate cardiac 
output (CO). Thus, the degree to which CO can be increased with activity (e.g., exercise) is limited.  
 Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography is a safe imaging technique frequently used to assess HFpEF. 
However, LV diastolic dysfunction is difficult to assess using standard echocardiography.
[ADDRESS_1126890] t o assess diastolic ventricular function.47, 48 This technology has been systematically 
validated by [CONTACT_813766], tagged cMR, and color -coded tissue Doppler echocardiography. Speckle 
tracking echocardiography is superior to Doppler imaging in measuring left ventricular deformation as it overcomes li mitations such as angle-dependent high frame rates and tethering effects. It allows investigators 
to easily calculate and assess myocardial deformation (rotation, torsion, and strain) and tissue velocity, which are important parameters for left ventricular  diastolic function.
[ADDRESS_1126891] demonstrated more sensitive measurements of changes of LV 
structure than regular echocardiography. Speckle tracking consistently showed early diastolic strain rate, reduced peak strain, and fibrosis as evidenced by [CONTACT_813767], which parallels the degr ee 
of diastolic dysfunction.
50-52 In this study, a speckle tracking echocardiography technician will perform the 
echocardiograms during each visit (baseline and 12 weeks). Drs. Shah (an expert in speckle tracking research), Vacek, and Hiebert (cardiologists) will determine EF and the ratio of mitral peak velocity of early 
filling (E) to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (eꞌ) (E/eꞌ rati o) (SV, EDV, EF) from the echocardiogram. Using 
speckle tracking software, we will measure myocardial deformation, rotation, torsion, strain, strain rate, and 
tissue velocity. Changes in the early api[INVESTIGATOR_813727] (rotR) and negativity of t ime from api[INVESTIGATOR_813728] (trotR) to mitral valve opening (MVO) are two major variables that reflect diastolic function. Decreases in rotR and trotR are indications of diastolic dysfunction.
53 Speckle tracking analysis with 
two-dimensional imaging w ill be performed as previously described by [CONTACT_813768]. at high frame rate 
parasternal short -axis images at the level of the mitral valve to generate rotation and rotation rate data.47 
Frame-by -frame rotation and rotati on rate will be exported in Excel, and the temporal data will be normalized to 
the percentage duration of systole and diastole separately as previously described by [CONTACT_813769].54 We 
anticipate that ubiquinol and/or D -ribose will change rotR, trotR,  strain, strain rate, and tissue velocity.  
 
Potential Problem and Alternative Solutions. One issue that might arise relates to scheduling the 
echocardiographic technician when the subject is available to come to the CTSU. A solution is to utilize an additional on-call echocardiographic technician should scheduling issues occur.  
 
Hypothesis #4. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will increase the 
distance that patients with HFpEF can walk in [ADDRESS_1126892] (6MWT) is a simple clinical tool which has been shown to be 
linearly related to oxygen uptake.[ADDRESS_1126893] been predicted with the 6MWT. It was found that patients 
with a walking distance of less than 300 meters (325 yards) had 50% mortality at 1 year; the mortality of those walking more than 450 meters was less at 1 year. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between distance walked and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285].
58 
 We will examine the effects of ubiquinol and/or D -ribose on the 6MWT at baseline and [ADDRESS_1126894] perceived dyspnea and fatigue at baseline and at the end of each walk by [CONTACT_813770], where 0 = nothing at all, 5 = severe, and 10 = very severe. Words of encouragement will be offered during the walk and water provided afterwar d. 
 
Hypothesis #5. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will decrease 
venous blood B -type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patients with HFpEF.  
 
B-type natriuretic peptides are a cardiac neurohormone secreted from  the atria and ventricles in response to 
volume expansion. This natriuretic peptide system assists in regulating extracellular volume by [CONTACT_813771].
59 Serum levels of BNP increase in cardiac disease conditions associated with increased atrial and 
ventricular stretch and left ventricular diastolic filling pressures. Miller et al. found that BNP concentrations 
were increased in outpatients with HF and were directly correlated with the magnitude of HF.60 In one study of 
1,653 subjects, the BNP levels increased as left ventricular dysfunction increased.61 Ruskoaho found that in 
the outpatient setting serum BNP values had a sensitivity of 97% and a negative predictive value of 98%.[ADDRESS_1126895] been strongly related to left ventricular 
hypertrophy.63 HF recommendations were updated in 2010 to include natriuretic peptides (i.e., BNP) in the 
urgent -care setting when the clinical diagnosis of HF is uncertain.64 In HF patients with EF > 40%, natriuretic 
  
 
 
peptides were the strongest independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction.65  At time of discharge, a BNP level 
of 400 pg/ml was 89% sensitive for events, and the negative predictive value was 96%.[ADDRESS_1126896] mortality in patients with HF.67 
 
BNP concentration will be measured using a portable i -STAT handheld analyzer. A blood sample (20 μl) will be 
obtained from a finger stick after the subjects have completed the questionnaires at baseline and [ADDRESS_1126897] BNP levels ranging between 5 and 5000 pg/ml, with results available in 10 minutes.  
 Hypothesis #6. Ubiquinol (600 mg daily), D -ribose (15 g daily), or a combination of the two will decrease the 
lactate/ATP ratio in patients with HFpEF.  
 
CoQ10 is a key component in mitochondrial bioenergy transfer.
14, 68 Its enzymatic processes facilitate electron 
transfer in the generation of ATP. CoQ10 functions in electron transfer chain (ETC) from enzyme complex I 
and enzyme complex II to complex III.69 Thus, CoQ10 is critical in ATP generation because 95% of ATP 
generation is via ETC.70 D-ribose is a naturally occurring compound and a simple sugar molecule that has 
been shown to increase cellular energy synthesis in the heart. The myocardium’s ability to resynthesize ATP is then limited by [CONTACT_813772] D -ribose,
71, 72 and supplementing D -ribose would increase ATP production. We 
plan to measure the effects of ubiquinol and/or D -ribose on mitochondrial ATP production by [CONTACT_813773] (serum lactate/ATP ratio). Several studies have measured the effects of CoQ10 on mitochondrial 
function.68, 73-75  In HFpEF, ATP production is limited due to myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction, which results 
in anaerobic metabolism and increased lactate production. When exercise intolerance occurs, fatigue and lack 
of energy ensue.76, 77 Pyruvate is the principal substance used in the production of energy. In a series of 
reactions, glucose is converted to pyruvate, which in the presence of adequate oxygen leads to mitochondrial ATP production. Insufficient oxygen supply results in pyruvate being converted to lactate. When mitochondrial function is impaired (e.g., CoQ10 deficiency) the pyruvate to ATP pathway is  compromised resulting in 
pyruvate being converted to lactate.
78-[ADDRESS_1126898] been studies measuring the lactate/pyruvate ratio in HF 
patients receiving ubiquinone.75, [ADDRESS_1126899] studies, ubiquinone decreased this ratio. Dai et al. found that 
ubiquinone supplementation in patients with HF significantly lowered plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio.75 However, 
our review found only one case history that examined lactate/pyruvate ratios and ubiquinol deficiency.[ADDRESS_1126900] measure of lactate and pyruvate levels from cardiac myocytes would be optimal; however, it is not feasible in an outpatient clinic setting. The pyruvate measurement takes approximately [ADDRESS_1126901] down to 0.1 fmol of 
ATP in 15 seconds. Chida et al. used serum lactate/ATP ratio as a new real -time biomarker in patients to 
assess changes in energy with impaired mitochondria, the lactate/ATP ratio is elevated.84 
 A capi[INVESTIGATOR_813729] (1.0 ml) will be obtained after subjects have completed the questionnaires and echocardiograms. Lactate concentration will be measured with a portable i -STAT handheld instrument 
using a CG4+ cartridge that requires 0.[ADDRESS_1126902] the probe into the EnSURE
TM instrument (ATP Test System). 
The E nSURETM quality monitoring system detects real -time ATP down to 0.[ADDRESS_1126903] 4 years has prescribed the combination of ubiquinol (600 mg/day) and D -
ribose (15 g/day) for patients with HFpEF. He has observed significant improvement in the health status of 
these patients using this combination of supplements. All subjects in our preliminary study reported that they complied with these doses by [CONTACT_813774] (compliance). Each subject tolerated these doses without any reported side effects (tolerance).  
 
  
 
 
Table 1 summarizes the results of this preliminary study. Patients with HFpEF were given the KCCQ and the 
POMS Vigor subscale before and after 12 weeks of taking ubiquinol or ubiquinol plus D -ribose. We observed 
significant improvements (paired samples t -tests, p  < 0.05) in the KCCQ clinical summary, functional status, 
self-efficacy, social interactions, quality of life, symptoms, and physical limitation scores as well as significant 
improvements in POMS Vigor scores. The increase in self -efficacy and social inter actions was not a direct 
change but may have resulted from the improved level of vigor and reduced signs and symptoms of HF.  
 
 
Table 2 presents a summary of echocardiographic data from a retrospective chart review of patients with 
HFpEF: E/eꞌ; pulmonary artery pressure; and B -type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Variables were retrieved 
from charts before and 12 weeks after taking the supplements (ubiquinol 600 mg/day, D -ribose 15 grams/day).

Comparative data were also reviewed from a group of patients who were not taking ubiquinol. These data indicate that E/eꞌ ratio, PAP, and BNP levels significantly deteriorated among patients who did not take ubiquinol. In contrast, 12 weeks of ubiquinol (or ubiquinol + D -ribose) supplementation resulted in a marked 
improvement of left ventricular function, as reflected by [CONTACT_813776] E/eꞌ ratio, PAP, and BNP.  
 In another study we investigated the effects of ubiquinol on heart nuclear membrane damage (apoptosis) and mitochondrial structure injury during severe oxidative stress in anesthetized rats (Figure 4).

Oxidative stress was produced by [CONTACT_2869] 40%  of the rat’s total blood volume and sustaining shock for 1 
hour, after which the blood and lactated Ringers were re-infused. One group received ubiquinol and monitored 
for 2 hours, after which the animals were euthanized and the heart excised for analysis. The findings indicate 
that ubiquinol significantly attenuated myocardial oxidative stress damage, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of HFpEF. In summary, a commonality between our preliminary data in rats and HFpEF patients is impaired mitochondrial energetics and oxidative stress. The proposed measurements in HFpEF patients will enhance our understanding of how ubiquinol and D -ribose is beneficial at the cellular level to 
improve cardiac performance and reduce HF symptoms.  
 C.5. Statistical Anal yses.  
 
Groups and Number of Subjects (69 per group/Total = 276 subjects) .  The power analyses require  
62 subjects/group, but there will be 69 subjects/group based on the expected 10% attrition.  
1.  Control Group (Usual Care)  
N1  = 69 subjects : Receive no ubiquinol and  
no D -ribose; placebo capsules and powder per day.  2.  Ubiquinol Group  
N2 = 69 subjects:  Receive 600 mg of ubiquinol per day;  
D-ribose placebo powder per day.  
3.  D -ribose Group  
N3 = 69 subjects : Receive 15 g of D -ribose per day;  
placebo capsules for ubiquinol per day.  4.  Ubiquinol + D -ribose Group  
N4 = 69 subjects:  Receive [ADDRESS_1126905] including 62 subjects in 
each of  the four study groups (ubiquinol, D -ribose, ubiquinol + D -ribose, and placebo). Since we expect about 
a 10% attrition rate, we will include 69 subjects in each group for a total of 276 subjects who will be 
randomized to one of the four groups. Efforts will be made to recruit 50% females. As suggested by [CONTACT_813778], we will oversample minority populations to increase the generalizability of data for minority groups (30% Black/AA, 30% Hispanic/Latino, 30% White, and 10% Other). In each group there will be Black/AA = 21, 
Hispanic/Latino = 21,
 White = 21, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander = 6 
(Total = 69).  A 10% attrition rate is anticipated since this is the approximate rate [CONTACT_813806] (Co-PI) has 
experienced with her heart failure clinical trials at the same locations. Reasons for the subject’s attrition were 
that they did not want to continue in the study, change in geographic location, or illnesses.  
 
Hypotheses #1 and #2.  The change in the KCCQ Clinical Summary score from baseline to the end of the [ADDRESS_1126906] the null hypothesis of no difference in mean change 
between patients on ubiquinol and patients on placebo. Similar tests will be used to compare D -ribose with 
placebo, ubiquinol + D -ribose with placebo, and ubiquinol versus ubiquinol + D -ribose.  Next, we state and 
justify the assumptions underlying our proposed sample size.  Soto et al. (2004) conducted a study of 1516 patients and found that a 10-point decline in KCCQ scores had an important prognostic significance, in that 
patients whose KCCQ Clinical Summary scores declined by ≥ 10 points had a 107%  increased risk of dying or 
being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813730] 12 weeks (event rate = 11.4% vs. 5.5%, p<0.001).
[ADDRESS_1126907] 10 points with use of ubiquinol will be clinically important. In addition, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_813731], after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects with ubiquinol or ubiquinol + D -ribose had 
an increase in the KCCQ Clinical Summary score of at least 10 points, which is consi stent with the study 
findings of Soto et al. (2004). The combined estimated standard deviation for the increase was 12.[ADDRESS_1126908] 0.81 (= 10/12.3) are clinically important. Therefore, a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_1126909] 98% power to detect this or larger effect sizes at a nominal 
significance level of 0.05 (with Bonferroni correction for four comparisons).  
 Analogous two-tailed independent samples t -tests will be used to compare changes in POMS scores. 
According to a linear regression of changes in POMS Vigor scores versus changes in the KCCQ Clinical 
Summary scores using our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], a 10-point increase in KCCQ Clinical Summary scores predicted about a 
6.[ADDRESS_1126910] 1.8 are clinically important. Our sample sizes will 
provide 99% power to detect this or larger effect sizes at a nominal 0.[ADDRESS_1126911] to baseline (t=5.23, df=4, two-tailed 
paired samples  p=0.0064). Similarly, the other five subjects of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_813732] + D -
ribose showed a significant increase of [ADDRESS_1126912] to baseline (t=5.10, df=4, two-tailed paired samples p=0.007). The 13.7-point increase produced by t he independent effect of D -ribose was borderline 
significant (t=2.06, df=9, two-tailed independent samples p=0.08). These results from our small pi[INVESTIGATOR_813733] a high likelihood that ubiquinol, and probably D -ribose, will produce clinically important increases of 10 
points in KCCQ scores, which gives additional confidence in the success of our proposed study and in the potential clinical applications of ubiquinol.  
 
Hypothesis #3.  The change in the E/eꞌ ratio from baseline to the end of 12 weeks of treatment will be 
computed for each patient as E/eꞌ ratio at 12 weeks minus E/eꞌ ratio at baseline. A two-tailed independent samples t -test will be used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in mean E/eꞌ ratio change between 
patients on ubiquinol and patients on placebo. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (Table 2) showed a substantially strong and clinically important Cohen effect size of ubiquinol on E/eꞌ ratio (−3.5). With [ADDRESS_1126913] a very large power of 99% to detect this or larger effect sizes with a 0.05 level of significance (with 
Bonferroni correction for 4 comparisons, since both D -ribose alone and combined with ubiquinol will 
additionally be compared with placebo, and ubiquinol will be compared with ubiquinol + D -ribose). There are 
no studies comparing E/eꞌ ratio on D -ribose versus placebo or on the combination of ubiquinol and D -ribose 
versus placebo. However, our sample sizes will be able to detect effect sizes of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1126914] 90% power. A study  comparing D -ribose with dextrose found a significant improvement in atrial 
velocity with D -ribose, reporting means and SDs that suggest an effect size of about 0.85.
[ADDRESS_1126915] size of 
ubiquinol on PAP observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (−2.8; Table 2) suggests that our sample sizes will provide 99% 
power for at least the ubiquinol -placebo comparison.  
 
Hypothesis #4.  A two -tailed independent samples t -test will be used to test the null hypothesis that the mean 
change in the 6MWT from baseline to the end of 12 weeks in patients taking ubiquinol is different from the mean change for placebo. Comparisons of D -ribose versus placebo, of ubiquinol + D -ribose v ersus placebo, 
and of ubiquinol versus ubiquinol + D -ribose will likewise be made. Our proposed sample sizes (62 per group) 
will allow detecting Cohen effect sizes on the 6MWT of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1126916] 90% power at a nominal 0.[ADDRESS_1126917] size of ubiquinol on a 6-minute walk (3.9), giving us confidence in our design for at least the ubiquinol vs. placebo comparison.  
 
Hypothesis #5.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_813734] a large effect size on B NP (−1.5; Table 2). Thus, 
two-tailed independent samples t -tests comparing changes in BNP from baseline to the end of [ADDRESS_1126918] a large power (99%) for investigating Hypothesis #[ADDRESS_1126919] 90% power.  
 
Hypothesis #6.  The change in lactate/ATP ratio from baseline to [ADDRESS_1126920] the alternative that the mean change in patients on ubiquinol 
will be numerically smaller, which includes the possibility of a negative change. Similar tests will c ompare D -
ribose versus placebo, the combination of ubiquinol + D -ribose versus placebo, and ubiquinol versus ubiquinol 
+ D-ribose. Our sample sizes will give us a power of at least 90% to detect effect sizes of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1126921] of these two indicators (the interaction term), 
gender, and race/ethnicity demographics. Analogous regressions will be conducted with KCCQ subscales, with the POMS Vigor score, as well as with indicator s of left ventricular diastolic function. In addition, this study will 
give us an unparalleled opportunity to: (1) examine the mediating role of the lactate/ATP ratio in the effect of ubiquinol on left ventricular diastolic function in patients; and (2) examine whether there is an interactive effect with synergism on this function when simultaneously administering ubiquinol and D -ribose. A structural 
equation model will be built to explore our mechanistic
87 hypothesis that a reduction in lactate/ATP ratio 
mediates the association between ubiquinol treatment and reduction in E/eꞌ ratio.  We will control for potential 
confounders such as demographics, baseline lactate/ATP ratio, and baseline E/eꞌ ratio. This modeling approach will take full advantage of the fact that subjects will provide measures of lactate/ATP and E/eꞌ ratios at two time points (baseline and 12 weeks), which will allow disentangling the dynamic effects of time, a crucial 
variable in causality analyses. In a published article, [CONTACT_409662] has described the use of structural equations in 
examining mechanistic pharmacological hypotheses of mediation.
[ADDRESS_1126922] of E/eꞌ. To investigate whether ubiquinol and D -
ribose i nteract synergistically, a linear regression model of E/eꞌ change from baseline to week [ADDRESS_1126923] of these two indicators (the interaction term), gender, and race/ethnicity. Analogous regressions will be conducted with other indicators of left ventricular diastolic function. If necessary, transformations will be 
performed to achieve the assumptions of regression models.  
 
Statistical  Analysis of Effect of Treatment Duration . The effect of ubiquinol treatment duration on KCCQ 
Clinical Summary changes will be further investigated by [CONTACT_6486] a random intercept linear model that will use 
the repeated measures provided by [CONTACT_748]. Each subject will contribute to the model if any of the following two measures of the dependent variable are available: (1) a change in KCCQ score from baseline to the end of the 6
th week, and (2) a change from baseline to the end of the 12th week. One dummy variable 
indicating whether the change corresponds to a treatment duration of 6 weeks (dummy=0) or 12 weeks (dummy=1) will be included as an independent variable as well as an indicator of ubiquinol treatment, gender, and race/ethnicity. This analysis will  include subjects with complete or incomplete data. A positive and 
significant regression coefficient for the treatment duration dummy will signal that 6 weeks are not sufficient to obtain a change in KCCQ score equivalent to the change obtained after 12 w eeks of treatment. Further, a 
significant regression coefficient for the ubiquinol treatment indicator will provide additional evidence of differences in KCCQ score changes between ubiquinol and placebo groups. To explore whether there is heterogeneity of ubiquinol effects across subjects, an additional random effects linear model will treat the 
regression coefficient of the ubiquinol indicator as a random coefficient. Analogous analyses will be made with the other continuous variables: POMS Vigor scale, E/ eꞌ ratio, PAP, and BNP and with D -ribose in place of 
ubiquinol. Random effects linear models use the information provided by [CONTACT_813779] . These models are robust to the presence of missing values under 
a missing -at-random assumption. To explore the sensitivity of the models to the presence of possible non-
ignorable missing data, such as missing data caused by [CONTACT_813780]-out, a joint random intercept linear model will be fitted that will simultaneously model the KCCQ score and the missingness process.
[ADDRESS_1126924] Milestones and Timeline. This research proposal is designed to be completed within a 3-year time period (Figure 5). After the arrival of equipment and supplies and hiring of personnel, we will start screening, recruitment, and enrollment of subjects. We will simultaneously collect data on Aims 1 and 2 until we reach the sample size.  Data analyses and publication of the findings will then follow.

PARTICIPATION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
The University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review and approve this study prior to implementation. Recruitment of subjects (patients with diastolic heart failure, or HFpEF) will be conducted by [CONTACT_079] (PI) and research staff including Project Director and Research Associate in Kansas City, Kansas, 
and through the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients with HFpEF will be asked for permission to be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], have the study explained, be invited to participate, and will be provided written informed consent. 
The potential subjects will be informed that the purpose of the study is to examine the effects of oral ubiquinol, D-ribose,  or a combination of the two in treating patients with HFpEF. Consent forms and Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) disclosure information per IRB will be given to all subjects and their signatures will be obtained and witnessed, if  they agree to participate. The consent forms will include a 
description of the study, nature of the data collection, the potential benefits and adverse reactions anticipated, 
and the methods used to ensure confidentiality. The standard care of subjects wi ll not be changed, withdrawn, 
or reduced for any subject in this study. The research team personnel will abide by [CONTACT_813782]. All research staff will keep their required Human Subjects Protection and HIPAA certification current.  
 The University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC)  Tutorial for Human Subjects’ Protection program examines 
the historical context for human subjects’ protection; the foundational principles that govern the ethical conduct 
of research; policies and practices that promote the welfare of research volunteers; and the collective 
responsibilities shared by [CONTACT_8236], faculty, and staff. The KUMC  Tutorial for HIPAA  provides legal and 
ethical information about protected healthcare information. Research regulations are reviewed by [CONTACT_813783]. Training on HIPAA regulations will be conducted for project staff by R. Spaniol, PhD, who directs HIPAA Compliance at the University.  
 
1. Risks to Human Subjects.  
1.1. Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design. The involvement of human subjects in the 
work outlined in the Research Strategy includes two visits to the Clinical and Translational Scientific Unit 
(CTSU), obtaining echocardiograms and digital punctures (finger sticks), completing questionnaires, and 
receiving three follow -up phone calls by [CONTACT_3647] . As suggested by [CONTACT_241244], we will oversample 
minority populations to increase the generalizability of data for minority groups (30% African American (AA), 30% Hispanic/Latino, 30% White, and 10% American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. All patients included in this study will: be 50 years old or older; have left ventricular ejection fraction 
(EF) ≥ 50% documented by [CONTACT_813759] 12 months of enrollment; be diagnosed with HFpEF 
within a 12-month period; HFpEF, have symptoms of dyspnea and [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) 
Classification II or greater symptoms, have a diagnosis of  HFpEF defined by [CONTACT_080]: (1) previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405352] (pulmonary venous hypertension, vascular congestion, interstitial edema, or pleural effusion) of pulmonary congestion, (2) invasive hemodynamics, (3) echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction, (4) elevated NT -pro (>400 pg/ml) or BNP (>200 pg/ml), or 
(5) no use of intermittent sublingual nitroglycerin within 12 months; be 50 years old or older; have left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50% documented by [CONTACT_74295]; are diagnosed with HFpEF within a 6-month period; have willingness to provide informed consent; have a telephone or reliable phone contact; 
and have their own means of transportation to the study site. Patients will be excluded  based on any of the 
following criteria: (1) acute coronary syndrome in the past 12 weeks; (2) significant valvular heart disease; (3) 
severe cardiac fibrosis (galectin-3 level > 26 ng/ml); (4) constrictive pericardium; (5) pulmonary fibrosis; (6) congenital heart disease; (7) hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy; (8) heart transplant; (9) left ventricular assist device ; (10) HF associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813735] 30 days; (11) recent 
percutaneous coronary intervention; (12) significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction; (13) severe cognitive impairment; or (14) consumption of any CoQ10 (ubiquinol) or D -ribose supplements. Hepatic and renal 
dysfunction will be defined as an ICD -10 code with diagnosis of renal and/or hepatic failure in the patient’s 
healthcare record. For retention we will schedule the sessions at a convenient time for each par ticipant.  Two 
nurse practitioners and a cardiologist on this application who work in the outpatient HF clinics will refer patients to the research team.  Also, p otential patients with HFpEF who are in the Frontiers participant registry will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], s creened, and enrolled in the study. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 
eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either ubiquinol (600 mg daily po), D -ribose (15 g daily po), a 
  
 
 
combination of the two, or matched placebo for a period of 12 weeks, using a randomly generated number 
from a statistical software package.  
 
1.2. Sources of Materials. Research material or data collected will be from clinical measurements 
(echocardiograph with speckle tracking software, 6-minute walk tes t), laboratory testing (lactate, ATP, and b- 
natriuretic peptides (BNP)), and questionnaires (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Profile of Mood 
States, and Demographic Questionnaire). Existing patient medical records of current diagnosis, drug list , and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813736]’s permission. All data will be gathered for the explicit 
purposes of this study using procedures to ensure confidentiality. All personal data will be identified by [CONTACT_120467]. A list that links the assigned code number to the subject’s name [CONTACT_813805] a locked file. Only the Project Director and Research Associate will have the access to individually identifiable private information about study subjects. All subjects will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_813784].  
 1.3. Potential Risks.  No appreciable risk of physical, psychological, financial, legal, or other harm to the study 
subjects is expected. Ubiquinol is  naturally produced in the human body, and the safety of high doses of orally -
ingested CoQ10 for long periods is well established.
90-[ADDRESS_1126925] been reported in a small number of subjects; these were not dose-
related and occurred in both ubiquinol and placebo groups.[ADDRESS_1126926] shown that oral 
administration of D -ribose up to 15 g/kg/d is safe. Only minor side effects were reported, including diarrhea, 
gastrointestinal discomfort, and nausea.93-95 The time and efforts required for two visits to the CTSU may be an 
inconvenience to patients with HFpEF , especi ally when they are experiencing symptoms. Subjects may 
experience minimal pain/discomfort from digital puncture, or possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site, especially for subjects who are taking anticoagulant therapy; uncommonly, faintness  is 
associated with the procedure.  Although the potential risks for subjects participating in the 6-minute walk test 
(6MWT) may be changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and lightheadedness, it is often well tolerated and without reported complications.
[ADDRESS_1126927] Director or Research Associate will include structured 
questions that are brief (less than 5 minutes), between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (or other times if specified by [CONTACT_423]), and are neutral in voice and tone.  
 2.1. Recruitment and Informed Consent.  All recruitment, consent, and data forms for the study proposal will 
be submitted to the University’s IRB prior to subject enrollment. Informed consent will be obtained by a trained research team member (either the Project Director or Research Associate) who has completed an approved 
Human Subjects’ protection certification program. Consent includes the standard elements: Study description, potential risks, benefits, and options for non-partic ipation. Prior to proceeding with enrollment, personnel will 
ask the subjects to confirm that they know what components of the study involve. Consent will be documented as a signed form and will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked study office at the CTSU.  In this study, 
recruitment materials will target subjects with HFpEF. Invitation letters and advertisement flyers about the 
study will be sent by [CONTACT_813785] (KUMC). Using this process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_813737] a potential study participant without permission. A 
list of potential subjects who enrolled in the Frontier Participant Registry will also be obtained upon approval by [CONTACT_813786]. In addition, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813721] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335032]) will be used to assist with recruiting 
Black/AA, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 
subjects. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813738]. 
The two nurse practitioners and [CONTACT_813807] at MidAmerica Cardiology will also provide potential HFpEF patients for the research team to approach for participation in the study. Following permission, the Project Director or Research Associate wi ll contact [CONTACT_813787] a scripted approach to discuss the consent 
for the study and to answer all the participant’s questions. If individuals agree to participate in the study, they 
  
 
 
must verbally indicate that they understand the purpose of the study and their rights as participants. The 
returned, signed consent forms will be considered indicative of informed consent for this study. Due to time commitment to the study, subjects will be compensated for their time at each visit to the CT SU. A bonus 
incentive will be paid to subjects that complete two CTSU visits.  
 2.2. Risk Protection. Although no appreciable risk of physical or mental harm is expected to result from the 
proposed protocol, procedures for dealing with adverse effects are established. Participants will be instructed to take the supplements (ubiquinol, D -ribose, a combination, or placebo) with a meal to prevent or minimize 
gastrointestinal symptoms. The procedures listed below will be followed to avert negative reactions to procedures or questions posed during the CTSU visits or the follow -up telephone calls: (1) all subject s will be 
informed that they are free to skip questions, (2) end data collection, (3) not participate in any component of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, or (4) withdraw from the study without changes in their standard or usual medical or nursing care. Subjects will be instructed to report immediately to the PI, Project Director, 
Research Associate, or the cardiologists (consultants) any negative side effects when consuming the 
supplements. Appointments will be cancelled and rescheduled if subjects express an inability to travel for 
scheduled CTSU visits. Furthermore, personnel are trained to discontinue any data collection in which the 
participant becomes emotionally upset or notes discomfort. The Research Associate or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_813739] [ADDRESS_1126928] (explained in the consent form) wil l be assured that they do not have to participate, that their medical 
care will not be affected, or, if already enrolled in the study, that they may withdraw at any time without 
prejudice. In addition, any such concerns will be documented and reported to I RB. 
 
We will use several procedures to protect subjects against the risk of compromising their confidentiality. First is the decoupling of all subjects’ names from all study materials. All forms will make use of a subject code number only, and informed consent forms that include the subject’s signature [CONTACT_574840]. Methods chosen will ensure that patient identifiers and study data are uncoupled. Only selected research staff (the Project Director and Research Associate) will have access to the subjects’ data.  
Information protection procedures are in place specific to the data/communications, Internet computer 
environment. All subjects and staff are informed that subjects’ names and patient medical treatment are not to be discussed or placed on the Internet so that incidental disclosure does not occur.  
 Privacy and security under the HIPAA standards requires six basic concepts; (i) notice, (ii) permission, (iii) access, (iv) security, (v) responsibility, and (vi) oversight .
97 Subjects’ informed consent includes the H IPAA 
compliance documentation approved by [CONTACT_1744]. These documents and privacy concepts were used to develop 
and deliver interventions in other studies without untoward events.98 The research team personnel will abide by 
[CONTACT_813788] P rivacy Protection for Research Subjects.  
 
3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others. 
The administration of oral ubiquinol, D -ribose, or a combination of both to patients with HFpEF will potentially 
reduce the signs and symptoms of heart failure. This would occur by [CONTACT_813789]/or D -ribose enhancing 
cellular energetics in cardiac muscle, thus improving diastolic function and enhancing the health status and 
vigor of patients with HFpEF. The study will generate scientific data that will provide evidence to support 
expanded use of ubiquinol, D -ribose, or a combination in the clinical management of patients with HFpEF. This 
study addresses major problems related to lack of effective treatments for HFpEF in order to reduce morbi dity 
and mortality and strives to improve HFpEF clinical outcomes. With the suggestions of the reviewers, we will 
have more generalizability of data for minorities since there will be oversampling of minority populations.  
 
4. Importance of the Knowledge To Be Gained. 
One benefit of gaining knowledge from this proposed study is to present valid and reliable data from these 
subjects with HFpEF in abstracts and full -length publications so that healthcare practitioners will have a better 
understandi ng of the effectiveness of oral ubiquinol, D -ribose, or both in treating patients with HFpEF. This 
would potentially change the clinical practice of cardiologists and healthcare practitioners in managing HFpEF 
and have a significant impact on implementing new changes in clinical guidelines for HFpEF.  
  
  
 
 
5. Racial/Ethnic Data for Kansans.  
Wyandotte County, Kansas - where the University of Kansas Medical Center is located - is profiled as multi -
cultural, urban-centered, and medically underserved. The 163,[ADDRESS_1126929] densely

6. Recruitment Is from Sites Related to the PI’s Community Involvement. 
This includes the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  Institute for Community Engagement and Frontiers: Heartland 
Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (HERON), Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813740], all of which have HF 
patients signed up to volunteer to participate in HF research. In addition, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813741] 60% Black/AA, 30% Hispanic/Latino, and 
10% other races/ethnicity. Thus, we will screen at least [ADDRESS_1126931]. Smith’s 
recent HF trial, enrolling patients (N=276) from various registries and lists should be feasible.  
 
7. We Proposed Several Research Plans to Overcome An y Problems.  
Potential participants will be identified prospectively by [CONTACT_133563]-America Cardiology nurse study coordinator who reviews electronic medical records for [ADDRESS_1126932]. Smith’s grant have volunteered to become involved in this study.  
 
8. Investigators Involvement in Human Subjects Training. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_813742].   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_813743]-going education 
on the ethical conduct of research for the research team. The five NIH required instructional components (format, subject matter, faculty participation, duration, and frequency) are discussed herein.  At each team 
quarterly meeting (duration and frequency)  a standing agenda item will be core conduct of research topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. NIH 
recommends including conflict of interest, policies regarding human and animal subjects, research team members’ responsibilities in collaborative research, peer review processes, quality data acquisition, and coding (subject matter). Samples of research misconduct and policies on responsible authorship and publication 
(subject matter) are reviewed. In the past meetings, formats of instruction have included report readings of NIH 
human subjects concerns, case study reviews, discussions regarding any current study issues arising from consultant input or collaborative work (f ormat). We will invite our KUMC faculty  leading the KUMC monthly 
ethics seminar/discussions to l ead (faculty participation) some of these discussions on human and data safety 
and monitoring of scientific rigor and human safety .  All staff members undertake the required human subjects 
research training, pledge to maintain the highest levels of scienti fic quality, and strive for meaningful 
translational influence of findings.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). 
The DSMP for this study follows the NIH policies and also policies of the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Office of Sponsored Projects, written by [CONTACT_813790]. This plan will be approved and annually recertified by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) at the KUMC and carried out by [CONTACT_813791] (DSMB). This plan will be completed by [CONTACT_87110], following rev iew of the National 
Institute of Aging (NIA) Policy (if funded by [CONTACT_813792]). The DSMB chairperson will send all reports to NIH 
and to our KUMC IRB . 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1126933] an acceptable safety profile as a dietary supplement with multiple daily doses. The potential risk to study participants for ubiquinol includes  mild gastrointestinal symptoms at high 
doses around 1000 mg/day.  For D -ribose oral administration of D -ribose up to 15 g/kg/d is safe. Minor side 
effects include diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and slight nausea. Subjects may experience minimal pain/discomfort from digital puncture, possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site, especially for subjects who are taking anticoagulant therapy; uncommonly faintness is associated with the procedure. Although the potential risks for subjects participating in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) may be changes in 
blood pressure, heart rate, and lightheadedness, it is often well tolerated and without reported complications.  
 
The potential benefits to study participants include improved energy level, increased overall health status (reduced physical limitations, less symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), increased self -efficacy, expanded social interactions, and improved quality of life), and enhanced cardiac 
performance.  
 1.2. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
Adverse occurrences or unanticipated problems reported by a subject during the course of their participation in the study will be immediately documented according to study protocol. A report will be sent to IRB if the adverse events is serious, unexpected, and related to the study. We will report to the DSMB and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) administrator all serious adverse events. For each occurrence, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_813744]-I will evaluate independently to determine severity, expectedness, and attribution of the 
occurrence to the study protocol or not and report to NIA, IRB, and DSMB if required per policy.  
Determinations regarding adverse and serious adverse events will be made by [CONTACT_813793], MD who is the 
designated cardiologist on the study who is unblinded. After [CONTACT_813807] makes this final determination, the 
adverse event will be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Janet Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835] (PI) or [CONTACT_813808] (Co-PI) to the NIA and Chair of the DSMB ([CONTACT_813809]).  All DSMB members are available in real time to review and recommend appropriate 
actions regarding any adverse or unanticipated events or other safety issues.
 Any action taken to suspend or 
terminate the project will be reported immediately to KUMC IRB, NIH Office of Sponsored Projects, and the study Program Officer at NIA.  
 
1.3. Protection Against Study Risks  
Informed Consent Process:  The consent process will inform a volunteer about the study, indicating the 
participation is voluntary and he/she has the right to stop at any time. Risks will be enumerated in the informed 
consent form and described orally during the consent process.  
 
Protection Against Risks:  Although no appreciable risk of physical or mental harm is expected to result from 
the proposed protocol, procedures for dealing with adverse effects are established. Participants will be 
instructed to take the supplements (ubiquinol, D -ribose, a combination, or placebo) with a meal to prevent or 
minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The procedures listed below will be followed to avert negative reactions to procedures or questions posed during the CTSU visits or the follow -up telephone calls: 1) all subjects will be 
informed that they are free to skip questions, 2) end data collection, 3) not participate in any component of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, or 4) withdraw from the study without changes in their standard or usual medical or nursing care. Subjects will be instructed to report immediately to the PI, Project Director,  
Research Associate or the cardiologists (consultants) any negative side effects when consuming the supplements. Appointments will be cancelled and rescheduled if subjects express an inability to travel for 
scheduled CTSU visits. Furthermore, personnel are trained to discontinue any data collection in which the 
participant becomes emotionally upset or notes discomfort. The Research Associate or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_813739] 911, if immediate medical assistance is required. Subjects who express worry or distress from perceived loss of privacy, have concerns about inconvenience or rights as a research subject (explained in the consent form), will be assured that they do not have to participate, that their medical 
  
 
 
care will not be affected, or if already enrolled in the study that they may withdraw at any time without 
prejudice. In addition, any such concerns will be documented and reported to IRB.  
 
2.0 Interim Analysis  
There are no advance plans for interim and/or futility analysis at this time.  
 
3.0 Data and Safety Monitoring 
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. The DSMB will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor participant safety, eval uate the progress of the 
study, to review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses.  
 3.1. Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring 
The DSMB will meet annually to evaluate the study progr ess, either in-person or by [CONTACT_753512], data quality, and participants safety.
 The PI ([CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_835]) will be informed of serious 
adverse events as soon as they occur and will notify the NIA and the DSMB within 2 business days of notification.
 
 3.2. Content of Data and Safety Monitoring Report

structur e, and organization and rules of operation, as noted in the policies. All trial progress and DSMB advice 
on continuation, modification, or termination are reported to the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_813810][INVESTIGATOR_835]), IRB, and the NIA Program Officer.  
 3.3. DSM B Membership and Affiliation 
Each of the individuals will formally accept the position as part of the DSMB and the DSMB membership will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_6059]. Should there be any questions regarding the independence of the DSMB, it will be ad dressed and corrected if necessary at that time. This DSMB will include external scientists 
(cardiologist, supplemental specialist, and a biostatistician) selected and chosen by [CONTACT_45455].  
 3.4. Conflict of Interest for DSMB’s  
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study investigators or intervention. Each DSMB 
member will sign a Conflict of Interest Statement which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology companies (e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study objectives.  
 3.5. Protection of Confidentiality

Inclusion of Women and Minorities. 
Subjects may participate regardless of gender, socioeconomic level, or ethnic background. All subjects will be 
50 years or over, as HFpEF is more prevalent in older adults. National statistics  show the prevalence of heart 
failure to be divided roughly equally between males and females.102 Efforts will be made to recruit 50% 
females, which is the actual proportion of HFpEF patients in Kansas City.  
 
The regional HF statistics indicate are: 10% Black/African Americans (AA), 13% Hispanic/Latino, 76% White, 
and 1% Asian, Native American/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. The racial and ethnic population distribution planned coincides with these national and regional figures. The Kansas City Metropolitan Statistical Area confirms these percentages in the general population.
99 In this study, we will 
oversample minorities (reviewer’s suggestion), which will enable us to examine the relationship between HFpEF and racial/ethnic differences. Most of the data regarding treatments for HFpEF are derived from white populations,
27 and therefore it is important to include other racial/ethnic groups and examine whether the 
effects of ubiquinol and/or D -ribose follow similar patterns to those among whites. For this study, a total of 276 
subjects will be randomized to one of the four groups.  As suggested by [CONTACT_241244], we will oversample 
minority populations to increase the generalizability of data for minorit y groups (30% Black/AA, 30% 
Hispanic/Latino, 30% White, and 10% Other). Each group will be Black/AA = 21, Hispanic/Latino = 21,  White = 
21, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander = 6 (Total = 69). The University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration (HERON) database, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813721] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335032]), and chronic HF clinic at the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (KUH) will be used to recruit subjects. These registries provide clinical/translational investigators with the 
numbers of patients at KUH who meet the inclusion criteria for clinical trials and contact [CONTACT_813794]’s Frontiers participant registry. Based on the HERON, there will be approximately 7,100 subjects with HFpEF available to be screened for enrollment in this study. The Swope Health Services in Kansas City, Missouri has a large Black/AA and Hispanic/Latino population. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813745] a relationship with Swope Health Services and can assist us with electronic informed consent forms, email verification, and subject recruitment at this site.  
 
  
  
 
 
Inclusion of Children. 
All subjects will be 50 years or over, as HFpEF is more prevalent in older adults. Children (the age to 18 years 
and younger) will not  be included in this study because diastolic heart failure is very rare in the pediatric 
population.  
   
  
 
 
Ubiquinol  
 
D-ribose  
 Appendix 9: Safety and Efficacy of Ubiquinol (CoQ10) and D -ribose  
 
 Ubiquinol  
Safety 
 
• CoQ10 is generally well tolerated at doses not exceeding 1000 mg/day.11, 103, 104 
• Occasionally, a side effect is gastrointestinal upset, which is significantly reduced if CoQ10 is taken with 
food. Several studies have reported that patients tolerated ubiquinol well and that they had no adverse side effects.
105-107 
• For this study, we will use Kaneka ubiquinol which is the only ubiquinol ingredient made in the [LOCATION_003]. The Kaneka ubiquinol will have pure ubiquinol and be free of the following (does NOT  contain): sugar, 
starch, salt, preservatives, corn, soy, wheat, dairy, gluten, mold, or metals. The ubiquinol will be Kosher and Vegan/Vegetarian.  
• Kaneka ubiquinol has a Current Good Manufacturing Practi ce (CGMP) certification by [CONTACT_813795] (FDA).  This assures proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes, and facilities at Kaneka.  They also have a certificate of analysis for the ubiquinol product.  
• Kaneka QH has the National Safety Foundation (NSF) certification to be 100% pure without fillers or 
additives. The NSF is a Public Health and Safety Organization that certifies dietary supplements to 
ensure through testing and evaluations that a product is safe.  
• There are no established toxic effects of CoQ10 supplementation in humans, and CoQ10 has an 
excellent safety profile.
11 
• Administration of 300 mg of ubiquinol (Kaneka QH) has significant absorption of ubiquinol from the gastrointestinal tract, and no safety concerns on standard laboratory tests for safety or on assessment of adverse events.
91 
• In our study, we shall advise subjects to take ubiquinol with food to reduce the potential for 
gastrointestinal upset.108 
• Ubiquinol needs to be protected from extreme heat and light.  It should be stored in a cool and dry 
place.  
• The ubiquinol dosage of 600 mg/day is well within the clinically recommended range. Several studies 
have indicated that CoQ10 produced no adverse effects or drug interactions.109-112 
 
Efficacy 
 
• Low serum CoQ10 levels may result from excessive use, impairment of biosynthesis, insufficient dietary intake, or any combination of the three.
113, 114 
• In heart failure patients, it is necessary to increase serum CoQ10 levels to a minimum of 3.5 mcg/mL to achieve clinical benefits.
115 
• Administering ubiquinone in some studies resulted in poor gastrointestinal absorption. In addition, the ability to convert ubiquinone to ubiquinol (active form) was decreased.
116-119  This conversion is not an 
issue for individuals in the 20-40 year age range120, 121 but it becomes increasing difficult for individuals 
older than the age of 40.122, 123 
• With the use of ubiquinol, there is no impairment of absorption in patients of any age. With the 
introduction of ubiquinol the efficacy has greatly increased in many diseases105, 124, 125 including 
congestive heart failure.126, 127 
   
 
Safety 
 
• D-ribose is safe and well tolerated in the daily doses smaller than 20 grams.128-130 In this study, subjects 
will be consuming 15 grams/day. Subjects may experience loose stools. This effect can be 
  
 
 
Placebo Products – Capsules and Powder  circumvented by [CONTACT_3726] D -ribose ingestion on an empty stomach or by [CONTACT_813796] 5 gram doses at 
various times of the day.  
• For the study, we will use Dual Health 100% Pure D -Ribose Powder. It is a pharmaceutical USP Grade 
D-Ribose that is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder, characterized by a fruity sweet odor and 
slightly sweet taste.  
• The Dual Health D -ribose is produced in the [LOCATION_003] and from a CGMP manufacturer and has a certificate 
of analysis for the product.  
• The D -ribose from Dual Health is [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (USP) and Food Chemical Codex ( FCC) 
graded and is 100% pure without fillers or additives. Thus, it is a certified dietary supplement that through testing and evaluations is a safe product for human consumption.  
• D-ribose readily dissolves in water, juice, milk, and other cold liquids and has been determined to be 
safe with few adverse side effects.
131 
• D-ribose may lower blood pressures  132 
 
Efficacy 
 
• Impairment of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis results in energy demand exceeding energy supply, which results in depletion of ATP accompanied by [CONTACT_91148]. Research has shown that supplementing exogenous D -ribose accelerated synthesis of ATP by [CONTACT_173265] -fold.
133 
• Increased ATP levels by D -ribose improved cardiac energy metabolism and contributed to significant 
recovery of myocardial contractility.134,135 
• D-ribose significantly improved diastolic function and patients’ exercise tolerance, which enhanced 
patients’ quali ty of life.71 
 
 
Combined Regimen of Ubiquinol and D -ribose  
 
 
• Reports have shown no evidence for adverse interactions between CoQ10 and D -ribose.136 They 
reported these supplements enhanced low and high-intensity exercise. There were no side effects in animal studies using these supplements thus investigators stated that they were safe for human consumption.
137 
• Several studies have used the combination of antioxidants together for the treatment of patients with 
mitochondrial dysfunction. They found that D -ribose or ubiquinol with other antioxidants such as vitamin 
C, methylcobalamin, and N -acetyl -L-cysteine resulted in significant improvement with no acc ompanying 
side effects.138-140 
• The combination of these supplements has contributed to the cardiac function by [CONTACT_813797].  
 
   
Safety 
 
• To reduce the risk of allergic reaction, all the placebo products (capsules and/or powder) will be free-from the eight most common food allergens in the [LOCATION_002], as declared by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA).
141 
• Both the placebo capsules and powder will contain no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, and no peanuts/tree nuts.  
• All placebo products will be manufactured at a pharmaceutical packaging facility that is certified by [CONTACT_813798] (CGMP) facilities and also FDA registered and inspected. This company 
will produce placebos to match our comparators (both the ubiquinol and D -ribose). Stark pharmacy in 
Overland Park, KS will prepare, package, and label the placebo capsules and powder.  
  
  
 
 
Placebo Products – Capsules and Powder 
Label Information from Stark Pharmacy  Efficacy 
 
• The inactive ingredients within the placebo capsule will have microcrystalline cellulose in each capsule. 
The capsules will be the same color and size and in the same type of plastic container.  
• The ubiquinol and placebo capsules will both be non-marked light brown color, oval shape capsules.  
The study product and placebo capsules will be similar in capsule odor, texture, hardness, and packaging.  
• The D -ribose powder will be a pure product that has no inactive ingredients. Thus, the placebo powder 
will also not have inactive ingredients and consist of only microcrystalline cellulose.  Both powders will be white in color, similar consistency, and in the same type of plastic container.  
  
 
 
 Below are examples of the bottle labels that will be provided by [CONTACT_813799]. The first label (#1) will be used for the ubiquinol or placebo capsules. The second label (#2) will be used for either the D -ribose or 
placebo powder.

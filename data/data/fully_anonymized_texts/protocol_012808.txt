Rationale for this Study  
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with limited 
treatment options and very poor prognosis for metastatic disease, with median progression- free survival with chemotherapy ranging from 2.5 to 4 months. In addition, 
there is limited effective targeted therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC with the exception of tumors with germline BRCA mutation, which highlights TNBC as an area 
of unmet need.   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis demonstrated that the most frequent loss -
of-function and gain-of-function alterations in TNBC involve genes associated with DNA damage repair and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, 
including the axis of PI3K -mTOR -Akt /PTEN loss. Non-basal subtypes (i.e. LAR, M 
and MSL) demonstrated relatively high PIK3CA –activating mutations and exhibit 
sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in vitro . In addition, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has 
shown activity in basal -like TNBC.  Nevertheless, use of PI3K inhibitors as single agent 
therapy has proven minimally effective secondary to multiple feedback mechanisms. Combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579765] , and we are 
conducting a phase I/IB study combining eribulin with everolimus in metastatic TNBC 
as one such strategy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
Another strategy utilizing  this pathway revolves around AKT. Ipatasertib (GDC -0068) 
is a novel selective ATP -competitive small -molecule inhibitor of AKT that preferentially 
targets active phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and is potent in cell lines with evidence of Akt activation. Ipatasertib displays synergy when combined with taxanes or other 
chemotherapeutic agents (Gemcitabine, platinum, 5-FU, doxorubicin(1), paclitaxel) in vitro. In a phase I study, ipatasertib was well -tolerated with a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of [ADDRESS_761985] common adverse 
events were grade 1– 2 diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, and hyperglycemia. In the Phase 
Ib study, ipatasertib combined with docetaxel or mFOLFOX6, was well -tolerated with 
evidence of anti -tumor activity and MTD of 600mg daily. Currently, the combination of 
paclitaxel  (80mg/m2, days 1, 8,15 every 4 weeks) and ipatasertib (400mg daily 3 
weeks on and 1 week off) are being studied in both the metastatic setting  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and the neoadjuvant setting ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in TNBC. In the LOTUS 
trial, combination of paclitaxel 80mg/m2 (days 1, 8 & 15) and ipatasertib 400mg po 
days 1-21 every 28 days has shown modestly -improved PFS. The combination 
regimen was well-tolerated with 23% of grade ≥3 diarrhea and  18% grade 3 
 
  
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 3 neutropenia.   
 
The combination of ipatasertib with single DNA -damaging agents is another potential  
strategy  for synergy. DNA -damaging agents such as platinum drugs (cisplatin and 
carboplatin) are active in TNBC. In the randomized TNT trial, single-agent carboplatin 
was compared to single- agent docetaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC. Patients 
with TNBC and germline BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_761986] a higher response 
rate and longer progress ion-free survival rates favoring carboplatin over docetaxel . 
Weekly paclitaxel (100mg/m2) was combined with weekly carboplatin AUC 2, days 1, 
8, and [ADDRESS_761987] cancer patients . The 
regimen was effective with a response rate of 62% and was well tolerated with a grade 
3/4 neutropenia rate of 35%. Other grade 3/4 toxicities included neuropathy (11%), 
infection (6%), weakness (6%), anemia (5%), and paresthesia (3%). This study 
showed that weekly carboplatin/ paclitaxel produces response rates comparable with those seen with the q3w schedule, but with a more favorable toxicity profile. A high 
proportion of TNBC tumor s exhibit BR CAness -like status, which indicate these 
tumors are highly sensitive to platinum salts.  
 In the patient -derived xenograft model of mTNBC, carboplatin and ipatasertib were 
synergistic in tumor suppression (unpublished data). Based on this evidence, w e 
hypothesize that carboplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel plus the Akt inhibitor ipatasertib will have a synergistic effect in TNBC. Hence arms (A and B) of this clinical trial are designed to determine the dose and safety of the doublet ipatasertib/carboplatin and triplet combination ipatasertib/carboplatin/paclitaxel and obtain initial evidence of 
efficacy.  
 
The Impassion130 study demonstrated the addition of atezolizumab (anti -PD-L1) to 
nab-paclitaxel improved PFS and OS outcomes in PD -L1 positive mTNBC in the first 
line setting. It remains unknown whether non-taxane chemo + anti -PD-1/L1 will be 
beneficial in mTNBC. CREATE-X study that supports the use of adjuvant capecitabine 
for patients who have residual disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Given these data, as well as promising data supporting the use of immune checkpoint 
inhibition (ICI) in TNBC, there is a strong interest in testing the combination of an ICI in 
combination with capecitabine. In a phase IB study, the combination of ipatasertib, atezolizumab and paclitaxel or nab- paclitaxel showed a promising response rate of 
73% in a cohort of 26 patients with unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic TNBCs previously untreated in the metastatic setting.  Interestingly, responses were high 
irrespective of PD-L1 status or PI3K/AKT/PTEN alteration status (2).In the third arm of 
this study, arm C, we aim to test the combination of ipatasertib, capecitabine and 
atezolizumab in patients with mTNBC. 
 As a result, in the current trial, we will study  the following combinations in patients with 
metastatic TNBCs: carboplatin+ ipatasertib, carboplatin + paclitaxel + ipatasertib, 
capecitabine + atezolizumab + ipatasertib. The primary objective is to determine the 
recommended starting dose for each combination, further evaluate the safety of the combinations and obtain initial evidence of activity . In addition, blood and tumor samples are collected for correlative analysis in order to identify potential biomarker s 
associated with response to therapy.

Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed  
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will undergo the full informed consent process. 
Prior to starting treatment, all subjects will undergo history and physical exam, and 
laboratory studies including CBC, diff, chemistry, liver function tests, INR/PTT, and 
viral serology .  
 
Baseline disease will be documented with brain MRI with contrast, bone scan and CT 
scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, or PET-CT as long as there is a diagnostic CT component (within 35 days prior to starting treatment).  
 All subjects will have cardiac function evaluation (within 30 days prior to starting 
treatment) using an EKG.  
 
CBC with differential and comprehensive serum chemistry panel will be performed on Day 1 , 8, 15 of each 4-week cycle and on chemotherapy infusion days through the 
duration of the study. The study team will monitor the CBCs for dose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) evaluation during the first 4 weeks of the study.  
 
Restaging imaging (CT, bone scan if indicated) will be repeated every 12 weeks (+/-
7days). At screening, staging imaging within 35 days (5 weeks) of study entry is allowed. Reading and comparison of two prior staging imaging (3 month and 6 month 
prior to study entry) are required to document SD per RECIST version 1.1.  
 
 
  
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 9 During screening, brain imaging will be performed in subjects with known  untreated or 
unstable brain metastases (such subjects also need records of brain imaging 
performed within the last 3 months prior to screening to establish stability).  
 
Tumor biopsies  will be obtained prior to study initiation, at Cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1)  and 
at end of study. If fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible at study entry, archived formalin-
fixated paraffin-embedded tumor tissue procured within [ADDRESS_761995] be submitted to study team at time of patient registration. When a core needle 
biopsy is used, a minimum of 4 core biopsy samples with a minimum 18 gauge needle is required.  
 Peripheral blood samples will be obtained at baseline (Day 1 cycle 1, D1C1), as well as Day 1 of cycles 2, 4 and end-of-treatment visit. Three tubes  (1 x 10 ml green-top, 1 
x 10 ml  Streck tube (Cell -free DNA BCT ®) and 1 x 10 ml lavender -top) of blood will be 
collected and delivered to the correlative study PI’s laboratory. Peripheral blood or biopsy sample can be taken at end of treatment if patient was off trial due to reasons 
other than disease progression.  
 Stool sample will be collected at baseline, C4 D1 and end-of-treatment visit for 
microbiome and calprotectin analysis.  Patient reported outcome measured by [CONTACT_26740] -C30 questionnaire  will be 
completed by [CONTACT_252479] C1D1, then every 3 month at the tumor assessment visit, and up to 3 and 6 months after radiological disease progression. The questionnaire should 
be completed before the patient receives any information on disease status and prior 
to the performance of non-PRO assessments and the administration of study 
treatment.  
 
 
Statistical Considerations 
Statistical Design for Arm A and B:  This is a Phase I trial of ipatasertib plus either 
carboplatin or carboplatin/ paclitaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC.   
 Phase: I/IB  
Purpose: Safety and Initial Evidence of Efficacy  
 The combination of paclitaxel and ipatasertib have been well -tolerated and the 
recommended phase II dose is ipatasertib 400mg po daily 3 weeks on/1 week off, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 days 1, 8,15 of every 4 week cycle. Two dosing regimens will be 
tested in this study. In triplet schedule A, carboplatin AUC 2, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 will be added on day 1, 8 and 15 of every 4 weeks cycle while patients receive ipatasertib of 400mg daily. In doublet schedule B, carboplatin AUC2 on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days will be added to ipatasertib 400mg daily continuous dosing. 
 Primary Objective:  
To determine the recommended Phase II dose of ipatasertib plus either carboplatin or 
carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
  
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 10 1. To confirm the recommended Phase II dose safety in an expanded cohort.  
2. To evaluate progression- free survival, overall survival and response.  
3. Further describe the cumulative toxicities of the combinations  
4.   To evaluate patient’s quality of life (QOL)  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  Preliminary data suggests a better response to ipatasertib in patients with PTEN loss/ 
PIK3CA-Akt mutated breast tumors. TNBC sub-typi[INVESTIGATOR_579766]. DNA exome-sequencing via NGS will be used for detecting genomic alterations. These genomic alterations will be associated with clinical  responses. The 
frequency and role of PTEN loss, PIK3CA-Akt pathway status, and BRCA mutation status will be tested as correlatives. The association of stool microbiome and 
calprotectin with diarrhea will also be studied.  
 Phase I/Ib Design:  
We will use the Phase I Queue (IQ) 3+3 design that ensures patient risk does not exceed the maximum risk permitted in the traditional 3+[ADDRESS_761996] been conducted, including NCI/CTEP 
studies based on the 3+3 risk constraints  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . This 
method has been shown (JSM 2016) to reduce study duration by [CONTACT_579810] 23% for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_122666] I study, with a median increase in the number of patients of 1-4, while reducing the number of patients turned away due to lack of slots. The details of the design are described in section 3. (see Phase I Queue (IQ) 
3+3 table which also has a side-by -side comparison with the classic 3+3 design).  
 To confirm the recommended Phase II dose obtained from the dose escalation, and for an initial assessment of response, correlatives and PFS estimates, we will enroll an additional cohort of patients until the number treated and evaluable for DLT 
considerations at the recommended phase II dose is 14 patients for the doublet (Arm 
B) and for the triplet Arm (Arm A) 
  All eligible patients who start treatment at the recommended Phase II dose will be considered in the calculation of the response rate. 
 
Sample size for Arm A and B: Expected sample size (if level 1 is well -tolerated) is 14 
patients for both the doublet and triplet, for an expected total sample-size of 28 patients. Additional cohorts of 6-8 patients will be required if lower doses are 
necessary (e.g. level 1 is not well -tolerated) for each Arm.   
 
Statistical Design for Arm C:  
Clinical Statistics: For the safety -lead in, a 3 at risk design will be utilized to assess 
toxicity for the combination therapy as per Table C in Protocol [ZIP_CODE]. The DLT period 
is 1-cycle (28 days).  
Each participant will remain on the dosing level according to the escalation dose level 
they were enrolled in, and intra-dose level escalations will not be allowed, even if the 
MTD is defined at a higher dose level. Rules for escalation are given in Table C. If a 
patient comes off study in the first 28 days for any reason outside of toxicity (unrelated

Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 11 AE, withdrawal of consent, progression of disease etc), this patient will not be 
considered as evaluable for DLT and this patient should be replaced.  
When a maximum tolerable dose level has been defined by [CONTACT_579811], and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D not to exceed the 
MTD) has been selected,  additional patients will be accrued to confirm the tolerability of the regimen.  Specifically, at least 12 patients will be treated at the RP2D to confirm tolerability.  Additional patients (beyond the 12 at the RP2D can be accrued if the total 
number of patients accrued does not exceed 21 patients With 12 patients, any specific severe toxicity with 20% incidence will be observed with 93% probability.  
Secondary Objectives:
 Clinical activity will be described based on the secondary 
objectives, with a description of the activity based on PD-L1 status.  Survival endpoints will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Other correlative studies are considered exploratory in the context of this limited Phase I study; however, w hen 
the sample size is 12, a single group t-test with a 0.[ADDRESS_761997] 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.766.

common cause of cancer -related mortality in women, with a 5-year survival rate 
following metastatic diagnosis of approximately 15% ( Jemal et al. 2011; Ferlay et al. 
2015).  
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 20% of all breast cancers and is defined by [CONTACT_294824] (<1%) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and non-amplified human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) expression per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and 
College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines ( ASCO/CAP 2010, 2013). Patients 
with metastatic TNBC exhibit a particularly poor clinical outcome, generally with rapid progres sion and a median overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 16 months 
(Rodler et al. 2010; Miles et al . 2013 ). Although TNBC may respond to chemotherapy, 
including taxanes, there are no approved first-line targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571766]. Because of an increase in toxicity and little 
survival benefit with combination chemotherapy, treatment with sequential single agents is generally preferred (Cardoso et al.  2017; NCCN 2017). Paclitaxel is considered an 
appropri ate first-line regimen, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 
approximately 6 months in patients with TNBC ( Miles et al. 2013; Miles et al. 2017). 
There is a pressing need for clinically active agents for the triple-negative subtype of metastati c breast cancer. 
PI3K/Akt Pathway in Breast Cancer  
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway is more frequently activated by [CONTACT_294825] (LoRusso 2016). The most common genetic alterations in this pathway are activating mutations of 
phosphatidylinositol -4, 5 −bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit, alpha (PIK3CA), 
loss-of-function alterations of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(PTEN ), deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and amplification and 
mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012; Millis et al . 
2015). Alterations in Akt itself, including amplification and overexpression of individual 
Akt isoforms, as well as activating mutations in Akt, have been identified in a subset of human cancers (Bellacosa et al. 2005; Brugge et al. 2007; Tokunaga et al. 2008). All of 
these mechanisms of pathway activation ultimately funnel through Akt as the central node that drives cell survival, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism, and migration (Manning and Cantley 2007).  
Large-scale comprehensive genomic analyses have characterized the heterogeneous 
nature of TNBC, including a subgroup with a PI3K/Akt pathway activation signature [CONTACT_571868] [CONTACT_23587]3CA or AKT1 activating mutations and PTEN alterations  (Cancer 
Genome Atlas  Network 2012). Overall, PIK3CA/AKT1 /PTEN -altered tumors are 
Page 22 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762010] cancer, and are reported in approximately 35% of patients 
with TNBC and in approximately 50% of HR+ /HER2 − breast cancers (Cancer Genome 
Atlas Network, 2012).  
To date, the relationship between PI3K/Akt pathway activation and prognosis in early 
breast cancer is mixed, with some data demonstrating association with favorable outcomes, some data with poor prognosis, and a number of studies showing insignificant 
results (Y ang et al. 2016). Information demonstrating significant differences in the 
prevalence of these gene alterations between primary and metastatic tumor tissues is limited, while enrichment in metastatic patients is probable (Millis et al. 2015).  
 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON IPATASERTIB  
Ipatasertib is a potent, highly selective small -molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of 
the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Ipatasertib binds to the activated conformation of Akt and 
is ATP competitive . Ipatasertib binding inhibits the kinase activity of Akt and suppresses 
the phosphorylation of its direct substrates, including PRAS40, and additional downstream targets, such as S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), resulting in G
[ADDRESS_762011] and/or 
apoptosis in human cancer cells (Lin et al. 2012). In clinical tumor samples, robust Akt 
pathway inhibition by [CONTACT_571804] (Yan et al. 2013). 
Upregulation of Akt signaling (whether intrinsic or induced following chemotherapy) represents a potentially important survival pathway in response to genotoxic/mitotic stress (Xu et al. 2012). Activation of Akt signaling following chemotherapy (including 
taxanes) may promote cell survival and chemoresistance across several cancer models, including breast cancer (Clark et al. 2002). Conversely, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway in diverse cancers leads to radiosensitization and/or chemosensitization (Brognard et al. 2001; Solit et al. 2003; Wallin et al. 2010).  
In nonclinical models with high levels of phosphorylated Akt or PI3K/Akt pathway activity (i.e., PIK3CA mutation, PTEN  alterations), sensitivity to ipatasertib has been observed 
across different tumor models, including breast cancers (Lin et al. 2013). Additionally, 
ipatasertib plus microtubule inhibitors or DNA -damaging chemotherapeutic agents 
showed a clear advantage over respective single-agent treatment in preclinical models (refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for further information).  
Based on the scientific rationale that PI3K/Akt blockade attenuates survival signals 
associated with mitotic stress from treatment with microtubule inhibitors and the high 
prevalence of PI3K/Akt pathway activation signatures in TNBC and in HR +/HER2 − 
tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012), clinical trials evaluating the preliminary 
safety and efficacy of the combination of ipatasertib and paclitaxel in patients with breast 
cancer have been conducted. These trials include a Phase Ib study with an expansion 
Page 23 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 23 cohort of patients with HER2−  breast cancer (Study P AM4983g, Arm C) and a 
randomized Phase II study (GO29227, LOTUS) comparing ipatasertib  + paclitaxe l versus 
placebo  + paclitaxel as first-line treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced or 
metastatic TNBC.  
In the Phase Ib study PAM4983g, 3 of the 15 patients (20%) with breast cancer 
remained progression free for >  6 months (HR+ /HER2 −: n  = 2; TNBC: n  = 1), and 4 partial 
responses included patients who had prior exposure to paclitaxel or investigational PI3K inhibitors (HR +/HER2 −: n
 = 2; TNBC: n  = 2). 
In the randomized Phase II study GO29227, one of the objectives was to investigate the 
added benefit of ipatasertib to paclitaxel in the subgroup of patients with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors. Results from  this study showed improvement in 
median PFS in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population (hazard ratio  = 0.60; 6.2 months in the 
ipatasertib a rm compared with 4.9 months in the control arm ); and more pronouncedly in 
the pre-specified patient population with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors (hazard 
ratio  = 0.44; 9 months vs. 4.9 months). 
Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure for details  on nonclinical and clinical 
studies, including single -agent activities in the Phase I study (PAM4743g ). 
 
1.3 BACKGROUND ON CARB OPLA TIN 
DNA- damaging agents such as platinum drugs (cisplatin and carboplatin) are active in 
TNBC. T he randomized TNT trial, single-agent carboplatin was compared to single-
agent docetaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC. Patients with TNBC and ger mline 
BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_762012] a higher response rate and longer progress -free 
survival rates favoring carboplatin over docetaxel  (Tutt et al.  2015) . Weekly paclitaxel 
(100mg/m2) was combined with weekly carboplatin AUC 2, days 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_762013] cancer patient. The regimen was effective 
with a response rate of 62% and well tolerated with a grade ¾ neutropenia rate of 35%. 
Other grade 3/4 toxicities included neuropathy (11%), infection (6%), weakness (6%), 
anemia ( 5%), and paresthesia (3%)  (Loesch et al. 2002) . This study showed that weekly 
carboplatin/ paclitaxel produces response rates comparable with those seen with the 
q3w schedule, but with a more favorable toxicity profile (Loesch et al. 2002) . A high 
proportion of TNBC tumor exhibit BRCAness -like status,  which indicate these tumors 
are highly sensitive to platinum salts.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_762014] cancer remains an incurable disease. For patients with locally 
advanced and metastatic TNBC, clinical outcome is particularly poor, generally with 
rapid progression and a median OS of approximately 16 months (Rodler et al. 2010; 
Page 24 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 24 Miles et al. 2013). For patients with HR +/HER2 − breast cancer who are not appropriate 
candidates for endocrine therapy, OS with first-line chemotherapy with week ly 
single-agent paclitaxel is approximately 28 months (Miles et al. 2013; Miles et al. 2017).  
Results of the Phase II randomized Study GO29227 demonstrated that adding 
ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic 
TNBC improves PFS in the ITT and in PTEN -low populations; the PFS improvement was 
more pronounced in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors identified with the 
FoundationOne next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay (representing approximately 40% of the randomized patients in this setting). The use of PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -
alteration status  as a predictive biomarker for response to the com bination of ipatasertib 
and paclitaxel in metastatic TNBC is further supported by [CONTACT_579812]3CA/AKT1/PTEN non-altered tumors. 
The clinical safety profile of ipatasertib as a single agent in the Phase Ia 
study (PAM4743g) and in combination with paclitaxel in the Phase Ib (PAM4983g) and 
Phase II (GO29227) s tudies  supports continued development in metastatic breast 
cancer. As a single agent, ipatasertib has a predictable pharmacokinetic  (PK) profile with 
a half-life of approximately 48 hours  and significantly downregulates the PI3K/Akt 
pathway at doses ≥
 [ADDRESS_762015] notably ipatasertib-related gastrointestinal toxicities that are 
manageable and reversible. Common adverse events with a ≥ 10% higher incidence in 
the ipatasertib arm than in the placebo arm were diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy. Common Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included diarrhea, 
neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, and fatigue. When groupi[INVESTIGATOR_579768], asthenia/fatigue and peripheral 
neuropathy were not significantly different between the two arms (refer to the Ipatasertib 
Investigator’s Brochure for detailed safety information). 
In Study GO29227, diarrhea was more common in the ipatasertib arm compared with 
the placebo arm (93% vs. 19%); however, the majority of cases were low grade. The 
onset of diarrhea was most common within the first cycle; late onset diarrhea was rare, and no cases of colitis were reported. Diarrhea generally responded to loperamide 
treatment and to ipatasertib dose holds and dose reductions when resuming treatment; limited (only 3%) discontinuation of ipatasertib treatment due to diarrhea was reported. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_294757], the median relative dose intensity of both ipatasertib and paclitaxel approached 100% and was comparable in the ipatasertib and placebo arms. 
In current studies, to improve diarrhea management and patient experiences, 
anti-diarrhea prophylaxis (loperamide) has been mandated for the first cycle for all 
patients (where allowed by [CONTACT_23670]) and implemented subsequently as clinically

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 25 indicated. Patients are being monitored for early signs of diarrhea symptoms, and 
investigators will be provided with comprehensive management guidelines for study 
treatment− related symptoms or potential risks.  
Based on the efficacy of carboplatin in TNBC, and prior Phase II data ( GO29227) in 
patients with TNBC support the addition of ipatasertib to carboplatin treatment in patients 
with metastatic TNBC. Our preclinical data in patient derived xenograft model of 
metastatic TNBC, carboplatin and ipatasertib were synergistic in tumor suppression 
(Yuan et al.  unpublished data). Based on these evidence, w e hypothesize that 
carboplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel plus the Akt inhibitor ipatasertib will have a synergistic  effect in TNBC. Hence this clinical trial is designed to test the safety of the 
doublet and triplet combination and obtain initial evidence of efficacy. The combination of 
ipatasertib and paclitaxel has been generally well tolerated and comprehensive guidelines for management of anticipated treatment-related symptoms will be 
incorporated into this protocol building upon previous clinical trial experience. 
Preliminary data suggests a better response to ipatasertib in patients with 
PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN altered breast tumors. DNA targeted exome-sequencing will be 
used for detecting genomic alterations. TNBC sub-typi[INVESTIGATOR_579769]. These genomic alterations will be associated with clinical responses .  
 
This trial will enroll patients wi th metastatic  triple negative breast cancer . Given the 
relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population 
is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. The benefit-risk ratio 
for ipatasertib in combination with carboplatin or carboplati n/ paclitaxel is  expected to be 
acceptable in this setting. 
1.5 Background on Arm C  
 
Capecitabine and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor: The Impassion130 study demonstrated the 
addition of immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (anti -PD-L1) to nab-paclitaxel improved 
PFS in PD -L1 positive mTNBC in the first line setting.(3)  It remains unknown whether non-
taxane chemo + anti -PD-1/L1 will be beneficial in mTNBC. In the curative setting, evidence has 
emerged from the CREATE-X study that supports the use of adjuvant capecitabine for patients 
who have residual disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing anthracycline, 
taxane, or both). In this trial, eight q3 weekly cycles of adjuvant capecitabine therapy was shown 
to be safe and effective in prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival among patients 
with HER2 -negative breast cancer who had residual invasive disease.(4)  Given these data, as 
well as promising data supporting the use of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in TNBC, there 
is a strong interest in testing the combination of an ICI in combination with capecitabine. In fact, 
a phase Ib study of metastatic breast cancer, pembrolizumab plus capecitabine (2000mg bid, 7 
days on and 7 days off) showed encouraging safety and efficacy. Overall response for the 
capecitabine+ pembrolizumab arm was 43% (5 PR, 1 CR, 2 SD) with median progression free 
survival of 155 days.(5)  
 Combination of AKT inhibitor with ICI: PTEN is a well -known negative regulator of AKT. 
PTEN loss is associated with decreased T cell infiltration and reduced efficacy of ICI. PI3K-beta inhibitor improves the efficacy of both anti -PD-1 and anti -CTLA-4, supporting the rationale of

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 26 exploring combinations of ICI and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors (17). In a phase IB study, the 
combination of ipatasertib, atezolizumab and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel showed a promising 
response rate of 73% in a cohort of 26 patients with unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic 
TNBCs previously untreated in the metastatic setting.  Interestingly, responses were high irrespective of PD-L1 status or PI3K/AKT/PTEN alteration status (2). 
 In the third arm of this study, arm C, we aim to test the combination of ipatasertib, capecitabine and atezolizumab in patients with PD -L1 mTNBC. The primary end point will be safety and 
tolerability of the regimen. Identifying the safe dose of these three drugs in combination will pave the way to evaluate this triplet combination in early stage disease. A secondary endpoint will be the response rate and evaluation of the role of PD -L1 status.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY  
This is a Phase I trial of ipatasertib plus either carboplatin or carboplatin/ paclitaxel in 
patients with metastatic TNBC. The combination of paclitaxel and ipatasertib have been 
well-tolerated and the recommended phase II dose is  ipatasertib 400mg po daily 3 weeks 
on/1 week off, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 days 1, 8,15 of every 4 week cycle based on the 
previous data of LOTUS trial . In the current trial, two dosing regimen will be tested in this 
study. In triplet schedule A, carboplatin AUC 2, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 will be added on day 
1, 8 and 15 of every 4 weeks cycle while patients receive ipatasertib of 400mg daily. In 
doublet schedule B, carboplatin AUC 2 on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days  will be added to 
ipatasertib 400mg daily continuous dosing.  
 
We will use the Phase I Queue (IQ) 3+3 design that insures patient risk does not exceed the maximum risk permitted in the traditional 3+[ADDRESS_762017] been conducted, including NCI/CTEP studies based on 
the 3+3 risk constraints  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . This method has been shown 
(presented at JSM 2016, with the latest design presented at JSM 2018, Frankel, P, 
Activity #359, manuscript submitted) to reduce study duration by [CONTACT_579810] 23% for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_122666] I study, with a median increase in the number of 
patients of [ADDRESS_762018] due to lack of slots. 
The operating characteristics demonstrate negligible difference in the dose chosen for the MTD, and in the number of DLTs reported in patients treated above the MTD (see 
statistical considerations). The details of the design are described below (
D: Comparison 
of the 3+3 and the Phase I Queue 3+3 (IQ 3+3) Design Decisions).  
 
For response and PFS estimates, and to confirm the recommended Phase II dose 
obtained from the dose escalation, we will enroll an additional cohort of patients until the 
number treated and evaluable for DLT considerations at the recommended phase II dose 
is 14 patients for the doublet (Table B) and for the triplet schedules ( Table A). 
  
All eligible patients who start treatment at the recommended dose will be considered in 
the calculation of the response rate.  
 Sample size for the doublet and triplet schedules  A and B: Expected sample size (if level 
1 is well -tolerated) is 14 patients for both the doublet and triplet, for an expected total 
sample-size of 28 patients. Additional cohorts of 6-8 patients are required if  level 1 is not 
well-tolerated for each schedule.

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 28  
Sample-size for the triplet Arm  C: The starting dose level for schedule C is not the 
highest possible dose to be tested, which differs from Arm A and B.  Once the MTD and 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is selected for Arm C, at least 12 total patients will 
be treated at the RP2D.  The expected number of patients (based on 800 simulations 
with DLT rates of 9.0%, 10.8%, 13.6% and 18.0% or with DLT rates of 6.7%, 7.6%, 9.0% and 10.8% for levels 1-4) is between [ADDRESS_762019] been accrued to the RP2D 
in total, the number of total patients remains less than 21, additional patients can be 
accrued to the RP2D  (e.g. if the RP2D is dose level 1, with 6 patients treated, and 2 
DLTs on dose level 2 for a total 8 patients, 13 additional patients can be added to dose 
level 1 as opposed to only 6).

3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Ipatasertib  
 In previous studies, the ipatasertib starting dose of 400 mg QD on Days 1− 21 of each 28-day 
cycle was selected on the basis of safety and pharmacokinetics data from Arm  C of 
Study  PAM4983g (Phase Ib trial of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel; refer to the Ipatasertib 
Investigator's Brochure for detail s). The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and ipatasertib following 
co-administration showed no evidence of drug− drug interaction and 400 mg ipatasertib was 
better tolerated than 600 mg ipatasertib in this combination.  
In the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study (GO29227) in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic TNBC, the combination of ipatasertib 4 00 mg administered QD on Days 
1−21 of each 28-day cycle and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 
each 28-day cycle  was generally well tolerated and showed an improvement in PFS . The 
sparse sampling exposure results in this study were also consistent with the known PK profiles 
of ipatasertib (and its metabolite G -037720) .  
In addition, the totality of pharmacodynamics data from Phase I (PAM4743g, PK/pharmacodynamic analysis) and safety and efficacy data (including exploratory expos ure-
response analyses, data on file) from randomized Phase II studies of ipatasertib (Study GO29227 and Study GO27983, which evaluated two dose levels of 200 mg and 400 mg of ipatasertib in patients with metastatic castration- resistant prostate cancer) support the selected 
starting dose of [ADDRESS_762023] inhibition and efficacy with a generally acceptable safety profile (refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure for details) . In the 
ipatasertib + paclitaxel arm of the GO29227 study, despi[INVESTIGATOR_294761] 21.3% of patients due to adverse events, discontinuation of ipatasertib due to any adverse event was 6.1%, and the median cumulative dose intensity of both ipatasertib and paclitaxel were maintained at 99.0% (ipatasertib) and 100% (paclitaxel).  
The ipatasertib starting dose of [ADDRESS_762024] supportive care. Overall, the spectrum and 
frequency of AEs attributable to ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone is similar to that of 
single-agent ipatasertib in the PAM4743g trial.  
Page 33 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 33 The patients treated at the 400 mg dose of ipatasertib achieved a similar plasma exposure at 
steady -state relative to patients treated at 400− 600 mg on a 21-of-28 day  schedule (the single-
agent MTD).  At [ADDRESS_762025] inhibition was 
demonstrated at the 400 mg dose level (for  further details, see the Ipatasertib Investigator’s 
Brochure).  
In the current study, ipatasertib continuous dosing for arms A and B  was planned in order to 
better understand the tolerability of the daily dosing in combination with chemotherapy. 
Hypothetically continuous AKT inhibiting may provide sustained target suppression and possible 
improved disease control. Therefore the dosing schedules of this clinical trial were selected 
based on continuous dosing of ipatasertib. For Arm C, to be consistent with LOTUS  and ongoing phase III trials, ipatasertib 3 weeks on, 1 week off schedule was chosen. Due to concerns of increased risk of diarrhea, ipatasertib starting dose of 300mg was chosen.  
 
3.3.2 Rationale for Carboplatin/Paclitaxel or Carboplatin  
Carboplatin combination therapy has been shown to be effective in treatment of metastatic 
breast cancers (Perez et al. 2004). Weekly paclitaxel (100mg/m2) was combined with weekly 
carboplatin AUC 2, days 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_762026] 
cancer patient. The regimen was effective with a response rate of 62% and well tolerated with a grade 3/4 neutropenia rate of 35%. Other grade 3/4 toxicities included neuropathy (11%), 
infection (6%), weakness (6%), anemia (5%), and paresthesia (3%) (Loesch et al. 2002). In the 
LOTUS trial , grade 3/4 neutropenia rate was 10%. There is a strong rationale to test continuous 
dosing of ipatasertib for consistent AKT inhibition. Therefore in the current study, we proposed two dosing schedules to study the combination of carboplatin alone with ipatasertib or carboplatin/paclitaxel in combination with continuous dosing of ipatasertib. Starting doses for 
each combination and the dosing schedules are described in detail in section 3.[ADDRESS_762027] cancer, single-agent carboplatin produced 
objective response rates of 20% –35% in previously untreated patients (Kolaric et al.  1991, 
Martin et al. 1992, O’brien et al. 1993) at dosing of 400 mg/m2 every 3 or 4 weeks , or based on 
glomerular filtration rate to achieve an area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) of 
7 mg/ml minute every [ADDRESS_762028], objective responses were 8-16%  with these 
carboplatin schedules in patients treated previously with chemotherapy for metastatic disease 
(O’brien et al. 1993, Carmo -Pereira et al. 1990).

cancer who had residual invasive disease. A phase Ib study of pembrolizumab plus 
capecitabine (2000mg bid, 7 days on and 7 days off) showed encouraging safety and efficacy. 
Page 34 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 34 Overall response for the capecitabine+ pembrolizumab arm was 43% (5 PR, 1 CR, 2 SD) with 
median progression free survival of 155 days.3  Since both capecitabine and ipatasertib are 
associated with diarrhea, a lower dose of capecitabine starting dose at 750mg/m2 will be used. 
Capecitbine 7 days on and 7 day off schedule is based on the following publication: Traina TA, 
Dugan U, Higgins B, Kolinsky K, Theodoulou M, Hudis CA, Norton L. Optimizing chemotherapy 
dose and schedule by [CONTACT_579816]-Simon mathematical modeling Breast disease. 2010 Jan 
1;31(1):7-18. Detailed dosing schedules are described in detail in section 3.[ADDRESS_762030] cancer remains an incurable disease. 
Although chemotherapy is a mainstay treatment for TNBC, resistance inevitably develops and benefit is often short-lived. Ipatasertib with paclitaxel has shown encouraging clinical benefit for 
TNBC from the randomized Phase II study (GO29227 or LOTUS). In Study GO29227, patients with TNBC in the ipatasertib + paclitaxel arm showed a more pronounced improvement in PFS in the pre-specified patient population with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors (hazard 
ratio = 0.44, 9.0 months vs. 4.9 months) compared with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN non-altered 
tumors (hazard ratio = 0.76, 5.3 months vs. 3.7 months) or unselected ITT patients (hazard 
ratio = 0.60, 6.2 months vs. 4.9 m onths).  
For patients with metastatic HR +/HER2 − breast cancer, approved therapy during the endocrine-
sensitive phase includes CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors such as everolimus. 
Preliminary data from the Phase Ib study PAM4983g suggest that HR +/HER2 − patients may still 
respond to the combination of ipatasertib + paclitaxel after prior exposure to PI3K/Akt pathway 
inhibitors (e.g., PI3K inhibitors) (Isakoff et al. 2014). The efficacy of ipatasertib for patients 
previously treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors is unknown, but these patients are not excluded from participation in this study. 
3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Genomics: Genomic analysis is increasingly informing our understanding of disease 
pathobiology. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) such as whole exome sequencing ( WES) 
provides a comprehensive characterization of the exome, and along with clinical data collected 
in this study, may provide the opportunity to develop new therapeutic approaches . Triple 
negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with many distinct subtypes as defined by 
[CONTACT_294849] a diverse array of mutational profiles.  
In addition to PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN −alteration status, samples will be assessed for additional 
biomarkers in an effort to identify f actors that may correlate with the safety and efficacy of 
treatment with ipatasertib combined with carboplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel.  
In addition, all submitted tumor or blood samples at screening and end-of-study may be 
evaluated using additional genomic testing such as NanoString nCounter Breast Cancer 360 
panel and data analysis to provide a more comprehensive understanding of resistance

Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 35 mechanism s to carboplatin/AKT inhibitor , which may lead to future development of alternative 
treatment strategies.  
Carboplatin has shown significant efficacy in BRCA1/2  mutated tumors. The BRCA status will 
also be examined using NGS, WES , and/or other methods. The collected DNA from blood 
samples and tumor tissue from this study will be analyzed to identify germline (e.g., BRCA1/2 ) 
and somatic alterations that are predictive of response to study drug, are associated with 
progression to a more severe disease state, are associated with acquired resistance to study 
drug, or can increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology.  
Gut Microbiome:  Recently, it has become evident that the gut microbiota modulates the 
response to cancer therapy and susceptibility to toxic side effects  (Roy et al. 2017). The best 
characterized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579772] (Tesniere et al. 2010) and cyclophosphamide  (Daillère 
et al. 2016). The gut microbiota primes myeloid cells for production of reactive oxygen 
species in the case of oxaliplatin, and facilitates the induction of an anticancer T cell 
response in the case of cyclophosphamide  (Daillère et al. 2016). The role of gut microbiota in 
modulating the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors remains to be discovered . Evidence of 
the important role of the microbiota in controlling cancer therapy effectiveness and toxicity is 
derived mainly from data in experimental animals, an d translation of these findings to human 
clinical medicine remains challenging. Additional clinical data need be obtained in order to 
understand how ipatasertib affects the gut microbiota , and to develop strategies to attenuate 
the gastrointestinal  side ef fects of ipatasertib. Therefore, gut microbiota  analysis will be 
included in this study to assess the correlation of treatment side effects such as diarrhea and 
treatment response. Stool sample will be collected at baseline, C4 D1 and end-of-study visit 
(Appendix 1 Study Calendar ). 
Plasma Calprotectin: Calprotectin, first described in 1980 by [CONTACT_579817], is released by [CONTACT_579818], and accounts for more than 40% of the cytosolic proteins of neutrophils. Elevated 
concentrations of calprotectin can be measured in plasma, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], synovial fluid, 
urine, and feces when ongoing inflammation is present, or in malignant conditions  (Fagerhol et 
al. 1980) . Increased fecal calprotectin (FCP) concentrations have been found in gastric and 
colorectal cancers as well as in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). The high fecal calprotectin 
concentrations detected in IBD can be explained by [CONTACT_579819], and increased migration of neutrophils into the gut lumen. FCP  was found to be strongly 
associated with colorectal inflammation indicating organic disease, and is a simple and non-
invasive method for assessing excretion of macrophages into the gut lumen. FCP  values can be 
used to screen asymptomatic patients, evaluate the response to treatment, and predict disease 
relapse in patients with IBD  (Erbayrak et al. 2009). It is unclear if FCP is associated with 
targeted therapy -induced bowel inflammation and/or diarrhea. In this study, FCP  analysis will be 
used for detection of bowel inflammation, by [CONTACT_579820] , C2D1  and 
end-of-study visit  (Appendix 1 Study Calendar ).

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 36 3.3.6 Rationale for Patient -Reported Outcome 
Assessments   
Patient reported outcomes (PROs) provide an understanding of the impact a treatment has on a 
patient. The QLQ -C30 is a validated instrument that has been widely used in assessing quality 
of life in patients with cancer. The core instrument assesses global health status/quality of life, 
functions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptoms. For 
EORTC QLQ-C30 forms, refer to Appendix 11 .

administered after paclitaxel dose.  
 
Carboplatin dose (mg) = AUC X (GFR + 25)  
(Calculated total dose is in mg -not mg/m2)  
 
The Creatinine Clearance (to replace GFR) will be calculated for each treatment course using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 2
):  
 
Note : The serum creatinine level to be used in the following calculations must be ≥ 0.7 mg/dL 
for patient age <65, if the measured serum creatinine level is < 0.7 mg/dL, use 0.7 mg/dL as the 
value in this calculation. For patient age ≥ 65, if measured serum creatinine is < 0.8 mg/dL, use 
0.8 mg/dL as the value in this calculation.  
 
For Females:  
 
CrCI = (140- age) X wt. in kg. X 0.85  
          72 X serum creatinine*  
 
Use calculated creatinine clearance for GFR in Cockcroft-Gault formula.  
 
For Males:  
 
CrCI = (140- age) X wt. in kg.  
         72 X serum creatinine*  
 
Use calculated creatinine clearance for GFR in Cockcroft-Gault formula.   
Note:  Remember to re-calculate the dose for each treatment cycle. The actual body weight should 
be used for all calculations. If the actual weight is greater than 1.[ADDRESS_762044] carbo dose if dose changes on days 8 and 15 is greater than 10% per institutional guidelines.  Note: The GFR (calculated by [CONTACT_3158]-Gault) used in the Calvert formula to calculate AUC -

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 46 [IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles 
All toxicities ( except alopecia, fatigue and lymphopenia, cancer -related pain, hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, neuropathy) must  
resolved to ≤ grade 2neutropenia and thrombocytopenia prior to initiation of the next cycle 
of therapy. Qualifying laboratory tests and procedures can be obtained up to 72 hours before 
planned initiation of therapy from the 2nd cycle onwards. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Interruption, Dose Delays and Dose Modification  
For criteria of dose interruption, dose delay and dose modification, please refer to Section 
5.1.5: Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events. 
For all  arms, if ipatasertib dose is held due to toxicity, make- up dose will not be given. 
For both Arm A and Arm B, if the infusion dose on Day 1, 8, or 15 is missed due to toxicity, 
make-up dose will not be given.  
If patient encounters dose delays, timing of  restaging scans will be deter mined by 
[CONTACT_579824], not by [CONTACT_579825]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments and Special Monitoring  
For a detailed list of all study procedures including timing and windows, see section 4.5  and 
Appendix_1 . 
Management of atezolizumab specific adverse events: Toxicities associated or possi bly 
associated with atezolizumab treatment should be managed according to standard medical 
practice. Investigators are encouraged to review and refer to Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
management of immune- related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors published by [CONTACT_579826] (Brahmer 2018) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (Haanen 2017), along with the dose modification guidelines provided in this protocol for evaluation and management of potential immune adverse events. Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology.  
Although most immune- related adverse events observed with immunomodulatory agents have 
been mild and self-limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major complications. More severe immune-related toxicities may require acute management with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents. Management of patients with Grade 3 or 4 atezolizumab related immune toxicities will require aggressive immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For details, refer to section [IP_ADDRESS].11. 
4.3.3 Other Treatments: Premedications and Prophylactic 
Treatment  
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Page 47 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 47 Cremophor ® vehicle or carboplatin, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of 
anaphylaxis. Patients  must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel with dexamethasone, 
diphenhydramine, and an H2-receptor blocker (i.e., ranitidine or  famotidine) or per institutional 
practice. H2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, which are known to inhibit cytochrome 
P450, are excluded. 
 Steroid use may potentiate hyperglycemia, which can also be induced by [CONTACT_571808] .  
For 
≥ Grade  2 hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 160-250), STAT endocrinology consult 
should be arranged by [CONTACT_579827] 24h. 
 Diarrhea is a common adverse event associated with ipatasertib and/or paclitaxel treatment. In 
this current study, to improve diarrhea management and patient experiences, loperamide (2 mg 
twice a day or 4 mg once a day) will be administered daily as prophylaxis for diarrhea in the first 
cycle if allowed by [CONTACT_23670]. If side effects of loperamide are not tolerated, doses may be 
reduced at any time. Investigators are encouraged to continue this dosing for the remainder of 
the study using their discretion based on clinical judgments. If loperamide is ineffective in 
controlling diarrhea, other agents such as lomotil (diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and or 
colestipol can be used per discretion of treating physician.  
Study participants are required to document their diet, bowel movement and anti -diarrheal 
medication usage ( Appendix 8
).  
If diarrhea occurs, it should be managed per guidelines in Table 5 , page 65; upon resolution or 
when study treatment is restarted, loperamide prophylaxis should be considered to resume and 
continue based on clinical judgments .

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY, PROHIBITED FOOD, AND ADDITIONAL 
RESTRICTIONS 
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient in 
addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 14  days prior to initiation of study treatment to the 
treatment discontinuation visit.  All such medications should be reported to the investigator and 
recorded in the patient’s medical records.  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy and Supportive Care 
Patients are permitted to use the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226]:  
• Oral contraceptives, as allowed per local guidelines  
• Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic relief of 
pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for a preexisting lesion, provided it does not 
interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be irradiated must not be a site of measurable disease). Study treatment should be suspended 
during palliative radiotherapy (see Section 4.4.3
) 
Page 49 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 49 • Premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or analgesics for each paclitaxel 
administration 
• Prophylactic use of loperamide is mandated in the first cycle, and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea. Patients who experience diarrhea 
should be on treatment doses of loperamide per the management guidelines provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]; please refer to that section for additional details. Patients should be 
educated/reminded to be cognizant of the onset, duration, severity, and frequency of 
symptoms and the medications administered.  
• Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor treatment is permitted for patients receiving paclitaxel  
or carboplatin/paclitaxel arm. The primary prophylaxis should be administered per the 
ASCO, EORTC, and European Soci ety for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines; namely, 
in patients who are ≥
 60 years of age and/or with comorbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et 
al. 2011).  
• Bisphosphonate therapy or RANKL inhibitor therapy (e.g., zolendronic acid and 
denosumab) used specifically to prevent skeletal events (e.g., bone metastasis, 
osteoporosis) is allowed.  
• Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists for ovarian function preservation are allowed.  
• Patients who have type I or type II diabetes mellitus must be followed by [CONTACT_579829]. 
 
In general, investigators/treating physicians  should manage a patient’s care with supportive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579773].  For example, patients who 
experience infusion-associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional practice. Serious infusion-associated events manifested 
by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_579774] c linically indicated 
(e.g., supplemental oxygen and β
2-adrenergic agonists).  
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific immune-related adverse events when associated with atezolizumab (refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details). Atezolizumab should be temporarily 
held during systemic corticosteroids treatment. 
For usage of antiemetics and treatment for neuropathy, physicians are advised to follow ASCO 
and/or NCCN guidelines, as appropriate. 
4.4.[ADDRESS_762047] exercise caution, and all study treatment should be

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762048] 7 days before and after the procedure (at least 14 days after 
radiation is recommended). After the temporary treatment hold is complete, study treatment  
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A and may be a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. A clinical drug −drug interaction study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A 
substrate) showed a 2.2-fold increase in midazolam exposures in presence of steady -state 
Ipatasertib dosed at 600 m g QD.  Therefore, sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow 
therapeutic window should be avoided. Given that ipatasertib is primarily metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A, there is a high potential for drug− drug interactions of ipatasertib with any medication 
that strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A. Data from a clinical study showed that ipatasertib 
exposures were reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% when co-administered with enzalutamide, a 
strong CYP3A inducer. Strong CYP3A inhibitors are expected to increase ipatasertib exposures 
significantly.   
Therefore, the following drugs should be avoided or used with caution.  
• Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
troleandomycin, voriconazole, and/or grapefruit juice  
• Strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, such as, but not limited to, rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifapentine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and/or St. John’s  wort or hyperforin 
• CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as, but not limited to, alfentanil, 
astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, 
tacrolimus, ergot alkaloids ergotamine, and/or dihydroergotamine 
• Paclitaxel exposures may be increased due to CYP2C8 inhibition; therefore, strong 
and moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors, such as gemfibrozil, teriflunomide, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], and deferasirox should be used with caution during treatment with paclitaxel. 
Similarly, CYP2C8 inducers should be avoided or used with caution.  
• Patients who require short-term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study treatment 
should be temporarily held until at least [ADDRESS_762049] dose of these 
drugs.  
• Patients are permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 with caution. 
 
Patients should be closely monitored. Refer to the following information for further guidance on 
CYP450− drug interactions and a list of common substrates, inhibitors, and inducers:

4.4.3 Cautionary Therapy for Capecitabine (Arm C)  
Anticoagulants: Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been 
reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants 
such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. These events occurred within several days and up to 
several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397681]. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. In a drug interaction study with single-dose warfarin administration, there was a significant increase 
in the mean AUC of S -warfarin. The maximum observed INR value increased by 91%. This 
interaction is probably due to an inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by [CONTACT_397787]/or its metabolites.  
Phenytoin: The l
 evel of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking capecitabine 
and phenytoin dose may need to be reduced. Some patients receiving capecitabine and 
phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels. Formal drug-drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been conducted, but the mechanism of interaction is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme by [CONTACT_397787]/or its metabolites.  
CYP2C9 substrates Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction studies between 
capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised 
when capecitabine is coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates.  
Drug -Food Interaction: Food was shown to reduce both the rate and extent of absorption of 
capecitabine. In all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 
minutes after a meal. It is recommended that capecitabine be administered with food.  
 
4.4.4 Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_579776].  
• Investigational therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) is prohibited within 
14 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment. 
• Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal therapy) is 
prohibited for various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent ( see Section 4.1.2), and during study treatment, until disease progression is documented 
and the patient has discontinued study treatment, with the exception of palliative 
radiotherapy and local therapy under certain circumstances (see Section 4.4.1 for details 
for details).  
• Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not permissible after enrollment (refer to the 
guidance in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are prohibited within [ADDRESS_762050] dose of study treatment  
Page 52 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 52 • Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and IL-2) are 
prohibited within 28 days or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to start of 
treatment and during study treatment because these agents could potentially increase the 
risk for autoimmune conditions when given in combination with atezolizumab.  
• Systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, azathioprine, 
methotrexate, and thalidomide) are prohibited during study treatment because these agents 
could potentially alter the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab.  
• Steroids greater than or equivalent of 10 mg prednisone/day is  contraindicated.  
4.4.5 Prohibited Food 
 
Use of the following foods is prohibited as described below: 
• Consumption of grapefruit juice, a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, is prohibited during the 
study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_762051] dose of study treatment. 
• Consumption of St. John’s wort, a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, is prohibited for up to 
[ADDRESS_762052] dose of 
study treatment. 
 
4.4.6 Additional Restrictions 
No food or fluids other than water will be allowed for 8 hours prior to each Day 1 study visit until 
after study laboratory samples for fasting glucose and fasting lipid profile, as applicable, are obtained (see Appendix 1
 Study Calendar ).

be obtained before performing any study -related procedures (including screening 
evaluations or submission of archival tissues). Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all 
eligibility criteria before enrollment. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record 
details of all patients screened, and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, 
as applicable.

(i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), a non-contrast CT scan of the 
chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed. MRI scan of the brain must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastasis in all 
patients (CT brai n with contrast can be performed if MRI is contraindicated). At the 
investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST 
v1.[ADDRESS_762058] scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast diagnostic

All measurable and evaluable lesions should be re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. The same radiographic procedures used to as sess disease sites at screening 
should be used for subsequent tumor assessments (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans).  
Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_579830] v1.1 (see Appendix 6
). 
Assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_22960], if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  Results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_579831].  
An objective response should be confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥ 4 weeks after initial 
documentation. At the investigator’s discretion, and if clinically indicated, CT scans may be 
repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected, and other methods of assessment of 
measurable disease may be used (e.g., brain scans using CT or MRI) in addition to those listed above. For symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria per RECIST v1.1.
 
 
4.5.6 Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological 
Samples  
Laboratory samples should be drawn according to the study  calendar (see 
Appendix 1 ) and within 48 hour  prior to study drug administration.

All patients will complete the EORTC QLQ -C30  questionnaire at [ADDRESS_762063] v1.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ -C30 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated, reliable self -report measure (Aaronson et al . 1993; 
Fitzsimmons  et al. 1999) (see Appendix 11). It consists of 30 questions that ass ess fi ve 
aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom 
scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life, and six single items 
(dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diar rhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall 
period of the previous week. Scale scores can be obtained for the multi -item scales. 
The EORTC QLQ- C30 module takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
4.5.8 Mandatory Samples for Circulating Tumor DNA  
Blood sampled will be collected for DNA extraction to enable whole genome sequencing (WGS) , 
whole exome sequencing (WES)  or partial  exome sequencing (PES) to identify germline 
mutations and/or somatic mutations that are predictive of response to study drug, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are associated with acquired resistance to study drug, are associated with susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_68146], or can increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology. The blood samples may be sent 
to one or more laboratories for analysis . 
Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology. WGS 
provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and WES provides a comprehensive 
charac terization of the exome and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase 
the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26630]. Data will be analyzed in the context 
of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. The availability 
of a larger dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents.

Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the circulating tumor DNA  and WGS /WES/PES 
analyses, data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to patients . 
4.5.[ADDRESS_762064] -Treatment Follow -Up  
All participants will enter follow -up after completing End-of-Treatment assessments. This is 
comprised of: 
• Safety Follow -up- [ADDRESS_762065] dose of protocol therapy. 
• Note the period for safety follow -up will be extended until stabilization or resolution for all 
reportable AEs (per the agreement of the Study PI) and accompanying follow -up safety 
report. 
• Response Follow -up- for those who have yet to have disease progression.  
• Survival Follow -up- for all participants who have progressed OR completed Active 
Response Follow -Up.  
• Assessment timepoints and windows are detailed in Appendix [ADDRESS_762066]-treatment follow -up visits, survival follow -up information, subsequent treatment and 
outcome, and PROs will be collected via telephone calls, patient’s medical records, and/or clinic 
visits approximately every [ADDRESS_762067]-treatment follow -up; this request must be documented 
in the source file and signed by [CONTACT_093].  
 For patients who discontinue treatment without evidence of disease progression per  RECIST 
v1.1, in addition to post-treatment follow-up, patients will be followed every  12 weeks for tumor 
assessments (disease follow -up clinic visits; see Study Calendar App endix 1) until  documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1, elective withdrawal from the study, or study  completion or 
termination.

Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 59 • Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
• Withdrawal of consent from the study treatment 
• Pregnancy  
• Use of an anti -cancer therapy not required per protocol 
• Disease progression per investigator’s assessment according to RECIST v1.1 or 
symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression 
 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented in the patient’s 
medical records .  
Patients will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit ≤  [ADDRESS_762069] dose 
of study treatment. The visit at which response assessment shows progressive disease may be 
used as the treatment discontinuation visit.  Patients who discontinue study treatment for any 
reason other than progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit will continue to undergo tumor response assessments and PRO assessments as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1
). 
After treatment discontinuation, information on survival follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy 
will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every  3 months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Investigator  terminates 
the study ). 
4.6.[ADDRESS_762070] one of the following criteria was met: 
• Confirmed disease progression  
• Completed protocol therapy  
• Completion of study activities (treatment and overall survival follow -up after protocol 
treatment) 
• Participant is deemed intolerant to protocol therapy because of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_58349]/ delay

Documentation of the reason for discontinuing protocol therapy and the date effective should be 
made in the Electronic Health Record/medical record and appropriate eCRF. The COH DCC and the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_579777]. 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented in the patient’s medical 
records . If a patient requests to be withdrawn from the study, this request must be documented 
in the source documents and signed by [CONTACT_093]. Patients who withdraw from the study  
prematurely  will be replaced. 
If a patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., c ounty records) to obtain information about survival status.  
4.6.2 Study Discontinuation 
The Investigator has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the 
study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to patients  
• Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory  
Documentation of the reason for discontinuing study participation and the date effective should 
be made in the Electronic Health Record/medical record and appropriate eCRF. The COH DCC 
should be promptly notified of the change in participant status. 
 
 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
Ipatasertib is not currently approved for any indication, and clinical development is  
ongoing. The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
ipatasertib in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety risks and management plan for ipatasertib and paclitaxel are outlined below. The identified risks associated with ipatasertib treatment 
include gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and oral mucositis),  
fatigue/asthenia, erythema multiforma, rash, and hyperglycemia. Refer to the Ipatasertib 
Investigator's  
Page 61 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762071] been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities. Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including investigator’s  
assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events, as well as  
expedited reporting of protocol -defined adverse events of special interest regardless of 
seriousness. Vital signs and relevant laboratory values will be monitored at baseline and during the study.  
Guidelines for managing adverse events, including prophylaxis (for diarrhea), and 
criteria for dose modification (interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation) for the management of specif ic adverse eve nts attributable to ipatasertib, paclitaxel and carboplatin are 
summarized in Section 5
.  
 
Suggested dose reductions for ipatasertib, carboplatin and paclitaxel are  
listed in rm A and Arm B. General guidelines for  dose modification are provided in Table 1, 2,  
3 & 4. 
COH DSMC will be used during this study for toxicity monitoring. For details, refer to Section 6: 
Data & Safety Monitoring Plan, Adverse Event and Unanticipated P roblem R eporting 
 
5.1.1 Risks Associated with  Ipataserti b in Combination with Paclitaxel  
Ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel was  administered to 61 cancer patients in  
Study GO29227 (LOTUS). Adverse events related to ipatasertib/placebo whose  incidences 
were higher by ≥10% in patients receiving ipatasertib + paclitaxel versus  
placebo + p aclitaxel were diarrhea (88.5% vs. 16.1%) and nausea (41.0% vs. 19.4%). 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 adverse events (reported in ≥ 5% of patients in either 
treatment arm) in patients in the ipatasertib + paclitaxel arm vs . placebo + paclitaxel arm  
were diarrhea (14 patients [23.0%], all Grade 3, vs. 0 patients), neutropenia (6 patients  
[9.8%] vs. 1 patient [1.6%]), decreased neutrophil count (5 patients [8.2%] vs. 4 patients  
[6.5%]), and fatigue (2 patients [3.3 %] vs. 4 patients [6.5%]), respectively. 
 The incidence of overall neutropenia in the LOTUS Study was similar in both arms (34%  
in the ipatasertib + paclitaxel arm vs. 39% in the placebo + paclitaxel arm), but Grade ≥3 
neutropenia, analyzed by [CONTACT_579835], was higher in the 
ipatasertib + paclitaxel arm (18% vs. 8%). Thus, for recurrent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia,  
ipatasertib should be reduced by [CONTACT_294872] (refer to the Adverse Events Management Guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
 Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for further information regarding the nonclinical and clinical safety evaluation of ipatasertib as a single agent and in  
combination with chemotherapy.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications  
The five agents included in this study ( ipatasertib, carboplatin, paclitaxel, capecibabine, 
atezolizumab) have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_156444]-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_95611]. Neuropathy  is likely 
attributed to paclitaxel. Nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression and infusion  reaction can be 
attributed by [CONTACT_579837]. D iarrhea and stomatitis can be attributed by 
[CONTACT_571808], capecitabine  and paclitaxel. Premedication such as dexamethasone and ipatasertib 
can both cause hyperglycemia. Nausea, vomiting and myelosuppression can be contributed by 
[CONTACT_579838].  
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided 
below. 
 
Any dose interruption, dose modification, overdose or incorrect administration of study druges  
should be noted on the corresponding study drug administration eCRF. All adverse events associated with an overdose or incor rect administration of study druges  should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event log eCRF.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification General Guidelines 
Details in this section can be used as guidance for dose modification. O nly the specific dose 
levels shown should be used (Table 1, Table 2 , Table 3 and Table 4).  
 
Reasons for dose modifications (interruption or reduction) and  discontinuation, the supportive 
measures taken, and the outcome will be documented in the patient's chart and recorded in the 
eCRF. Reasons for not adhering to the following guidance should also be documented in the 
patient’s chart.  
 
On day 1 of each cycle of treatment, the general parameters for chemotherapy  administration 
include the following:  
• ANC ≥ 1500/µ l (≤Gr 1) 
• Hemoglobin ≥ 8mg/dL *  
Page 68 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 68 • Platelet count ≥  100,000/µ L (≤Gr 1)  
• Grade ≤ 2 clinically significant chemotherapy -related gastrointestinal toxicity  or neuropathy  
 
On the day 8 &  15 each cycle of treatment, the general parameters for chemotherapy  
administration include the following:  
• ANC ≥ 1000/µ l (≤Gr 2) 
• Hemoglobin ≥ 8 mg/dL*  
• Platelet count ≥  75,000/µ L(≤Gr 2)  
• Grade ≤ 2 clinically significant chemotherapy -related gastrointestinal toxicity  or neuropathy  
* Transfusion allowed on treatment day to meet the hemoglobin criteria  
 General guidelines for dosage/schedule modification are summarized as follows:  
• If any treatment component is held or delayed, the study cycle day count continues and 
does not shift except day 1 of each cycle;  i.e., every cycle contains exactly 28 days.  
• If ipatasertib treatment is interrupted during the middle of a cycle, carboplatin or 
carbo/paclitaxel treatment should continue.  
• If day 1 of the cycle  is interrupted, consider delaying the ipatasertib and chemotherapy 
treatment concurrently for up to 7 days  to maintain the 28 day cycle  
• If day 8 or 15 of the cycle is interrupted,  no makeup dose of chemotherapy treatment will be 
given.  
• If toxicity causes chemotherapy to be omitted, patient should be seen in one week for 
lab/a dverse events follow up/treatment.  
• Once the toxicity has resolved to the required level, study treatment and study procedures 
will be resumed. No makeup doses of day 8 or day 15 carboplatin/paclitaxel will be given . 
• For any concomitant conditions at baseline, dose modifications may apply according to the 
shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator deems it appropriate. For example, if a patient has 
Grade 1 asthenia at baseline that increases to Grade 2 during treatment, this change may be considered a shift of one grade and may be treated as Grade 1 toxicity for dose-
modification purposes if medically appropriate.  
• For toxicities assessed by [CONTACT_579839]-threatening events, treatment may be continued at the same 
dose without reduction or interruption. 
• Dose reductions or interruptions may not be required for anemia (non-hemolytic) if satisfactorily managed by [CONTACT_27752].  
• If any observed toxicity is attributable to only one drug as assessed by [CONTACT_093], the 
dose of the other drug(s) may not require modification.  
• Dose modifications for isolated abnormal hematologic laboratory values will be based on 
hematologi c parameters at the start of a treatment cycle.  
• Chemotherapy may be interrupted to manage toxicity .

Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 73 Treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, should be instituted as early 
as possible. Guidelines for treatment of diarrhea following the prophylactic dose of loperamide 
(where allowed) includes use of loperamide 2 mg every 4 hours or after each loose, watery stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16 mg/day or per institutional guidelines and standard of 
care, including, but not limited to, additional therapy with Lomotil
 (diphenoxylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), 
codeine, or octreotide. Duration of diarrhea may be minimized by [CONTACT_398182], 
avoiding lactose-containing foods, and hydrating with 8− 10 glasses per day (~12 oz/glass) of 
electrolyte- containing clear liquid, such as broth or low -calorie drinks.  
For ≥ Grade 3 diarrhea that persists for  more  than 5 days, despi[INVESTIGATOR_40792]-diarrheal  
agent(s) and/or withholding dosing of ipatasertib, gastroenterologists should be consulted to rule out the risk of colitis and infection (e.g., obtaining CT images or a stool culture for infectious workup [Clos tridium difficile, enteric bacteria, cytomegalovirus]) . Patients should be educated on 
the symptoms and importance of early reporting of diarrhea to receive instructions of treatment and prevention of dehydration so that patients can be promptly and appropriately managed. Educational  materials  will be  provided  to investigators and patients  outlining these guidelines.  
Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be maintained as tolerated.  Dose reductions of ipatasertib 
will be by [CONTACT_294907] a time (i.e., 400 to 300 mg; 300 to 200 mg) as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]

[IP_ADDRESS].11.9 Management of meningoencephalitis 
Immune-related meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab. Immune-related meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningiti s or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness. Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances 
needs to be distinguished from  potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, 
viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.  All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT 
scan  and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or edema. If 
deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], a lumbar puncture should be performed and a 
neurologist should be consulted.  
 Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table [IP_ADDRESS].11.J .

[IP_ADDRESS].11.10  Management and Evaluation of Elevated Creatinine (Potential Immune-
Related Nephritis)  
Immune-related nephritis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Eligible patients must have adequate renal function defined as baseline calculated creatinine clearanc e 
≥ 50 mL/min, and renal function will be monitored throughout study treatment. Patients with 
signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be 
treated according to the guidelines in Table [IP_ADDRESS].11.K.  
For patients with elevated creatinine, concurrent medication, volume depletion, renal obstruction 
should be considered and addressed, as appropriate. Refer to a renal specialist if clinically indicated. A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate 
treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS].11.1 1 Management of Immune-related myositis 
Immune-related myositis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Myositis 
or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are amongst the mos t common 
disorders. The diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis) supported by [CONTACT_579851] (serum creatine-kinase increase), electromyography, and imaging (MRI) features, which may be confirmed with a muscle -biopsy. Patients presenting with muscle pain 
without muscle weakness should have atezolizumab held pending evaluation for possible 
myositis. Referral to a neurologist should be considered for patients presenting with weakness. 
Patients with symptoms and confirmation of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table [IP_ADDRESS].11L.

6. GENENTECH ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING,  DATA & SAFETY MONITORING 
PLAN  
 
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
Specification of Safety Variables 
 
Safety  assessments  will consist  of monitoring and reporting adverse events  (AEs) and serious  
adverse events (SAEs) per protocol. This includes  all events  of death, and any study  specific  
issue  of concern.  
 
Adverse Events 
 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symp tom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of an investigational  medicinal  product 
(IMP ) or other protocol-im posed intervention, regardless  of attribution.  
 
This includes  the following: 
•    AEs not previously  observed in the subject  that emerge during the pr otocol-
specified   
• AE reporting period, including signs  or symptom s associate d with m etastatic breast cancer  
that were  not present prior to the AE reporting period. 
• Complications  that occur  as a result of protocol -mandated interventions  (e.g., 
invasive  procedures such as cardiac  catheterizations)  
• If applicable, AEs that occur  prior to assignment of study  treatment associated 
Page 97 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 97 with medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other  protocol -mandated 
intervention.  
• Preexisting  medical  conditions  (other  than the condition being studied)  judged by 
[CONTACT_579852] -specified  AE reporting period.  
 
Serious Adverse Events 
 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met: 
• It results  in death (i.e., the AE actuall y causes  or leads  to death). 
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places  the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does  not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.). 
• It requires  or prolongs  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., the AE results  in 
substantial  disruption of the subject’s  ability  to conduct normal  life functions). 
• It results  in a congenital  anomal y/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother  
exposed to the IMP. 
• It is considered a significant medical  event by [CONTACT_579853] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical  intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed  above).  
 
METHODS  AND TIMING  FOR ASSESSING  AND RECORDING  SAFETY  VARIABLES 
 
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs  that are observed or reported 
during the study  are collected and reported to the FDA,  appropriate IRB(s),  and Genentech, Inc. 
in accordance with CFR.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period 
 
The study  period during which AEs  and SAEs  as described in section J where the 
patient has been exposed to Genentech product must  be reported Reporting period 
begins  after informed consent is obtained and initiation of study  treatment and 
ends  [ADDRESS_762116] administration of study  treatment or study  
discontinuation/termination,  whichever  is earlier. After this period, investigators  
should only report SAEs  that are attributed to prior study  treatment (Modify 
statement depending up on section g). 
 
Assessment  of Adverse Events 
 
All AEs and SAEs  whether  volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_579854], or detected through physical  examination, 
laboratory  test, or other  means  will be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE 
or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory  
seriousness  criteria  if applicable,  suspected relationship to the study  drug (see 
Page 98 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 98 following guidance), and actions  taken.  
 
To ensure consisten cy of AE and SAE causality  assessments,  investigators  
should apply  the following general guideline:  
 
Yes 
 
There is a plausible temporal  relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study  drug, and  the AE cannot be readily  explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s  clinical  state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or  the 
AE follows  a known pattern of response to the study  drug; and/or  the AE 
abates  or resolves  upon  discontinuation of the study  drug or dose  reduction 
and, if applicable, reappears  upon re- challenge.  
 No 
 Evidence exists  that the AE has an etiology  other  than the {study  drug}  (e.g., 
preexisting  medical  condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness,  or 
concomitant  medication); and/or  the AE has no plausible temporal relationship 
to study  drug administration (e.g., cancer  diagnosed [ADDRESS_762117] dose of 
study  drug).  
 
Expected adverse events  are those adverse events  that are listed or 
characterized in current Investigator  Brochure . 
 
Unexpected adverse events  are those not listed in the P.I or curren t I.B or not 
identified. This includes  adverse events  for which  the specificity  or severity  is not 
consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under  this 
definition, hepatic  necrosis  would be unexpected  if the P.I. or I.B. only referred  to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
 
PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
 Eliciting Adverse Events 
 
A consistent  methodology  for eliciting  AEs at all subject evaluation time points  
should be adopted. Examples  of non-directive questions  include: 
 
• “How have you felt since  your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have  you had any new or changed health problems  since  you were  last 
Page 99 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 99 here?”  
 
Specific Instructions for Recording A dverse Events 
 Investigators  should use correct  medical  terminology/concepts  when 
reporting AEs or SAEs.  Avoid colloquialisms  and abbreviations. 
 
a.   Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis  should be reported rather  than individual  signs  
and symptoms (e.g., record  only liver failure or hepatitis  rather  than jaundice, asterixis,  and 
elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs  and/or  symptoms  cannot be 
medically  characterized as a single diagnosis or  syndrome at the time of reporting, it is 
acceptable  to report the information that is currently  available.  If a diagnosis  is subsequently  
established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
 
b.   Deaths 
 
All deaths  that occur  during the protocol -specified  AE reporting period (see Section I), 
regardless  of attribution, will  be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, 
the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the 
single medical  concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained  at the time 
of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”. 
 
c.   Preexisting Medical Conditions 
 
A preexisting medical  condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such  conditions  
should be reported as medical  and surgical  histo ry. A preexisting medical  condition should be 
re-assessed  throughout the trial  and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity,  or 
character  of the condition worsens  during the study. When reporting such  events, it is important 
to convey  the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665]  (e.g., “more  frequent headaches”).  
 
d.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579785].  If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical  or surgical  procedure as 
a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE.  For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579786] y by[CONTACT_13786], record  the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_579855].

e. Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events 
    
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0 Update current versions) will 
be used for assessing adverse event severity. Below Table should be used for assessing 
severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_27947].  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event  
d. Grade [ADDRESS_762118] dose of study  drug, a report should be 
completed and expeditiously  submitted to Genentech, Inc. Follow- up to obtain the outcome of 
the pregnancy  should also occur. Abortion, whether  accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, 
should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously  reported as an SAE. Similarly,  any

. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 101 congenital  anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the study drug 
should be reported as an SAE. 
 
 
g. Post-Stud y Adverse  Events  
 
For studies involving collection of survival data/ follow up until progression free period/ Extended 
follow up period (select applicable) the investigator after the end of the adverse event reporting 
period (defined as [ADDRESS_762119] dose of study drug) should report all deaths, (regardless of cause), and any serious adverse event including development of cancer or a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated 
in the study that is believed to be rela ted to prior exposure to study drug.  
Case Transmission Verification will be performed by [CONTACT_537468] . 
 The investigator  should expeditiously  report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed 
or discontinued study  participation  if attributed to prior study  drug exposure. If the investigator  
should become aware of the development of cancer  or a congenital  anomaly  in a 
subsequently  conceived offspring of a female subject [add if applicable- including pregnancy 
occurring in the partner of a male study subject] who participated in the study, this should be 
reported as an SAE adequately to Genentech drug Safety during follow up period.  
 
 
h. Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports 
 
The Sponsor  agrees  to conduct  the Case Transmission verification to ensure that all single 
case reports have been adequately received by [CONTACT_579856] a Quarterly line-list ing documenting single case reports sent by [CONTACT_579857].  
 
The periodic line-listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of the 
agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be receive d within the time period mutually 
agreed upon. 
                    
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the 
discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case -by-
case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive reconciliation guidance 
documents within the ‘Activation Package’.  
 
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been received by 
[CONTACT_579858] (5) calendar days from 
request by [CONTACT_8229]. 
 
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification report will 
be sent to Genentech

7. COH DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events per protocol. This includes all events of death and any study -specific issue of 
concern. This is a Risk Level 4 study  as defined in the City of Hope Institutional Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan. This determination was made because the study involves a CO H IND.  
 
Definition of Risk level 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that 
occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol 
intervention.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any expected or unexpected adverse events that result in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred)  
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of ex isting 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Secondary malignancy*  
• Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).

Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 109 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved 
research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_36923], devices or procedures involved in the r esearch); AND  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
See section 6 
 Assessment of Adverse Events 
The site Investigator will be responsible for determining the event name, assessing the severity 
(i.e. grade), expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
 
Assessment of Adverse Event Name [CONTACT_579883] 5.0.  The determination of severity for all other events not listed 
in CTCAE 5.0  the should be made by [CONTACT_579862] 1 to 5 as defined below: 
• Grade 1 (mild) – An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
• Grade 2 (moderate) – An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
• Grade 3 (severe) – An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.  
• Grade 4 (life threatening) – An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated 
with an imminent risk of death or  with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the 
ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc). 
• Grade 5 (fatal) – Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
Assessment of Attribution 
 
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study agent or study procedure.  
• Unrelated – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
Page 110 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 110 • Unlikely – The event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event was 
most likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Definite – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s condition, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs, AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on re-exposure.  
 
Assessment of Expectedness The following definitions will be used to determine the expectedness of the event:  
• Unexpected – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s 
brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event. *Modified from 21 CFR 312.32 (a)
 
• Expected – An adverse event is expected if it does not meet the criteria for an 
unexpected event, OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, 
disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing 
the adverse event.   
 
 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Routine Reporting of Non-Serious Adverse Events  
Routine AE recording will occur via data entry into the study eCRF. Recording of adverse events will begin once the patient is consented and will continue until [ADDRESS_762127] study . 
Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_462490] (PMT). Adverse events that do not meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems do not require expedited reporting.  AEs reported through expedited processes (i.e. reported to the IRB, DSMC, FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
EXPEDITING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF SAES AND UPS  
Advers e events that meet the criteria of serious OR are unanticipated problems will be reported 
according to the approved City of Hope’s Insti tutional policy
 via the AE/UP reporting form in 
iRIS. Reportable serious adverse events must be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, 
or determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_093].  Follow -up SAE reports must be submitted 
for all events that require expedited reporting when the status of the event changes and until the 
resolution or stabilization of the event.

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND SINGLE SUBJECT EXCEPTIONS  
It is understood that deviations from the protocol should be avoided, except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. Brief interruptions and delays may 
occasionally be required because of travel delays, airport closures, inclement weather, fam ily 
responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, and so forth. Delays can also extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_579797] a deviation does not threaten patient safety or protocol scientific integrity. As a result of deviations, 
corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_1286]. 
 Definitions 
Deviation 
A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol that occurred without prior IRB 
approval.  Investigators may deviate from the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the protection, safety, and well -being of the study subjects without prior IRB approval. Examples 
include, but are not limited to: a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) 
alteration in treatment schedule due to non-availability of the research participant for treatment; 
and c) laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety.  
 Single Subject Exceptions (SSE)  
An SSE is a planned deviation, meaning that it involves circumstances in which the specific 
procedures called for in a protocol are not in the best interests of a specific patient.  It is a 
Page 113 of 172 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 113 deviation that is anticipated and receives prior  approval by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_579798].  
  
Reporting of Deviations and SSEs 
Reporting Deviations 
For any deviation, the Investigator will notify the COH DSMC and IRB within 5 calendar days of its occurrence via iRIS  in accor dance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy  and 
Genentech requirement ( Refer to Section 6 ) 
 
Reporting Single Subject Exceptions 
The SSE must be submitted as a “Single Subject Exception Amendment Request” via iRIS  in 
accordance with IRB guidelines and the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy . An IRB 
approved SSE does not need to be submitted as a deviation to the DSMC.  
 
In addition, if contractually obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
Phase I-dose escalation portion is the IQ 3+[ADDRESS_762143] 12 patients for 
Arm C . The expected combined sample size for this Phase I study and expanded cohort 
at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be <=40 patients (with >99% probability , 
based on 800 simulations ) for Arms A and B together, with an additional expected 24 
patients for Arm C  (see below) . For arms A and B the sample size will be 28 patients  if 
level 1 has acceptable toxicity on both triplet schedule A and double schedule B.  
With 14 patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose for Arms A and B, the DLT rate can 
be estimated with a SE less than 13.5% and provides added information to refine the 
recommended phase [ADDRESS_762144] one patient with PI3K -mTOR -Akt- alteration/PTEN loss (per schedule) is 96% 
assuming an incidence in the population of 20%. Secondary analysis will also evaluate 
PFS and response based on molecular subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235211]3K -mTOR -Akt/PTEN loss and 
BRCA mutational status.  For Arm C, with a minimum of 12 patients (maximum of 19), 
the DLT rate can be estimated with a SE less than 14.4%.  
At the end of the study, we will have at least [ADDRESS_762145] 12 patients treated on the RP2D for 
the arm/schedule C .  Initially, the plan was to facilitate this comparison, when schedules  
A and B had available slots, by [CONTACT_579868] A and schedule B.  Due 
to limited time when both arms had slots, and due to prior treatment history which limited 
patients to one arm, this quasi -randomization proved impractical  and slot assignment 
will be determined based on open slots and treating physician preference.   This includes the new added schedule (Arm C).  As a result, comparison of response rates 
across the arms will be on descriptive as these represent different patient populations.   
  
9.2 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE FOR ARM C  
 
Sample-size for the triplet Arm C: The starting dose level for schedule C is not 
the highest possible dose to be tested, which differs from Arm A and B.  Once 
the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is selected for Arm C, at least 
12 total patients will be treated at the RP2D.  The expected number of patients (based on 800 simulations with DLT rates of 9.0%, 10.8%, 13.6% and 18.0% or 
with DLT rates of 6.7%, 7.6%, 9.0% and 10.8% for levels 1-4) is between 17 and 
18 patients for dose-finding, and the interquartile range is 15- 20 patients.  
 This is based in the IQ3+3 design.  This method has been used in over 10 dose-
finding studies to reduce study duration by [CONTACT_579869] 23% for 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_122666] I study, with a median increase in the number of patients of 1-4,

. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762146] presented at JSM  2016, with the manuscript submitted (see 
below for additional details) . 
 
The simulations assume 4 dose levels ( -1,1,2,3), starting at dose level 1, with a 
course length of 28 days, uniform beta distribution for screening of 28 days, a screen failure probability of 30%, an inevaluable rate of 20%, and uniform beta 
distribution of time to inevaluable over the the 28 day course length, and DLT 
rates as noted above.  The time to DLT event is a beta(1.5,1) distribution over 
the course length, and the patient in ter-arrival has a an exponential distribution 
with a mean of [ADDRESS_762147] been accrued to the RP2D in total, the number of total 
patients remains less than 21, additional patients can be accrued to the RP2D (e.g. if the RP2D is dose level 1, with 6 patients treated, and 2 DLTs on dose 
level 2 for a total 8 patients, 13 additional patients can be added to dose level 1 
as opposed to only 6). With 12 patients, any specific severe toxicity with 20% 
incidence will be observed with 93% pr obability.  
 
Secondary Objectives:
 Clinical activity will be described based on the secondary 
objectives, with a description of the activity based on PD-L1 status.  Survival endpoints 
will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Other correlative studies  are considered 
exploratory in the context of this limited Phase I study; however, when the sample size is 12, a single group t-test with a 0.[ADDRESS_762148] 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.766.  
9.3 PLANNED EFFICACY EVALUATIONS  
Planned efficacy evaluations will include assessment of response (RECIST) and 
evaluation of progression-free survival. The assessments are specified in the study calendar. 
Phase I Operating considerations and methods of analysis The Phase I design is the IQ 3+3. To evaluate the operating characteristics, we selected 
12 different scenarios, and ran 800 simulations . In all scenarios, the probability of 
selection of any dose as the MTD differed by [CONTACT_21316] 3% compared to the traditional 
3+3, with the majority within 1%. The mean number of DLTs  above the MTD for the two 
designs (3+3 vs IQ 3+3) differed by 0.[ADDRESS_762149] scenario when implementing the queue-based variation of the 3+3 (the IQ 3+3).  
Tables will be created to summarize all toxicities and side effects by [CONTACT_479], attribution, 
dose, course (cycle 1 vs later cycles) , organ and severity. Rates and associated 95% 
confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs at the RP2D, clinical benefit, response, and PIK3CA mutation rate. Kaplan Meier methods will be used to estimate the median and

Response Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors  (RECIST ) v1.1 
Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 
v1.1), (Eisenhauer et al.  2009) are presented below, with slight modifications from the original 
publication and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity.1 
TUMOR MEASURABILITY 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable 
as described below. All measurable and non-measurable lesions should be assessed at 
screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional 
assessments may be performed as clinically indicated for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519]. 
DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE LESIONS  
Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows:  
• 10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI 
scan sl ice thickness/interval ≤
 5 mm)  
• 10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-m easurable)  
• [ADDRESS_762192] be ≥  [ADDRESS_762193] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be ≤  5 
mm).  At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Additional 
information on lymph node measurement is provided below (see "Identification of Target and 
Non-Target Lesions" and "Calculation of Sum of Diameters"). 
 
[ADDRESS_762194] been made.  
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 155 DEFINITION OF NON- MEASURABLE LESIONS 
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis ≥  10 mm but <  15 mm) as well as truly non -measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_150063].  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING LESION MEASURABILITY  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment, as outlined below. 
Bone Lesions: 
• Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scans, and 
plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. 
However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components  that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets  the definition of 
measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. 
 
Cystic Lesions: 
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable 
lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: 
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
 
METHODS FOR ASSESSING LESIONS  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 156 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging-based evaluation should 
always be the preferred option.  
CLINICAL LESIONS  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥  10 mm in 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules ). For the case of skin les ions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested.  
CHEST X- RAY 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776]. 
CT AND MRI SCANS  
CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CT scan is 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is ≤
 [ADDRESS_762195] slice 
thickness of > [ADDRESS_762196] scans with intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by [CONTACT_234632]. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is 
done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case 
should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forw ard. 
Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non-target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. 
ENDOSCOPY, LAPAROSCOPY, ULTRASOUND, TUMOR MARKERS, CYTOLOGY, 
HISTOLOGY  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be utilized 
for objective tumor evaluation.  
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 157 ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. 
IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS 
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. This 
means that, for instances in which patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be considered non- target lesions.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted above, pathological nodes that are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short 
axis of ≥
 [ADDRESS_762197] 
in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane 
of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short 
axis. For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm  × 30 mm has a short axis 
of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥  10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis of <  10 mm 
are considered non-patho logical and should not be recorded or followed.  
All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or non-measurable), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required. It is possible to record multiple 
non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., "multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes" or "multiple liver metastases"). 
CALCULATION OF SUM OF DIAMETERS 
A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non−lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node 
lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each subsequent tumor 
assessment as a measure of tumor burden. 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762198] the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the 
node regresses to <  10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are included as target 
lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <
 10 mm.  
Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure 
During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non− lymph node) recorded at baseline 
should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when 
very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as 
target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measurement and may report them as being too small to measure. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows:  
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.  
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned and "too small to measure" should be ticked. (Note: It is 
less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable 
size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; 
however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and "too 
small to measure" should also be ticked). 
 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that should be 
recorded, even if it is <  5 mm, and in that case "too small to measure" should not be ticked.  
Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
When non−lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions 
should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a 
plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter 
measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are 
no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
EVALUATION OF NON- TARGET LESIONS 
Measurements are not required for non-target lesions, except that malignant lymph node non-
target lesions should be monitored for reduction to <  10 mm in short axis.  Non-target lesions 
should be noted at baseline and should be identified as "present" or "absent" and (in rare cases) may be noted as "indicative of progression" at subsequent evaluations. In addition, if a lymph 
node lesion shrinks to a non-malignant size (short axis  <
 10 mm), this should be captured on the 
CRF as part of the assessment of non-target lesions.

Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 159 RESPONSE CRITERIA 
CRITERIA FOR TARGET LESIONS 
Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions are 
provided below: 
• Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
• Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR  
• Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline)  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥ 5 mm. 
• Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD  
 
CRITERIA FOR NON- TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non-target 
lesions are provided below. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the schedule of activities.  
• CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor 
marker level  
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size ( <
 10 mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions and/or (if applicable) 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
• PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions  
 
SPECIAL NOTES ON ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESSION OF NON- TARGET 
LESIONS  
Patients with Measurable and Non- Measurable Disease 
For patients with both measurable and non-measurable disease to achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target lesions in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target lesions in the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare. 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.7 160 Patients with Non- Measurable Disease Only   
For patients with non-measurable disease only, the same general concepts apply as noted 
above. However, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the 
interpretation of an increase in non- measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-
measurable disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108], if all lesions are truly non-measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease, that is, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from "trace" to "large" or 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread If unequivocal progression is 
seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be 
ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the increase must be substantial.  
NEW LESIONS 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some "new" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is  particularly important 
when the patient’s baseline lesions show  PR or CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may 
be reported on a CT scan report as a "new" cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
CRITERIA FOR OVERALL RESPONSE AT A SINGLE TIMEPOINT  
Appendix [ADDRESS_762199] non-measurable (therefore non-target) disease only, Appendix 6 
Table 2 is to be used.

Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; PR  = partial 
response; SD  = stable disease.

Patients with Non- Target Lesions Only   
Non-Target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR No CR 
Non-CR/non -PD No Non-CR/non -PD a 
Not all evaluated No NE 
Unequivocal PD  Yes or no  PD 
Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease.  
a "Non -CR/non- PD" is preferred over "stable disease" for non -target disease since 
stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials; thus, assigning "stable disease" when no lesions can be measured is 
not advised.  
 
MISSING ASSESSMENTS AND NOT -EVALUABLE DESIGNATION 
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint. If measurements are made on only a subset of target lesions at a 
timepoint, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesions would not change the assigned timepoint response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of 
PD. For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and 
 
. 
Ipatasertib   City of Hope  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE], Version 2.[ADDRESS_762200] achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
SPECIAL NOTES ON RESPONSE ASSESSMENT  
Patients with a global deterioration in health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as "symptomatic deterioration." Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective 
response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of such 
patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target lesions as shown in Appendix 6 Table 1  and Appendix 6 Table 2 . 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

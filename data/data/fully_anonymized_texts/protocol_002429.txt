Introduction  
 
Falls are the leading cause of non -fatal and fatal injuries in older adults.1 Overall, 30% of adults 
over [ADDRESS_774919] medical 
costs related to falls was estimated as 19 billion in 2000.3 In 2005 there were 15,802 f all-related 
older adult deaths,1 and in 2006 5.8 million older adults (16%) reported a fall in the prior [ADDRESS_774920] within 12 weeks.7 The APTA recently published a Clinical Guidance 
Statement (CGS) for the management of falls in community -dwelling older adults.8 The CGS 
underlined the gap between exercise intervention available within current physical therapy delivery models and substantial levels of challenging exercise required to achieve optimal fall prevention outcomes. It called for future treatment models to address behavior change, self -
efficacy, and adherence to ongoing physical activity and structured exercise.”
[ADDRESS_774921], Living In Fitness Together (LIFT) tests the feasibility and 
preliminary efficacy  of a group- based PT fall prevention program using a within- group peer 
coaching intervention to improve outcomes for older adults at risk for falls by [CONTACT_588384]. The program will consist of group-based physical therapy for balance, strength, flexibility, and mobility training combined 
with a behavioral theory -based goal -achievement and peer -coaching training intervention 
targeting self -efficacy for the patients/group participants. It consists of  [ADDRESS_774922] (PT) and trained staff.  The program is designed to: 1) deliver progressive, tailored, and challenging exercise intervention for older adults at risk for falls;  2) empower older adults to achieve the required 
milestones for exercise and physical activity through training in theory -based behavior change, 
self-management, peer support and peer -coaching applied among the group participants; 3) 
incorporate evidence- based home safety intervention with necessary support for implementation 
of modification recommendations. By [CONTACT_588385]- based fall prevention for long- term patient engagement, 
this project will provide an innovative model for successful fall prevention.   
Our Specific Aims are to:  
1. Assess the feasibility of implementing the peer -coaching program in the physical therapy 
practice context by [CONTACT_588386], attendance, and compl etion of the program.  
 
2. Evaluate whether the LIFT Fall Prevention program creates long- term behavior change as 
measured by [CONTACT_588387] 6 months.  
 
3. Evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the LIFT Fall Prevention program among 48 
patients withi n an outpatient physical therapy practice. Safety will be assessed using self -
reported falls, injuries, and adverse events. To support trial design for a future comparative 
trial, we will measure indicators of initial efficacy including lower extremity str ength and 
function, balance, balance confidence, concern about falls, mobility, physical activity, self -
efficacy for exercise, and exercise adherence.  
 
Intervention Program  
 
Exercise Component  
The design of the group exercise intervention is  based on the evolving evidence for 
exercise and fall prevention.8 This component was modified based on the evidence-  based 
Otago Exercise Program (OEP),[ADDRESS_774923] practice recommendations for fall prevention 
from the APTA Clinical Guidance Statement8 results of Sherrington et al.’s updated exercise 
meta -analysi s and best practice recommendations,[ADDRESS_774924]’s review: 
Characteristics of optimum falls prevention exercise programs for community -dwelling older 
adults.12  This includes progressive, challenging exercise for strength, balance training, mo bility 
and gait training. The intervention will also meet physical activity recommendations from the 
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American Heart Association (AHA).13 
The strengthening /resistive and balance/neuromotor exercise components are based on 
the Otago exercise program with the addition of UE strengthening as recommended by [CONTACT_588388]. Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/endurance exercise will be encouraged through an individualized progressive walking home program with the use of accelerator meter for feedback once cleared 
by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Flexibility exercises will be incorporated into the exercise program or within the peer coaching session.  
 The program frequency is two sessions/week for two weeks, decreasing to one 
time/week for  [ADDRESS_774925] two weeks, for the physical com ponents and 
education for tracking home exercise program. The exercise component will decrease to thirty 
minutes and increased time will be allotted to the goal -achievement component of the program.  
 Intensity for all components will be measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report using the modified Borg 
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale from “somewhat hard” (5- 6) to “vigorous” (7- 8).
14, [ADDRESS_774926] seven major  muscle groups, knee 
flexors, extensors, hip abductors and extensors, ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. The 
addition of 3 upper extremity exercises  is an addition to the Otago program based on ACSM 
recommendations for older adults and these elements will be based on Miriam Nelson’s 
Osteoporosis programs.  Participants will be advised to perform 2- 3 training sessions/week or 
split the sessions into two shorter sessions of 3- [ADDRESS_774927] will monitor for muscle substitution, proper breathing, exercise technique 
and timing and provide guidance to ensure that exercise level is challenging.   
The balance training will incorporate progressive activities that reduce the base of 
support, leaning beyond base of support, shifting center of mass, minimizing upper limb support, 
coordination of single/dual tasks with cognitive challenges. Training and guidance will be 
provided to tailor exercise to meet the requirement for all exercises to be challenging. Dynamic walking activities including obstacle courses for functional act ivities and strategies for transfers 
to and from the floor will be included.   
 The flexibility exercises  will include a static stretching program involving all major 
muscle groups and yoga based stretches in both sitting and standing  after warm up or cool down.  
 The endurance/walking will be prescribed  based on examination results throughout the 
group sessions. Patients who are deemed safe for a  home walking program will receive 
guidance for tailored, progressive walking program with the goal of >=3x/week. The intensity of 
walking will be self -rated usi ng the Borg scale, and duration goals will be adjusted accordingly.  
 The home program will be based on the evidence- based Otago program, modified and 
individually tailored based on the goals and exercise progression achieved in the group 
sessions. Patient s will be provided with exercise program materials based on the Otago manual, 
including calendar and exercise diary to manage and document exercise performance and 
progression. The manual will include detailed instructions for the material presented in group sessions, with visual aids, including frequency, intensity, time by [CONTACT_588389], instructions for progression and use of the Borg scale to guide intensity. Patients will record steps taken as reported by [CONTACT_588390].  
 At the [ADDRESS_774928] will 
discuss present program; review tracking system for home exercise program; review exercise 
intensity levels based on the Perceived Exertion Rating for each exercise type (e.g. resistance 
and walking). Individual progression and/or modifications will be determined by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541]. The Goal -Setting program lead will facilitate a discussion about how goal -setting and 
peer-coaching activities have been going. Figure [ADDRESS_774929] these data.  Older Adult Patient

The three main dimensions of the Goal Achievement component include:  
1. Goal Setting  
2. Self-Assessment  
3. Self-Awareness  
During the program, participants will be provided with education and participate in guided, 
individualized and group activities to promote independence in each of the three dimensions.  
 
Goal Setting  
Participants will receive education and training in goal -setting throughout the program. Goal 
Setting is a shar ed provider/participant activity that includes consideration of outcome 
expectations, potential short term (ST) and long- term (LT) goals, confidence in achieving the 
goals, potential facilitators and impediments, and problem -solving.  
 
In order to facilita te Goal Setting the provider will work with participants to complete a Goals 
Worksheet (Appendix A). The provider will discuss and complete the overall program goals and 
individualized PT goals with the participant, and ask the participant to complete the activity 
goals.  
Participants will be asked to refer back to these goals on a weekly basis and adjust the goals as appropriate. To support achieving their short term and long term goals, we will teach 
participants to create weekly Action Plans (Appendix B) in which they will include the specific 
action(s) they will take, and include details such as intensity, duration and frequency of exercise 
for the week. Within the Action Plan, participants will rate their confidence in carrying out the 
action plan as fol lows:  
 
How much confidence do you have that you will complete the action plan?  
None  at all  A little  A lot  Full confidence  
o  o  o  o  
 
We will teach participants skills to use when they find that their confidence in achieving the 
goals is low. Identification of barriers and facilitators, brainstorming and experimentation will be 
used as described in Self -Assessment below.  
 
Self-Assessment  
Self-Assessment will be framed as dialogue with oneself, with peer coaches, or other sources of 
social support. The approach is aimed at fostering experiential learning and development of 
self-efficacy for exercise. A key feature of the training will be the focus on teaching participants 
to model the target behaviors in their group interactions. We will train participants to ask and answer key questions to assess their progress, build self -efficacy, problem -solve, and take 
positive action to achieve their goals (Appendix C).  
Sample questions include:  
• What went well? Did I do the exercises and activity I planned?   
• What were my challenges?  [Impediments/barriers]  
• What are some solutions I could try/What could I do next time?  
• Which one(s) will I try first?  
 Participants will use these questions to foster problem solving with an emphasis of 
experimentation, and solution focused success.  Participants will be encouraged to write out 
their responses to the questions and to share with the group.  If they report s uccess then they 
will be demonstrating good role modeling for the group.  If they report barriers, then the group 
can help with group problem solving, by [CONTACT_588392].  They will identify the 
barrier(s), pi[INVESTIGATOR_128718], then brainstorm with the group and lastly chose one to try during the coming 
week.  These steps will be repeated weekly by [CONTACT_588393], self -efficacy and adherence to their exercise program and incorporated into their 
interaction in the peer -supp ort sessions.  
    
 
Self-Awareness  
We will teach participants skills and activities to promote self -awareness and self -efficacy and 
independence in managing their impediments to goal achievement. Examples of activities will 
be self -rating of confidence in accomplishing goals (as shown in goal -setting above) level of 
calmness/peacefulness, stress, and energy and symptom levels. We will teach simple 
management strategies such as breathing and position and activity changes to improve self -
efficacy and management. We will use self -rating to teach awareness.  The following are 
examples of questions that can be asked.  A worksheet of self -awareness self ratings will be 
provided in the binder (Appendix D)  
 
Below are two examples:  
How stressed do I feel right now?  
Not  at all  A little  Very       
o  o  o   
 
How much energy do I have right now?  
None  at all  A little  A lot     
    
 
Peer -Coaching Component  
The goal of the Peer coaching component is for team members to provide social and emotional 
support to each other to support achievement of the exercise adherence goals. Peer coaching is  
a process in which [ADDRESS_774931] succeeded in 
long- term adherence to exercise. The emphasis of th e LIFT program is on learning adherence 
and peer support skills together.  
 
Participants will receive instruction and training in roles and responsibilities and basic peer 
support skills including active listening,  such as restating, summarizing, minimal e ncouragers, 
reflecting, giving feedback, using simple follow -up questions, validat ion, effective pause,  and 
avoiding communication blockers. We will also teach the use of open and closed- ended 
questions. This material will be taught using lecture, discussi on, video as well as role playing in 
which the participants will practice specific skills in multiple group sizes (pairs, and groups of 4) 
in the context of their own exercise goals. We will ask participants about their current technology 
use and incorporate technology as appropriate, including group calls and social media. We will 
teach the participants how to conduct a group call/session, and how to fulfill the role of 
facilitator.  
 
Support materials such as scripts  and choices of probes are provided in t he LIFT binder . 
Participants will have the opportunity to debrief after they practice the skills, and after they try 
peer-coaching on their own. They will be provided with contact [CONTACT_588394]. Figure 4 below provides a detailed model of the elements of the 
Goal Achievement component.

Home Safety Evaluation  
Each participant in the LIFT study (intervention and control groups) will have the opportunity to have a home safety evaluation by [CONTACT_345845][INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT) at no cost the participants or 
their insurers. The goal of the home evaluation will be to help the participant to identify any 
environmental changes or equipment that could decrease their risk of falling and make everyday 
tasks easier and safer at home.  
 
At the time of baseline data collection, a series of questions will be administered to the 
participants to gather information about prior home safety evaluations and planning information, 
including whether or not the participant would like a home safety evaluation. Based on the results of these questions the OT investigator will follow -up with the participant to provide 
guidance or to schedule and conduct the home safety evaluation.  
 The OT will use the H OME -FAST tool to guide the home safety evaluation and to document 
results and recommendations (Appendix E)  
 
Control Program  
The control group will  continue with "usual care" one- on-one physical therapy. In addition, they 
will attend a control group class that provides social interaction and interesting health 
information. They will be asked to track when and how much they do their PT home exercise 
program, walking, and any falls or adverse events or problems. Below is a description of the 
control group class.  
"Healthy YOUniversity"  is a program developed by [CONTACT_588396][INVESTIGATOR_588364] (MAHHC) for the Living In Fitnes s Together Research Study to 
provide group education about activities and behaviors that promote healthy living. This 6-session program includes the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:

 Number eligible  
 Number refusing.  
We will collect number consenting from the consent forms  
We will track class attend ance using an attendance sign- in sheet (Appendix  O) 
Cancel lations (notification) and no -show status will be tracked by [CONTACT_588403]  (Linda for 
Intervention and Michael for control ).  
Adverse Event  Monitoring and Reporting  
We will follow the guidelines of [LOCATION_011] University Medical Campus (BUMC) IRB with respect to defining and reporting adverse events, serious adverse events and unanticipated problems.  The following definitions will be used:  
Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable m edical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to  the subject’s participation in the research.  
SERIOUS Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that  
Grade (1) results in death;  
Grade (2) is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred);  
Grade (3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
Grade (4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
Grade (5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
Grade (6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergenc y room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
  
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three of 
the foll owing criteria:  
• is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents (such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document); and (b) the characteristics 
of the subject population being studied;  AND 
• is related or possibly related  to participation in the research ( possibly related  means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  AND 
• suggest s that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
Unanticipated problems must be reported to the BU IRB using the Repor table Events and New 
Information form.  BU IRB requires that all Unanticipated Problems meeting the definition listed 
above and involving a fatal or life- threatening event be rep orted to them within [ADDRESS_774936] be reported to the BU IRB in section 5 of the Continuing Review submission and include the Principal Investigator’s conclusion that the pattern of events does not suggest a greater risk of harm.  
Adverse Event Recording from the Baseline Data Collection through Week 6 (in -
person classes)  
Because this study includes older adults at increased risk for falls, we expect adverse events in 
this study to include falls. In addition, we expect adverse events from exercise in both groups to 
include: fatigue, muscle soreness or other discomfort or a fall or injury during tests and exercise. 
As per Lamb 200516, falls will be de scribed as "unexpected events in which the partic ipants 
come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level. " Participants will be provided with the definition 
of falls used in this study in the Baseline Data Collection & Orientation session (prior to starting 
the program). They will be provided with their  binders, and we will instruct them in the use of the 
Action plan to record daily any falls or adverse events, symptoms and questions, as they occur.  
At each session, the instructor will collect the forms, make copi[INVESTIGATOR_588378], and 
return t hem to the participants.  
 If participants report fall(s) and/or adverse effects/events through the Action Plan (intervention) 
or Activity Tracker (control),  or verbally, in- person or by [CONTACT_756], the instructor will provide 
appropriate clinical assessment and recommendations and modifications if safe to continue 
participating  in the program and document in t he clinical flow chart.   In addition, the instructor 
will fill out the Adverse Event Form ( Appendix P) and provide the form to the research assistant, 
who will document the event in a master log of all adverse events.   
If a part icipant falls or experiences an adverse event while attending the class session, the 
instructor will provide appropriate clinical assessment and recommendations and modifications 
if safe to continue participating in the program and document in the clinical flow chart. If injury 
occurred and the participant was unable to participate i n the class, the instructor will complete 
and submit an RL Solutions event as per Mt Ascutney procedures. The instructor will determine 
whether the participant need s to seek medical attention at MAHHC and assist  the participant  to 
the clinic or emergency department.   In addition, the instructor will fill out the Adverse Event 
Form ( appendix P ) and provide the form to the research assistant  for documentation in the 
master log.  
If any adverse event , either self -reported or experienced during class,  meets the definition of 
Unanticipated Problem,  the instructor will , in addition to providing the Adverse Event Form to the 
research assistant,  notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318] (same day).  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588379] 2 business days if the adverse event 
meets the definition of Unanticipated Problem and involves a fatal or life- threatening event , and 
within 7 days otherwise.  All adverse event s that do  not meet the definition of Unanticipated 
Problem  will be reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_588380].  
Adverse Event  Recording from Week 6 through Study C ompletion (6 months)   
To identify adverse events  after the regular class sessions have been completed, participants 
will record the events in their tracking forms, and a blinded assessor (separate from the 
outcomes assessor, study management and intervention teams) will contact [CONTACT_588404] [ADDRESS_774937] script 
will be followed during these sessions to obtain consis tent information and to maintain blinding 
(appendix P ).  The blinded assessor will fill out the Adverse Event Form for any event reported 
during a call and provide it to the research assistant for documentation and tracking.  If the adverse event meets the definition of Unanticipated Problem, the blinded assessor will also notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318] (same day).  The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588381].  In addition, other 
study staff will report adverse events if they become aware of them  during the post -group class 
time period ( Week 6 –  6 Months) by [CONTACT_588405], providing it to the 
research assistant, and notifying the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588382].

Within [ADDRESS_774938] the physical tests, and complete  the Baseline Data Collection Form.  
The Intervention and Control groups will be invited to separate Data Collection times or rooms in 
groups of 4. For example, 4 of the Intervention participants will be scheduled for 10:00am on 
Thursday. They will be shown into one room. The blinded research staff (Andrea) will be 
informed of the room and time, but not t he assignment of the group. She will inform the 
participants that she must not know their assignment. She will instruct the participants to 
complete the questionnaires, and offer to clarify as needed. While participants are completing 
the questionnaires, s he will conduct the TUG, [ADDRESS_774939] and 
Dynamic Gait Index (10 minutes)  individually. When participant s have  completed the 
questionnaires and physical tests, The Data Collector ( Andrea)  will release them to unbli nded 
study staff (Meg), who will bring the participant s to the appropriate location for their separate 
orientation sessions. She will also deliver the physical test results to the Intervention group 
instructor (Linda) to inform the Orientation session. The orie ntation will consist of an explanation 
of the over all structure of the class, provi sion of the Participant Binder and the activity monitors, 
and ascertaining the starting weight for strength training. Instruction will be provided on use of the monitors. Participants will be asked to wear the monitors daily and to record their steps in 
their Acti on Plan  (Appendix  B) until the first program session to establish their baseline walking 
activity.  The Acti on Plan  will also be used to track daily symptoms and fal ls on a daily basis.  
 Orientation to the Program  (see Appendix  Q) 
Each participant leaves with his/her assessment form.  
Intervention group meets with Linda who: Completes the Goals Form based on the assessment 
form and patient input. Linda will put copy in binder and make copy for records. Linda will 
document PT progress note with plan of care and goals in medical record (Initial evaluation was done by [CONTACT_588406][INVESTIGATOR_541] ).

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
From grant submission  7-27-2015  
 
Enrollment and safety data will be collected in the study database by [CONTACT_588407]-
investigators. Safety analyses will be conducted based on similarly basic data collection and tracking and will include summary falls, adverse events and protocol deviati ons, and summary 
statistics (n,%) calculated. This feasibility study will not be powered to detect differences in 
outcomes between the [ADDRESS_774941] (baseline) and corresponding values at  post-tests (6 -week /program completion, [ADDRESS_774942] program ). The corresponding confidence intervals will be calculated  to fully describe 
the plausible true population values.
[ADDRESS_774943] time point, we will apply analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the relat ionship between the post -test score and treatment 
controlling for the pretest score and demographic variables.

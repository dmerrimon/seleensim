Title:  A Phase  1/2 Study of FPA008, an anti -CSF1 Receptor Antibody, in Patients with 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_657676] (PVNS)/Diffuse Type Tenosynovial Giant Cell 
Tumor (dt -TGCT)  
Protocol 
Number:  FPA008 -002 
Clinical Phase:  1/2  
Sponsor:  Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study Centers:  Approximately 11 study centers in North America, Europe, and Asia  
Objectives:   
Primary: • Phase 1: To determine the recommended dose (RD) of FPA008 in patients with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_134364] (PVNS)/diffuse type tenosynovial giant cell 
tumor (dt- TGCT)  
• Phase 2: To estimate the objective response rate (ORR = CR+PR) of FPA008 in 
patients with PVNS/dt -TGCT  
Secondary: • To characterize the safety and tolerability of FPA008 in patients with PVNS/dt-TGCT  
• To determine the duration of response in responding patients 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics of FPA008 in patients with PVNS/dt -TGCT  
Exploratory: • 
 
 
  
• To evaluate synovial fluid for FPA008 concentration and changes in cellularity in selected patients 
• To assess funct i
onal outcomes as measured by : 
– Ogilvie -Harris score developed specifically for PVNS (Ogilvie -Harris 
1992, Rhee 2010 ) 
– Brief Pai n Inventory ( Appendix 5 ) 
– Joint Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale ( Appendix 6) 
 

FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886620]  2016 
 Page 5 of 99 Confidential  Study Design:  This is a Phase 1/2 study. Phase 1 is a dose escalation, open -label, safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD  study of FPA008. Patients will be enrolled into either Phase 
1 or Phase 2 of the study, but not both. 
After an initial Screening period of up to 28 days, patients will be treated with 
FPA008 every 2 weeks in 28- day cycles.  
In Phase 1, each dosed patient will be observed during Cycle 1 for safety 
assessments and occurrence of dose -limiting toxicities (DLT Observation Period).  
 If a patient does not receive  2 doses in Cycle 1 and has not experienced a dose 
limiting toxicity, then a replacement patient will be necessary at that dose level.  
Additional treatments may be administered every 2 weeks in 28- day cycles 
thereafter as clinically indicated (Extended Tr eatment Period).  
In Phase 2, patients will be treated with FPA008 every [ADDRESS_886621] selected after assessment of data obtained in Phase 1.  
 Phase 1: Dose -Escalation 
In Phase 1, three dose cohorts are anticipated, with a minimum of 3 patients 
enrolled in each cohort. The planned dose levels and schedules are:  
Dose level 1:  1 mg/kg FPA008 q2w 
Dose level 2:  2 mg/kg FPA008 q2w 
Dose level 3:  4 mg/kg FPA008 q2wReview of safety, PK and PD  profiles may 
inform decisions to add cohorts with a lternative dose levels or dose regimens (e.g., 
differen t dosing frequency, higher dose levels) in order to reach an optimal target 
exposure. 
All dose escalation decisions will be based on the assessment of DLTs, overall 
safety, and tolerability and will be  made after the last patient enrolled in each cohort 
has completed the first treatment cycle. Dose escalation decisions will be agreed 
upon by [CONTACT_194447] (CRC), consisting of the Sponsor and Investigators.  
 
 The following algorithm will b e used for dose escalation decisions:  
  
Number of Patients 
with DLTs  Action  
0/3 Open next cohort  
1/3 Enroll 3 more patients in same cohort  
≥ 2/3  Stop enrollment. Enter 3 more patients at dose level below, if 
only 3 were previously entered  
1/6 Open next  cohort  
≥ 2/6  Stop enrollment. Enter 3 more patients at a dose level below 
or at an intermediate dose level if the current dose level is 
≥50% higher than the previous dose level  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886622]  2016 
 Page 6 of 99 Confidential  Study Design 
(Cont.): The selection of the RD will be based on clinical response and safety data as well as 
PK and PD profiles. The Sponsor and Investigators may decide to discontinue dose 
escalation before reaching the highest planned dose of 4 mg/kg or, potentially, 
evaluate a higher (> 4mg/kg) dose if the safety, PK, and PD data support evaluation 
of different dose lev els. 
 
 After declaring  the RD, the Sponsor and Investigators may decide to evaluate 
alternative dose levels to those defined in the protocol if the safety, PK, PD, and 
efficacy data support further evaluation of additional dose s in order to reach an 
optimal target exposure. The d ose escalation rules specified in Section 3.1.2  will 
apply to the additional cohorts.  
 Phase 1: Extended Treatment Period  
On completion of Cycle 1 (Safety and PK Assessment Period), Phase 1 patients 
may participate in an Extended Treatment Period, which begins on Day 1 of 
Cycle  2. FPA008 will be administered every 2 weeks in 4 -week cycles for up to 24 
weeks of treatment or until disease progression (if before 24 weeks of treatment ), 
unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to discontinue, or termination of 
the study.  
 Phase [ADDRESS_886623] has been identified by [CONTACT_10186], based on ove rall safety, tolerability, objective response, PK, PD and estimates of 
efficacious exposures extrapolated from nonclinical data. If dose escalation 
continues higher than 4 mg/kg, the RD may or may not be a maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD), if an MTD is identif ied in Phase 1. For example, if an MTD is not 
reached, or if exposure at the MTD is much higher than the level believed to be 
required for efficacy, or if subsequent cycles of treatment provide additional insight 
on the safety profile, then the RD may be a different, though not higher, dose than the MTD.   
After initiation of Phase 2, the RD may be changed based on data from continued dose exploration. Any change in  the RD for Phase [ADDRESS_886624] stable or improving symptoms with stable measurable 
disease or better by [CONTACT_9268] (magnetic resonance imaging), but is having intolerable or Grade 3 or greater adverse events, dose reduction by 25-50% may be allowed with 
Sponsor agreement. 
Retreatment Cohort  
At the discretion of the Sponsor, pa tients from the 1  mg/kg  or 2 mg/kg cohorts may 
be retreated at the RD after a washout period of at least [ADDRESS_886625] for an additional 6 cycles (12 doses).

Dose -
Modification 
Criteria:  Dose reductions may be permitted for patients on treatment beyond the DLT period 
in Phase 1 or any patient in Phase 2 upon discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_429]. 
Patients may miss up to 2 consecutive doses (up to 6 weeks between doses) for 
adverse or other events; omission of additional dosing longer than 6 weeks for 
adverse or other events will necessitate the patient’s removal from the study unless 
allowed by [CONTACT_1034]. 
If a patient’s dose is decreased for an adverse event, dose escalation to the 
originally assigned dose may occur after resolution of the AE and after discussion 
with and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. Recurrence of the AE to greater than Grade 2 
will result in p ermanent dose reduction without the opportunity for re -escalation.  
Concomitant 
Medications:  Supportive care (e.g., anti- emetics; analgesics for pain control) may be used at the 
Investigator’s discretion and in accordance with institutional procedures.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886640]  2016 
 Page 10 of 99 Confidential  Withdrawal 
Criteria:  A patient must be discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy if any of the following apply: 
• Consent withdrawal at the request of the patient or their legally authorized 
representative  
• Progression of patient’s disease.  
• Any event that would pose an unacceptable safety risk to the patient  
• A concurrent illness that would affect assessments of the clinical status to a significant degree  
• A positive pregnancy test at any time during the study 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor or its a uthorized representative (e.g., if 
the study is terminated for reasons of patient safety).  
PK and PD Assessments:  Pharmacokinetics (PK)  
The following PK parameters will be derived from concentration- time data for 
FPA008, when appropriate and applicable (other parameters, such as accumulation 
ratio and half- life, may also be calculated):  
• Area under serum concentration -time curve (AUC)  
• Maximum serum concentration (C
max) 
• Minimum serum concentration (C min) 
• Clearance (CL)  
• Volume of distribution at steady stat e (V ss) 
 Pharmacodynamics (PD)  
•  
    
  
  
 
  
  
  
• Synovial fluid (optional)

FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886641]  2016 
 Page 11 of 99 Confidential  Tumor 
Response 
Parameters:  MRI of affected joints will be performed at Screening, 4, 8, and 16 weeks (or until 
treatment discontinuation) following the start of treatment. A tumor assessment 
should also be performed at the 30 days (±7 days) and 90 days (±7 days) End of Treatment Follow- Up Visits unless already performed within the previous [ADDRESS_886642] 1.1 and TVS based on 
independent central radiology review.  
Clinical assessment of health outcomes (function, symptoms) will be done at 
Scree ning, C1D15 (pre-dose), C2D1 (pre-dose), and then on Day 1 (pre-dose) for 
all subsequent cycles through [ADDRESS_886643] not progressed should continue onto Long-Term Follow-up after 
completing the End of Treatment Follow-up Period.  Patients are to be followed 
(MRI and assessment of health outcomes) every 14  (± 2)  weeks until progression, 
the patient undergoes local therapy (e.g., resection, radiation) or a new systemic therapy is initiated, for up to 52 weeks following C1D1. 
Positron emission tomography ( PET) scans will be performed for a subset of 
approximately 10 patients from P hase 2 at S creening, C3, D1 (±7 days), C6D15 (±7 
days) Visit , 90 days (±7 days) End of Treatment Follow- Up Visit , and at the first 
Long-Term Follow-up Visit ( 14 weeks (± 2 weeks)  post 90 days End of Treatment 
Visit ). 
Safety 
Assessments:  Safety of FPA008 will be assessed by [CONTACT_657685], vital signs, 12- lead ECGs, and clin ical laboratory 
measurements.  
Statistical Procedures:  All analyses will be descriptive and will be presented by [CONTACT_657686]. Patient data from the Phase [ADDRESS_886644] will also be summarized. Because of the low number 
of patients that may be enrolled at lower dose levels, some dose levels may be 
combined for summarization. Missing values in the efficacy data will be treated as 
missing; no efficacy data will be imputed.  
 Data collected in this study will be presented using summary tables and patient data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented where appropriate.  
Response rates and the corresponding confidence interval (CI) will be used to 
access efficacy. It is anticipated that there will be a total of approximately 20-[ADDRESS_886645] overall. Table 8 displays the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval and the precision for various sample sizes and observed response rates.  
PK parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental analysis methods, 
though compartmental analysis methods may be employed if appropriate.

 Page 22 of 99 Confidential  1. Introduction  
1.1. PVNS Background  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_134364] (PVNS) is a benign neoplasm of the synovium with features of 
both reactive inflammation and clonal neoplastic proliferation in which colony stimulating factor -1 (CSF1) is over expressed. A common translocation of the CSF1  gene (1p13) to the 
COL6A3  promoter (2q35) is present in approximately 60% of PVNS patients. The translocation 
is accompanied by [CONTACT_38247]1 overexpression in the synovium. In addition, approximately 40% of PVNS patients have CSF1 overexpression in the absence of an identified CSF1  translocation. 
The consistent presence of CSF1 overexpression in all cases of PVNS and reactive synovitis suggests both an important role for CSF1 in the spectrum of synovial pathologies and the utility of targeting the CSF1/CSF1R interac tion therapeutically ( West 2006).  
In PVNS, CSF1 overexpression is present in a minority of synovial cells, whereas the majority of the cellular infiltrate expresses CSF1R but not CSF1. This has been characterized as a tumor -
landscapi[INVESTIGATOR_657679]1 expression in the neoplastic cells, leading to the abnormal accumulation of non- neoplastic cells that form a mass.  
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with localized PVNS. Recurrences occur in 8 -20% 
of patients and are easily managed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-excision. PVNS/dt-TGCT tends to recur more often (33–50%) and has a much more aggressive clinical course. Patients are often symptomatic and 
require multiple surgical procedures during the ir lifetime. For patients with unresectable disease 
or multiple recurrences, systemic therapy using CSF1R inhibitors may help delay or avoid surgical procedures and improve functional outcomes ( Ravi 2011). 
Imatinib, a non-specific inhibitor of CSF1R, has undergone evaluation in [ADDRESS_886662] common site of disease was the knee (n = 17; 59%). Five of 27 evaluable patients had complete (n=1) or partial (n=4) responses per RECIST for an overall response rate of 19%. Twenty of 27 patients (74%) had stable disease. Symptomatic improvement was noted in 16 of 22 patients (73%) who were assessable for symptoms. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high rate of symptomatic improvement and an overall favorable safety profile, 10 patients discontinued treatment for either toxicity or other reasons ( Cassier 2012 ). 
Recently two studies of potent inhibitors of CSF1 signaling have shown preliminary but compelling clinical activity in patients with PVNS. PLX3397, a CSF1R kinase inhibitor, and RG7155, a monoclonal antibody targeting CSF1R have been evaluated in patients with PVNS (Cassier 2014, Tap 2014 ). In both studies, a majority of patients with PVNS responded to 
treatment based on RECIST, FDG-PET, and/or total volum e score, which is a measure of disease 
volume by [CONTACT_9268].  
In PVNS, overexpression of CSF1 by a minority of cells leads to recruitment of CSF1R-
expressing cells that make up the bulk of the tumor mass. FPA008 antagonizes CSF1R activation and should result in the reduction of CSF1R-expressing cells in the tumor thereby [CONTACT_657687].

 Page 38 of 99 Confidential  3. Overall Design and Plan of the Study  
3.1. Overview  
This is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_886671] of 2 doses: on Day [ADDRESS_886672] infusion of FPA008 
(Appendix 1). Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study specific Screening tests or procedures. Screening assessments will be performed within [ADDRESS_886673] FPA008 dose will be collected during this period. 
3.1.2. Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) 
Dose escalation will continue until either the MTD or maximum feasible dose is reached, with a 
minimum of 3 patients enrolled in each cohort. The anticipated dose levels and schedules are: 
• Dose level 1:  1 mg/kg q2w 
• Dose level 2:  2 mg/kg q2w 
• Dose level 3:  4 mg/kg q2w 
All dose escalation decisions will be based on assessment of DLTs, overall safety, and 
tolerability and will be made after the last patient enrolled in each cohort has completed the first treatment cycle. Dose escalation decisions will be agreed upon between the Investigators and the Sponsor. Prior to initiating each new dose level or expanding an existing dose level, a safety teleconference will be held wherein Investigators and the Sponsor review patient data, including, but not limited to, demographics, FPA008 dosing, concomitant medications, hematology and serum chemistry, and AEs; and confer and document agreement that dose escalation or expanding an existing dose level is considered appropriate. If the Sponsor and Investigators collectively agree that following review of safety and pharmacokinetic data, that a different dose escalation scheme should be used than the one outlined, this will be permitted. Review of safety, PK and PD parameters may inform decisions to add cohorts with alternative dose levels or dose regimens (e.g., less frequent dosing or with a loading dose) in order to reach an optimal target exposure. 
The following algorithm will be used for dose escalation decisions: 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886674]  2016 
 Page 39 of 99 Confidential  Table 2: Dose -Escalation Considerations 
Number of Patients with DLT  
at a Given Dose Level  Dose Escalation Decision Rule  
0/3 Escalation will occur to the next higher dose cohort  
1/3 Enroll three more patients in same cohort  
≥ 2/3  Stop enrollment. Enter three more patients at dose level below, if only three 
were previously entered  
1/6 Open next cohort  
≥ 2/6  Stop enrollment. Enter 3 more patients at a dose level below or at an 
intermediate dose level if the current dose level is ≥ 50% higher than the 
previous dose level  
The MTD is defined as the highest dose associated with DLTs in less than 33% of patients 
receiv ing FPA008 administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28- day cycle. This will normally be the 
dose recommended for further study (RD); however, based on review of safety and PK data, the RD could be lower than the MTD. If the MTD is not reached, and the highest evaluated FPA008 dose is well tolerated, the data will be reviewed to assess  whether further dose escalations are 
warranted. The protocol may be amended if additional dose escalation is considered appropriate. 
If the MTD is not reached during Phase 1, or subsequent cycles of treatment in Phase [ADDRESS_886675], the Sponsor and Investigators may decide to evaluate alternative dose 
levels t o those defined in the protocol if the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy data support further 
evaluation of additional doses in order to reach an optimal target exposure. The dose escalation rules outlined in Section 3.1.2 will apply to the additional cohorts.
  
If a patient does not receive 2 doses and does not complete the safety and PK assessment in 
Cycle  1 for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., disease progression or withdrawal of consent), then 
an additional patient will be enrolled into the cohort so that the cohort has at least three patients evaluable for tolerability through Cycle 1. All such discussions and decisions will be documented as part of the dose escalation decision -making process.  
Intra -patient dose escalation above the starting dose for each patient is not permitted. 
If a patient’s dose is decreased for an adverse event, dose escalation to the originally assigned dose may occur after resoluti on of the AE and after discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Recurrence of the AE to greater than Grade 2 will result in permanent dose reduction without the opportunity for re- escalation.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886676]  2016 
 Page 40 of 99 Confidential  On completion of Cycle 1 (Safety and PK Assessment Period), Phase 1 patients may participate 
in an Extended Treatment Period, which begins on Day 1 of Cycle 2. FPA008 will be administered every 2 weeks in 4- week cycles for up to 24 weeks of treatment or until disease 
progression (if before 24 weeks of treatment ), unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician 
decision to discontinue, death, or Sponsor termination of the study (as defined in Section 9.12), assuming no limitations with availability of drug supply, or other issues that may preclude the Sponsor from providing FPA008. 
3.1.3. Phase [ADDRESS_886677] has been identified by [CONTACT_10186], based on overall 
safety, tolerability, objec tive response, PK, PD and estimates of efficacious exposures 
extrapolated from nonclinical data. If dose escalation continues higher than 4 mg/kg, the RD may or may not be an MTD, if an MTD is identified in Phase 1. For example, if an MTD is not reached, o r if exposure at the MTD is much higher than the level believed to be required for 
efficacy, or if subsequent cycles of treatment provide additional insight on the safety profile, then the RD may be a different, though not higher, dose than the MTD. 
After initiation of Phase 2, the RD may be changed based on data from continued dose 
exploration. Any change in the RD for Phase 2 will only apply to newly enrolled patients. There 
will be no intra -patient dose- escalation. The total number of patients for enrollment in Phase 2 
will be approximately 25 -30, irrespective of the assigned dose.
 
Treatment is planned to continue every 2 weeks for up to 24 weeks of treatment  (no more than 
12 doses) or until disease progression. 
If a patient appears to have stable or impr oving symptoms with stable measurable disease or 
better by [CONTACT_9268], but is having intolerable or Grade 3 or greater adverse events, dose reduction by 
25–50% may be allowed with Sponsor agreement. 
3.1.4. Retreatment Cohort  
At the discretion of the Sponsor, patients from the 1  mg/kg  or 2 mg/kg cohorts may be retreated 
at the RD after a washout period of at least 4 months and rescreening. 
Patients treated at lower dose levels (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg FPA008) during Phase [ADDRESS_886678]  for an additional 6 cycles (12 doses). Some of the patients treated at 1 mg/kg 
and 2 mg/kg had symptomatic relief without any radiological response. Treating these patients at the RD will provide an expanded safety profile. This will also provide additional information on assessme nt of efficacy through both RECIST and Patient- Reported Outcomes (PROs)  after the 
re-treatment.  
The patients eligible for this cohort will have already met the primary eligibility requirements, completed 6 cycles of initial treatment at either the 1 mg/kg  or the 2 mg/kg dose levels, and have 
completed the end -of-treatment follow -up period. Prior to re -treatment, potential patients will 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886679]  2016 
 Page 41 of 99 Confidential  need to provide written informed consent and be re- assessed to ensure they meet the same 
eligibility requirements as untreated (naïve) patients.  
3.2. Procedures  
Patients will undergo safety evaluations (DLTs and other AEs, vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests), determination of ECOG performance status (PS), and physical examinations (Appendix 1). Additionally, blood samples will be collected for PK and PD analyses for all 
patients ( Appendix 2).  
MRI of affected joints will be performed at Screening, 4, 8, and 16 weeks following the start of treatment. An MRI should also be performed at the 30 days (±7 days) and 90 days (±7 days) End of Treatment Follow -up Visits unless already performed within the previous [ADDRESS_886680] MRI every 14 (± 2) weeks until progression, the patient undergoes local 
therapy (e.g., resection, radiation) or a new systemic therapy is initiated, for up to [ADDRESS_886681] 1.1 and TVS based on independent central radiology review.  
Clinical assessment of health outcomes (function, symptoms) will be done a t baseline, Cycle 1 
Day 15, Cycle 2, Day 1 and then approximately every 4  weeks , prior to the administration of 
study drug. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_657688], weight, vital 
signs, 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory measurements. Assessment of AEs will follow the 
guidelines provided in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE), version 4.03. Blood samples will also be drawn at scheduled time 
points ( Appendix 2) during the study for determination of drug serum concentration, and anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs) (i.e., antibody response to FPA008).  
In patients who have archival tumor tissue available and who have signed the Optional Research 
Sample Informed Consent Form , the tissue will be evaluated for CSF1  gene translocation if not 
previously done ( Appendix 1). In addition, CSF1 and CSF1R and CD68 markers and will be 
determined.  
For patients who sign the applicable Optional Research Sample Informed Consent Form, baseline tumor tissue resections ( ≥0.5 cm to ≤ 2 cm) and synovial fluid (if applicable) will be 
obtained from patients prior to starting FPA008 treatment and after eligibility criteria have been fulfilled. The baseline tissue sample will be reviewed by a pathologist to determine whether the tissue is evaluable. If the Screening tissue sample is evaluable, a subsequent biopsy will be performed before the Cycle 2, Day 1 administration of FPA008 ( Appendix 1).  
Patients enrolled in Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the study may continue treatment with FPA008 in 28-day cycles for up to 24 weeks of treatment or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, 
patient or physician decision to discontinue, or Sponsor termination of the study. Responding 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886682]  2016 
 Page 42 of 99 Confidential  patients who discontinue treatment while still in response (CR, PR or SD) should get follow-up 
scans at 14 ( ±2)-week intervals during the Long- Term Follow -up Period to determine the 
duration of response, unless other therapy is started for the treatment of PVNS/dt- TGCT or 
consent is withdrawn.  
Approximately t en patients enrolled in Phase 2 will undergo a PET scan  at Screening, Cycle 3 
Day 1 (±7 days), Cycle 6 Day 15  (±7 days) Visit, 90 days (±7 days) End of Treatment Follow-pp 
Visit, and at the first Long -Term Follow -up Visit (14 weeks (± 2 weeks) post 90 days End of 
Treatment Visit ).. All patients should return to the clinic for three End of Treatment Follow-up 
visits irrespective of whether a patient is withdrawn or withdraws at a planned visit or mid -cycle.  
AEs will be assessed from the time the first dose of FPA008 is administered through 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of FPA008 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected after signing of the informed consent form through 90 days (± 7 days) after the 
last dose (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .

4.4. Patient Withdrawal and Replacement 
The patient has the right to stop treatment or to withdraw from the study at any time. Patients may continue to repeat cycles (up to 6 cycles) of FPA008 treatment until at least one of the following criteria applies: 
• Consent withdrawal at the patient’s request or at the request of their legally authorized 
representati ve

 Page 48 of 99 Confidential  • Progression of patient’s underlying disease 
• Any event that would pose an unacceptable safety risk to the patient 
• An intercurrent illness that would affect assessments of the clinical status to a significant 
degree and require discontinuation of therapy 
• A positive pregnancy test at any time during the study  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor or its authorized representative (for example, if the study is terminated for reasons of patient safety)  
The date and reason for cessation of FPA008 will be documented, and the Investigator must make every effort to perform the End of Treatment Follow- Up visits. Patients will be followed 
for 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of FPA008 for safety. Those with ongoing SAEs will be followed until either resolution or stabilization.  
Data from patients who discontinue prematurely will remain part of the study database.  
4.5. Patient Identification and Enrollment  
Patients must be able to provide written informed consent and meet all inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria. No waivers of inclusion or exclusion criteria will be granted by [CONTACT_657689]. Before enrolling a patient, all eligibility criteria must be satisfied. Patients who qualify for Phase [ADDRESS_886699] available cohort. In Phase 2, a cohort of approximately 25-30 patients will be enrolled . At the Sponsor’s discretion, up to 5 patients from the 1  mg/kg or 2 mg/kg 
cohorts may be retreated at the RD in the Retreatment Cohort . A total of approximately 
42-[ADDRESS_886700] s and vitals/ECGs prior to enrollment if a non -
qualifying finding is considered an error or an acute finding is likely to meet eligibility criteria on repeat testing.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886701] in this study is FPA008. The investigational supply of FPA008 
will be provided to the study centers by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee) and will be administered to patients in the clinical study by a trained healthcare professional.  
A brief description of the FPA008 drug product is provided below: 
•  
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
5.2. Administration  
The dose of FPA008 will be administered based on weight to patients in this study. 
 
 
 FPA008 will be administered under medical supervision over approximately 
30-minute (± 5 minutes) IV infusion via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter.  
If a patient experiences an infusion reaction prior to completion of the infusion, the infusion must 
be stopped, and the patient should be promptly managed according to signs and symptoms, and local clinical protocol. The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate if all signs and symptoms have resolved. If the signs and symptoms do not resolve, the infusion should not be restarted. Patient should be kept under close observation for at least 1 hour after the end of study drug infusion. 
All vials are for single use only. Instructions on study drug preparation and administration will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.

 Page 50 of 99 Confidential  5.3. Starting Dose and Dose Modifications  
The starting dose level of FPA008 and subsequent dose escalations between cohorts in Phase 1 
are described in Section  3.1.2. The dose of FPA008 in Phase 2 will be determined by [CONTACT_657690] 1 of the study.  
5.3.1. Dose Escalation of FPA008 between Cohorts  
Dose escalation to the next cohort will only start after the preceding dose cohort has completed 
the DLT period. Twenty- eight days (DLT period) of safety data must be available for at least 
3 safety -evaluable patients prior to a potential dose -escalation decision by [CONTACT_657691]. In t he event that a patient in a cohort is lacking adequate safety data (e.g., due to early 
withdrawal from study or poor compliance with the protocol), an additional patient will be enrolled to the cohort. 
Dose escalation in each successive dose cohort will proceed in a stepwise fashion. All relevant 
safety information for the first cohort or the preceding dose cohort will be reviewed by [CONTACT_10186] (see Section 9.10).  
Dose escalation is planned to continue until dose- limiting toxicities occur in 2 or more patients  in 
a cohort. The decision to discontinue dose escalation will be made jointly by [CONTACT_89951](s) based on reaching the MTD or a dose level that shows an adequate pharmacodynamic effect.  
In Cohort 1, three patients will be enrolled initially at a starting dose of 1  mg/kg FPA008, given 
by [CONTACT_104482]. The occurrence of DLTs ( Section  5.3.3) will determine whether the dose will be 
escalated in subsequent cohorts.  
The dose escalation decision rules are summarized in Table 3. 
Table 3: Decision Criteria for Escalation  
Number of Patients with DLTs  Action  
0/3 Open next cohort  
1/3 Enroll 3 more in same cohort  
≥ 2/3  Stop enrollment. Enter 3 more patients at dose level below, if only 3  were 
previously entered  
1/6 Open next cohort  
≥ 2/6  Stop enrollment. Enter 3 more patients at a dose level below or at an 
intermediate dose level if the current dose level is ≥ 50% higher than the 
previous dose level  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886703]  2016  
 Page 51 of 99 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]. Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The selection of the RD will be based on clinical response data as well as PK and PD profiles. 
The Sponsor and Investigators may decide to discontinue dose escalation before reaching the highest planned dose of 4 mg /kg or, potentially, evaluate a higher (>4 mg/kg) dose if the safety, 
PK, and PD data support evaluation of different dose levels.  
Escalation to an MTD is not intended, however, may occur. If so, the MTD is defined as the 
highest dose associated with DLTs in Cycle 1 in less than 33% of patients receiving FPA008 administered on Day [ADDRESS_886704], the Sponsor and Investigators may decide to evaluate alternative dose 
levels than those defined in the protocol if the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy data support evaluation of additional doses in order to reach an optimal target exposure. The same dose 
escalation rules specified in Section 3.1.2 will apply to the additional cohorts. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicity at Lowest Dose Level 
If the first dose level of 1 mg/kg is, unexpectedly, found to exceed an MTD, then decisions on 
how to proceed will be based on safety, tolerability, and PK data; and will be agreed on between the Investigators and the Sponsor. 
A lower dose level may be chosen as the next cohort.  
5.3.2. Dose Escalation within a Cohort 
Intra -patient dose escalation above the starting dose is not permitted. If a patient’s dose is 
decreased for an AE,  dose escalation to the originally assigned dose may occur after resolution of 
the AE and after discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. Recurrence of the AE to greater 
than Grade 2 will result in permanent dose reduction without re- escalation.  
5.3.3. Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
DLTs are defined as any Grade ≥3 related adverse event  that occur during Cycle 1 of treatment 
and are assessed by [CONTACT_657692]008  with the 
following exceptions: 
• In the absence of clinical symptoms and other accompanying changes in bilirubin, serum elevations of AST and/or ALT ≤ [ADDRESS_886705] will not be considered a DLT and serum elevations of CK and/or LDH ≤ [ADDRESS_886706] will not be considered a DLT.

 Page 52 of 99 Confidential  • In the absence of clinical symptoms and other accompanying changes in bilirubin, serum 
elevations of AST and/or ALT > 12x ULN and ≤ 20x ULN that last for ≤  7 days will not be 
considered a DLT and serum elevations of CK and/or LDH > 15x ULN and ≤ 20x ULN that last for ≤  7 days will not be considered a D LT.  
As applicable, events will be classified according to the NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03). 
Phase 1 patients who experience a DLT during the DLT assessment period (Cycle 1) will be 
removed from study treatment. Patients experiencing toxicity in cycles after C ycle 1 that would 
be considered dose limiting during the DLT assessment period are not required to discontinue study participation in the study.  
5.3.4. Dose Modification Criteria  
Dose reductions may be permitted for patients on prolonged treatment beyond the DLT period in Phase 1 or any patient in Phase 2 per the following guidelines. If dose reductions or interruptions that do not fall within these guidelines are being considered by [CONTACT_737], these will require discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_1034].  
Patients may miss up to 2 consecutive doses (up to 6 weeks between doses) for adverse or other 
events and may resume the study drug if the event returns to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within 6 weeks of treatment interruption. Omission of additional dosing long er than 6 weeks for adverse 
events will necessitate the patient’s discontinuation from the study unless allowed by [CONTACT_1034]. Patients may miss doses in the course of participation in the study, including missed doses for scheduled vacations or other personal reasons as needed, but not more than 2 doses sequentially.  
The Cycle 2, Day 1 infusion of FPA008 can only be administered after completion of the 28- day 
DLT window. All subsequent infusions can be administered with a ±[ADDRESS_886708] , CK and LDH elevations  are

If a patient’s dose is decreased for an adverse event, dose escalation to the originally  assigned dose may occur 
after resolution of the AE and after discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. Recurrence of the AE to greater

bronchospasm or dyspnea occurs in a patient during infusion, the infusion should be stopped.  
In addition, at the Investigator’s discretion, the infusion rate may be reduced or stopped if a less 
severe AE (Grade 1 or 2) occurs during the infusion. If a Grade 3 or less severe AE resolves within 6 hours, the infusion may be restarted at half the previous rate. If the same AE appears again with the same severity at any time during the restarted infusion, the infusion should be discontinued, and no further dosing of study drug will occur without consultation with the Sponsor (or designee).  
If a patient experiences an infusion reaction, the patient’s vital signs (tempe rature, blood 
pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) should be monitored during the infusion, as well as every 
[ADDRESS_886715] at the investigational site. However, in the absence of such a protocol, the standardized treatment protocol provided in Appendix 7 should be used. 
5.4. Blinding and Breaking the Blind  
Blinding and breaking the blind are not applicable as this is an open- label study.  
5.5. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or appropriately qual ified staff is responsible for maintaining accurate study 
drug accountability records throughout the study. 
The Investigator is responsible for returning all unused study drug to the Sponsor (or designee), 
and must verify that no remaining supplies are in the Investigator’s possession. The study site is permitted to destroy used or partially used study drug vials according to the site policy once Sponsor (or designee) approval of its documented destruction procedure has been obtained. Accurate records of al l study drug received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by 
[CONTACT_657696] a drug inventory log during and on completion of the study. 
5.6. Investigational Product Compliance 
Only qualified trained site personnel may administer FPA008. Pharmacy personnel trained in the 
study requirements will monitor compliance with the treatment assignments. FPA008 will be infused over approximately 30 minutes via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter by a trained healthcare professional. Records of study medication administered (date, start and stop 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886716]  2016  
 Page 56 of 99 Confidential  time, and dose administered relative to time of preparation) will be recorded on the patient’s 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  
5.7. Concomitant Medication and Treatment  
All concomitant medications including herbal and other non- traditional remedies are to be 
captured on the eCRF. The following parameters will be collected: generic name, route of administration, start date, stop date, dosage, frequency, and indication. Any changes in the 
dosage or regimen of a concomitant medication also must be recorded on the eCRF. 
At Screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the previous 
28 days. At each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked about any changes in concomitant medications since the previous visit. 
Throughout the study, Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except  for the following: 
• Other experimental drugs or devices 
• Other systemic medication for treatment of PVNS such as imatinib or nilotinib  
• Chronic daily corticosteroids ≥ 10 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent) 
If a patient uses a prohibited medication or undergoes tumor resection, the Sponsor should be consulted for a decision on whether the patient should be withdrawn from the study (see Section  9.12).  
Patients may initiate or continue pain medications as dictated by [CONTACT_28773]. Transfusions are permitted as needed. 
No routine premedication will be administered for the initial FPA008 dose. If a patient develops 
nausea, vomiting, or other infusion- related AEs, the patient may be pre- medicated with 
antiemetics, steroids, or antihistamines prior to subsequent infusions of FPA008 at the discretion of the Investigator. The treat ment will be administered according to the institution’s standard 
practice, and should be captured on the patient’s eCRF. 
  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886717]  2016  
 Page 57 of 99 Confidential  6. Parameters and Methods of Assessment  
Safety of FPA008 will be assessed by [CONTACT_657688] 
(inclu ding weight), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, disease related signs and symptoms, and clinical 
laboratory measurements. Blood samples will be evaluated for immunogenicity.  
6.1. Tumor Response Parameters  
MRI will be performed at Screening (within [ADDRESS_886718] dose), 4, 8, and 16 weeks 
following the start of treatment ( Appendix 1). MRIs should be completed within [ADDRESS_886719] tumor response 
parameters assessed at the 30 days (± 7 days) and 90 days (± 7 days) End of Treatment Follow-up Visits, unless a tumor assessment has been performed within the previous [ADDRESS_886720] not progressed after the End of Treatment Follow-up Period are to be 
followed every 14 weeks (± 2 weeks) (see Section 7.2.10) until progression, the patient undergoes local therapy (e.g., resection, radiation) or a new systemic therapy is initiated, for up to [ADDRESS_886721] 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) and the Total Volume Score 
(Tap 2014) for radiologically measurable disease. MRI will be used for radiologic measurement 
of tumor.  Linear measurements of diffuse PVNS are complicated by a number of factors. Since the tumors 
are characteristically amorphous and can fluctuate in shape, correlation of serial linear measurements with changes in tumor volume depends on where the measurements are made. However, poor contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissue in certain locations limits where these measurements can be made accurately. Additionally, linear measurements are highly vulnerable to variations in the plane of section on serially acquired images. Nevertheless, given the longstanding tradition of RECIST in oncology clinical trials , linear measurements of up to 
two measurable tumor locations per joint or tendon sheath, as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_886722] and local 
structural damage caused by [CONTACT_657697]- articular spaces. 
Tumor growth interferes with joint flexion and can also destroy the structural and functional integrity of joints as tumor invades local bones and soft tissues. The goals of imaging in clinical trials of PVNS are thus to monitor changes in the volume of the tumor and to monitor any associated damage to local tissues.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886723] 
been based on semi -quantitative scoring.  
The TVS scale is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity, which varies from joint to joint, or of the maximally distended tendon sheath (assumed to be three times the diameter of the involved tendon). Thus, a tumor that is equal to the volume of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath would be scored 10, whereas a tumor that was 70% of that volume would be scored 7, and a tumor twice that volume would be scored 20. 
Individual patient outcomes by [CONTACT_657698]:  
• Complete Response (CR): lesion completely gone 
• Partial Response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in volume score relat ive to baseline 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  ≥30% increase in volume relative to lowest score during the 
study whether at baseline or some other visit 
• Stable Disease (SD):  does not meet any of the prior criteria based on score during 
study.  
Note : Tumor assessments performed as part of the patient’s standard of care within 28 days (4 weeks) of the first dose of FPA008 do not need to be repeated during Screening. 
Approximately t en patients in Phase 2 will also undergo a PET scan  at Screening , Cycle 3 Day 1  
(±7 days),   C6D15 ( ±7 days ) Visit, 90 days (±7 days) End of Treatment Follow-up Visit, and at 
the first  Long -Term Follow -up Visit (14 weeks (± 2 weeks)  
post 90 days End of Treatment Visit ). 
PET scans will be locally read and interpreted according to RECIST guidelines, observing change in normalized standardized uptake value ( SUV) for lesions in the affected joints 
(Eisenhauer 2009).

6.2.1. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Collection of Adverse Events  
Any new symptoms, injury or worsening of symptoms that occur following signing of the 
informed consent form (ICF) but prior to first infusion (Cycle 1, Day 1) will be considered pretreatment events and reported on the Medical History page of the eCRF, unless they directly correlate to a study -related procedure. Adverse event reporting will continue through the End of  
Treatment Follow -up Period or until 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug. Serious 
AEs occurring after the end of the study should be reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_657699] a causal relationship with the study drug. 
Serious AEs should always be recorded on the AE eCRF page and the SAE form.  SAEs and new AEs will be collected until 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of FPA008 
(or withdrawal of consent). If an SAE comes to the attention of the Investiga tor after the final 
visit, information regarding the SAE should be collected and reported only if assessed to be related to study drug by [CONTACT_737]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient administered a 
pharmac eutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. 
All AEs including intercurrent illnesses that occur during the study, from the time of study drug 
administration, will be documented on the eCRF. Concomitant illnesses, which existed prior to the day of the first study infusion, will not be considered AEs unless they worsen by [CONTACT_2669] 1 grade during the treatment period. Intensity (severity) grade will be defined according to the NCI-CTCAE, version 4.03. Pre-existing conditions will be recorded on the Medical History 
eCRF.  
A treatment -emergent AE will be defined as an AE that begins or worsens in severity after at 
least 1 dose of study drug has been administered. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, will not be 
reported as an AE, but the procedure and/or therapeutic treatment should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The medical condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported as an AE (or as part of the patient’s medical history, if appropriate). Disease progression is an endpoint and therefore should not be reported as an AE or SAE.

Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_452025]:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Seriousness  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. Death may occur as a result of the underlying disease process. All events 
other than progression of underlying disease that result in death during the reporting period up to 90 days (± 7 days) following the last dose of FPA008 must be treated as an SAE and 
reported as such. 
• Is life -threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred ) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hospit al for medical reasons)  or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such eve nts are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious and 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate.

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412276] a pre -existing condition is not 
considered an SAE unless it results in one of the outcomes listed above. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Intensity  
Investigators need to assess the severity of AEs according to the guidelines provided in 
NCI-CTCAE, version 4.03. 
CTCAE v 4.03 Severity Grades are: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; mild AE  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non- invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living; moderate AE  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886726]  2016  
 Page 61 of 99 Confidential  • Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but non immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living; severe AE  
• Grade 4: Life- threate ning consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Fatal AE  
If the AE is not specified in the CTCAE or the study protocol, the grading of severity will be 
assessed as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or death due to the AE (Grade 5) using the following definitions: 
• Mild: The patient is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily 
tolerated.  
• Moderate: The patient experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce his or her usual level of activity.  
• Severe: Significant impairment of functioning: the patient is unable to carry out usual activities.  
• Very severe (life- threatening): The patient’s life is at risk from the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causali ty/relationship between the study drug and the AE and 
record that assessment on the eCRF.  
The most likely cause of an SAE (e.g., disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant medication, other) will be indicated on the eCRF with details of the  concomitant 
disease or medication or other cause.  
The relatedness for SAEs will also be assessed and documented on the SAE form. Table [ADDRESS_886727].  
Table 6: Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
Yes The temporal relationship of the AE to investigational product administration makes a causal relationship possible, 
and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide sufficient explanation for the 
AE.  
No The temporal relationship of the AE to investigational product administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, 
or other drugs, the rapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the AE.  
Note:   The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study documentation process. 
Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate 
all reported SAEs against cu mulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to Investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886728]  2016  
 Page 62 of 99 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS].4. Outcome and Action Taken 
The Investigator will record the action taken and outcome for each AE according to the 
following criteria:  
• Action Taken  
– None 
– Dose reduced  
– Administration of FPA008 temporarily interrupted 
– Administration of FPA008 permanently discontinued 
– Concomitant medication  
– Other  
• Outcome 
– Recovered without sequelae 
– Recovered with sequelae  
– Ongoing 
– Death  
– Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Adverse Events  
Any new symptoms or injury or worsening of symptoms that occur following signing of the ICF, but prior to the first infusion (Cycle 1, Day 1), will be considered pretreatment events and reported on the Medical History page of the eCRF, unless they directly correlate to a study-related procedure. New or worsening symptoms or injury related to study- related procedures that 
occur before Cycle 1, Day 1 will be reported as adverse events. Otherwise, adverse event reporting will begin on Cycle 1, Day 1 (day of first infusion) and continue through the End of Treatment Follow -up Period or until 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug. Serious 
AEs occurring after the end of the study should be reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_657700] a causal relationship with the study drug.  
All AEs, regardless of the relationship to study drug, will be recorded on the eCRF. This 
includes potential end-organ toxicity, e.g., renal (proteinuria), hepatic, and cardiovascular (increased blood pressure) effects, and effects on wound healing. All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date and time of onset, date and time of resolution, intensity, treatment required, relationship to study drug, action taken with the study drug, outcome, and whether the event is classified as serious.  
Abnormal laboratory findings that are not considered clinically significant will be recorded only on the laboratory eCRF pages and not on the AE pages. Abnormal laboratory results that are

 Page 64 of 99 Confidential  The Sponsor (or designee) is responsible for submitting reports of AEs associated with the use of 
the drug that are both serious and unexpected to FDA, according to 21 Code of Federal Regulatio ns (CFR)  312.32, and to other regulatory authorities, according to national law and/or 
local regulations. All Investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the study medication will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_555240] (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
The Sponsor (or designee) will submit all safety updates and periodic reports to the regulatory 
authorities as required by [CONTACT_25435]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow- up of Adverse  Events  
All AEs experienced by a study patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored 
until the event has resolved or stabilized, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the Inves tigator and Medical Monitor, there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or the patient is lost to follow-up. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy tests should be performed for any patient of childbearing potential, as noted in 
Appendix 1. In the event of suspected pregnancy, the pregnancy test should be repeated. Patients who become pregnant during the study must discontinue study treatment immediately.  
ICON Pharmacovigilance must be notified of any patient that becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Although pregnancy is not an AE, all pregnancies must be followed to conclusion to determine their outcome. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or designee to report any pregnancy in a patient that occurs during the study by [CONTACT_657701]. Please contact [CONTACT_657702] a pregnancy.  
Notification of the pregnancy including the anticipated date of birth should be submitted on a Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of awareness and reported using the same procedure as described for reporting SAEs (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). If the pregnancy is to be terminated, the anticipated date of termination should be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Follow- up in the Event of a Pregnancy  
The patient will be asked to provide information on the outcome of the pregnancy, including 
premature termination should the case arise. Spontaneous miscarriages and congenital abnormalities will be reported as SAEs. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to ICON Pharmacovigilance and the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be in accordance with regulatory guidance and at least 6 to 8 weeks after the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.

functional outcomes: 
• Ogilvie -Harris (OH) Scale ( Appendix 4): This tool was developed specifically for patients 
with PVNS ( Ogilvie -Harris 1992) and has been used in other PVNS publications ( De Ponti 
2003, Rhee 2010) . Characteristics of this tool include the following:  
– It is a clinician reported outcome measure  
– It is based on a 0–3 interval scale for each of the 4  domains:  
 Pain  
 Synovitis/effusion  
 Range of motion 
 Functional capacity  
– It uses lower end of the scale (score min = 0) indicating severe disability, pain and 
functional loss and the higher values (score max = 12) indicating no disability. Scores can be summed and classified as follows: 
 Poor condition (0 – 3 points) 
 Fair condition (4 – 6 points) 
 Good condition (7 – 9 points) 
 Excellent condition (10 – 12 points) 
• Brief Pain Inventory ( Appendix 5 ): The Brief Pain Inventory rapi[INVESTIGATOR_657680], has been translated into dozens of languages, and has been  
widely use d in research and clinical settings  in a variety of cancer and non- cancer studies . 
Characteristics of this tool include the following:  
– Assesses severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functions 
– Has been validated in patients with chronic and acute pain  
– Assesses the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain 
medications and amount of pain relief in the past [ADDRESS_886738] week 
– Assesses responsiveness of behavioral and pharmacological pain intervention 
– Can be completed either by [CONTACT_6270] -report or interview  
– Takes approximately five minutes to complete  
– Questions are scored from 0 (least or does not interfere) to 10 (worst or completely interferes).

 Page 77 of 99 Confidential  8. Statistical Methods  
Before database lock, a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized, providing 
detailed methods for the analyses outlined below.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
study report.  
8.1. Study Patients  
8.1.1. Disposition of Patients  
The number and percentage of patients evaluable for DLT, safety, efficacy, PK and PD will be presented. Reasons for withdrawal will also be summarized. 
8.1.2. Protocol Deviations 
A summary of the number and percentage of patients with protocol deviations by [CONTACT_657704]. Deviations will be defined in the SAP prior to database lock. 
8.1.3. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations are defined for the study: 
• Safety Population—all patients who have r eceived any portion of at least one dose of 
FPA008.  
• DLT -Evaluable Population—all patients enrolled into Phase [ADDRESS_886768] 2 doses of FPA008 and completed Cycle 1 of treatment, or who experienced a DLT in 
Cycle 1.  
• PK-Evaluable Population —all patients who have received at least one dose of FPA008 and 
have had adequate PK assessments drawn for determination of the PK profile.  
• Efficacy -Evaluable Population—all patients who met eligibility criteria, received at least 
[ADDRESS_886769]- baseline disease assessment.  
• Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT)—all enrolled patients. Patient without post- baseline disease 
assessment will be considered as non -responder. 
8.2. General Considerations 
All analyses will be descriptive and will be presented by [CONTACT_16303], dose group, and overall as appropriate. Patients dosed at the RD will be summarized, except the  Retreatment Cohort data 
will be summarized separately  from the naïve patient data from Phase 2. Data collected in this 
study will be presented using summary tables and patient data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the number of valid cases, arithmetic 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886770] deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_22977].  
A change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require a protocol amendment only if it alters a principal feature of the protocol. The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock. Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report.  
8.3. Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant Medications 
Demographic data, medical history, other baseline characteristics, concomitant disease, and concomitant medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_13153]. To determine whether the criteria for study conduct are met, corresponding tables and listings will be provided. These wi ll 
include an assessment of protocol deviations, study drug accountability, and other data that may impact the general conduct of the study. 
8.4. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment administration will be summarized by [CONTACT_657705], dose 
modifications or delays, cumulative dose, average dose, number of infusions, and the duration of therapy.  
8.5. Analyses of Tumor Response 
Patients will be classified according to their best overall tumor response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], or progressive disease [PD]). Frequencies, proportions, and exact 95% CI of patients, when appropriate, stratified by [CONTACT_657706]. Patients with a best overall tumor response of CR or PR with duration of at least 4 weeks (28 days) will be further classified as having an objective tumor response. Listing of patients with an objective tumor response will be presented. 
Patients will be classified for response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and the Total Volume Score. The Tumor 
Volume Score classifies response according to the following definitions: Complete Response [(CR) lesion completely gone by [CONTACT_2054]], Partial Response [(PR) ≥50% decrease in volume score relative to baseline], Progressive Disease [(PD ) ≥30% increase in volume relative 
to lowest score during the study whether at baseline or some other visit] or Stable Disease [(SD) does not meet any of the prior criteria based on score during study]. 
In addition to local review, all MRI scans will be ce ntrally reviewed, and concordance between 
the local and central assessments of tumor response will be determined. Duration of response by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_886771] 
documentation of overall response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of disease progression 
or death, whichever comes first. Patients who are alive and progression- free at the time of data 
analysis will be censored at the time of their last assessment for tumor response.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886772] 1 dose of FPA008 will be included in the safety analyses. AEs, clinical laboratory information, vital signs, ECOG performance status, weight, ECGs, and concomitant medications/procedures will be tabulated and summarized.  
AEs will be summarized overall and with separate summaries for serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs leading to death, and NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher AEs.  
Weight and vital signs will be summarized descriptively (N, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum). ECOG performance status will be summarized categorically and descriptively.  
Shift tables displaying patient counts and percentages classified by [CONTACT_657707]. A marked 
laboratory change is defined as a shift from a baseline Grade 0 to Grade 3 (non-hematologic) or Grade 4 (hematologic) on treatment, or a shift from a baseline Grade [ADDRESS_886773] , including patients from both 
Phase 1 and 2, will also be summarized.  The overall response rate will be summarized with 
frequencies and percentages. The duration of response for CR and PR patients will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) as well as categorically. Response and duration of response will be determined using RECIST 1.1. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to summarize duration of response. 
8.8. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Individual and mean (±SD) serum FPA008 concentration- time data w ill be tabulated and plotted 
by [CONTACT_15994]. FPA008 PK parameters will be calculated from the serum drug concentration- time 
data using a non-compartmental analysis (NCA) method with intravenous infusion input in 
 Alternative methods may be considered. 

FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886774]  2016  
 Page 80 of 99 Confidential  Estimated individual and mean (±SD) PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_5264]. Other descriptive statistics might be reported for serum FPA008 concentration- time data 
and estimated PK parameters. Dose proportionality, drug accumulation, and attainment of steady state will be evaluated whenever it is possible.  
The impact of immunogenicity on FPA008 exposure will be assessed.  
8.9. Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analysis is planned.  
Safety data will be reviewed on a routine basis by [CONTACT_290463]. In Phase 1, the Sponsor 
(and/or designee) and Investigator(s) will review safety data from each dose cohort prior to dose escalation or de- escalation. Adverse event data from the extended treatment per iod will be 
presented to the medical monitors when available. 
8.10. Determination of Sample Size  
Three patients per dose group, with a sample size increase to 6 in the case of DLT, is generally 
accepted as adequate to determine the safety of escalating doses of novel oncologic drugs. If a 
DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that same dose level. Dose escalation will continue until 2 of 3–6 patients treated at a dose level experience a DLT. The MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which < 33% of patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1. After the MTD is determined, additio nal patients  may be recruited at that dose 
level to further characterize the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of FPA008. It is anticipated that 12 -15 patients may be enrolled in Phase 1. 
For the objective of estimating the ORR of FPA008 in patients with PVNS/d t-TGCT, it is 
estimated that approximately 25-[ADDRESS_886775] overall. The following Table 8  
displays the corresponding two -sided 95% CI and the precision for various sample sizes and 
observed response rates ( Agresti 1998) .

 Page 82 of 99 Confidential  9. Ethical, Legal, and Administrative Aspects  
9.1. Data Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor (or designee) may conduct a site visit prior to study initiation at a site to verify the 
qualifications of each Investigator, inspect the site facilities, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and for ensuring study compliance and procedures for adequate and correct documentation. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each study patient. All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the patients’ source documentation (i.e., medical records). 
9.2. Electronic Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered into the eCRFs promptly. All source 
documents from which eCR F entries are derived should be placed in the patient’s medical 
records. eCRF fields for which source documents will typi[INVESTIGATOR_657682], physical exam reports, nursing notes, ECG recordings, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and MRI reports .  
The eCRFs for each patient will be checked against source documents at the study site by [CONTACT_25007].  
Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the Investigator for resolution.  
9.3. Access to Source Data  
During the study, a monitor will perform routine site visits to review protocol compliance, 
compare eCRFs and individual patient’s medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory r equirements. eCRF entries 
will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Investigator must ensure provision of sufficient time, reasonable space, and adequate qualified personnel for the monitoring visits. The visits are for the purpose of verifying adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data entered on the eCRF and other documents. Moreover, regulatory authorities, IRBs, IECs, and/or the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance group may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or on -site audit inspections. Direct access to source data will be 
required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The Investigator assures that the Sponsor (and/or designee) will receive the necessary support to complete these activities.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886778]  2016  
 Page 83 of 99 Confidential  All participating  centers should take particular care in ensuring that original imaging source data 
(MRI images, echo images, etc.) are maintained and accessible for monitoring, and that these 
original source data are then archived on a long -term basis in compliance with I CH GCP 
Section  9.6. These images must be stored in a secure location until the Sponsor (or designee) 
authorizes their destruction, and must be retri evable by [CONTACT_657708].  
9.4. Data Processing 
The Data Management Plan, to be developed during the initiation phase of the study, will include 
specifications for consistency and plausibility checks on data and will also include data-handling rules for obvious data errors. All processes for data processing and query handling will be described in the Data Management Plan.  
9.5. Archiving Study Records  
The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the Investigator’s Brochure, the protocol and any amendments, the protocol for tissue sampling, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IEC/IRB and the Sponsor (or designee), and other study- related documents.  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study -specific source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed and dated ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and FivePrime or its designees.  
The Investigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of [ADDRESS_886779] 5 years after the investigation is discontinued. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed by [CONTACT_1034]. In addition, the Investigator must make provision for the patie nts’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
No data should be destroyed without the agreement of FivePrime. Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, FivePrime must be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be archived in accordance with the 
archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site.  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886780]  2016  
 Page 84 of 99 Confidential  9.6. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
Investigator abide by [CONTACT_412350] (1989). The study also will be carried out in compliance with local legal requirements.  
9.7. Informed Consent Form  
All information about the clinical study, including the patient information and the ICF, is prepared and used for the protection of the human rights of the patient according to ICH GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The ICF,  prepared by [CONTACT_427493], must be approved 
along with the study protocol by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and be acceptable to the Sponsor before each 
patient is enrolled on the study, written informed consent will be obtained according to the regulatory and legal requirements. A copy of the signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_657709]’s site file, unless otherwise agreed.  The Investigator 
will not undertake any investigation specificall y required only for the clinical study until valid 
consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must be documented in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
If a protocol amendment is required, the informed consent form may need to be revised to reflect 
the changes to the protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_19821]/IEC, and signed by [CONTACT_657710].  
All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534].  
9.8. Optional Research Informed Consent Form  
If the collection of archival tissue, synovial biopsy, and/or synovial fluid for optional research described in Section 3.2 is  approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, patients will have the option to authorize the 
collection and use of these sample(s)  and personal health information for additional research 
purposes. Signing of this  consent form is not required for enrollment in the trial but is required 
prior to the optional research sample collection. All procedures outlined above for the review, approval, processing, and use of the Consent Form also apply to this optional research form. 
In the [LOCATION_002], each Informed Consent Form may also include authorization allowing the 
Institution, Investigator, Sub-investigator, and the Sponsor to use and disclose personal health information in compliance with the HIPAA of 1996. 
Signed and dated Informed Consent Form must remain in each patient’s study file and must be 
available for verification by [CONTACT_657711].  
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886781]  2016  
 Page 85 of 99 Confidential  9.9. Protocol  Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved 
by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and Regulatory Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements. The Sponsor, Sponsor’s agents, and Investigat or must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements 
have been met before the first patient is enrolled in the study. 
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC and Regulatory Authorities approval prior to implementation (if appropriate).  
All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with appropriate instructions. 
Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the need for a formal amendment. Administrative changes will be distributed to the Investigator and others as appropriate.  
9.10. Cohort Review Committee  
The CRC will assess safety of the study on a regular basis. The CRC will consist of 
representatives from the Sponsor, CRO, as well as one or more designated Investigators from actively participating sites in which FPA008 is being evaluated.  
9.11. Duration of th e Study  
For any individual patient, the minimum duration of the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_886782] to patients if the study continues, the study may be terminated. The study may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: • Discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in the 
study 
• Failure to enroll patients at an acceptable rate  
• Decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the drug. 
FPA008-002 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment [ADDRESS_886783]  2016  
 Page 86 of 99 Confidential  9.13. Confidentiality  
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor. 
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be identified on eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the Sponsor (or designee) by [CONTACT_95898], birth date, and/or initials. Study patients are not to be identified by [CONTACT_2300], and any information sent to the Sponsor (or designee) should have patient identifiers redacted, and replaced with patient ID. Documents that include the name [CONTACT_73150] (e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator further agrees to take al l 
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_145447]. 
9.14. Other Ethical and Regulatory Issues  
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individu al case report or review of 
aggregate data, then the Sponsor will issue prompt notification to applicable regulatory 
authorities and Investigators. Investigators will then notify local IRB/IECs as deemed appropriate based on individual IRB/IEC policy. 
A significant safety issue is one that has a significant impact on the course of the clinical trial or 
program (including the potential for suspension of the trial program or amendments to protocols) 
or warrants immediate update of the informed consent form.

h. Obtain ECG records at Screening , approximately [ADDRESS_886788]-dose on Day 1 5 for all cycles, and at the 30 day s (± 7 days) End of Treatment Follow -up Visit.  Additional 
ECGs should be obtained at any time,  and/or  if serum CK or cardiac troponin is elevated; if abnormal (excluding sinus tachycardia), ECGs should be obtained (if cl inically 
indicated), until the abnormality is resolved or clinically stable. ECGs for each patient should be obtained from the same machine whenever possible. To minimize variability, 
it is important that patients be in a resting position for approximately  ≥ 5 minutes prior to each ECG evaluation. Body position should be consistently maintained for each ECG 
evaluation to prevent changes in heart rate. Environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avo ided during the pre -ECG resting period and during 
ECG recording.

 Page 99 of 99 Confidential  Appendix 7: Management of Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Staff administering study drug are required to closely monitor all patients for possibl e systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., generalized exanthema, urticaria, paraesthesia, 
bronchoconstriction, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]) over the first 180 minutes after infusion, paying particular attention to those patients with a history of asthma or systemic reactions to allergenic injections.  
All systemic hypersensitivity manifestations will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page(s) and identified as being due to a hypersensitivity reaction. 
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions will be managed according to treatment protocols in effect at 
the investigational site. In the absence of such a protocol, the following standardized treatment protocol will be used: 
• Clinically mild reactions (e.g., generalized rash or itching, hives) are treated as soon as 
possible with Benadryl® (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) 25 to 50 mg, orally or IV at the Investigator’s discretion. The period of observation is extended beyond [ADDRESS_886802] study drug administered.  
• Clinically moderate reactions (e.g., hypotension, shortness of breath, facial edema) are treated immediately and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated (e.g., IV  
fluids, corticosteroids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). Vital signs are monitored at 10- minute intervals until they have normalized. 
The period of observation is extended beyond [ADDRESS_886803] resolved. In the event of a clinically moderate reaction, the patient should receive no further treatment with study drug.  
• Clinically severe reactions (e.g., marked hypotension, syncope, severe bronchoconstriction, tongue or throat swe lling, significant angioedema) are treated immediately, under the direct 
supervision of the investigator, and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated (e.g., IV fluids, corticosteroids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). Vital signs and systems are monitored at a minimum of 10-minute intervals for as long as the investigator considers it necessary to ensure patient safety. In the event of a clinically severe reaction, the patient should receive no f urther 
treatment with study drug.  
These clinical classifications are for the purpose of recommending treatment for patients who experience systemic hypersensitivity reactions. These classifications will not be used to grade the severity of the systemic hyp ersensitivity event within the eCRF. The severity of these events will 
be documented per the grading system presented in NCI CTCAE v4.03.

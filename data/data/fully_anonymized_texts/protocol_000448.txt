CONFIDENTIAL  5. INTRODUCTION 
Clearside Biomedical is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS 
TA) to treat non- infectious uveitis . This multicenter, open- label  study is designed to evaluate th e 
safety of  suprachoroidal ly injected  CLS -TA in subjects with non- infectious uveitis . 
Suprachoroidal (SC) injection is a novel drug delivery approach that employs Clearside’s proprietary suprachoroidal space (SCS™) microinjector and allows drugs to be precisely administered to the SCS via a minimally invasive injection procedure. This injection has been 
shown in animal models to allow distribution of drug candidates dominantly to the posterior 
segment ocular tissues while limiting exposure to anterior structures in the eye, thereby [CONTACT_869214]. The purpose of this study is to expand the safety database of suprachoroidally injected CLS -TA in patients with non -infectious uveitis . 
5.1. Disease Background  
Uveitis is the fifth most common cause of visual loss in the developed world (Gol dstein , 2009; 
Wood, 2011; Miserocchi, 2013). Significant vision loss can occur in up to 35% of children and adults, and uveitis accounts for 5% - 20% of legal blindness in both the [LOCATION_002] (US) and 
Europe, and perhaps as much as 25% of blindness in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19744] (Rothova, 1996; 
Bodaghi, 2001). 
There are a number of causes associated with this vision loss including cataract formation or 
progression, chor
ioretinal scarring, retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma, but the 
dominant cause of vis ion loss within uveitis comes from chronic macular edema ( ME), 
accounting for about one-third of visual impairment or blindness (Wood, 2011; Dick, 1994; Karim, 2013). Approximately 30% of all uveitis patients and up to 60% of intermediate- and 
pan-uveitis patients experience ME  (Lardenoye, 2006). 
5.2. Scientific Rationale  
Clearside is developi[INVESTIGATOR_363347] -TA, a proprietary TA formulation, for the treatment of non-
infectious uveit is administered by [CONTACT_10530]. This therapy for uveitis is part of Clearside’s 
paradigm of developi[INVESTIGATOR_869212].  
Uveitis is commonly treated with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents; such 
treatments
 are either systemic or local. The challenge with systemic, frequently  oral, 
cortico steroid treatments for ophthalmic inflammatory conditions is that these tre atments are 
often associated with adverse events (AEs) such as peptic ulcerations, osteoporosis, necrosis of 
the hip, weight gain, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, and systemic hypertension. All currently used modes of steroid administration for ophthalmic conditions, including local administrations , 
are associated with increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) that could result in glaucoma, progression of glaucoma, and to both the formation and the progression of cataracts (Karim, 2013).  
The potential advantages of using suprachoroidal administration  to precisely  
 provide local 
corticosteroid therapy to the affected tissues of the eye are that it can result in robust efficacy 
based upon data from animal models and from Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1212988]  
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, is a preservative- free, terminally 
sterilized, aqueous suspension, formulated for administration into the eye. It will be administered as a single SC injection of 4 mg in 100 µL. The suprachoroidal spa ce (SCS) is the region of the 
eye between the sclera and the choroid (Figure 1).  
Figure  1: Anatomy of the Eye 
  
 
Additional  i
nformation regarding CLS -TA, tria m cinolone acetonide injectable suspension, is 
available in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.4. Summary of Clinical Experience and Justification of Dose Selection  
Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) has been used safely and effectively in human ocular therapeutics 
to treat conditions involving inflammation for over 50 years. The initial recommended dose of 
the TA formulation approved by [CONTACT_869215] 
4 mg in 100 μL (TRIESENCE Prescribing Information, 2007). The dose of CLS- TA 
administered as a single suprachoroidal injection will be similar (4 mg in 100 μL). TRIESENCE 
and CLS- TA contain the same active and inactive ingredients at approximately the same 
concentrations. Both formulations are aqueous suspensions that have been terminally sterilized 
and designed for opht halmic use.  
Clearside has completed 2 clinical trials in patients with non -infecti ous  uveitis and one clinical 
trial in patients with retinal vein occlusion ( RVO). 
The completed clinical study, CLS1001-101 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), was a Phase 1/2, open- label, 
safet y a
nd tolerability study in subjects with intermediate, posterior, or pan non- infectious uveitis  
(Goldstein 2016). Each subject received a single SC injection of 4 mg in 100 µL TA (TRIESENCE®). Nine of the 11 subjects in the safety analysis set (82%) compl eted the [ADDRESS_1212989] one AE, with a total of 37 AEs reported. One serious adverse

CONFIDENTIAL  event (unrelated pulmonary emboli; SAE) occurred. No deaths were reported. No significant 
increases in IOP were reported. The most commonly reported AE, eye pain, was reported in 5 subjects.  All subjects in the per -protocol (n=8) analysis set showed improvements in BCVA in 
this study.  
The completed clinical study, CLS1001-201 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), was a Phase 2, randomized, masked safety
 and efficacy stud y in subjects with ME associated with non-infectious uveitis. 
Twenty -two subjects were assigned to receive a single SC injection of CLS -TA, either 4 mg in 
100 µL or 0.8 mg in 100 µL in a 4:[ADDRESS_1212990] a mean reduction in central subfield thickness (CST) of 164 microns (p=0.002) 
when measured from Baseline at 2 months. One SAE (unrelated atrial fibrillation) occurred. No 
subjects discontinued due to an AE, and there were no Investigator- report ed increases in IOP at 
follow-up visits. 
The completed clinical study, CLS1003-201 (CT02303184), was a Phase 2, randomized, masked 
safety a nd 
efficacy study in subjects with ME following RVO. Forty- six subjects were randomly 
assigned 1:1 to either SC injection of CLS-TA administered in conjunction with an intravitreal 
(IVT) injection of aflibercept (ACTIVE), or an IVT injection of aflibercept alone (CONTROL). 
Subjects were observed to have a mean reduction in CST of [ADDRESS_1212991] corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) were 16, 20 and 19 letters in the ACTIVE 
group and 11, 12 and 11 letters in the CONTROL group at Months 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Sixty 
percent fewer additional intravitreal aflibercept injections (p=0.013) were required in the 
ACTIVE group receiving the combination of suprachoroidal CLS- TA and intravitreal aflibercept 
compared to subjects in the CONTROL arm. No subjects discontinued due to an AE and no 
SAEs were reported. Two subjects in the active group reported [ADDRESS_1212992] commonly 
reported AE . 
Additional information regarding clinical experience with TA administered to the 
SCS is available in the Investigator’s Brochure.

 any reason at any time during the study that does not fall on a scheduled study visit 
should have that visit recorded as an Unscheduled Visit.  
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clearside Biomedical, Inc   
CLS1001-[ADDRESS_1213003] of two  unilateral suprachoroidal injections of 4 mg of CLS -TA in 100 µL, 
administered 12 weeks apart .  
Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled.  The CLS -TA injection s w ill occur at Visit 2 
(Day  0) and at Visit 5 (Day 84 ± 5).   
All SC  injections may only be performed by [CONTACT_869217]. Training will be documented 
by [CONTACT_869218]. Training documentation will be maintained at the site as well as with 
the Sponsor.  
 Detailed instructions on the SC injection procedure can be found in the Investigativ
 e Site File . 
 
9.2. Study Eye Determination  
The study eye will be the eye receiving the SC CLS -TA injection .  The determination of the 
study eye will be based on S creening /Baseline  information and will be determined prior to 
injection . 
If both eyes meet study criteria, then the right eye should be designated as the study eye.  The 
eye that is no
t designated as the study eye will be denoted as the fellow eye.  
9.3. Treatment  of the Fellow Eye  
Subjects may have bilateral disease, but only one eye will be designated the study eye and 
treated .  
Local medications are permitted for the fellow eye during the course of this trial. The choice of local o cular t 
herapy for the fellow eye is not subject to the requirements of this protocol. 
Systemic therapy for diseases of the fellow eye is subject to the list of prohibited medications below.  Medications used for therapy of the fellow eye will be recorded in the subject’s medical chart and the case report form (CRF).   
9.4. Additional Treatment  
If at any time  during the study a subject is considered at immediate risk for a vision -threatening 
event, the Investigator should immediately follow best medical practice in the Investigator’s judgment for treating the subject.  All additional therapy will be recorded in the subject’s medical chart and the CRF.  
9.4.1. Rescue Criteria  
B
eginning at Week 4 (Visit 3), if any of the following criteria are met in the study eye, the use of 
a treatment ma
y be introduced.  The therapy implemented is left to the discretion of the

• A ≥ 1.5- step incre ase from baseline (Day 0) i n the level of inflammation (eg, anterior 
chamber cells  or flare,  or vitreous haze) or an increase from 3+ to 4+  
• A decrease of [ADDRESS_1213004] ETDRS BCVA data observed durin
g the study, along with an increase in other signs or complications 
associated with the patient’ s uveitis  
• In the investigator’s medical judgement, the uveitic complications in the study eye have not improved and t
he condition needs to be addressed 
9.5. Concomitant Medications  
The list of prohibited medications provided below is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to help guide the Investigator’s medical ju dgment.  In cases where a subject  presents with 
a medication not included on the following list, or should there be any question on the part of the 
Investigator, Investigators are encouraged to confer with the Medical Monitor for any 
clarification.  
Use of the following medications are prohibited at any time during the study: 
• Any corticosteroid implant (ie , Ozurdex
®, Iluvien® or Retisert™) in the s tudy eye

• Anti-angiogenic drugs (anti- VEGF) in t h e study eye or systemically ( including 
pegaptanib sodium, bevacizumab, ranibizumab) 
• Any i nvestigat ional drug or device 
In cases where there is anticipated need for the above listed medications during the study or if a 
subject  pre
sents to the Investigator having initiated treatment during the study with one of these 
medications or classes of medications, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to notify the 
Sponsor immediately.  If additional therapy is necessary  to treat uveitis in the study eye  and 
normal standard of care requires these medications, they will be recorded in the subject’s case report form  and should follow the guidelines presented for R escue C riteria .  Subjects will not be 
discontinued from the study due to initiation/change in a prohibited medication. 
9.6. Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will only be administered by [CONTACT_359215] (P rincipal Investigator or

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event   
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medic
al condition  after or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not 
considered causally related to the product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed consent, before treatment, during treatment, or during the stud
y participation, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on 
the forms provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adv erse Event  
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-
up), and at any dos
e of the investigational product, comparator, or placebo, that fulfils one or 
more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threate ning 
• Requires in -patient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results
 in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medic al event th at may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
during study pa
rticipation, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded. 
12.2.2. Relations hip to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the investigat
ional product for each AE (Unrelated or Related). The Investigator should decide 
whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, 
then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clearside Biomedical, Inc   
CLS1001-[ADDRESS_1213013] and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” 
12.2.3. Recording Adv erse Event  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study
 personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood  pressure, and pulse 
need not be reported as AEs. However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs will be collected from the signing o f the consent form until the end of the 
study. Serious adverse event information will be collected from signing of the consent form until 
the end of study participation. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology 
when possible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, seriousness outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study. 
12.2.4. Intensity  
The intens i
ty of each AE will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology C r
iteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE)  v 4.03. The  criteria  can be accessed at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf . 
The term “severe” i s a meas ure of intensity. A sever e AE is not ne cessarily an SAE.  
Grade refers to the intensity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical des
criptions of intensity for each AE based on this general guideline: 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only
; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of 
daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening
; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769020]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas ser
iousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS]. An AE of severe intensity 
may or may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the provided pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy i
n itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_174509] a contraceptive medication.

CONFIDENTIAL  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects ar e SAEs. Sponta
 neous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs. 
12.2.5. Reporting A dverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of the consent form until the end of study pa
rticipation. Any SAEs considered related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201]. All SAEs must be 
reported to Clearside Biomedical, or its designee, within one business day of the first awareness 
of the event. The Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy by [CONTACT_363365], or its designee.   
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be faxed to Clearside 
Biomedical
, or its designee, within one business day of receipt. The information should be 
recorded on a follow-up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study file. 
Clearside Biomedical is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It i
s the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug- related events (7/15 -Day Safety Reports) 
that occur duri ng the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these 
additional SAEs. 
12.2.6. Follow- up of AE s and SAEs  
All AEs and SAEs reported during study conduct must be followed until resolution, until the condition stabi
lizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.  
Subjects will be followed for any treatment- related SAEs reported at the end of participation 
until the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, the subject is lost to follow-up, or 
the subject withdraws consent.   
NOTE:  “Resolution” means the subject has returned to baseline state of health, or the 
Investiga
tor does not expect any further improvement in the subject’s condition or does not 
expect worsening of the AE.  
For a non-serious AE that is first identified on the last scheduled contact, the event must be recorded on the
 AE CRF with the current status noted, but no further follow-up needs to be 
performed.  
Post-Study SAEs:   Investig ators are not obligated to actively seek SAE information in former 
study participants; however, any new SAE reported by [CONTACT_869226], should be reported to the Sponsor. The Investigator should follow related

CONFIDENTIAL  13. STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared for this study.  Even though the endpoints in 
this study will only be based on descriptive statistics, the plan will contain a discussion of the statistical methods, a description of any computational algorithms and data handling 
conventions, and specifications for the data summaries and listings.  It will be finalized before 
database lock. No inferential statistical analyses will be performed. All safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Pharmacokinetic analyses to determine systemic levels of triamcinolone acetonide following suprachoroidal
 injection will be described in a separate detailed plan.  
13.1. Determination of Sample Size  and Level of Significance  
Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled in this open- label safety study.  Because this is a 
safety study, it was not powered for hypothesis testing; statistical analyses were descriptive in nature. The study sample size was not based on statistical calculations or statistical assumptions.  
13.2. Subject Disposi tion, Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject disposition, demographic, and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively . 
13.3. Analysis  Populations  
13.3.1. Safety  Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who are administered at least one dose of CLS- TA.  All analyse
s will be based on the Safety Population. 
13.3.2. Pharmacokinet ic Population  
The p harmacokinetic population will include all subjects who are administered at least one dose 
of CLS -TA. Analys es w
ill be conducted on all samples collected during the study.  
13.4. Analysis Methods 
Safety and efficacy endpoints are provided in S ection 7.12.  
13.4.1. Primary Safety  An alysis 
The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse even ts (TEAEs) and SAEs, 
grouped by [CONTACT_34565], relatedness to study medication, and severity. 
The TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
by [CONTACT_1601] t
he number and percentage of subjects with each TEAE and S AE. The  following 
AE summaries  will be produced:

In the summary, subjects may be counted under multiple SOCs and PTs, but for each SOC and 
PT, subjects
 are only counted once. If a subject has the same AE on multiple occasions, the 
highest severity (severe, moderate, mild) recorded for the event will be presented and the highest 
drug relationship will be presented on the respective tables. Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the Safety population. 
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

Biomedical, Inc will visit the study site  (unless waiver criteria are met)  to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss
 with the Investiga tor(s) and other personnel thei r responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence and the responsibilities of Clearside Biomedical, Inc or its 
representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Clearside Biomedical , Inc and the Investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from Clearside Biomedical, Inc or its representative will have regular c
ontacts with the study site to : 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator (s) 
• Confir
m that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm th
at the investigational team is a dhering to t he protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF s, and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s with 
the s
ubject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to the 
study. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (eg , clinic 
charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Clearside Biomedical,  
Inc or designee.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forw
arded to Clearside Biomedical, Inc or designee and those SAEs that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator (s) or other st aff needs 
information or advice. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Clearside Biomedical, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the study site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a Clearside Biomedical audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_869228] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

The progress of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_245526], written, e-mail, and telephone 
communications between personnel at the study site and the Sponsor. The Investigator will allow Sponsor monitors, or designee(s), to inspect all CR Fs; subject records (source documents); 
signed Informed Consent Forms; records of study drug receipt, storage, and disposition; and regulatory files related to the study.  
At the time of database lock, the clinical database will be audited to ensure accuracy of the data, 
as well as
 to provide an estimated error rate for the final, locked database. The audit will involve 
a comparison of CRF values with values from data listings generated from the clinical database. 
Values identified as critical safety and eff icacy variables will be confirmed for 100% of the 
subjects. In addition, a random sample of subjects will be selected for which all data values, excluding comment fields, will be checked. The number of subjects whose data will be randomly reviewed will be determined to provide sufficient accuracy for the estimated error rate of the clinical database.

What will I be asked to do? 
We will ask you to complete an online survey about your type of practice and the 
disabilities and health conditions that you see in your patients. You may also be asked to

In the focus groups, you will be asked about access to and quality of healthcare based 
on your clinical observations. We also may show you research findings about healthcare and ask you what you think those findings. You may be approached for follow-up conversations after the focus groups, and your conversations and behaviors may be observed.

includes the time and effort involved in answering questions about your own experiences in caring for a variety of patients. If you get tired, you can take a break and come back later.  You can decide to stop participating at any time. You should not answer any 
questions that make you uncomfortable. 
 
How will I benefit from the study?

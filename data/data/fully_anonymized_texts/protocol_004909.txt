Preventing Depressive Relapse in Pregnant Women With Recurrent Depression  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
5/17/[ADDRESS_844206] evidence indicates that depression is 
prevalent during pregnancy an d is associated with increased risk of adverse correlates and 
consequences for offspring, including obstetrical and neonatal outcomes such as shorter 
gestational age, increased rates of preterm delivery and lower birthweight; affective and 
behavioral dysre gulation during childhood; and increased risk for later psychopathology1-3. The 
most robust predictor of depression during pregnancy is history of depression, and women with 
recurrent depression experience high rates of relapse depression during pregnancy4,5, 
underscoring the pragmatic and ethical need for definitive evidence regarding how to mitigate 
risk of depressive rela pse during this important developmental transition.  
 The current treatment guideline and standard of care for preventing depressive relapse 
among adults with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) is maintenance 
antidepressants (AD), which poses unique challenges for the management of depression for 
pregnant women with recurrent depression6-9. Decisions regarding maintenance relative to 
discontinuation of AD during pregnancy require a weighing of increased risk of relapse 
associated with AD discontinuation, on one hand, versus the known and unknown risks of fetal 
exposure to AD on the other. Rates of subsequent relapse are significantly high er among 
women with recurrent depression who discontinue AD than among those who maintain, and 
depression during pregnancy is one of the greatest risk factors for postpartum depression10,11. 
Postpartum depression not only places the mother at risk for refractory illness, but also can 
have long -term negative consequences on child development and behavior12,13. 
 
 Prior work has demonstrated that a non -pharmacologic intervention, Mindfulness -Based 
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), modified for pregnant women, yields significant reduction o f 
depressive relapse risk and symptom burden versus usual care through six months 
postpartum14 and is feasible to deliver digitally15,16. However, the precise role of non -
pharmacologic interventions like MBCT as an alternative to AD is unclear, leaving pregnant 
women with recurrent depression and their providers in the position of making  critical clinical 
decisions with incomplete evidence to guide them. There is an urgent need for systematic, 
practical, and personalized guidance to support decision -making among women and their 
healthcare providers, to determine if MBCT offers benefit wit h respect to usual care (UC) in 
community practice settings, and to determine what approach is most likely to confer the 
greatest benefit and least risk for a given woman and her child.  
 Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated comparable re lapse protection 
among patients randomized to MBCT vs. maintenance AD, a finding of central interest to 
reproductive aged women and their healthcare providers. However, there are indications that 
outcomes are moderated by [CONTACT_632309]. For example, Segal et al. reported 
that MBCT and maintenance AD performed comparably and significantly better than placebo 
specifically among patients with residual depressive symptoms17. Williams and colleagues 
reported that MBCT, compared to an active psychoeducational control, was efficacious in 
preventing relapse specifically among a subsample of participants who reported early abuse18, a 
pattern that was also observed in a comparison of MBCT and maintenance AD in which MBCT 
was superior to AD spe cifically among this subgroup19. Preliminary analy ses from DeRubeis et 
al. applied the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI)[ADDRESS_844207] has not been tested in a definitive trial; the 
question of whether MBCT can mitigate risk for depressive relapse among pregnant women on 
AD, including among those who discontinue AD proximate to  or during pregnancy, also has not 
been addressed. Reproductive age women with recurrent depression and their healthcare 
providers need to know, first, if a scalable digital non -pharmacologic prevention approach is 
superior to UC in community settings, and  second, whether MBCT can attenuate risk for 
depressive relapse among those who elect to discontinue maintenance AD treatment proximate 
to or during pregnancy. Lastly, the capacity to identify which women are most likely to benefit 
from a non -pharmacologic  or pharmacologic approach personalizes the risk benefit decision 
making process for reproductive age women on AD planning to conceive or who are pregnant.  
UPWARD Supplemental Arm s (UPWARD -S) 
The prevalence of suicidal ideation and behavior among perinatal women has been 
reported to be 5 -14%.[ADDRESS_844208] called for additional research examining mindfulness -based 
interventions among adults with suicidal ideation and behavior.26 These recommendations are 
based, in part, on studies of mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) among adults with 
histories of suicidal ideation and behavior.16,[ADDRESS_844209]  Study  
 
Objective: The overarching objective of this investigation is to conduct a pragmatic effectiveness 
trial comparing Mindful Mood Balance for Moms (MMB), a digital MBCT  program,  plus UC to UC 
only among euthymic pregnant women with recurrent depression treat ed with AD.  
 
Aim 1: To test the relative risk for depressive relapse and reduction of symptom burden 
between women randomized to digital MMB  or UC.  
Hypothesis 1:  We predict that relative risk for depressive relapse and reduction of 
symptom burden will be significantly lower among women randomized to digital MMB  
relative to women randomized to UC.  
 
Aim 2: To explore the specific benefit of MMB  relative to AD discontinuation and 
questions regarding personalization that are of strong interest to pregnant wome n and 
their healthcare providers.  
Hypothesis 2a.  We predict that relapse risk and symptom burden among women who 
discontinue AD will be significantly lower among those randomized to MMB  than UC.  
Hypothesis 2b . Considering women randomized to MMB  who disc ontinue AD and 
women randomized to UC who maintain AD, we predict that a treatment selection 
algorithm will identify which approach works best for whom (baseline characteristic 
profiles) and that women who receive the algorithm indicated approach will have  
superior outcomes to those who receive the algorithm contraindicated approach.  
 
Aim 3: To test the extent to which digital MMB engages putative targets.  
Hypothesis 3:  We predict that women randomized to  MMB  will show significantly greater 
improvement in maladaptive cognitive processing (i.e., reduced rumination, increased 
mindfulness and self -compassion) than women randomized to UC and that these 
changes will mediate relapse prevention.  
 
UPWARD Supplemental Arm s 
Objective: In the supplemental arm s we will investigate the prevalence, severity, longitudinal 
course, correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior among women during 
pregnancy and the postpartum period  (Arm 1a) . We will al so examine the safety, feasibility, and 
acceptability of enrolling pregnant women with suicidal ideation in our parent trial of MMB 
compared to usual care  (Arm 2) . Additionally,  we will describe the resources for responding to 
suicidal risk that are available for pregnant and postpartum women in community settings and 
the experiences of healthcare providers who provide care to these women during such a critical 
time in their lives  (Arm 1b) . We will lastly use a cross -sectional design to describe the 
characteristics and correlates of suicidal ideation and behavior among pregnant women (Arm 
1c). 
 
 
Arm 1 : We will characterize a real -world population of pregnant and postpartum women by 
[CONTACT_632310], correlates, course, and predictors of s uicidal ideation and 
behavior using mixed -methods in the context of cross -sectional and longitudinal designs.  
Aim 1a. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we will describe the 
characteristics, correlates, course, and predictors of suicidal ideation an d behavior 
among pregnant and postpartum women using clinical and qualitative interviews, 
self-report instruments, behavioral task, and medical records from community 
providers (n = 125).  
Aim 1b. Using qualitative interviews, self -report instruments, and medical records, 
we will describe the extent to which community healthcare professionals providing 
care to pregnant and postpartum women with suicidal ideation report the knowledge 
base and requisi te skills to address suicidal ideation and behavior in the real -world 
population of healthcare providers serving the sample of women enrolled in Aim 1 a 
(n = 125). 
Aim 1c . Using a cross -sectional design, we will describe the characteristics and 
correlates o f suicidal ideation and behavior among pregnant women (n = 550). 
Arm 2 ( Aim 2): Using expanded entry criteria in our parent grant pragmatic trial design, we 
will explore the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of expanding study entry criteria 
specifica lly to enroll pregnant women with any reports of suicidal ideation or behavior (n = 
40) in a proof of concept randomized controlled trial of MMB for Moms to enhanced usual 
care.

All recruitment will be conducted digitally in collaboration with Baby[CONTACT_26818]. Baby[CONTACT_632311]. Baby[CONTACT_632312] 18 million unique users each 
month across the [LOCATION_002], ensuring more than adequate access to our proposed sample 
(N=[ADDRESS_844217] and N= [ADDRESS_844218] Supplemental Arms ). Their previous longitudinal 
studies focused on depression during pregnancy demonstrate a proven track record in recruiting 
the patient population we hope to engage. Baby[CONTACT_632313]. A random intercept may be served to users viewing content on the Baby[CONTACT_632314], with invitations targeted to specific content area, like depression or pregnancy stage. 
Baby[CONTACT_632315], where parents can connect with each other via chat groups organized 
around pregnancy  stage or topic, will also be used to recruit women meeting the inclusion 
criteria. Baby[CONTACT_26818]’s Community managers can post invitations to participate in a research 
study as a message in the relevant community boards, and women who are interested can clic k 
through to a short eligibility survey. As the majority of Baby[CONTACT_632316], 
these recruitment sources can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices.  Ineligible 
participants who fill out the online eligibility survey via Bab yCenter will also have the option of 
providing their contact [CONTACT_632317]’s Mental Health or the University of Colorado Boulder.   
IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
UPWARD Study    
Partic ipants will be linked to a recruiting survey on University of Colorado Boulder’s REDCap 
site describing the study including length, the number of assessments, and incentives, and will 
proceed to answer screening questions aimed at determining initial eligi bility. At this point, 
individuals can continue with the online screening or opt out. Following identification of potential 
study participants , women will be given the option to either provide contact [CONTACT_632318] . Potential study participants will also be given 
the option of signing up for a screening call using Calendly , a secure online scheduling tool. 
MGH study staff trained to assess perinatal women will confirm, by [CONTACT_252580], inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, address any questions, and review the online study fact sheet . 
  UPWARD and each UPWARD Supplemental Arm will have a unique study fact sheet. 
The online study fact sheet  will accurately describe the general goals of the study and the 
nature of the participant’s role in the study. Participants will be given the ongoing opportunity to 
ask any questions regarding confidentiality, participation schedule , or any other aspect of the 
study in the first call with the MGH team and in all subsequ ent contacts with study team 
members. After reading the study fact sheet , study staff will obtain verbal consent for 
participation. In addition , participants will review key points of the study with study staff , will be 
provided with contact [CONTACT_632319] d encouragement to contact [CONTACT_632320], and will be encouraged to print and retain personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_632291] . Consented subjects will be sent a copy of the phone consent document. This 
consent form wi ll include a summary of privacy policies and date of consent. Individuals who do 
not provide verbal consent  will be informed that it is not possible for them to participate in the 
study and we will provide them with a list of links to depression information websites.  
To maintain concealment, assignment will occur following the baseline assessment by 
[CONTACT_632321]. Assignments will be generated using a random number 
table with equal probability of assignment to each group in blocks of four, which will guarantee 
balance for every four subjects. Randomization to study arm will be stratified  based on number 
of prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , antidepressant medication status (on med ication  or having discontinu ed at 
time of randomization), and baseline depressive severity based on PHQ -9 score . Women will be 
randomly assigned to receive M MB (n = 300) or UC ( n = 300). 
Study staff will also obtain contact [CONTACT_632322]. This contact [CONTACT_632323] a letter describing the study and providing the consult line and  availability of study doctors 
for questions. Additionally, we will reference the MGH Center for Women’s Mental Health’s 
website, www.womensmentalhealth.org , as a perinatal resource center that provides evidence -
based safe practices for both the study participant and their clinician during pregnancy.  
 
UPWARD Supplemental Arms  
 
If women do not meet criteria for the UPWARD study due to suicidal ideation (PHQ -9 #9 > 1), 
they will be recruited for prospective monitoring across the course of pregnancy and the 
postpartum period (n = 125) and for the proof of concept RCT (n = 40).

For recruitment of the healthcare providers (n = 125) in UPWARD -S, we will use the 
same procedures implemented in the parent UPWARD study, where participation of women is 
contingent on providing contact [CONTACT_632324]. If the  participant is currently seeing a 
mental health specialist, we will also ask for this provider information. If the participant  does n ot 
have any additional provider, this will not constitute exclusionary criteria. Using this information, 
we will recruit h ealthcare providers and provide an online consenting process to participate in 
the research activities described for Supplemental Aim 1b.  To recruit these providers, we will 
include an interest card and a business reply envelope in the mailing that is sent to providers at 
the time of enrollment. This interest card will prompt providers to check boxes indicating their Eligible  for UPWARD

between the study teams and community providers.  
 
Study staff will also obtain contact [CONTACT_632326] a qualitativ e interview discussing their provider’s experience and knowledge or caring for 
patients expressing suicidality . Consent to contact [CONTACT_632327] -S after the screening questions have been asked to determine e ligibility  and 
before questionnaires are administered to assess suicidal ideation.  This contact [CONTACT_632328] a letter describing the study , the qualitative provider interview,  and provide the 
consult line and availability of study doct ors for questions. This letter will be sent to providers 
after the baseline interview with their patient. A copy of the same letter will also be sent to the 
participants themselves.  We will reach out to providers again when participants are in their third 
trimester, to remind them of their patient’s participation in the study, endorsement of suicidality, 
and availability of study doctors for questions and consults.  Additionally, we will reference the 
MGH Center for Women’s Mental Health’s website, www.womensmentalhealth.org , as a 
perinatal resource center that provides evidence -based safe practices for both the study 
participant and their clinician during pregnancy.  
 
UPWARD -Baby  
 
[CONTACT_632329] -Baby [CONTACT_11191]. All participants who completed the 
UPWARD study will be sent a recruitment email between [ADDRESS_844220] -Baby [CONTACT_632330] 12 -months 
postpartum timepoint  (participants will have until 15 months postpartum to complete this 
timepoint) . If participants do not comp lete the UPWARD -Baby [CONTACT_150499], study staff will reach out 
via text message , email, or telephone  to determine if participants would like to participate in this 
timepoint. If participants are not interested in completing any more surveys and would not like to  
participate, they can choose to ignore the recruitment email and text message and not provide 
consent.   
 
V. STUDY PROCEDURES  
UPWARD  
All procedures will be administered by [CONTACT_632331]. 
The self -report measures and behavioral tasks will be programmed and hosted by [CONTACT_632332], baseline assessment and follow -up data collection us ing REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture21). Participants will be emailed secured links by [CONTACT_632333] -limited 
access. All participants enter their responses usin g a study assigned ID, and data stored in 
REDCap is accessed only by [CONTACT_632334] a user ID and password.  
 
This study involves prospective monitoring of the study sample across their pregnancy, with 
self-report questionnaires completed each month and five telephone contacts with study staff for 
all participants (at baseline, post-intervention , third trimester, 3 months postpartum, and 6 
months postpartum). Participants will be offered the option to schedule phone interviews online 
via Ca lendly. Those who do not wish to use the online scheduling platform can choose to 
schedule directly with the study team via email, phone call, or text message on an encrypted 
study cell phone . Changes in medication and  usage and dosage, as well as any relapse in 
depressive symptoms since the last phone contact, will be gauged during each phone call by 
[CONTACT_464]. Please see Table [ADDRESS_844221]-

support data harmonization for domains relevant to suicidal ideation and behavior by [CONTACT_632335]. Participants in 
the supplemental arms will also answer self -report instruments and behavioral tasks that index 
key social processes (e.g., belonging). For example, t o measure implicit associations pairing the 
self with social belonging, participants will complete a Go/No -Go T ask.[ADDRESS_844228] of interpreting the coded interviews and identifying higher -order themes, 
using an iterative inductive -deductive  approach.  Additionally, emails spontaneously sent from 
participants in the intervention group to the MMB coach may be saved on secure databases as 
qualitative data. Information sent in emails that would be considered important qualitative data 
would include participants’ accounts of how COVID -[ADDRESS_844229] Study, Aim 1a involves prospective monitoring of the study 
sample across their pregnancy, with self -report questionnaires completed each month and five 
telephone contacts with study staff for all participants (baseline, qualita tive interview, third 
trimester, 3 months postpartum, and 6 months postpartum). Participants will first be consented 
before continuing with the screening process. Those determined to be ineligible after this phone 
screening will be dropped from the study a nd provided with a list of resources, including the 
national suicide hotline and contact [CONTACT_632336]. 
Consented subjects will be sent a copy of the phone consent document. This consent form will 
include a summary of pri vacy policies and date of consent. Individuals who do not provide 
verbal consent will be informed that it is not possible for them to participate in the study and we 
will provide them with a list of links to depression information websites. Participants in Arm [ADDRESS_844230] participants to treatment and resources if necessary. 
Among women, we will probe key factors identified predictive models of suicidal risk and 
behavior; we will conduct open -ended interv iews to assess social belonging, and we will use 
interview and coding procedures described in Hargus et al. (2010) to assess autobiographical 
memory specificity and meta -awareness.15 We also will inquire about experiences with the 
healthcare system and informal support networks (e.g., reasons for reporting or not reporting 
suicidal ideation and behavior to p roviders, perceptions of what providers and the health care 
system could do differently, and perception of effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_632293]).  
 
Aim 1b.  
After consent to reach out to community providers in obtained in Aim 1a, a letter  explaining the 
UPWARD Study and Supplemental Arms will be sent to the community providers overseeing 
the care of participants enrolled in Arm 1a. The letter will ask that these providers consider 
taking part in a qualitative interview with study staff. A QR code will be included in this letter that 
directs providers to Calendly , an online scheduling platform. This online scheduler will be 
securely encrypted and  allow providers to select the time slot that works best for them to 
participate in a qualitative interview. Additionally, study staff may reach out to community 
providers over phone , fax,  or email to recruit them for participation in the qualitative inter view.  
Willing providers will be consented by [CONTACT_237720].  After reading the study fact 
sheet, study staff will obtain verbal consent for participation. In addition, participants will review 
key points of the study with study staff, will be p rovided with contact [CONTACT_632337], and will be 
encouraged to print and retain personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_632294]. Consented healthcare 
providers will be sent a copy of t he phone consent document. This consent form will include a 
summary of privacy policies and date of consent. Providers who do not provide verbal consent 
will be informed that it is not possible for them to participate in the study.  Interviews with 
healthc are providers will be oriented around identifying the extent to which providers report the 
knowledge and skills necessary to support patients with suicidal ideation and behavior and 
identify areas of additional training and support needed. Queries will pro be policies for 
supporting patients, access to mental health providers within their healthcare setting, 
perceptions regarding the importance of patient access to a mental health provider for 
comprehensive care, barriers and challenges to providing patients  with care, and perceived 
resources for support for providers.  Phone interviews with providers will be audio recorded to 
aid in transcription and qualitative analysis. Providers concerned about the time commitment 
involved in a phone interview will be ask ed to answer the same open -ended questions through 
an online REDCap survey and will be electronically consented through REDCap.  
In addition to provider interviews, medical records will be requested for the [ADDRESS_844231] been addressed in a clinical settin g. We 
will assess the potential relationship between suicidal ideation and behavior during pregnancy 
and risk for adverse obstetric outcomes (e.g., preterm labor, shorter gestational age).38 We also 
will assess the extent to which prenatal healthcare providers document evi dence of suicidal 
ideation and behavior in these records; these data will inform our description of routine care of 
suicidal ideation and behavior is identified and addressed in routine care across a spectrum of 
specialty and general practice settings. Pro cedures for record procurement and abstraction of 
relevant obstetric and neonatal data are well established based on the success of the MGH 
team following these procedures to obtain records from over 90% of women enrolled in the 
National Pregnancy Registry  for Psychiatric Medications.39 
 
Aim 1c.  
To address Aim 1c, we will use a cross sectional design in which pregnant women who endorse 
suicidality with PHQ -9 item #9 scores > [ADDRESS_844232] study will be asked if they are willing 
to consent to complet ing a one-time set of self-report instruments and behavioral tasks to inform 
our understanding of the characteristics and correlates of suicidal ideation and behavior (n = 
550). Participants will read information about the study and provide consent electronically before 
continuing on to complete the survey battery . Consenting participants will be asked to provide a 
mobile phone number which will be used as an identifier to prevent duplicate survey responses 
from the same participant. All participants  in this study also will be provided with a list of 
resources, including the national suicide hotline and contact [CONTACT_632338], a well -respected group that provides local support to pregnant and postpartum 
women.  
 
 
Aim 2.  
Similar to the parent UPWARD Study and Aim 1a, Aim 2 involves prospective monitoring of the 
study sample across their pregnancy, with self -report questionnaires completed each month 
and five telephone contacts with study staff for all participants (bas eline, qualitative interview, 
third trimester, 3 months postpartum, and 6 months postpartum). Participants will be consented 
prior to the initial phone screening. Those eligible will proceed to randomization and those 
found ineligible after the phone scree ning will be dropped from the study and provided with a 
list of resources, including the national suicide hotline and contact [CONTACT_632339]. Consented subjects will be sent a copy of the phone consent document 
and consented using the procedure described for the parent UPWARD study.  
 Participants in Arm 2 will be randomly assigned to receive MMB ( n = 20) or UC ( n = 20). To 
maintain concealment,  assignment will occur following the baseline assessment by [CONTACT_632340]. Assignments will be generated using a random number table with 
equal probability of assignment to each group in blocks of four, which will guarantee balance for 
every four subjects. Randomization to study arm will be stratified based on number of prior 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], antidepressant medication status (on medication or having discontinued at time of 
randomization), and baseline depressive severity based on PHQ -[ADDRESS_844233] participants to 
treatment and resources if necessary. We will ask open -ended questions about women’s views 
on the helpfulness of MMB for Moms , reasons for benefits, and difficulties. We also will inquire 
about women’s perceptions of elements added to other MBCT protocols for specific 
populations, such as the use of additional introductory meetings prior to the [ADDRESS_844234] Study and are between 12 -15 
months postpartum will be offered to participate in a one -time, self -report battery administered 
through REDCap. The purpose of this 12 -months postpartum timepoint is to learn more about 
participants’ wellness as well as their babies’ development and behaviors. Eligible particip ants 
will be contact[CONTACT_632341]. The email will include a REDCap link that 
directs participants to an online consent form followed by [CONTACT_632342]. They 
may choose to ignore the email to opt-out of participatio n. If they consent and choose to move 
forward, they will complete the self -report questionnaires and will have up until 15 months 
postpartum to do so . Upon completion  of these surveys , they will be sent the code to a $ [ADDRESS_844235] 
clinical interview, including race/ethnicity, education level, and history of psychiatric treatment.  
 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) . The MINI is a valid, structured diagnostic 
tool that assesses Axis I and II disorders in accordance with DSM -IV symptom criteria. The MINI 
will be used to establish baseline diagnoses for each participant, and to ensure eligibility criteria 
are met (e.g. rule ou t diagnoses of bipolar diso rder, psychosis, or substance abuse disorder). It 
will also ascertain whether or not participants experienced a depressive relapse at four follow -up 
assessment time points. Also, participant scores > 15 on the monthly PHQ -9 or ≥ [ADDRESS_844236]. Marlene Freeman at  MGH . Evaluators will be blind to treatment

using in another NIMH funded trial with depressed perinatal women, participants complete four 
blocks that pair me and not -me (separately) with traits of belonging (e.g., accepted, included, 
wanted) and rejection (e.g., isolated, abandoned, excluded).  
 
Insomnia  Severity  Index  (ISI):  The ISI is a 9-item questionnaire  that measures  severity  of 
insomnia  over the past two weeks.  
 
Beck  Hopelessness  Scale  (BHS):  The BHS is a 20-item questionnaire  that measures  three  
major  aspects  of hopelessness:  feelings  abou t the future,  loss of motivation,  and expectations.  
 
PUQE-24: The PUQE -24 is an assessment tool for evaluating the severity of nausea and 
vomiting during pregnancy (NVP). The scoring scale measures the frequency of nausea, 
emesis, and retching within the p revious 24 hours.  
 
DSM -5 Self -Rated Level 1 Cross -Cutting Symptom Measure (DSM -5 CCSM): The DSM -5 
CCSM is a 13 -item self -report questionnaire that assesses mental health domains that are 
important across psychiatric diagnoses.  
 
Distress Intolerance Index (DII): The DII is a 10-item self-report questionnaire about how 
individuals handle difficult situations and emotions.  
 
Hamburg Hannover Agitation Scale  (H2A): The HHAS  is an 11 item self -report questionnaire 
used to measure symptoms of agitation over a one -week period.  
 
Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI ): The SITBI assesses the presence, 
frequency, and characteristics of a wide range of self -injurious t houghts and behaviors, 
including suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal 
self-injury  
 
Brief Approach Avoidance Copi[INVESTIGATOR_130750] (BACQ): The BACQ is a 12 -item self -report 
questionnaire that measures approach and avoidance styles of copi[INVESTIGATOR_632295]. Items are scored on a 5 -point scale.  
 
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale SR (BIS):  The BIS is a [ADDRESS_844244] Tactics Scale (CTS2):  The CTS2 short form is a [ADDRESS_844245] doing to the partner.  
 
 
Protective  Factors  (deterrents)  of Suicide  
General  Belongingness  Scale  (GBS):  The GBS  is a 12-item measure  to assess  a sense  of 
general  belongingness.  
 
 
 
 
MMB Treatment Protocol  
Participants in the UPWARD Study and UPWARD -S Arm [ADDRESS_844246], called Mindful Mood 
Balance for Moms (MMB for Moms; see Table 2), is delivered in a mobile first digital format, 
which can be accessed fully from desktop or mobile devices. It is provided in an individually 
tailored manner that replicates the core co mponents of the in -person MBCT program. 
Specifically, each session engages a sequential tripartite learning cycle that is core to the in -
person MBCT program (Experiential Practice, Video -Based Vicarious Learning, and Didactic 
Information). This provides pa tients with the opportunity for threefold presentation of content, 
but accessed through unique and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_632296].23,[ADDRESS_844247], but modified for digital delivery ( e.g., presented in a 
more interactive format, shortened to accommodate the typi[INVESTIGATOR_632297]). Participants are asked to logon to the program on a daily basis until program 
completion and to set a regular routine for sessions and h omework practice. The digital platform 
for M MB will be hosted at Brella  for the study’s duration. Direct access to the server is secured 
by a firewall with IP whitelisting and account verification. HTTPS,  SSL access, and user 
passwords are secured with 256 -bit level encryption.  
 
The MMB for Moms program also includes social community functionality.  
 
Finally, telephone coaching is delivered for participants to accompany the MMB for Moms digital 
program, consistent with the coaching manual for a 12 -week inte rvention period. Participants 
may also be emailed or texted by [CONTACT_632346]. These text messages will be sent from the Google Voice 
platform and  will be limited to information needed t o schedule phone calls and not for lengthy 
clinical discussion . The CU Boulder site will oversee the integrity of the digital M MB condition, 
including telephone /text/email  coaching and moderating all digital site activity, including 
coaching feedback and o nline community interactions.  Participants  enrolled in UPWARD 
Extension  will receive the fully functional MMB intervention but will not receive the additional 
coaching component.  
 
Data describing participant engagement with the intervention will be collected and analyzed. 
This includes metrics captured by [CONTACT_632347] h as the number of sessions 
participants complete, the number of times participants log into the platform, participants’ home 
practice completion, and participants’ reflections on mindfulness practices .

MMB for Moms may be a promising intervention for pregnant women with suicidal ideation, as it 
delivers digitally both the content and structure of in -person MBCT. The standard MMB for 
Moms program will be implemented for participants in UPWARD Supplemental  Arm 2; however, 
measurement expansion for Supplemental Aim 2 will probe participant responses to the content 
and the potential need for additional information specific to suicidal ideation and behaviors.  
 
 
Usual Care (UC). Usual care will not be constrain ed for any study participants, including those 
randomized to M MB. The study will not constrain or influence women’s decisions about 
maintenance or discontinuation of AD for all participants. Usual care will be augmented in two 
ways. First, we will provide ongoing study assessments and the provision of feedback to 
participants based on their responses to the PHQ -9, EPDS,  and clinical interviews (e.g., “Your 
answers seem to suggest that you are having significant symptoms of depression. We 
recommend t hat you talk with your community care provider about whether treatment or 
modification of treatment might help”). Usual care also will be augmented by [CONTACT_632348].   
 
Prospective Follow -up and Community Outreach  
MGH physicians with perinatal psychiatry expertise will be available via a consult line for 
community providers  of participants enrolled in the UPWARD Study and UPWARD -S. 
Throughout the study, they will answer questions regarding psychiatric medications and 
possible treatment options for individual patients determ ined by [CONTACT_632349].  
 
MGH study staff trained in interviewing techniques will administer the baseline, qualitative, post-
intervention , third trimester, [ADDRESS_844250] Study, in addition to regularly scheduled self -report questionnaires and phone 
contacts, relapse determination calls will be made to any participan t scoring ≥ 15 on the monthly 
PHQ -9 or ≥ [ADDRESS_844251] -S, if suicidality is endorsed with a 
score of greater than 1 on EPDS item #10 or PHQ -9 item #9 or on any of the self -report 
questionnaires  (such as the SITBI  or CCM ), subjects will be prompted to complete the CS -S to 
assess risk of sui cidality. Study subjects will also be given the national suicide hotline number 
([PHONE_080]) and informed that answers to online questionnaires are not monitored in real 
time. A positive score on questions 3, 4, or 5 on the CS -S, indicating intention o r plan for 
suicidality, will prompt a safety call by [CONTACT_67926]. Suicidality expressed during the course 
of clinical  or qualitative  interviews, either through discussion , endorsement of the suicidality item 
on the MINI mood module, endorsement of items 3, 4, or 5 on the suicidality module of the 
MINI,  or via scoring >[ADDRESS_844252] emergency room. Endorsement of items 3 -5 
on the CS -S prompting a physician safety call has been the thr eshold used in previous studies 
at the collaborating site (University of Colorado Boulder). As this is a community -based study 
with collaboration from community physicians, these providers dictate treatment.  We will notify 
community providers directly via phone or fax within 24 hours from report of positive scores on 
CS-S items 3 -5. 
 
 
VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Preliminary Analyses: Differences between the M MB and UC in demographic characteristics 
and depression related characteristics (e.g., symptom severity, comorbidity) will be assessed 
using Chi -square test for binary variables, Cochran Mantel Haenszel tests for categorical 
variables, and t -tests for contin uous variables. Variables that show significant group differences 
and predict outcome will be entered in analyses as covariates; AD exposure will be included as 
a covariate. All participants will be considered evaluable for analysis (intent -to-treat sample ). 
Significance levels will be evaluated at p<.05, and effect sizes reported.  
 
Analysis for Specific Aim #1: To test the relative risk for depressive relapse and reduction of 
symptom burden between women randomized to digital M MB or UC.  
For the analysis o f rates of relapse, we will examine time to relapse as rated by [CONTACT_632350] [ADDRESS_844253] regression and illustrated in Kapla n-Meier 
curves (Collett, 1994).  However, time to attrition is a competing risk that can be related to time 
to relapse. We will adopt the subdistribution hazard model (SHM) developed by [CONTACT_632351] -independence of the cens oring mechanism.25  
For the continuous outcomes, we will use Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) as our 
primary anal ytic model, which will compare change over time between groups on depressive 
symptom burden using the PHQ -9. HLM is flexible with respect to the nature of change over 
time (i.e., linear, pi[INVESTIGATOR_632299], loglinear, etc.), and will accommodate the within s ubject 
correlation through the inclusion of random effects at the patient -level, accounting for the 
patient -to-patient deviations. Pattern -mixture models26 will be used to assess whether important 
estimates (i.e., intervention effects) are dependent on missing data and to provide overall 
estimates of effects by [CONTACT_632352] -data patterns.   
 
Analysis for Specific Aim #2: To explore the specific benefit of M MB relative to AD 
discontinuation and questions regarding personalization that are of strong interest to pregnant 
women and their healthcare providers.  
H2a: Comparison of M MB to UC among wom en who discontinue AD:  Our analysis will 
be the same as H1 with both the time -to relapse and continuous outcome models.  We predict 
that rates of relapse and symptom burden among women randomized to M MB who discontinue 
AD will be significantly superior to those randomized to UC who discontinue AD.  
H2b: Treatment Selection Algorithm : We predict that the use of a treatment selection 
algorithm will differentiate two profiles of women based on pre -treatment characteristics (those 
who are optimally suited to di scontinue AD and engage M MB to minimize their risk of relapse, 
and those who should continue AD to minimize risk of relapse) and that women who are 
randomized to the algorithm indicated approach will have significantly lower risk of relapse and 
symptom bur den than women who are randomized to their algorithm contraindicated approach.  
 
Analysis for Specific Aim #3: To test the extent to which digital M MB engages putative targets.  
To test target engagement, we will use the same HLM methods described above to 
compare differences between M MB and UC in change in the putative targets during the 
intervention period.  To test target validation, we will use r ecent statistical developments that 
apply formal causal inference concepts to mediation analyses. Causal media tion approaches 
address violations of the assumption of sequential ignorability (e.g., no 
confounding/randomization of the mediator) that is required for unbiased estimates of the M 
(mediator) → Y (outcome) relationship. Addressing the issue of sequential ignorability yields 
unbiased estimates of the natural direct effect (NDE = the non -mediated effect of reduction of 
depressive related outcomes) and the natural indirect effect (NIE = the component of the 
intervention that seems to proceed through the respe ctive mechanisms), with Total Effect = 
NDE + NIE.[ADDRESS_844254] experience implementing these models which fall 
under the classification of marginal structural models (MSM), principal stratification (PS), 
structural nested mean models (SNMM), and rank preserving models (RPM),28-30 which we will 
apply for each putative target individually. Sensitivity analyses will be implemented using 
approaches outlined by [CONTACT_632353].31  
 
 
Power Analysis for Speci fic Aim #1: To test the relative risk for depressive relapse and reduction 
of symptom burden between women randomized to digital M MB or UC.  
For the analysis of rates of relapse, in our efficacy study of MBCT,[ADDRESS_844255] evidenced approximately 30% lower rate of relapse than UC. In estimating 
the difference in relapse rates  between M MB and UC, accommodating the sample size required 
to address Aim 2, N = 600 participants is required for randomization. With N= 600, we have 
95.5% power to detect a 20% difference in relapse rates (which i s smaller than what we 
observed in our efficacy study) and allowing for 30% attrition, which is higher than attrition in our 
efficacy study of MBCT with pregnant women (15%) and lower than attrition in our digital 
delivery of MBCT work (approximately 40%).   
For the continuous outcomes, using the method described by [CONTACT_632354]. to derive 
formulas for power estimation of linear mixed models,33 power calculations can be made for 
repeated measures designs under specifi ed assumptions.  Based on a sample size of 300 per 
group, assuming 30% attrition for a total of [ADDRESS_844256] power of 86.5% to detect 
an effect s ize of .25. Varying the effect size, we have 95.7%, 99.0%, and 99.8% power for effect 
sizes of 0.3, 0.35, and 0.4 respectively, which are much smaller than the d=0.[ADDRESS_844257] with pregnant women,34 indicating that we are 
sufficiently powered.  
 
Power Analysis for Specific Aim #2: To explore the specific benefit of M MB relative to AD 
discontinuation and questions regarding personalization that are of strong interest to preg nant 
women and their healthcare providers.  
H2a: Comparison of M MB to UC among women who discontinue AD:  Anticipating 
balance across the 4 cells (randomized to M MB or UC; choice of discontinue AD or maintain 
AD), with approximately [ADDRESS_844258] 82.8% power 
to detect a 23% difference in relapse rates with 30% attrition, which is smaller than what would 
be expected comparing the relapse rates among women who received MBCT (19%) in the 
Dimidjian  et al. study of MBCT with pregnant women32 to the rate of re lapse among women who 
discontinued AD during pregnancy (66%) in the Cohen et al. prospective study10). 
H2b: Treatment Sel ection Algorithm : Although there has been growing interest in trials 
focused on estimation of an optimal personalized treatment strategy,[ADDRESS_844259], the personalized treatment regimen, is not a measurable 
outcome as in typi[INVESTIGATOR_632300].36 Laber and colleagues provide a method for sizing 
such a trial, which they apply to their fertility (time to pregnancy) data example.37 In their setting, 
they estimated a sample size of 280 was need to yield 80% power for superior coverage with 9 
terms (including main effects and interaction terms) with an interval width of 0.38.  Based on a 
slight modification of width to  0.40, we estimate a sample size of [ADDRESS_844260] that 50% of participants randomized to M MB will 
discontinue AD (n= 150) and 50% of participants randomized to UC will continue AD (n= 150); 
thus, our randomized sample (N= 600) should be sufficiently powered  to build a model with up to 
4 moderator variables (the number identified in our preliminary d ata). We will conduct PAI 
analysis with the SAS software procedure PROC QLEARN.  
 
Power Analysis for Specific Aim #3: To test the extent to which digital M MB engages putative 
targets. Fritz et al. derived sample size requirements to guarantee 80% power.[ADDRESS_844261] for treatment on 
outcome, covarying the mediator, the sample size for 80% power is 224 patients; therefore, our 
proposed sample, even with as much as 30% attrition is  more than sufficient to test mediation 
with 80% power.  
 
VII.. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Participation in this study is not anticipated to confer risk to the fetus greater than that expected 
in normal day -to-day activity. Clinical studies of MBCT, including st udies with non -pregnant 
women, have been conducted and indicate no potential risks to pregnant women or fetuses. 
Subject burden for participation occurs for approximately [ADDRESS_844262] MMB condition will additionally receive 
telephone/email coach ing through the MMB program during the [ADDRESS_844263] personal and sensitive questions 
include asking about abuse of alcohol or illegal dru gs and history of suicidality. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_632301] (e.g., when directing attention to 
self-critical thoughts); however, these risks are no greater than what would occur in daily life.  
Patients will be advised that all questions are voluntary.  
We will include detailed information about possible risks in the study fact sheet s, which illustrate 
the most sensitive types of questions about which subjects will be asked on the questionnaires 
and as part of the M MB intervention, should they be randomized to that condition. Participants 
also will be instructed that they may discontinue participation in the study or the M MB 
intervention, and/or choose not to complete web-based  assessments at any time by [CONTACT_632355].   
It is possible that participants may experience injury or discomfort when engaging in the 
mindfulness stretching/yoga practices at home. The mindfulness and yoga practices included in 
the M MB intervention have been specifically tailored to pregnant and postpartum women. A 
description of the mindfulness/yoga components will be included in the consent form so that 
individuals are informed about the nature of the practices, and the digital program will instruct 
particip ants not to engage in any exercise or practice they think will be harmful to their health or 
well-being.  
 
Usual care will not be constrained for any study participants, including those randomized to 
MMB. Usual care will be augmented by [CONTACT_632356] -9, EPDS,  and clinical interviews 
(e.g., “Your answers suggest that you are having significant symptoms of depression. We 
recommend that you talk with your prenata l care provider about whether treatment might help”). 
Usual care also will be augmented by [CONTACT_632357]. All 
treatment dec isions, including use of medications and treatment of emergent symptoms, will be 
managed by [CONTACT_2299]’s community prescriber who is not a study investigator. Participants 
in the UC group will be followed naturalistically, and no clinical intervention s will be made by 
[CONTACT_2792]. The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort associated with 
participation in this arm of the study is not anticipated to be greater than that encountered in 
daily life.  
Participants also may feel inconvenience d by [CONTACT_632358]. Participants will be informed about the expected duration of each assessment time 
point and M MB practice sessions for participants in that arm, and we have designed the 
assessment procedures to mi nimize burden on participants. Participants  in the parent UPWARD 
Study  will receive a total of $[ADDRESS_844264] Baby [CONTACT_632359] 12 months 
postpartum will be compensated an additional $20. Participants in UPWARD Extension  will 
receive a total of $[ADDRESS_844265] 
Supplement Arms  1a and 2 will be compensated $200 for their participation in the study ($[ADDRESS_844266] study to compens ate for participation in qualitative interviews  and 
additional self -report questionnaires ). Providers that participate in UPWARD Supplement Arm 
1b will be compensated $[ADDRESS_844267] Supplemental Arm 1c will be compensated $[ADDRESS_844268] a history of depression will be included  in the proposed trial and therefore 
the recurrence or exacerbation of mood symptoms during study participation is a possible but 
expected risk. Suicidal ideation reported in phone interviews or self -report questionnaires over 
the course of study will be a ddressed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_632360]. Specifically, we will carefully monitor depressive 
symptoms, including suicidality, throughout the study, using the PHQ -939 and EPDS completed 
at regular assessment points via REDCap, and on the real -time phone contacts and interv iews 
administered by [CONTACT_612986], which assess depression course and relapse.  
 
If a participant scores greater than or equal to 15 on the PHQ -9 or greater than or equal to 12 
on the EPDS, the online data collection and management system (REDCap) will automatically 
provide participants with contact [CONTACT_632361]. Study investigators will be notified immediately via an algorithm 
programmed into REDCap . In the UPWARD parent trial and UPWARD -S Arms 1a and 2, study 
staff at MGH will initiate a clinical response by [CONTACT_632362] 24 business hours of report . The score of 15 is suggested as the 
threshold for moderate depression.39 Additionally, we will monitor specifically responses to the 
suicide item (#9) on the PHQ -9: ‘Thoughts that you would be better off dead or hurting yourself 
in some way.’ and the suicide item (#10) on the EPDS: ‘The thought of harming myself has 
occurred t o me’  for all study participants . If a participant endorses either of these items with a 
score of 1 or greater, REDCap will automatically route participants to fill out the Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CS -S) and provide participants with contact  [CONTACT_632363]. Study investigators and 
staff will be automatically notified by [CONTACT_632364] a positive score on questions [ADDRESS_844269] -S, endorsement of current suicidal ideation on the 
SITBI or CCM item (#11) will also  automatically  route participants to fill out the CS -S. Any 
endorsement of items 1 -5 of the CS -S will prompt administration of the full CS -S to capture 
duration and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behaviors.  Furthermore, a ny participant who 
misses a scheduled assessment point will be contact[CONTACT_632365].  Study staff 
will continue to try to reach participants until a participant indicates that they no longer wish to 
be contact[CONTACT_632366] p ostpartum by [CONTACT_632367] e of 
delivery, whichever comes first.  Throughout the stud y, all participants also will be encouraged to 
contact [CONTACT_632368].   
During the telephone -based assessments, M MB coaching calls, or other telephone contacts, 
study staff are provided ongoing education and supe rvision in the event of potential clinical 
problems and are instructed to have a very low threshold for obtaining consultation. 
Endorsement of suicidality will initiate a protocol used in other studies by [CONTACT_632369] l reach the patient, assess suicidality, and refer to the 
community prescriber or provider and/or to emergency services, based on participant interview. 
Drs. Dimidjian and Cohen carry cell phones listed with all study staff to provide immediate 
clinical su pervision if needed. If a participant expresses non -emergent mental health needs, 
research staff will encourage them to contact [CONTACT_632370]. If over the 
course of the phone contact [CONTACT_632371], is no t making clear 
sense, sounds intoxicated or impaired, or expresses thoughts of suicide or homicide, study staff 
will inform the participant that a study doctor will call them back  as soon as possible within a few 
hours. At that point, the study investigator will guide the interview to ascertain the acuity and/or 
potential for harm. The study investigator will first determine if the caller is alone or has access 
to another adult capable of transportation.  If the study inv estigator determines that the 
participant is in need of emergent care, the options for such care will be discussed with the 
caller and may include referral to the closest emergency room, or notification of emergency 
services for transportation to ER, and t he participant’s emergency contact [CONTACT_632372].  
In the parent UPWARD Study  and UPWARD Extension , procedures for responding to suicidal 
ideation are put into play as needed during the course of prospective monitorin g, and these will 
be expanded for the Supplement Arms. Specifically, they will be initiated at the time of study 
enrollment when subjects are determined to be otherwise eligible for study inclusion. 
Participants endorsing suicidality via PHQ -9 #9 > 1 durin g the screening process will complete a 
self-report version of the Columbia  Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Any positive 
endorsement of items [ADDRESS_844270].  Suicidality expressed during the 
course of clinical and qualitative interviews, either through discussion, endorsement of 
suicidality on the MINI mood module, endorsement of items 3, 4, or 5 on the suicidality module 
of the MINI, or via scoring >[ADDRESS_844271] Supplemental Arms, participants will be 
notified of the outreach to their community providers during the informed consent process. 
Following enrollment, community providers will b e sent a letter notifying them of their patient’s 
enrollment in the study and endorsement of suicidal ideation. Aside from the information that is 
shared during safety outreach to community providers in the parent UPWARD study (patient 
name, specifics  of expressing  suicidal ideation  - i.e. questions endorsed through self -report 
questionnaire, date of endorsement), no additional data collected from participants will be 
shared at the time of initial outreach to community providers or during the qualitative in terviews 
with providers described in Supplemental Aim 1b. During physician safety calls, an y information 
necessary to ensure participant safety (as determined by [CONTACT_632373]) will be shared with their community provider.  
 
Endorsement of items 3 -5 on the CS -S prompting a physician safety call has been the threshold 
used in previous studies at the collaborating site (University of Colorado Boulder). As this is a 
community -based study with collaboration from community physicia ns, these providers dictate 
treatment.  As noted above, consent to communicate with these individuals is obtained as a 
required part of enrollment in the parent grant and will be applied in the supplement. The 
feasibility of establishing close communication  with community -based providers of pregnant 
women with depression with and without suicidality enrolled in prospective studies is well 
established from previous federally funded grants conducted by [CONTACT_632374] [ADDRESS_844272]. Maria Oquendo (an 
expert in suicide research and a co -creator of the CSSRS) as a consultant to advise us on the 
other ways in which the clinical assessment of suicidality may be refined particularly with 
respect to evaluation of pregnant and postpartum women.  
 
In another potential scenario not directly related to assessment of suicidality but relevant to 
prospective  follow -up, queries may arise from participants’ community prescriber or provider 
regarding changes or reintroduction of pharmacologic treatment during pregnancy or the 
postpartum period. In this situation, study physicians with expertise in perinatal psyc hiatry will 
be available to provide consultation to these providers. This procedure of support to community 
prescribers has been successfully used by [CONTACT_632375] i nstruments during pregnancy and 
the postpartum period while concurrently followed clinically by [CONTACT_29436] -based  prescribers.  
 
There are risks to confidentiality and privacy associated with participation in all research studies 
and in studies of digital int erventions. A number of steps have been taken to safeguard privacy 
and confidentiality across the study. All study staff will be required to sign statements indicating 
that they understand confidentiality and agree to protect against risk of confidentialit y. Study 
personnel and materials will assure that participants understand the confidentiality measures 
taken in this study to protect them and their information. Participants will be invited at any time 
to share their concerns with the study staff, investi gators, or IRB representatives.  
Also, participating in this study will involve access to four websites: the MMB  website – where 
the 8 -session program will be presented, Qualtrics – where the SRET data and GNAT will be 
collected, the REDCap website – where  the online surveys will be completed , and Calendly to 
facilitate scheduling . The digital platform for M MB will be hosted at Brella  for the study’s 
duration. Direct access to the server is secured by a firewall with IP whitelisting and account 
verification . HTTPS, SSL access, and user passwords are secured with 256 -bit level encryption. 
Passwords and their associated web access will be deleted from the study registry by [CONTACT_632376]’s termination or completion  of the study, 
whichever is earlier. The study team will have administrative access to the website. Brella  is 
experienced in managing confidential data using encryption and passwords.  Calendly uses a 
secure server and data center accredited under: ISO [ZIP_CODE], SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 
3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II), PCI Level 1, FISMA Moderate and Sarbanes -Oxley (SOX). 
Scheduling information that passes through Calendly is encrypted, both in transit and at rest. All 
connections from the browser to the Calendly platform are encrypted in transit using TLS SHA -
256 with RSA Encryption.  
Study data will be collec ted and managed using REDCap. REDCap is a secure web application 
designed to support data capture for research studies. The database is hosted at the University 
of Colorado Denver Development and Informatics Service Center (DISC), which will be used as 
a central location for data processing and management.  This project uses REDCap Twilio 
integrated functionality to allow participants to respond via SMS text message to the questions 
asked in the positive mood diary. A REDCap and Twilio account are linked tog ether. When a 
user indicates that an SMS (text) or a call should be sent to a cell phone, REDCap requests that 
action through Twilio. When a user responds, Twilio relays that information back to REDCap. 
The data is stored in the REDCap database. Twilio doe s not store any data nor does it keep a 
log of its actions. All voice calls and SMS messages will be routed through Twilio's servers, but 
REDCap goes to great length to ensure that voice call records and SMS transcriptions do not 
stay in Twilio's logs but are removed shortly after being completed. This is done for security and 
privacy concerns (e.g., HIPAA), in which participants' phone numbers and their survey 
responses do not get permanently logged on Twilio's servers but instead remain securely in 
REDCap .  
Another risk to confidentiality involves unauthorized access to a participant’s login information if 
that information is inadvertently left in plain view. Although this risk is not completely 
preventable, we will instruct participants in the importance of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_632302].  
The digital M MB program makes available an online community; however, this will be 
moderated by [CONTACT_632377]. Though unlikely in the context 
of national recrui tment, it is possible that individuals may identify one another despi[INVESTIGATOR_632303]. We will inform participants of this potential 
in the consent form, and we will also explicitly ask participants in the proces s of seeking consent 
to maintain the privacy of all participants.  
We anticipate that the additional 12 -months postpartum timepoint (UPWARD -Baby) will not 
present any  additional risk for participants compared to that of the parent study. Because we are 
asking the PHQ -8 at this timepoint  instead of the PHQ -9 (which is what is asked throughout  the 
parent study), we will not learn about suicidal ideation and therefore a safety plan for SI is not 
needed.  
 
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Participants may benefit from ongoing clinical monitoring of depressive symptoms and , in all 
arms except UPWARD Extension , provision of feedback. In addition, participants assigned to 
the M MB condition may experience an increase in knowledge about depression and how to 
decrease future risk for relapse. All participants enrolled in the study will have any benefits 
afforded by [CONTACT_632378]. Since contact [CONTACT_632379], subjects will have the op portunity to easily access 
experts in the area of depression and pregnancy.  
Lastly, subjects will be compensated for their participation. Participants in the parent UPWARD 
Study will be compensated $[ADDRESS_844273] 
Extension  will be compensated a total of $[ADDRESS_844274] Supplement Arms 1a and 2 will be compensated $200 for their participation in the 
study ($[ADDRESS_844275] study to compensate for participation in qualitative 
interviews  and additional self -report questionnaires ). Providers that participate in UPWARD 
Supplement Arm 1b will be compensated $75 for their participation in the qualitative interview.  
Study physicians with expertise in perinatal psychiatry will be available as a resource to 
community providers for advice and management of participants’ clinical care. If questions arise 
regarding changes or reintroduction of pharmacologic treatment durin g pregnancy or the 
postpartum period, study physicians can provide consultations to these providers, thus 
spreading clinical knowledge and equippi[INVESTIGATOR_632304] -driven 
care.  
Recent reviews have called for additional resear ch examining mindfulness -based interventions 
among adults with suicidal ideation and behavior.26 These recommendations are based, in part, 
on studies of mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) among adults with histories of 
suicidal ideation and behavior.16,[ADDRESS_844276] (DSMB) will be established for trial monitoring. The DSMB will 
consist of four persons, including a psychiatrist  with expertise in depression care management, 
a psychologist with expertise in the design and implementation of pragmatic clinical trials, a 
Ph.D. -level statistician, and an expert in online intervention or education delivery.  None of these 
persons will b e involved directly in the study. The DSMB has agreed to oversee the UPWARD 
Study and UPWARD -S components. The DSMB will have the following aims:  
- To assure the safety, privacy, and confidentiality of human subjects  
- To assure the reliability, validity, comp leteness, and integrity of the data collection, entry, 
and management process  
- To review implementation of the human subjects protocol, including all proposed 
protocol amendments and modifications  
- To review all serious adverse events, less serious adverse e vents, rates of dropout or 
study withdrawal, and rates of missing data  
The DSMB will have a minimum of two teleconferences per year for the study duration. 
Members will also meet via email as needed and by [CONTACT_632380]. Prior to its regular meetings, the study 
team will prepare reports to the DSMB about progress toward achieving the scientific aims, 
including study enrollment and patient flow, dropout and retention, data quality,  confidentiality, 
and safety issues. The DSMB also will be provided with blinded reports of intervention 
effectiveness to inform judgments about the value of interim analyses. Both [CONTACT_390374] and 
[CONTACT_26021] will attend all meetings with the DSMB.  
The DSM B will issue independent reports to the IRBs and the NIMH summarizing its review of 
these domains. If the DSMB believes that participants are being endangered, the Board will 
make recommendations to the NIMH and IRBs as to whether the trial should be stopp ed or 
procedures modified. If indicated, the independent reports from the DSMB will suggest ways to 
reduce risk and improve the quality of care of participants, and ways to improve the reliability, 
validity, integrity, and confidentiality of the data colle ction procedures.  
An advisory stakeholder panel, composed of prior collaborators and women with perinatal mood 
and anxiety disorders, will be established to provide advice on study procedures and discuss 
participation burdens and ease of use. This group w ill function solely in an advisory capacity, 
and will not view protected health information, data, or research subject -specific information. We 
will use this panel to review procedures and various protocols prior to enrollment of subjects  to 
ensure they ar e reasonable for subject participation .  
All participants, regardless of treatment condition to which they have been randomized, will 
receive one telephone contact [CONTACT_632381], who will administer the mood 
module of the Mini Internatio nal Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)40and who will be blind to 
randomized condition. Phone interviews will be audio recorded for supervision and data quality 
insurance purposes. These recordings will help the research team understand how the 
intervention works and maintain consistency across interviewers. Like all research information, 
these recordings will be stored on a secure server and kept confidential. All audio files will be 
labeled with an assigned stud y code number and will be used for research and teaching 
purposes only. Audio files will be stored on secure, password protected servers, accessible only 
to key study personnel.  
Research staff will receive intensive training prior to conducting assessments  with study 
participants. Training will include orientation to the MINI, observation of live training interviews , 
and co -rating of trainin g interviews . Interviewers will need to establish interrater reliability 
(weighted kappa statistic) > .[ADDRESS_844277]. Marlene Freeman at MGH.  
 
During the course of the protocol, study and non -study related events such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632305]; our risk management protocols are in place to address 
these events as they occur. All study staff are trained and available  to manage adverse events. 
Physicians are available by [CONTACT_632382]. Study 
investigators will report adverse events to the IRB following the PHRC guidelines, including 
reporting within [ADDRESS_844278]’s primary care and mental health providers will be informed with 
the s ubject’s permission.

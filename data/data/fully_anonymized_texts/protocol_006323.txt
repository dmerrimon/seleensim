 TITLE:  MOBILITY - METFORMIN FOR OVERWEI GHT & OBESE CH ILDREN AND 
ADOLESCENTS WITH B IPOLAR SPECTRUM DISOR DERS TREATED WITH 
SECOND -GENERATION AN TIPS YCHOTICS.  
FUNDER : PCORI    
  
A.  SPECIFIC  AIMS   
The specific aim  of this study is to address the significant gap in the evidence base for metformin (MET) 
use in overweight and obese youth with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders ( BSD ).  
 
The overall objective  of this prospective, large, PRAGMATIC  randomized trial is to study the impact of 
MET and healthy lifestyle intervention (LIFE) vs. LIFE alone on patient -centered outcomes of body 
weight, Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA) adherence and satisfaction, psychiatric symptom 
burden (e.g. mood/a nxiety), and quality of life  (QoL). We will also examine metabolic outcomes.  
 
Specific  Aim 1:  Assess  the overall  and subgroup -specific  impact of MET+LIFE  versus  LIFE  alone  on 
short - (6mo)  and long-term (24mo)  weight and  metabolic  health  in overweight  and obese  youth  with 
BSD.  
Hypothesis  (H)1.1 : Overall,  assignment to treatment with  MET  will abrogate  more  weight gain and lead to 
fewer  adverse  metabolic  outcomes  than LIFE  alone  at 6 and 24 months.  
H1.2  (Heterogeneity  of Treatment Effects  [HTE]):  MET’s  effectiveness  at abrogating  weight  gain and 
components  of metabolic  syndrome  will vary with respect to the following  factors  (see Patient  Population  
and Background  for rationale  and prior  data):  1) Change  in BMI z-score  from  SGA  initiation  to baseline  
(in patients  already  receiving  SGA  treatment);  2) Prior  exposure to and duration  of SGA  treatment; 3) 
Baseline  BMI z- score; 4) Baseline  psychotropic  weight burden  (in SGA  non-naïve  patients;  as defined  in 
Measures  below);  5) BSD  as diagnosed  by a structured  interview;  6) Age;  7) Type  of insurance  
(public/private); 8) Ethnicity  (Hispanic/Non);  9) Baseline  insulin  resistance  (HOMA -IR); 10) Race  
(African -American  (AA)  vs non-AA).  
 
Specific Aim  2:  Assess  the overall  and subgroup -specific  impact of MET+LIFE  vs. LIFE  alone  on short -
(6mo)  and long-term (24mo)  SGA  adherence  and treatment  satisfaction, including  assessment  of how 
these  effects  may be mediated  by [CONTACT_346445].  
H2.1 : Overall,  assignment to treatment  with MET  will lead to better  SGA  adherence  and greater treatment  
satisfaction  than LIFE  alone  after both  6 and 24 months.  
H2.2 : (HTE): MET  effectiveness  with regard  to SGA  adherence  will vary with respect to: 1) Baseline  
weight  acceptability;  2) Baseline  psychotropic  medication  treatment  acceptability;  3) Type  of insurance  
(public/private).    
H2.3 : The overall  effects  of MET  treatment on  SGA  adherence  will be mediated  by [CONTACT_346446],  and this relationship  will be stronger among  girls than boys.   We anticipate a possibly 
complex relationship between a brogation  of weight gain  (associated  with MET)  and SGA adherence , 
because weight gain may also be avoided  via SGA non-adherence  (at the  probable  cost of sub-optimal  
psychiatric  outcomes;  see Specific  Aim 3).  A statistical  framework  (marginal  structural  models)  to 
accommodate  this possibility  is described  in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan.   
 
Specific Aim 3: Assess  the overall  and subgroup -specific  impact of MET+LIFE  vs. LIFE  alone  on 
psychiatric  symptom  burden,  psychotropic  treatment changes , and overall and  weight -related  QoL , 
including  assessment  of how these  effects  are mediated  by [CONTACT_346447].  
H3.1:  Overall,  assignment to treatment  with MET  will be associated  with lower  psychiatric  symptom  
burden,  decreased  risk for symptom -driven  treatment  changes,  and greater improvements  in overall  and 
weight -related  QoL than LIFE  alone  at both [ADDRESS_430398]-randomization.  
H3.2:  (HTE): MET  effects  on psychiatric  symptoms  will be smaller  in patients  who meet full  DSM criteria  
for a BSD.

B.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Overweight and Obese Youth with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders (BSD):   [ADDRESS_430399] a prevalence rate of up to 5% in youth.4-[ADDRESS_430400] a relapsing and remitting illness course, with greater functional impairment, poorer 
quality of life (QoL), and greater economic burden   than those with later -onset BSD as well as youth with 
chronic medical and behavioral illnesses (e.g., asthma, heart conditions, and depression).11 A major factor 
contributing to poor outcomes is the high rate of overweight or obesity in youth with BSD.  12 Rates of 
overweight/obesity in youth with BSD vary in studies between 45 -80%, more than double that of the 
general population.12-[ADDRESS_430401] and clinical 
concern.  
 
Treatment with Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs) is on the Rise for Youth with BSD:  
Maximizing mood stability and minimizing medication side effects are the primary treatment  goals for 
improving overall outcome and QoL of youth with BSD.20-[ADDRESS_430402] led to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration’s (USFDA) approval of four SGAs (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) 
for the treatment of mania in youth and of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/fluoxetine combination as the only evidence -based 
treatment for depression associated with bipolar disorder in youth. Furthermore, in contrast to adults with 
bipolar disorder, several studies have recentl y demonstrated that youth with BSD have a significantly 
greater response to SGAs than to other mood stabilizing medications (e.g., lithium, valproic acid).23,[ADDRESS_430403], in the only double -blind placebo -controlled study of lithium for mania in youth, on ly 38% had a > 
50% reduction in symptoms of mania, as compared to most studies of SGAs, which report response rates 
of 55 -80%.23 Without equally efficacious evidence -based options for treating BSD in youth, SGAs use 
will likely continue to increase. Althou gh treatment with SGAs offers advantages over conventional 
antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), such as lower rates of extrapyramidal syndromes, there is significant 
concern about the dramatic increase in SGA prescriptions for youth, because younger patient s are more 
susceptible to SGA -related side effects than adults23 and discontinuing SGAs without an effective 
alternative medication is not a treatment option for many youth with BSD.  
 
Treatment with SGAs often leads to considerable symptom improvement, but  is very commonly 
associated with substantial weight gain early in treatment . A primary etiology of overweight/obesity 
in youth with BSD is SGA exposure.32 SGA -induced weight gain increases their already elevated long -
term risk of cardiovascular disease an d premature mortality.33,34 Furthermore, metabolic syndrome is a 
common, more immediate consequence of SGA treatment in youth.35,36 The risk for SGA -induced weight 
gain is much greater in youth than in adults.23,32,37 The weight gain associated with SGAs i s often 
dramatic and places these youth at risk for dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_346392], which may progress to 
diabetes. Weight gain typi[INVESTIGATOR_346393]. In a recent study, over 50% 
of 272 treatment -naïve youth gained >7%  of their baseline weight within 12 weeks.38,39 These data may 
underestimate the problem; recently, we determined that 80% of SGA -treated youth gained > 7% of their 
baseline  weight over two months while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_346394]. The so -called 
“appetite aggression” induced by [CONTACT_346448]40,41 may lead to violent behaviors and medication refusal 
following food restraint.

Although all SGAs cause some weight gain in youth, the amount of weight gain varies by [CONTACT_346449], 
prior exposure to SGAs, an d the individual.1,42 Treatment -naïve youth may be more susceptible to SGA -
related weight gain.1,38,43,44 Nonetheless, weight gain typi[INVESTIGATOR_346395]. 
Indeed, we  found 1 lb/week weight gain over 16 weeks in youth prescribed ol anzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, or 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_346396].36,45 While it is unclear whether SGA -related weight gain is dose -dependent,  
1,38,46,47 SGA polypharmacy may be associated with greater risk of metabolic syndrome compared to SGA 
monotherapy.43 
 
SGA -related weight gain in this already overweight/obese population is particularly problematic, as most 
obese youth become obese adults.[ADDRESS_430404], studies report that approximately 70% of youth treated with 
SGAs are overweight or obese.13,49 Although rel atively few youth develop diabetes because of their large 
insulin reserves, 12 -50% of youth treated with SGAs experience hyperinsulinemia and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035],[ADDRESS_430405] rather 
than change medications and risk relapse (see Significance). Nonetheless, discontinua tion of SGAs or 
switching to a lower -risk SGA is a potential strategy to manage weight gain. Unfortunately, switching 
SGAs produces limited or inconsistent improvements in weight and metabolic outcomes, along with some 
psychiatric risk.[ADDRESS_430406] yle intervention 
or metformin added.     
 
Healthy Lifestyle Interventions  promote physical activity and dietary lifestyle changes. Healthy lifestyle 
programs designed for youth, such as the “Healthy Eating Plan” associated with Healthworks!, developed 
and t ested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Siegel (Co -Investigator), may lead to weight loss in obese youth.67,68 However, some 
studies  show only limited benefits and involve programs that are not easily accessible.69,70 Studies of 
older adolescents and adults treated with SGAs found that healthy lifestyle interventions are effective for 
preventing weight gain and for weight loss, respectively, as well as for improving QoL, particularly when 
used early in the course of SGA treatment.71-75 In general, 2 -5% reduction in weight or 1 -1.5 b ody mass 
index (BMI) units is reported in studies of healthy lifestyle interventions for patients with mental health 
disorders. However, these studies suffer from high dropout rates, small sample sizes, and short 
duration.65,71 -73,75

Furthermore, the eff ects on weight and other metabolic parameters are small compared with 
pharmacological interventions.65. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], The American Medical Association (AMA) 
200776 provides guidelines on interventions for youth ages 2 -19 years old who meet CDC criteria for “at 
risk for overweight” and “overweight” (BMI% >85%ile) that involve simple education regarding diet and 
physical activity, i.e., healthy lifestyle intervention.  Although these guidelines were not specifically 
developed for mentally ill youth, the approach has advantages for this population, including simple 
dietary guidelines and inexpensive strategies to reduce sedentary behavior. This approach is similar to the  
standardized Healthy Eating Plan and Physical Activity education (LIFE) that will be provided to each 
participant of the proposed trial.67,76  
 
Metformin (MET) for Obesity in Youth . Pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as MET, supplement the 
effects of lifesty le interventions for weight loss. MET targets a molecular mechanism for weight gain, i.e., 
hypothalamic neuronal AMP kinase, a metabolic “fuel sensor”. SGAs directly affect hypothalamic AMP 
kinase through histamine H1 receptors, decreasing leptin and insul in sensitivity.77 MET is an oral anti -
hyperglycemic, insulin - sensitizing agent that reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis and is noteworthy among 
diabetes treatments for not promoting weight gain.78 MET is approved by [CONTACT_346450] >10 years. MET decreases food intake in obese, non -diabetic individuals.79 A 
recent meta -analysis80 of 14 randomized clinical trials (N>1000) examining the effectiveness of MET for 
obesity in youth found an average BMI reduction of -1.38 (95% CI,  -1.93 to -0.82) over [ADDRESS_430407] was seen for youth with a BMI > 35 at baseline, the 
authors concluded that a large trial is needed to determine the benefits to subgroups. Smaller meta -
analyses report BMI red uctions of -1.1 to -2.7 in obese youth compared with placebo or lifestyle 
intervention alone, in trials ranging from 6 -12 months with MET dosages of 1000 -2000mg/day.81,82 
Fasting insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_346397].  In these studies of 
youth from 8 -18 years old, MET was well -tolerated at up to 2000mg/day.83-85  
 
MET is extremely safe in youth. Lactic acidosis is extremely rare, especially in the non -elderly and those 
with creatinine levels < 1.4, and the risk of neur opathy from chronic vitamin deficiency is low.85 MET for 
Weight Gain in Patients Treated with SGAs. We chose MET over other evidence -based medications for 
weight loss (e.g., orlistat, sibutramine, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]) because MET is the only medication that has been 
systematically studied for reducing weight in adults and youth treated with SGAs and because of its 
superior tolerability and safety profile when prescribed in conjunction with SGAs. Indeed, we first 
reported that MET is safe and effective for minimiz ing weight gain in youth taking SGAs.36,[ADDRESS_430408], 1 in 6 patients discontinued  orlistat and 1 in 2 patients 
discontinued sibutramine because of side effects. Additionally, although topi[INVESTIGATOR_346398], cognitive “slowing” commonly leads to discontinuation.[ADDRESS_430409], there are now seven meta -analyses of treatments for weight gain and/or 
cardiovascular risk factors in patients taking SGAs.  
 
Most recently, Gier isch et al,65 conducted a meta -analysis of studies of patients taking SGAs who were 
treated for weight gain and reported that adding MET was the only intervention studied to date that 
improves metabolic parameters, although, “comparative effectiveness stud ies are needed to test multi -
modal strategies.”65 In another review of 11 MET studies (N=685) lasting on average 15.5 weeks, we 
determined that MET: 1) Produces statistically   and clinically significant weight loss ( -3.1 kg; 95% CI -
4.5 to -1.6); 2) Impro ves lipid and glucose levels; 3) Is well tolerated; and 4) That weight gain resumes 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_346399].39 We also concluded that MET’s effects might continue beyond 16 weeks, but noted 
there is a paucity of long -term studies.94   Although MET may be even m ore effective for prevention (i.e., 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 5 
 
 when MET is started concurrently with an SGA) rather than  intervention (i.e., participants were started 
on MET when on a stable dose of SGA), there have been only [ADDRESS_430410] study to directly examine differences in MET’s effectiveness for prevention 
vs. intervention for weight gain in youth taking SGAs. Only one trial has compared MET alone, placebo 
plus healthy lifestyle intervention, and MET plus healthy lifestyle intervention: Wu et al.95 reported 
significant weight reduction and improved glucose and insulin levels for combined MET plus healthy 
lifestyle intervention compared with either alone.95 Based on these  studies, the following 
recommendations were made:    1) The duration of future MET studies must be longer than 16 weeks to 
provide long -term efficacy data; 2) Larger studies are necessary to identify mediators and moderators; 3) 
Studies of MET in compariso n to or combined with other strategies is much needed; 4) Because not all 
patients respond to MET, it is necessary to study heterogeneity of treatment effects (i.e., who is the best 
candidate for MET).85,96,[ADDRESS_430411] a pragmatic trial that addresses each of these gaps in evidence by [CONTACT_346451] -term 
effectiveness of MET in obese and overweight youth with BSD, treated with SGAs in a community 
setting.  
 
C.  PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_346400]:  47 youth with a BMI > 85%ile and prescribed an SGA were treated with MET 
at CCHMC’s residential treatment facility, using a MET dose titrated to 850 mg 2x/day over 2 -4 weeks, 
with a further increase to 1000 mg 2x/day by [ADDRESS_430412] data from two groups of these MET -treated patients 
were analyzed (MS submitted for publication): Group 1 (SGA non -naïve) was taking SGAs for at least 2 
months (mean ± SD = 9.2 ± 7.2 mon ths, range= 2.3 - 24.9) prior to MET initiation (n=29, 47% girls, 
age=13.9 years ± 2.5); Group 2 (SGA naïve) started on MET and SGAs simultaneously (n=18; 59% girls, 
age=14.2 years + 2.8). The groups were similar, and, as in our previous report, 40% receiv ed > 1 
psychotropic medications. 80% of the SGA non -naïve patients had weight gain > 7% over the 2 months 
prior to MET initiation and exhibited a 0.45 sd increase in their BMI z score (Figure 1). Surprisingly, 
more of the SGA naïve (94%) than the SGA non -naïve (78%) patients had a BMI > 95%ile at MET 
initiation. BMI Z score was stabilized by [CONTACT_346452], but there was a significant group by [CONTACT_259167] (p=0.003, generalized linear model), even after controlling for the higher baseline BMI z sco re 
(p=0.002).

This group difference resulted in part from the immediate decrease in BMI z  score in the SGA naïve 
group (BMI z score decreased by 0.23). BMI z score of the SGA non - naïve group decreased by 0.27+0.5 
during the 6 months on MET. SGA naïve patients responded at lower MET doses than SGA non -naïve 
patients (764 ± 225 mg/d vs. 834 ± 2 85). Additional determinates of MET response were: 1) Higher 
baseline BMI z score (p<0.0001); 2) Longer length of SGA treatment prior to MET initiation (p=0.049); 
and, 3) A > 7% increase in weight over the 2 months prior to starting MET (p=0.0007). These d ata 
confirm our previous results that MET abrogates SGA -induced abnormal weight gain in youth and also 
adds concerning information that a larger proportion of youth on SGAs are affected by [CONTACT_346453].  
 
IMPACT Study:  Most recently,  [CONTACT_346485]  completed a large rigorously controlled NIMH -supported 
study of youth with psychiatric disorders and BMI > 85%ile and SGA -related weight gain. Participants 
were  randomized to 1 of 3 arms: 1) continuation of current SGA (control arm) (N=44); 2)  switch from 
current SGA to lower -risk agent (LRA) (N=30) or 3) co -treatment with MET + continuation of current 
SGA (MET) (N=46).  
 
Sample characteristics were as follows:  Age: 13.7 (7.6 -19.9; <18=88%) Male=65% Hispanic:12% Black: 
28%. At 12 and 24 weeks t here was a significant decrease in BMI Z -scores in the MET ( -0.034, -0.088, 
respectively) and LRA ( -0.051, -0.112) groups compared with the control group ([PHONE_7184], [PHONE_7185]). 
Additionally, at [ADDRESS_430413], the MET group had an average decrease of -0.4lbs. 14.9% in the MET lost >5% of weight 
compared to 2.3% in the control group and 10.0% in the LRA group (Fisher’s exact, p=0.059). 
Importantly, dropout  rates in the LRA (39%) and c ontrol (28%) groups were higher than in the MET 
(24%) group. The most common (58%) reason for discontinuation in the LRA group was “inadequate 
therapeutic effect.”  
 
These findings confirm those of prior studies, including our own.36,[ADDRESS_430414] been conducted in academic settings, typi[INVESTIGATOR_346401]. Findings 
from  such studies may not be generalizable to BSD youth treated in community settings where access to 
these interventions (e.g. healthy  lifestyle strategies and medications) is often limited. Moreover, patient -
centered outcomes were not assessed in these studies.

E. EXPRIMENTAL DESIGN & METHODS  
a. Methods and Procedures  
 
Study Overview : We propose a prospective, large, PRAGMATIC , randomized trial to study the impact 
of MET and healthy lifestyle intervention (LIFE) vs. LIFE alone on patient -centered outcomes of body 
weight, SGA -adherence and satisfaction, psychiatric symptom burden (e.g. m ood/anxiety), and QoL. We 
will also examine metabolic outcomes.  
 
The focus of the pragmatic trial is to determine which intervention is most effective through observation 
of care as usual conditions or in “real -world clinical settings” rather than under c ontrolled experimental 
circumstances.  Information should be collected when available as part of routine clinical practice rather 
than through study -specific procedures, with minimal interference to clinical practice. Adherence to 
protocol recommendations from practitioners and patients are observed and documented throughout the 
study.   
 
  
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 8 
 
 Subjects:  We propose to recruit approximately 1800 overweight/obese  youth with  BSD who are 
prescribed SGAs from at least 40 public and private mental health practices (approximately [ADDRESS_430416] coordinating center ), to participate in the proposed patient -
centered large pragmatic tr ial examining the effectiveness of MET and LIFE vs. LIFE alone. Patients will 
be eligible  for study participation if they are: 
   
1. Inpatient  or outpatient age  8-19 years  inclusive ; participants must live with a parent, guardian, or 
caregiver;  
2. Fluent in English;  
3. Diagnosed  or told by a clinician  that they have any of the following bipolar  spectrum  disorders 
(BSD): bipolar  I, bipolar  II, unspecified bipolar and related disorders,  Disruptive Mood 
Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), cyclothymic  disorder , other specified  bipolar and related 
disorders, as well as mood disorder not otherwise specified (if diagnosed in the past as per DSM -
IV);  
4. Body  mass  index >85%ile  for age and sex by [CONTACT_346454];  
5. Received  a new or ongoing  prescription  for at least one SGA (i.e., olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
risperidone, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], ziprasidone, iloperidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_346402] ) that is not prescribed as a PRN medication  
 
Additionally, patients will be excluded by [CONTACT_716]:   
 
1. Patients will be excluded if they have had exposure to a total daily dose of MET [ADDRESS_430417] 3 months;  
2. Patients will be excluded if they could not tolerate MET during the recommended titration 
schedule outlined in the pr otocol;  
3. Major  neurological  or medical  illnesses  that affect  weight  gain (e.g., unstable thyroid disease) or 
require a systemic medication that might impact weight or gluco se regulation (e.g., diabetes 
mellitus [insulin], chronic renal failure [steroids]);  
4. If lab results are available in the last 6 months, then a fasting serum glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL on two 
occasions prior to or during screening, indicating need for prompt treatment.  
5. If lab results are available in the last 6 months, then a serum creatinine ≥1. 3 mg/dL on two 
occasions during screening and/or follow -up, indicating potential impairment of renal functioning  
6. Pregnant or breast feeding;  
7. Based on their clinician’s assessment, children and caregivers who are unable to complete 
screening/baseline assess ments for any reason;  
 
The enrollment rate will be approximately 1-2 patients/month/site for a recruitment time of 57 months.  
 
Randomization:  We will randomize 1800 patients ( 1:1 ratio) to either MET + LIFE or LIFE alone. All 
patients will receive a lifestyle intervention (LIFE) of brief standardized education. Once a patien t is 
determined to meet the above criteria and has provided  appropriate informed consent /assent , site staff will 
assign the participant a  patient ID num ber. The site staff will then log on to the study’s REDCap site and 
enter the Patient ID, and the following stratification factors: site, overweight or obese, previous SGA 
exposure, and sex of patient (transgendered patients will be randomized acco rding to  sex assigned at 
birth) . REDCap has a built in mechanism that prevents duplication of subject ID numbers.  
 
Once all stratification factors have been entered, the REDCap randomization module will return the next 
assignment for the appropriate strata.

 OUTCOME MEASURES:  
Due to MOBILITY being a pragmatic and largely observational study, any participant who is deemed 
eligible by [CONTACT_346455] . These criteria,  along with providing 
appropriate informed consent/assent, are th e necessary criteria for participation in MOBILITY. We will 
continue to collect data in a naturalistic manner from all patients who have met these criteria regardless of 
whether they begin the intervention to wh ich they have been randomized or have not attended a ll of their  
clinical follow up appointment s. Patients will  have follow -up study visits and data collected concurrent 
with their existing CLINICAL visit schedule .   
 
Primary  Outcome  Measure:  BMI z -score  will be computed  from measurement of height and  weight. 
Raw BMI  is calculated  as (weight  (kg)/ height  (m)2). Normalized  BMI (z-score,  adjusted  for age and sex),  
will be calculated  using  the program  provided  by [CONTACT_346456]/ARS  Children’s  Nutrition  Research  Center at  
Baylor  College  of Medicine  (http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/bodycomp/bmiz2.html).  At each site weight  will be 
measured with  a Seca scale, model  813, calibrated  to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_430418]  0.1 kg. Height will be 
measured  with a wall-secured  stadiometer.  The stadiometer is not required to be calibrated as stated by 
[CONTACT_346457] . Height will be measured  without  shoes  while  standing  on a flat surface  with 
chin parallel  to the floor. The patient’s  height  will be recorded  to the nearest 0.1 cm. 
 
 
Secondary  Outcome  Measures:  
Metabolic  Health  and Nutrition : As per clinical  standards,  blood  pressure  will be measured  after 5 
minutes  of sitting  at each patient visit.  A minimum of 8-hour fasting  total cholesterol, low -density  
lipoprotein  (LDL) -cholesterol, high  density  lipoprotein  (HDL) -cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose,  insulin,  
and glycosylated  hemoglobin  (HbA1c)  will be recommended for collect ion (see Table  2). For HTE  
analyses  the homeostatic  model  assessment  for insulin -resistance  (HOMA -IR) will be computed  as: 
(Insulin  [IU/mL] x Glucose  [mg/dL]  /405).  Following  the modified  ATPI[INVESTIGATOR_346403],130-132 metabolic  
syndrome is  defined  when  >3 of the following:  1) abdominal  obesity  (BMI  >90%ile,  as in NHANES  study  
of metabolic  syndrome  in youth133
; 2) blood  pressure  >90%ile  for height,  age, sex; 3) fasting  triglycerides  
>150 mg/dL; 4) low  HDL  cholesterol  (males  <40 mg/dL  and for females  <50 mg/dL);  5) fasting  glucose  
>100 mg/dL  Fulfillment of individual  criteria  and metabolic  syndrome  will be outcome  measure s. 
 
Adherence  and Treatment Satisfaction  Outcomes:  
Self-Reported  Adherence  and Barriers:  Caregivers  and children  will answer  standardized  questions  related  
to adherence  and adherence  barriers  to taking  SGAs,  MET  (if applicable),  and LIFE.  Information  on 
missed  and partial  doses  of each medication  in the past week  will be ascertained. Questions  prefaced  by 
[CONTACT_105]-judgmental  language  that normalizes  non-adherence  to treatment will  be used. A time period  of one 
week  will be used to maximize  respondent recall  and minimize  memory  decay.  
 
MEMS®6 TrackCap /SimpleMed Pi[INVESTIGATOR_346404] : The Medication Event  Monitoring Systems  (MEMS)  [AARDEX 
Corporation]  and the SimpleMEd Pi[INVESTIGATOR_346405] s that measure  the dosing  
histories  of oral medications. They  will be used to monitor  adherence  to SGAs  or MET  in a sub-sample  of 
[ADDRESS_430419]  plastic  vial or box  with a threaded  opening  and 
a closure  for the vial that contains  a micro -electronic  circuit to register the dates  and times  the 
bottle /pi[INVESTIGATOR_346406].  Data from the MEMS  TrackCap  will be downloaded  at each study  
visit. Patients randomized at an inpatient site to MEMS monitoring will only receive this monitoring if 
they are scheduled to be followed at an outpatient site that was selected for MEMS monitoring; otherwise, 
the MEMS aspect of the randomization should be disregarded.

International Physical  Activity  Questionnaires (IPAQ):140 The IPAQ is  an instrument  for cross -national 
monitoring  of physical  activity  and inactivity  with good  reliability  and validity  for monitoring  population  
levels  of physical  activity  in diverse  settings to assess  adherence  to LIFE  physical  activity  
recommendations.  
 
We will also assess food choices and eating habits using questions selected from the Healthworks Nutrition 
Screener, Satiety and Food Responsiveness using items from the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and 
Uncontrolled Eating and Cognitive Restraint using items from the 3 -factor Eating Questionnaire.167-168  
 
Psychiatric  Outcome  Measures:   
PROMIS  (Patient -Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information  System) measures undergo  a 
standardized,  extensive  measure  development  process  which  includes  literature  review,  expert meetings,  
qualitative  interviews  with families,  item development,  cognitive  testing  of the item content, confirmatory  
factor analyses  to establish  construct validity,  and item response  theory  to establish  psychometric  
properties.  We will use items from the validated  short -form assessments  of Anxiety,  Depression  and Anger 
as well as Global  Health  and Peer Relationships  (the latter two  are HRQoL instruments;  see next section).  
 
PROMIS  Anxiety  Short  Form : focuse s on fear (e.g.,  fearfulness), anxious  misery  (e.g., worry),  and 
hyperarousal  (e.g.,  nervousness).  Marginal  Cronbach's  α > 0.85 
 
PROMIS  Depression  Short Form : focuse s on negative  mood  (e.g.,  sadness),  anhedonia  (e.g.,  loss of 
interest), negative  views  of the self (e.g.,  worthlessness,  low self-esteem), and  negative  social  cognition  
(e.g., loneliness,  interpersonal  alienation).  Marginal  Cronbach's  α > 0.85 
 
PROMIS  Anger  Short  Form : assess es angry  moods  (e.g.,  irritability  and reactivity)  and aggression  (verbal  
and physical).  Marginal  Cronbach's  α > 0.80 
 
Clinical Global  Impressions  Scale -Severity  (CGI -S): Single -item assessments  of symptom severity. 
Severity  is rated  from  1 (not at all ill) to 7 (among  the most  severely  ill patients).  
 
Young  Mania  Rating  Scale  (YMRS):   11-item clinician -rated  instrument that  assesses  symptoms  of 
mania.  
 
Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) -Revised selected items:  a clinician -rated scale used for 
assessing severity of depression and change in depressive symptoms.  
 
Quality  of Life (QoL) and  Functional Outcomes:  We will ask patients  and caregivers  the number of 
days that they  missed  from  school  and work, respectively,  in the last month  and will use items from the 
following scales:  
 
PROMIS  Global  Health: assesses  physical,  mental,  and social  health.  Cronbach's  α=0.88.  
 
PROMIS Peer Relationships : measures  understanding  and communication;  companionship;  and quality,  
reciprocity,  and size of patients’  social  network  Cronbach's  α> 0.80.  
 
Children's  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS) : A single -item index  of overall  functional  capacity. Scores  
range  from  1 (indicating  severe  impairment)  to 100 (indicating  superior  functioning).  
 
Sizing Me Up & Sizing  Them  Up: self-report  and parent -proxy  measures of obesity -specific  HRQoL  for 
youth,  with subscales  measuring  Emotional,  Physical  and School  Functioning, Teasing/  Marginalization,  
Positive  Social  Attributes, Mealtime  Challenges, and  Social  Distress/Avoidance,  and a Total  QoL score.  
Excellent  documented  internal  consistency,  test-retest reliability  and convergent  validity.  
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 11 
 
 Body  Weight, Image  and Self-esteem Evaluation  (B-WISE®) : scale  designed  to capture  and quantify  
weight satisfaction, ability  to control  food intake, self -esteem and  other the psychosocial  consequences  of 
weight  gain,  scored  on a 3-point  Likert scale  from 1 (never) -3 (all the time), Cronbach’s  α=0.79.    
 
Caregiver  Strain  Questionnaire -Short  Form  7 (CGSQ -SF7) : Routine  assessment  of objective  and 
subjective  internalized  caregiver  strain,  scored  on a 5-point  Likert scale  from  1 (not at all)-5 (very  much  a 
problem),  with good validity  and reliability.  
 
Laboratory Measures:  
Site staff will collect and report  any lab  results that are obtained as part of the patient ’s clinical care .  
Laboratory test s will be suggested according to clinical practice guidelines, but will not  be require d for 
patients enrolled in MOBILITY, with the exception of a pregnancy test for all girls who have reached  
menarch e and who are randomized to metformin.   Additionally, since patients receive their treatment at 
mental health treatment facilities throughout the country and MOBILITY is a pragmatic study, patients 
may have laboratory tests performed at any laboratory facilit y that they typi[INVESTIGATOR_346407]. We will collect the re sults of the laboratory te sts once they are available in  medical 
records. Therefore, we will not require CLIA certificates or other regulatory documents for each 
laboratory facility. Table 2 (at intervals that reflect standard clinical care) indicates the recommended lab 
measures according to practice guidelines.   
 
Other outcome measures :   
 
Patient Health Questionaire -9 (Item 9):152 Assesses current suicidality; 0 (not at all), 3 (nearly every day) 
scale.  
Zucker Hillside Side Effects Form:119,153 Assesses  intensity (1=not present, 4=severe) of adverse events in 
five domains  (behavioral, neurological, cardiovascular, autonomic, GI side effects) . Open ended AE 
(adverse event) questions  at every visit . 
 
STUDY SCHEDULE AND TREATMENT  
Since MOBILITY  is a pragmatic  study , we will collect the above information, when possible, and in 
conjunction with patients’ clinical visits. We will allow for data collection approximately monthly for the 
first three months, followed by [CONTACT_346458], for a  total duration of [ADDRESS_430420] a copy of the MOBILITY Projected Visit Dates Spreadsheet (also found on the 
website:  MOBILITYstudy.org). The site coordinator will enter the patient’s baseline visit date w here 
indicated, and the recommended visit schedules will auto-populate.  However, once patients are 
randomized at baseline, MOBILITY is primarily an observational pragmatic study, therefore, data will be 
collected only at clinical appointments.  
 
Screening/Baseline  Procedures:  At screening and following informed consent/assent and review of initial 
study criteria, we will obtain demographic and clinical information as follows:  
 
Demographic  and Clinical  Characteristics : Site staff will record  patients’  date of birth, sex, type  of 
insurance,  contact [CONTACT_3031],  and prior type  and duration  of psychiatric  treatments. Patients  will report  
current  daily  nicotine  intake  (packs/day)  and whether they  currently  use other drugs  (checking  all that 
apply from  a list of common  drugs).  Data on treatments  and substance  use will also be collected  at six-
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 12 
 
 month  intervals.  
 
Screening  laboratory  tests recommended  include  renal  and hepatic  function  tests,  electrolytes, CBC and 
thyroid  stimulating  hormone  (TSH),  as per Table  2. However, we will collect any  results  of labs performed  
within  the last six months,  if available.  The only mandatory  test for screening will be  a pregnancy test in 
girls of menarche .  
 
Every attempt will be made to encourage clinicians to obtain laboratory testing prior to starting 
metformin, however, patients who have not had baseline labs will continue to be followed  in MOBILITY .    
 
Kiddie -SADS -Present and Lifetime  (K-SADS -PL 2013) :  After discussion  with our patient/parent partners  
and site clinicians,  we determined  that the appropriate  study  population  is all patients  who receive  a 
clinical  diagnosis  of a BSD,  as these  patients  will typi[INVESTIGATOR_346408].  However,  it was decided  that using  a structured  research  interview  would  
provide  an opportunity  to examine  concordance  of clinical  and research  diagnoses  and to assess  HTE  (i.e., 
do youth  with a research  diagnosis  respond  to MET  differently  than those  with only a clinical  diagnosis  
because  risk for overweight/obesity  and metabolic  disorder may  be higher for those  with a research  BSD  
diagnosis).  Therefore,  BSD  diagnoses  will be confirmed  with the mood  modules  of the K-SADS -PL, a 
semi-structured  diagnostic  interview with established  test-retest  reliability.128 
(Interviewers  will be trained  
by [CONTACT_5944]. Trained  staff at the  respective  coordinating  centers  who are not associated  with the 
clinical  sites will administer the interview  separately  to guardians  and patients , if > 12 years  old). Based  
on feedback  from  the clinical  sites,  we determined  that having  their staff administer the K-SAD S-PL 
might create  diagnostic  confusion, therefore,  we will develop  a mechanism  that clinicians  will be provided 
with the  K-SADS -PL diagnoses  after participants have reached Month 6 of study participation . 
 
 
Type  and duration  of current/prior  SGA  treatment  and weight  
gain during  SGA treatment : Prior  data suggest that the effect  
of MET  may depend  on the extent  of weight  gain during  SGA  
treatment prior to study  entry.   Site personnel  will document  
weight and  height prior to any SGA  treatment, specific  SGAs  
received  and duration  of treatment with  each (i.e., by  
[CONTACT_346459]). For a priori  analyses  of potential  
heterogeneity  of treatment  effect (HTE),  we will then 
distinguish  SGA -naïve  patients  (no current  or prior  SGA  
treatment  as of baseline  visit)  versus  those  with any current or 
prior  SGA  treatment.  Within  the latter group, we will 
compute  change  in BMI z-score  from  the start of SGA  
treatment  until baseline  and perform  HTE  analyses  to 
determine  whether  MET  effectiveness  varies  based  on the 
duration  of SGA treatment  and/or amount of excess  (relative  
to normal  development)  weight  gained  during  treatment.  
 
Classification  system  for psychotropic  treatments : We anticipate  substantial  variation  in the specific  
psychotropic  medication  regimens  prescribed  at baseline,  and that these  treatments  will vary over time. 
SGAs  may be prescribed  singly  or in combination  at varying  doses, and concomitant treatment with  
antidepressants,  non-SGA  mood  stabilizers  (e.g.,  divalproex  and lithium)  and/or stimulants  (e.g., for the 
subset  of patients  with co-morbid  ADHD)  will also be common. For our a priori  analyses  of potential  
HTE depending  on pharmacologic  treatments  other  than MET, we have reduced  this large  set of options  to 
three  groups  based  on available  data regarding  their weight effects.  Our data will provide  considerable  
additional  observational  evidence  about the  impact of specific  regimens,  and we will conduct  detailed  
analyses  that may  suggest  useful  post-hoc alternative classifications.1,129

Note  that we have not incorporated  dose effects  because  dose-dependent  weight  gain has not been 
consistently  demonstrated  for most SGAs.  We will examine  association  of dose and dose adjustments  with 
weight change  and other outcomes, though  exploratory  analyses  of such observational  relationships  will 
require  careful  consideration  of confounding  factors.

 Table  2. Schedule  of Events.  
The Table of Events is an approximation for when routine clinic visits might occur. In order to adhere to 
the pragmatic nature of the study, data will only be collected during the patient’s regularly scheduled 
clinical visits and a p articipant should not be brought in exclusively to conduct study specific visits.   No 
specific study labs  will be m andated for study participation, with the exception noted above (i.e., 
pregnancy test)  The lab  tests noted in the Schedule of Events are suggested in accordance with clinical 
practice guidelines for patients receiving SGAs.

Our population will be > 85%ile  BMI (weight of such 8- and 9 year-olds will likely be comparable  to an  
average  10-year-old child); 2) MET has  a favorable side  effect profile;  and 3) prior  reports  as well as the 
investigators’ previous  experiences  with the safe and well-tolerated use of MET  in patients > [ADDRESS_430423] a renal panel prior to starting MET  to evaluate  for renal impairment that 
would  preclude use  of MET.   
 
Participants  randomized  to treatment  with MET  will start at a recommended dose of 500 mg orally  at 
night  and slowly titrated  in 2-week  intervals  to ensure  that each  patient achieves  maximum  insulin -
sensitizing  effects  of the drug while  minimizing  the chance  of side effects  (see Table  1). We selected  50kg  
as the weight  at which  we felt comfortable  increasing  to a maximum total  daily  dose of 2000mg  (1000mg  
twice  daily). These  youth  will be at a low-end adult -comparable  weight.  We anticipate  that most  
participants  >10 years  old will be >50kg, which  is the 95%ile  for weight for 10-year-olds of both sexes.

and strategy, in general, MET will be at steady -state target levels well before key outcomes are assessed at 
Month 6. We will also recommend that  MET be taken with food to minimize side effects. If a part icipant’s 
BMI percentile <5% (=underweight ) his/her treatment with MET will be discontinued . Although the risk of 
low vitamin B12 while taking MET is associated with age > [ADDRESS_430426] be willing to be randomized to either treatment arm . However , the clinician 
may choose to initiate or continue (for those on a subtherapeutic  dose) metformin at their clinical 
discretion regardless of randomization  following a recommended initial 3 month period of treatment . 
These patients’ data will be considered in a different analytic group regardless of randomization.   
 
Comparators:  Health y Lifestyle Intervention (LIFE): This healthy lifestyle intervention (LIFE) consists 
of introducing  participants and families to a healthy eating plan  and physical activity. Prior to study 
initiation, study site staff will participate in a live (or taped) training session from a dietician to become 
educated with LIFE. At baseline visit p atients and caregivers will watch a standardized video about LIFE  
that was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Siegel  and his group.  The video  explains the concept of a Traffic Light Plan 
(TLP) that is a classification system for food and activity (GREEN, YELLOW, RED) . This plan  
encourages participants to limit RED foods (high -calorie, low -nutrient) and RED activity (sedentary), 
replacing them w ith GREEN foods (low -calorie, high -nutrient) and GREEN activity (moderate -to-high 
intensity). Participants will also receive a Food Reference Guide and Activity Reference Guide, 
categorizing food and activities in the TLP framework  that was adapted  from th e Healthworks! Youth 
Fitness [ADDRESS_430427] 150 
minutes/week of physical ac tivity will be recommended.  A link to the  LIFE  video and all handouts  will 
be available on the study websites at www.mobilitystudy.org   and offers a standardized, home -based 
exercise component for patients. At follow -up visits , patients and car egivers will have the option to watch 
the video again, and s tudy staff will briefly reinforce nutritional guidance, remind participants about the 
need for 150 minutes of physical activity/week, and be available to answer a ny general questions on 
healthy lifestyle habits. Prior studies indicate that 33% of youth will decrease BMI with this LIFE 
intervention.67    
 
b. Data Analysis and Data Monitoring :  
Drs. Welge and Huang  will conduct and/or supervise and have final responsibility for all analyses. Drs. 
Modi and Carle will conduct and/or supervise portions of the analysis that fall under their specific areas 
of expertise. Under the direction of the senior statistical team, [CONTACT_346486], [CONTACT_346487] and [CONTACT_238925] will carry 
out portions of the programming and analysis, which will begin within 6 months of the start of the trial 
(see Milestones). Analysis of short -term data will be complete by [CONTACT_24473]  68 (when the last patient will 
have been followed for six months), and analysis of the long -term data will be completed by [CONTACT_24473] 69 
(when all 24 - month follow -up will be complete), which will allow graphical and tabular summaries and 
narrative interpretation of the results to be completed by  [CONTACT_43380] 72. No interim efficacy analyses or 
adaptive features are planned. Model fitting performed before all outcome data are available will be 
provisional, for the purpose of verifying code and making limited modeling decisions (e.g., determining 
from ear ly data whether parameters, such as residual variance or scale reliability, may vary among 
subgroups). The Data Management and Biostatistics Committee will receive regular updates on progress 
in completing the statistical analysis plan, discuss any additio nal or modified analyses, and report to the 
Steering Committee as necessary.   
 
Data Analyses:  MOBILITY will use REDCap154 for patient -reported outcomes. REDCap is a software  
toolset and workflow methodology for collection and management of clinical researc h data developed by 
[CONTACT_50222], in collaboration with institutional partners including the University of Cincinnati 
Academic Health Center. This secure, flexible, web -based application provides: 1) an intuitive interface 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 17 
 
 for data entry and real time validation (e.g., automated data type and range checks); 2) HIPAA -compliant 
and 21 CFR Part 11 - ready audit trails for tracking data manipulation and exports; 3) record locking and 
electronic signature [CONTACT_297079]; 4) control of view/edit rights; 5) a t ool for reporting, monitoring and 
querying patient records; and 6) automated export to common statistical packages. REDCap is hosted on a 
network specially designed to support the rigorous security and compliance requirements of clinical 
research projects.   Administered by [CONTACT_346460], this network 
features multiple firewalls and a central facility for managing hosted systems and users, creating another 
layer of access control and audit capability on top of what REDCap alrea dy provides (e.g., user access can 
be monitored and controlled at the network level without making any changes within REDCap itself). 
These capabilities are available to authorized network administrators and REDCap study owners only, 
and user access change s are documented by [CONTACT_165247].  The data management team will monitor the 
database throughout the study to assure that data are complete and accurate.  
 
 
Analyses of Specific Aims : Each specific aim involves assessment of domains that are hypothesized t o 
be affected by [CONTACT_346461]. Our approach to potential HTE 
distinguishes effect moderators from mediators of distal outcomes. Moderators include fixed patient 
characteristics and pre -treatment covariates values.  Mediators include variables that are hypothesized to 
be affected by [CONTACT_346462]. We will utilize  generali zed 
linear mixed models (GLMM), which allow  for outcomes  from a range of distributions and will include 
random effects  to account for unspecified causes of variation among sites and patients , and subgroup -
specific coefficients to assess HTE .  
 
The basic model for outcomes will be a GLMM with change from baseline to either [ADDRESS_430428] terms for randomized treatment 
group (MET), baseline value of the outcome, and random site effects. For HTE analyses, a baseline value -
by-MET interaction (to assess HTE due to baseline status) will be included, and for particular domains 
additional continuous or categorical covariates and treatment -by-covariate interaction terms will be added 
to assess HTE. Outcomes within each domain will share the same set of HTE terms, specified in the 
Specific Aims.   Because the subgroups are in general correlated (e.g., duration of SGA treatment, weight 
gain history and psychotropic weight burden will be correlated with baseline BMI), we will include 
multiple first -order HTE terms simultaneously (to assess heterogen eity independently attributable to each 
moderator), but will also fit separate models for each term to gauge the impact of this correlation on our 
conclusions. Higher -order treatment -by-covariate interactions will not be included a priori, but will be 
explored with rigorous adjustment for multiple testing, using step -down testing (removing highest -order 
interaction terms first) or information criteria based on penalized likelihoods to guide model selection.   
 
Marginal Structural Modeling for Causal Inference:  SA1 concerns the overall and sub -group specific 
effects of MET on abrogation of weight gain (with changes in BMI z -score from baseline as outcomes) 
and metabolic health, particularly metabolic syndrome and its component criteria. BMI and adheren ce 
measures are obtained at all study visits, so our models for these measures will use all available 
observations by [CONTACT_346463]. We will use margi nal structural models156 to address this bi -
directional dependence, computing the probability of SGA treatment regimen change at each visit within 
weight gain treatment regimen groups and using appropriately normalized versions of the inverse of the 
probab ility as the stabilized weights.  
 
Adjustment of Self -Reported Adherence:  Adherence rates for self -report and MEMS (where available) 
will be calculated as number of treatments/day divided by [CONTACT_346464]. 
Truncated MEMs adherence rates (maximum of 100%) will be used in analyses to reduce inflation as a 
result of overuse or extra openings due to prescription refills. This method has been used successfully in 
studies assessing electronic monitoring (EM) adherence.157,158 Self-reported adherence vastly 
underestimates adherence as measured by [CONTACT_46107].159 While it  is not feasible to use EM for all patients and 
medications, we will use the statistical relationship between EM and self -reported adherence in a 
subsample of 300 patients (equal numbers per treatment group,  i.e., 100 for SGA  adherence  who are also 
taking MET, 100 for SGA adherence who are not taking MET, and 100  for MET  adherence, who are  
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 18 
 
 randomly selected the 8 randomization strata) to estimate EM adherence from self -report in the remaining 
patients. We will regress EM adherence on self -reports, using sta ndard diagnostics to ensure that non -
linearity, heterogeneity of variance across the range of adherence, or subgroup -specific regression 
relationships are included as needed. Predictions that accurately reflect the residual uncertainty can then 
be generate d by [CONTACT_111012], and the resulting complete -sample datasets will be used in primary 
analyses involving SGA adherence, with sensitivity assessed by [CONTACT_346465] -report 
directly.  
Data and Safety Monitoring plan : The Cincinnati site will provide an independent certified study data 
monitor who will visit each site prior to study initiation and approximately  every 6 months thereafter. The 
monitor will follow a monitoring plan that includes source data verifying and ensuring compliance w ith 
good clinical practices (GCPs), the IRB -approved protocol and other applicable regulatory guidelines, and 
will report any problems to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_346412].  Additionally, adherence to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, completion  of scheduled assessments, withdrawal/termination procedures, 
and maintenance of training and certification for all research personnel will be continuously monitored. 
The monitor will provide written recommendations following each visit to each site. All r eports will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_346466].  
 
Safety and tolerability data will be monitored by [CONTACT_139809] (DSMB), 
the study investigators,  and the CCHMC and NS/LIJ IRBs. The function of the DSMB is to prot ect the 
safety of the study participants. The DSMB members are: Tobias Gerhard, PhD, pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_346413]; Avraham Goldstein, adult diagnosed with BSD as an adolescent; Robert Parker , 
PhD, biostatistician;  Boris Birmaher, MD, child psychiatrist;  David Repaske, MD,  pediatric 
endocrinologist; and  Robert  Gard iner, parent of youth with BSD. Members will disclose and resolve any 
potential conflicts of interest prior to each meeting.  
 
At their initial meeting (pr ior to study initiation), the DSMB members will select a Chair, who will 
provide written meeting minutes and recommendations and will review the study protocol and consent 
forms for safety and validity. Biannually, they will evaluate whether recruitment go als are being met and 
monitor the occurrence of adverse events and early withdrawals or terminations. All serious adverse 
events will be reported to the site’s  IRB and the DSMB within 7 days of knowledge of occurrence  and 
will be followed until resolution,  permanent outcome of the event, or stabilization. The DSMB will 
provide recommendations based on this review (e.g., to terminate the study or recommend modifications, 
including additional safety or tolerability measures). Dr. DelBello, in conjunction with  the DSMB, will be 
responsible for ensuring that DSMB reports are filed with the IRBs and PCORI. The DSMB will also 
provide the investiga tor with a summary report that includes their recommendations. Adverse event 
reports will be collected systematically a t patient visits, any rated as severe will be documented and 
reported. All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_346467] . 
 
c. Data Storage and Confidentiality :  
Information will be obtain ed from clinical assessments and confidential HIPAA compliant online 
questionnaires that will be completed on the tablet. Access to activate tablets will be limited to study staff 
and password protected. Patient and their caregivers will confirm their iden tity by [CONTACT_49419] a personal 
security question at the end of each session. Specific materials obtained in the study will include patient 
and caregiver reports from behavioral, adherence, treatment satisfaction and QOL assessment tools.  
 
Other information, such as medical history and clinician symptom ratings also will be collected by [CONTACT_346468]/or medical records or directly entered into password protected online 
databases by [CONTACT_346469]/caregivers. The following samp les will be collected: urine in girls 
for a pregnancy test, if they confirm menarche . As recommended in  standard clinical practice an 8 -hour 
fasting blood draw for serum glucose, insulin, liver function tests, renal panel (including electrolytes), 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, [ADDRESS_430429] will be given to parents of minors at the 
discretion of the clinician. Blood pressure, and anthropometrics including height, weight, BMI, and BMI 
%ile will be recorded.  
 
As with any study, there is a po tential risk of loss of confidentiality. Consistent with the Federal 
guidelines, all patients and guardians will be informed of the federally mandated reporting laws for child 
abuse and neglect, verbally and in the written consent form. Therefore, if abuse  or neglect is suspected the 
Department of Human Services will be called. Risks associated with this include embarrassment, legal 
consequences, and removal of the child from the parents’/legal guardians’ home.  
 
d. Setting : Assessments will be conducted at the participating  community -based private and public 
mental health treatment centers in the East Coast and Midwest Regions .  The participating site personnel 
will be made up of a real -world clinical trial team that includes members with varied training an d 
experience with appropriate support from a qualified physician and centralized study trial team.  Site staff 
who will be  obtaining informed consent, reviewing medication lists,  and collecting and assessing adverse 
events must complete Human Participants Protection and Good Clinical Practice (HPP and GCP) training 
prior to involvement in the study .  These essential study staff will be documented via a site specific 
delegation of authority (DOA) log . DOA logs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_346470].  
 
e. Laboratory methods and facilities : Participants will be sent for blood work , at the clinician’s 
discretion , to any l aboratory facility.  No specific laboratory  test will be mandate d, as it is expected that 
laboratory procedures will take place in settings where everyday care happens, such as community clinics, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_346414].  It is recommended that clinicians adhere to practice guidelines and labs are 
ordered through the patient's medical practice by [CONTACT_25240].    
 
f. Estimated Period of Time to Complete the Study :  The following is a timeline for the 72-month 
period of the proposed study: Months 1 -2: Train study personnel; Months 3 -57: Recruit an average of 
approximately  1-2 patients/site/month from [ADDRESS_430430] 25% of the sample recruited by M10 -11; 50% recruited by M30 ; 75% by M45 and the 
final patient recruited by M57 ; Months 34-68: Complete su bject participation, data entry, and analyses.  
Final analyses will be completed M70- after the last patients have completed 6 and 24 months of follow -
up. 
 
F. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
a. Description of Subjects  
We will recruit a total of 180 0 youth,  (approximately 900 each from ~[ADDRESS_430431] sites  and ~[ADDRESS_430432]  mental health treatment sites) to participate in the proposed patient -centered large pragmatic trial 
examining the effectiveness of MET and LIFE vs. LIFE alone. Subjects will be eligible  to enroll and 
randomize  if they are ages 8 -19 years old  (inclusive ) at the time of screening , overweight or obese (BMI 
> 85%), continuing or starting treatment with at least one SGA (i.e., olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, 
quetiapin e, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], zipr asidone, i loperidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, or asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) , have a clinical 
diagnosis of BSD (bipolar I or II disorder, cyclothymia, or bipolar or mood not otherwise specified , or 
other specified bipolar  or mood  disorder ) and are living at home with the ir caregivers . 
 
Based on feedback from our advisory board and our consultants including children and adolescents who 
are in state custody is essential so that our sample is not biased as SGA exposure in this population is 
extremely high, Therefore, we will  allow children and adolescents  who are under the custody of DHS  to 
enroll.  We will seek the approval of a legally authorized individual from the county (e.g. Hamilton or 
Butler ). This may be the county  caseworker or it may be their supervisor. It will NOT be the case 
manager from the private agency that is handling the placement. But, the private agency case manager 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 20 
 
 will know who the appointed county JFS social worker. The foster parent(s) will NOT have  the authority 
to authorize enrollment into a research study. We will  need the foster parent(s) ’ approval  to ensure that 
study visits will be attended and compliance with study requirements is manageable.  Consents may be 
faxed  for signature  [CONTACT_346483].  A fully signed copy 
of the consents will be offered back to JFS after the consenting process occurs.       
 
For youth  who reside in Northern KY and are in the custody of the Cabinet for the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, we will obtain  the permission of the assigned Cabinet Social Worker who is assigned to the 
individual. That person will determine if they have the authority to grant permission for participation or 
whether they need to  seek higher approval .  
 
For youth in the custody of [LOCATION_001] City foster care, the investigator will submit a proposal along with 
our IRB approval and relevant consent forms to the Administration for Children’s Services  (ACS).  ACS 
will review, process, and approve the proposal. Once approved the proposal will go to the State Office of 
Children and Family Services  (OCFS) for their review and approval . 
 
b. Sample Size  
Eighteen hundred (1800) children  will participate in th e study. Each site will enroll up to 90 participant’s 
total or  1-2 participants/month for a total study enrollment period of 57 months (some sites completed 
regulatory requirements well into the recruitment period)  
 
c. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Inpatient  or outpatient age  8-19 years  inclusive ; participants must live with a  parent, guardian, or 
caregiver;  
2. Fluent in English;  
3. Diagnosed  or told by a clinician  that they have any of the following bipolar  spectrum  disorder s 
(BSD) : bipolar  I, bipolar  II, unspecified bipolar and related disorders , Disruptive Mood 
Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), cyclothymic  disorder , other specified  bipolar and related 
disorders , as well as mood disorder not otherwise specified (if diagnosed in the past as per DSM -
IV);  
4. Body  mass  index >85%ile  for age and sex by [CONTACT_346454];  
5. Received  a new or ongoing  prescription  for at least one SGA  (i.e., olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
risperidone, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], ziprasidone, il operidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_346415] ) that is not prescribed as a PRN medication ;   
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients will be excluded if they have had exposure to a total daily dose of MET [ADDRESS_430433] 3 months ; 
2. Patients will be excluded if they could not tolerate MET during the recommended titration 
schedule outlined in the protocol ; 
3. Major  neurological  or medical  illnesses  that affect  weight  gain (e.g., unstable thyroid disease) or 
require a systemic medication that might impact weight or glucose regulation (e.g., diabetes 
mellitus [insulin], chronic renal failure [steroids]);  
4. If lab results are available in the last 6 months, then a fasting serum glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL on [ADDRESS_430434] 6 months, then a serum creatinine ≥1.3 mg/dL on 2 
occasions during screening and/or follow -up, indicating potential impairment of renal functioning  
6. Pregnant or breast  feeding;  
7. Based on their clinician’s assessment, c hildren and caregivers who are unable to complete 
screening/baseline assessmen ts for any reason ; 
 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, [ADDRESS_430435] kidney disease.  
 
The initial rationale for requiring normal glucose prior to starting metformin was that pati ents who are 
hyperglycemic may need to r eceive metformin + LIFE rather than LIFE alone. However, if a patient does 
not have a normal glucose available prior to randomization, but meets all other study criteria , we will 
continue to collect data f rom the pat ient and administer the treatment to which they have been 
randomized , so that at a minimum they will receive LIFE. We will also strongly encourage their clinician 
to emphasize the importance of obtaining fasting glucose levels. If, however, lab results are  available in 
the last 6 months, patient with a fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL on [ADDRESS_430436] the patient 
will receive LIFE while we encourage the clinician to engage the patient to get fasting metabolic labs. At 
any point in the stu dy of a patient has a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL on 2 occasions , they will be 
immediately referred to their primary care physicians and possibly endocrinology.  
 
d. Intended Demographics  
We propose to recruit 1800 inpatient or outpatient youth (ages 8 -19 years, inclusive) who have a BMI ≥ 
85%ile (i.e., overweight or obese) and are prescribed SGAs as either ongoing or new treatment. There 
will be no barriers to inclusion based on sex, race, ethnicity or clinical status with the exception that 
otherwise eligible patients with current or prio r therapeutic MET exposure will be excluded. We 
anticipate equal recruitment by [CONTACT_4321], and based on US census reports from the recruitment regions, 
approximately 25% non -White (20% African American/Black and 5% Asian) and 15% Hispanic youth. 
Because the diag nosis of BSD and the use of SGAs is more controversial in younger patients and there 
are little safety data regarding the use of MET in patients younger than [ADDRESS_430437] our sample 
to 8-19 year olds.  
 
Process for consenting Spanish speaking caregivers : If it is determined that a caregiver cannot be properly 
consented in English, the caregiver will receive a consent document translated into Spanish. A qualified 
translator  will be present to answer any questions the care giver may have about the  study. A qualified 
translator can be a bilingual study staff member, or a certified translator. A  progress note will be written 
indicating a qualified translator  was present at time of consent . The progress note  will remain attached to 
the signed  consent form.   
 
e. Study Population S ource  
Participants will be recruited from  approximately  [ADDRESS_430438] no 
difficulty reaching our proposed rate of recruitment of 1-2 patients/month/site at [ADDRESS_430439] as good as in our  prior naturalistic outcome studies (~90%) over [ADDRESS_430440] ethnicity information.   
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, [ADDRESS_430441] important study related material and information to 
committee/stakeho lder members, study sites, and patients enrolled in the study. A Login username [CONTACT_346484], meeting material, and 
videos. There will be information about the study that will be ava ilable for the public to view, including 
information about the study, metformin, and bipolar spectrum disorders.  
 
We will have a study Twitter account for the MOBILITY study  that will be used to disseminate 
information about the study. This will not be us ed as a means of recruitment. We will use the handle 
name @MOBILITY_Trial, to communicate information about the study to likely followers, including 
clinicians, researchers, members of the media and study participants and their families. The account w ill 
not provide medical or health advice or recommendations. It will provide  background information about 
the study; background information about Metformin; and information about any publications or webinars 
related to the study. It could provide links to other  research that is published during the next 5 years 
related to Metformin, SGAs and bipolar disorder in adolescents. We anticipate posting one tweet per 
week. Tweets will be reviewed prior to publication by [CONTACT_346471], MD, or a study -related 
personnel  designated  by [CONTACT_39420] .  
 
G.  RISK TO SUBJECTS  
a. Level of Risk Description  
Potential risks from study participation include possible risks from MET treatments, and other risks 
associated with any study participation (e.g. loss of confidentiality and fatigue and frustration from 
repeated evaluations):  
 
Confidentiality:  As with any study, there is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Consistent with the 
Federa l guidelines, all patients and guardians will be informed of the federally mandated reporting laws 
for child abuse and neglect, verbally and in the written consent form. Therefore, if abuse or neglect is 
suspected the Department of Human Services will be c alled. Risks associated with this include 
embarrassment, legal consequences, and removal of the child from the parents’/legal guardians’ home.  
 
Healthy Lifestyle Intervention (LIFE):  There is little to no risk associated with LIFE, although patients 
may b ecome bored, fati gued or develop anxiety by [CONTACT_346472]. The 
exercises recommended may result in muscle soreness or strains, as there may be an increase in activity 
levels.  
 
MET:  All patients, guardians and clinicians will be  made aware that MET is not approved by [CONTACT_346473] -related weight gain. Risks associated with 
MET include: Common side effects (≥5%): diarrh ea, nausea, and vomiting. Less l ikely (<5%): abdominal 
pain/abdominal distension, constipation, dizziness, dysg uesia, dyspepsia, flatus, headache, and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]. Rare: Lactic acidosis, 47 cases out of 1 million patients taking MET. Very rare : 
Vitamin B12 deficiency. Clinicians will be educated th at youth who develop symptoms of lactic acidosis, 
such as hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, and somnolence  should stop taking MET and notify their 
treating clinician immediately. Additionally, we will educate all study -related clinicians about the very 
rare side effect of Vitamin B12 deficiency and associated potential clinical manifestations of vitamin B12 
deficiency (i.e., peripheral neuropathy and pernicious anemia).   
 
Blood Draws:  Although blood draws are not required for participation in MOBILITY, they are highly 
encouraged in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. No study specific blood draws will be 
performed.  Risks of blood draws include discomfort and/or bruising at th e blood draw site. Less 
commonly, fainting, the formation of a small blood clot, swelling of the vein and surrounding tissue, 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, [ADDRESS_430442] Risks. The final protocol will be approved by [CONTACT_346474] , the CCHMC and NS/LIJ IRBs, and the study data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) 
prior to recruiting. Patients/parents will be clearly informed they are free to terminate p articipation at any 
point during study participation. Furthermore, to minimize risks associated with the study, all personnel 
will be thoroughly trained as previously described prior to having any contact [CONTACT_346475].  
 
Breach of confidentiality:  All data will be entered into electronic case report forms (eCRF) or directly into 
databases (e.g. patient/parent questionnaires) that are 21 CFR Part 11 and/or HIPAA compliant. We will 
train all study -related personnel to follow HIPAA regulations for res earch to ensure confidentiality of all 
data and that the rights of the patients/guardians are protected. All data will reside on password -protected 
computers, with only the investigators and key members of the research team having access. A variety of 
other measures will be taken to protect confidentiality, including: We will 1) assign and use a unique ID 
number to each patient to label all components of the protocol, instead of patient names, 2) restrict access 
to the key linking names and ID numbers to ke y staff and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12758], 3) store of any paper with 
data at each site in a locked file cabinet, 4) if necessary, only send de -identified from clinical sites to the 
data coordinating site. Patients and caregivers will directly enter information rega rding adherence, 
treatment satisfaction, mood, anxiety, QoL, and drug and nicotine use, into the tablet where it will go 
directly to the study database. Therefore, there is little information that site staff will collect and most of it 
is part of a standar d clinical visit, so that the risk of loss of confidentiality is minimal.  
 
Subjects will be told that agents of the Academic Health Center’s IRB, study monitors, representatives 
from the USFDA or the study coordinating sites (UC/CCHMC or LIJ/NS), and membe rs of the DSMB 
will be allowed to inspect sections of their medical and research records related to this study, if requested. 
Site clinicians are federally mandated to report suspected abuse or neglect. However, we will encourage 
any such reports to be mad e with extreme confidentially to the Department of Human Services. Healthy 
Lifestyle Intervention (LIFE): All patients and families will receive LIFE education from a clinical site 
staff member. [CONTACT_346488] will ensure that all clinical site staff are adequ ately trained prior to initiating 
LIFE and will be available on an ongoing basis to all site staff that have questions about LIFE. The site 
staff will suggest that physical activity is spread over the course of 5 days (30 minutes/day) to achieve the 
recomm ended 150 hours/week, and not performed all at once to avoid muscle or other discomfort. The 
information that will be provided to the families outweighs the risks associated with LIFE. MET: 
Metformin is USFDA approved to treat youth with diabetes type 2, >  age 10. Additionally, there are 
significant safety data for MET down to age [ADDRESS_430443]. DelBello will be responsible for sending serious 
adverse events (SAEs) to the FDA, IRBs, and DSMB in a timely fashion in compliance  of IND and FDA 
guidelines.  
 
To further protect against the risks associated with metformin, patient, parent, and endocrinologist 
research team members will train clinical site staff prior to study initiation regarding the recommended 
MET dosing for the s tudy, how to discuss MET with patients and families, common and less common 
side effects, and strategies to mitigate side effects (e.g. decrease d ose and how to switch to MET -XR or  
take it with meals). This training will be taped and available online for a ny new clinician during the 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, 2018  Page 24 
 
 course of the study. Our study endocrinologists (Drs. Crimmins and Speiser) will also be available 
throughout the study should any site clinicians have questions regarding MET use. We will also educate 
site clinicians that it is  part of standard of care to obtain labs prior to initiating MET. In particular, since 
MET is excreted by [CONTACT_8212], if a patient has creatinine ≥1.3 mg/dL on [ADDRESS_430444] been no reports 
of lactic acidosis in youth. Additionally, we will encourage site clinicians to inform patients that 
excessive use of alcohol needs to be avoided as alcohol  potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate 
metabolism (patients may be users of alcohol) and metformin should be discontinued prior to any IV 
radiocontrast study or surgical procedure. Additionally, to guard against risk, if a patient has two 8-hour 
fasting glucose level s ≥ 126 mg/dL, they will be referred to their primary care clinician (and if at 
screening they will not be included in the study ), so that they may be evaluated for type II diabetes.  
 
Blood Draws: We will recommend that only trained a nd certified phlebotomists draw blood at a certified 
laboratory facility.  
 
Other potential risks: To guard against frustration and fatigue, questions and surveys have been carefully 
chosen by [CONTACT_1962], parents, and stakeholders. However, when necessary, a ssessments can be divided to 
decrease the frustration and fatigue. In addition, research staff will be hired based on their research 
experience and work with children and adolescents. Lastly, patients and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
will be advised t hat they do not have to participate in the study and that their participation is voluntary 
and refusal to participate will not impact their clinical care in any way. Their alternative to study 
participation is to continue to receive standard clinical care.  Additional weight gain or metabolic 
abnormalities: Patients in the study will be closely monitored for weight gain and metabolic 
abnormalities. Clinicians, parents, or patients can discontinue assigned study treatment at any point, but 
will still be monit ored for up to [ADDRESS_430445] substantial weight gain (> 10%) 
in the LIFE group, a clinician might decide to add MET to the treatment if clinically indicated. Likewise, 
if the patient is randomized to the MET + LIFE group and cont inues to have substantial weight (>10%) 
they will have the option to continue MET and/or add another treatment or switch the patient’s treatment 
for BSD, whichever is clinically indicated .  If a participant’s BMI percentile 5% (= underweight) his/her 
treatment with MET will be discontinued .  
 
Although the risk of low vitamin B12 while taking MET is associated with age > [ADDRESS_430446] of metformin and the very rare 
clinical manifestations of MET -related vitamin B12 deficiency (i.e., peripheral neuropathy and pernicious 
anemia).  
 
All changes will be noted, how ever since this is a prag matic trial  we will not mandate specific study 
discontinuation criteria , even if data collection is missed at recommended times for study visits. The 
intervals between study data collection are just guidelines for the most common i ntervals between clinical 
visits. However, clinical visits may occur more or less frequently. Regardless, data will be collected from 
participants at clinical visits, when feasible, at a frequency of no more than recommended in the Schedule 
of Events (Tabl e 2).  W e will encourage clinicians to follow recommended guidelines for referrals and 
treat patients as clinically indicated. We will review guidelines at study initiation. For example, referrals 
to endocrine will be recommended for fasting glucose ≥12 6 mg/dL x 2, HbA1C ≥5.7%, or fasting insulin 
≥50 mcU/mL. Patients with LDL > 140 or triglycerides > 300 might be referred to a lipid clinic, or those 
with elevated liver enzymes ALT > 45, for a liver clinic for evaluation of non -alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NAS H). After a review of the literature and consulting  with experts in the NA SH field, we selected the 
 
 
Protocol Version# 9.0 Dated: AUGUST 14, [ADDRESS_430447] (>=22.1for girls, >=25.8 for males).166 
Although the cutoff would be higher for boys, for consistency we will use a single c ut-off of ALT>=45.   
Referral for hypertension will be recommended if blood pressure is > 95th % at 3 times or > 130/90. Drs. 
Crim mins and Speiser will facilitate referrals as clinically necessary to ensure patients safety.  
 
We will monitor all patient records and train all clinicians to ensure that if they note a laboratory value as 
clinically significant, they will need to specify  the recommended follow -up and outcome.  
 
Exacerbation of BSD is also a risk, however patients will be treated for BSD as clinical indicated and 
there are no restrictions on psychotropic medications use. Patients will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_346476] s who will use the YMRS to systematically assess manic symptoms and the PHQ -9 item #9, to 
assess current suicidality. Patients will remain in the study even if they require a change in treatment or 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. These events will be recorded  as psychiatric symptom burden outcomes.  
Patient s who become pregnant during the ir study participation will continue to be followed . We will 
encourage treating clinicians to discontinue metformin if it is being prescribed for study participation and 
to consult with the prescribing clinician prior to discontinuation, if it is prescribed by [CONTACT_346477].   
 
b. Anticipated Benefit Justifies the Risk - We believe the risks associated with study participation are 
minimal . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_346416] + MET or LIFE along, this is a pragmatic 
observational study and there are minimal st udy specific procedures associated with participation. 
Additionally, patients will remain in the study and data will be collected regardless of whether they 
switch treatment arms or miss visits , although all of this information will be recorded . Youth with  BSD 
taking SGAs receive low rates of basic metabolic monitoring and even lower rates of intervention for 
being overweight or obese, even though weight gain is the side effect of SGAs that causes them the most 
concern and is a common reason for poor adhere nce. Participation may increase their likelihood of 
receiving state -of-the art monitoring and intervention/prevention for weight gain, obesity, and metabolic 
disorders. Potential benefits also include the chance to contribute to a scientific investigation which may 
benefit other patients like themselves in the future. The study will benefit society as a whole by 
[CONTACT_346478] a new means to optimize efficacy, minimize risk for adverse 
reactions, and ultimately achieve better quality of life for patients treated with SGAs. We may also gain a 
better understanding of MET’s effects on anthropomorphic measurements as well as glucose and lipid 
metabolism, which may ultimately improve our ability to prevent and/or manage the longer -term effe cts 
of SGA. Overall, the risks associated with this study are minimal and subjects may receive direct benefit 
from participation. Therefore, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_346417], including patient, parent, and other 
stakeholders, the benefits of this study outweigh the risks.  
 
In addition, the  benefits of this pragmatic trial to society, as well as to individual patients, such as gaining 
important information about his/her mental and physical health status and receiving healthy lifestyle 
intervention and MET , far outweigh its minimal risks involved. This patient -centered study will enhance 
our understanding of the effectiveness in a community setting of LIFE and MET to abrogate weight gain 
and its patient -reported complications, such as poor adherence, treatm ent satisfaction, QoL and 
psychiatric symptoms burden in obese or overweight youth with BSD who are treated with SGAs. In 
summary, this study will provide critical information to address an important public health concern in a 
highly vulnerable population.  
 
c. Anticipated Benefit as Favorable as Alternative Approaches  – An alternative to study participation 
is not participating and receiving standard of care treatment as directed by a physician of that participant’s 
choosing.  Participation may increase their likelihood of receiving state -of-the art monitoring and 
intervention/prevention for weight gain, obesity, and metabolic disorders associated with SGAs.

H. PAYMENT  
Patients and their caregiver will each be paid $25 for visits at Screening, month 6, a nd month 24 for their 
time and effort. Also, they each will each be paid $10 for visits at month 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. 
This totals to $155 for the patient and $[ADDRESS_430448] COSTS  
Patients are expected to provide for  the costs of  clinical care (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051]) through standard 
health care payment procedures. Subjects will have no costs associated with research participation.

IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-1000  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  08/29/[ADDRESS_534987] common gastroin testinal-related dis ease requiring  surgery in 
children. Nearly 25% of all children with pe rforated appendicit is develop postop erative su rgical 
site infections, specifically intra-abdom inal abscesses (IAA), whi ch is likely  due to the intra- 
abdom inal sepsis that o ccurs with the p erforated viscus  [1,2]. These IAA lead to increased 
patient discomfo rt, extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423618], and increased emergency room  visits and 
readmissions [3]. In line with other  children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423619], Children’s Memo rial 
Hermann Hospit al (CM HH) has implem ented evidence-based practices such as early and 
culture-directed antibiotic coverage, early operation, and protoco l-driven postop erative care [1,2]. 
Specifically for patients with p erforated appendicit is, ov er the course of four years, our d edicated 
team of p ediatric surgeons h as reviewed patient ou tcomes on an iterative basis, leading to 
targeted in traoperative and postop erative interventions such as transperiton eal drain placement 
and customized home antibiotic regimens in an  attempt to de crease postop erative IAA. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_423620], the  IAA rate has remain ed unchanged. 
 
 
In a 2004 surv ey of North Am erican pediatric  surgeons, o ver 90%  respon ded that th ey use intr a- 
abdom inal irrigation for  patients with adv anced appendicit is [4]. However, although its use is 
widespread, int raoperative irrigation has not b een widely studied. There is strong  evidence of no 
difference in IAA rate when no ir rigation is compa red to norm al saline  irrigation for children 
with pe rforated appendicitis [5], and the re is even some eviden ce that sugg ests that NS irrigation 
may actually increase the rate of postop erative IAA [6]. Anoth er irrigation solution that is  widely 
available and commonly used in the operating room is povidone -iodine (PVI). PVI is an 
antiseptic solut ion consist ing of polyvinylpyrrolidone  with w ater, iodide, and 1%  available 
iodine. It has bactericidal ability against a large array of pathogens, in cluding those pathogens 
which commonly cause postop erative IAA in childr en with pe rforated appendicit is [7,8]. Just a 
few examples of how PVI is used for surgery include: skin and mucos al preoperative 
preparation, in testinal intraluminal irrigation prior  to division and an astomosis, medi astinal 
washout following  sternal wound inf ections, and refractory chylothorax in newborns [9–11].

Althou gh PVI is comm only used in pedi atric operations, its u se as an intr a-abdom inal irrigant for 
perforated appendicit is has not b een rigorously studied.  
 
 
A recent meta-analysis demonstr ated th at intraoperative irrigation with  PVI in abdomina l, 
gynecologic, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_272175] s ignificantly decreased posto perative abscesses compa red to 
norm al saline  irrigation or no i rrigation at all (poo led relative  risk 0.1 3, 95%CI 0.05-0.37, 
p<0.001)  [12]. How ever, of the trials in cluded in th is particular analysis, only two of  the four 
focused on treating intra-abdom inal sepsis and neither of the  studies ind icated the numb er or age 
of pediatric  patients who were enrolled [13,14 ]. A recent sur vey of European general adult 
surgeons found that n early 40% of them common ly use P VI irrigation for contaminat ed or dirty 
abdom inal surg eries such  as perforated appendicit is [15]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_423621] u se in dirty abdom inal surgeries, the re have been 
no recent, high-quality trials demons trating its effectiveness in reducing IAA after perforated 
appendicit is in chi ldren. 
 
 
2.2 Scienti fic Rationale 
 
Hypothesis: Among  pediatric  patients pr esenting to CMHH  with pe rforated appendicit is, intra- 
abdom inal irrigation wi th PVI versus no irrigation will decrease the rate of 30-day postop erative 
IAA. 
Specific Aim 1: To conduct a pil ot random ized controll ed trial to comp are the efficacy of PVI 
irrigation to no ir rigation  for decreasing postop erative IAA in childr en with pe rforated 
appendicit is 
Specific Aim 2: To verify the safety profile of dilute  PVI for intra-abdom inal irrigation 
Specific Aim 3: To determine the effect of PVI irrigation vs no ir rigation on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423622], readmissions, and cost 
 
 
2.3 Potential Ris ks and Benefits 
 
PVI is commonly used in the su rgical treatment of adults with  dirty abdom inal surg eries such as 
perforated appendicit is [15]. PVI could c ause an allergic reaction or  iodine toxicity; how ever, 
this is exceptionally rare, especially at dilute concentrations [16]. Potential b enefits include  a 
reduction in postope rative IAA, decreased length of stay, and few er readmissions. The

5.0 Study Population  
 
 
 
5.1 Selection of  the Study Population  
 
A team of five pediatric  surgery research coordinators will  coordin ate the  enrollm ent, cons ent, 
and assent p rocesses. T he research coordin ator team wi ll be available 24/7  to the pediatric 
surgery service via a dedicated p ager. Residents a nd attendings on the  pediatric su rgery service 
will page the research coordinato rs upon di agnosing  a patient wi th suspe cted appendicit is. All 
patients und ergoing appendectomy for acute appendicit is will  be eligible for the trial. After 
enrollment, on ly patients who are diagnosed intraoperatively with pe rforated appendicit is will  be 
random ized. 
 
 
5.2 I nclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
 
Inclusion criteria: Patients aged 2-17 years old who und ergo an appendectomy for acute, 
perforated appendicit is at C MHH. Di agnosis of perforated appendicit is is made intraoperatively

presence of intr aperiton eal stool or a  fecalith at the time of  operation. 
 
 
Exclusion criteria: 1) p atients pr esenting with si mple or  gangrenous appendicitis, 2) p atients 
with a histo ry of iodine  sensitivity, thyroid dis ease or renal disease, 3) patients und ergoing 
interval or in cident al appendectomy, and 4) pregnancy. 
 
 
We do not anticip ate pregnancy in our stu dy population. Pregnant subj ects and their  fetuses may 
be placed at undue risk for the pu rposes of  the study. Therefore, pregnant patients will  be 
excluded from p articip ating in the study.

6.0 Study Procedures/Evaluations 
 
 
 
6.1 Study Procedures 
 
Rando mization and a llocation:  
 
Enrollment will  occur prior to the operation either in the emergency room,  on the ward, or  in the 
preoperative holding area. The random ization schema will be variable blo ck random ization, and 
sequentially numb ered, opaque, sealed envelopes will be used to blind alloc ation. Following 
consent, the sealed, op aque envelope will be attached to the patient’s chart which accompani es 
the p atient into the operating room. On ly if the  patient is found intr aoperatively to ha ve 
perforated appendicit is will  the envelope be  opened by [CONTACT_423630] p atient 
assigned to the control or  intervention group. If a patient is determined to have  simple or 
gangrenous appendicit is, the s ealed envelope will remain unop ened, and a research coordi nator 
will retrieve  it for re-use. 
 
 
Standard Preoperative, Operative, and Postope rative Protocols  
13 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-1000  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  08/29/2016  Protocol Version 5.0 
7.21.2016  
  
Upon p atient admission to the hospit al, the patient wi ll be sta rted on the  preop erative 
appendicit is proto col that has b een in p lace at CMHH since  2011.  Briefly, this protocol entails 
immedi ate ini tiation of  intravenous pip eracillin-tazobactam or  metronidazole/g entamicin for 
patients all ergic to p enicillin. The  intravenous antibiotics are continued throughout the inpatient 
admission. Addit ionally, patients are fluid resusci tated and analgesia is pr ovided. 
 
 
A laparoscopic approach will be attempted for  all patients; however, conversion from 
laparoscopy to an o pen technique will not result in exclusion from the trial. After careful ly 
examining the p eriton eal cavity and upon identi fying the appendix, the surgeon will  declare 
whether or not the patient has a  perforated appendicitis (as defined previous ly). At that point, the 
circulating nurse  will open the s ealed envelope and group assignment wi ll occur. Subsequently, 
once the su rgeon has removed the  appendix from the abdomen and ensured hemostasis, the 
surgeon will  proceed to use  the b attery-powered, suction-irrigator  device to irrigate  prim arily the 
right upp er, right lower, and pelvic regions as these are the predominant locations for 
postop erative IAA formation [5]. If the patient is assigned to the intervention group, t he nurse 
will create the  dilute P VI irrigation by [CONTACT_423631] 100ml  of saline from a 1000ml  bag and 
replacing it with 100 ml of stock, 10%  PVI (readily available in the op erating room), t hereby 
[CONTACT_423632] 1% P VI. Dilu tion of t he PVI will occur while the  surgeon 
completes the  operation (removes the  appendix). Once the appendix has been removed and 
hemostasis ensured, the surgeon will  perform the  irrigation  with 10c c/kg (minimum 100 ml and  
maximum 100 0ml) of dilute P VI. The dose of PVI (10cc/kg) is b ased on p revious stud ies [13,14] 
as well as consensus f rom our p ediatric  surgery team and is f elt to be  a conservative dose [14]. 
After completing the irrigation, the su rgeon will  suction out  all intra-abdominal fluid in to a 
suction canister and the  amount  will be recorded. Patients allo cated to the control group will not 
undergo intra-abdom inal irrigation.  
 
 
All postope rative care will follow the  stand ardized perforated appendicit is care pathway which 
includ es continued intravenous antibiotics until they are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Standard 
disch arge criteria for perforated appendicit is patients  will comprise the  following  parameters: 
oral/axillary temperature < 100°F  (oral) x 24hr, tole rating regular diet, pain relief with oral 
analgesics, ambulating with minimal assistan ce as age appropriate, no rmal whi te blood c ell count

without  bandemia. Those  patients who do not me et discharge criteria within seven days will 
undergo a compu ted tomography (CT). Patients diagnosed with  an IAA on  CT s can will  receive 
an interventional radiology consultation and  will undergo percutaneous drainage when deemed 
feasible by [CONTACT_423633]. 
 
 
The same  disch arge criteria will  apply for all patients. All patients will be scheduled for follow- 
up with a p ediatric  surgeon within one  week of discharge. Tho se patients who are not able to 
attend the follow up appointment will  be called and rescheduled. In the clinic, a post- 
appendectomy form (Appendix A) will be filled out by a pediatric  surgeon who will  document 
physical exam findin gs as well as any additional postop erative complications or visits to an 
emergency room (ER) or  other  healthcare facility as reported by [CONTACT_102]/parents. All patients 
will be called between 30-32 days pos toperatively (in case postop erative day 30 falls on the 
weekend), and a form will be filled out that d etails a ny further complications or h ealthcare 
facility visits. 
 
 
Postoperati ve Laboratory Testing & 6- and [ADDRESS_534990] 10 p atients du ring their admissions and will provide th erapeutic guidance in the 
unlikely event that symptomatic hypothyroidism  occurs. Six and 12-month follow up with 
patients (via chart review and phone  call) will take place to det ermine  if any small bow el 
obstru ctions o ccur due to abdom inal adh esions. Although rare, abdom inal adhesions  are a known 
entity after appendectomy and theoretically may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_423634] s aline or  PVI 
irrigation.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_534991] and Bayesian approaches has b een shown to p rovide complement ary 
interpretations  [17]. Furthermore, while  a frequentist analysis may result in a “negative” study, 
posterior probabilities based on a  Bayesian approa ch may still be sufficient for clinicians to

by [CONTACT_423635] [17]. Therefore, our stu dy will include  both frequentist and 
Bayesian analyses. 
 
 
7.1 Study Outcome Measures 
 
The prim ary outcome  will be 30-day postop erative IAA rate. An IAA will be d efined as an 
image-confirmed (ultr asound or CT) fluid collection deemed to be  an IAA by a pediatric 
radiologist at CMHH. The imaging studies will  be obtain ed for  patients w ho und ergo 
postop erative imaging at outside facilities and will  be read by [CONTACT_423636]. The 
radiologists will remain  blinded to the patient’s in tervention. Patients who are determin ed to 
have an IAA will be referred to interventional radiology for percutaneous drainage and will  be 
restarted on int ravenous  antibiotics based on o rganism  susceptibilities. 
 
 
Secondary outcom es will include  total hospi [INVESTIGATOR_423623] [ADDRESS_534993] will be generated when the p ediatric surgery team informs the research 
coordin ator th at a patient wi th suspe cted appendicitis is being  consented for an appendectomy.

16% with 80% po wer and a two-tailed s ignificance level of 0.05, a  sample size of 784 patients 
(392 patients per  group) would be  required. Bas ed on current practice (approximately 100 
appendectomies are performed annually for perforated appendicit is) and an estimated consent 
rate of 50%, study enrollment would take  approximately [ADDRESS_534996] they practice if a Bayesian analysis could det ermine 
with 75% confid ence whether or not PVI is beneficial. Based on Mont e-Carlo si mulations using 
the p rior probabilities described b elow, o ur pediatric surgeons are confid ent that a 2-year, pi[INVESTIGATOR_423626] (Appendix B). 
 
 
7.3 Bay esian Prior Probabilities 
 
A Bayesian p rior represents the probability distribution that summa rizes the beliefs about the 
treatment ben efit prior  to seeing study results. The  prior  is det ermin ed by [CONTACT_423637], expert knowl edge and opt ion, and defining clinically important ou tcomes. 
After thoro ugh review  of the current literature concerning intra-abdom inal irrigation for 
perforated appendicit is (which are referenced in the Introdu ction) and di scussion, the CMHH 
pediatric  surgeons feel the following Bayesian p riors are appropriate for analyzing the benefit of  
PVI in this trial (RR=relative risk, CI=confid ence interval): 
 
 
Neutral: RR 1 (9 5%CI 0.5-1.6) Optimistic: RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.3-1.2) 
 24% IAA (95%CI 13-37%)  16% IAA (95%CI 9-34%) 
 
 
To d etermine the p rior probability of treatment benefit for  the control g roup (no ir rigation), we 
will use th ree years of prospectively collected data from CMHH  of patients who und erwent the 
current prot ocol which is  to not perform irrigation (n=325).  Further strengthening this prior

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  08/29/[ADDRESS_535000] sizes and  95% CI. For binary outcomes, absolute and relative  effect sizes will  be 
determined. Bayesian probability models will also be  performed to det ermine  the likelihood and 
degree of treatment ben efit. Chi-square, Fisher’s exact, Student ’s t-test or M ann-Whitney U tests 
will be performed for categorical and  continuous v ariables, respectively. Generalized linear 
models will  be utilized to look at predicto rs of IAA, ER v isits, readmissions, and LOS. The  data 
will be analyzed based on their  distribution.  
 
 
A CO NSORT flow di agram wi ll be p rovided to clearly demonstr ate the n umber  of participants 
who were random ized, received the  intended treatment, and w ere analyzed for the p rimary and 
secondary outcomes. The  reasons f or loss es to e ach group will be documented; in tention-to-treat 
(primary) and per-protocol (secondary) analyses will be performed.  
 
 
Limitations 
 
(1) Subjectivity of the  primary outcome. An outc ome su ch as IAA may be subjective due  to 
variable d efinitions or in terpretations. Ho wever, we utilized a stand ardized definition that is 
utilized, endors ed, and has been validated by [CONTACT_423640] [18]. In addition, trained 
clinicians blinded to the allocation will  make  the assessments.  
 
 
(2) Failure to blind the treating clinicians. Clinicians m aking treatment de cisions  may not be 
blinded to the intervention if th ey were present during  the o peration. Ho wever, postop erative 
protocols are in place to help minimize differential treatment bas ed on t reatment allocation. 
Addit ionally, the patients, radiologists, and  data analysts will be blinded. Research coordin ators 
will keep a separ ate spreadsheet to keep track of group assignment. 
 
 
(3) Generalizability. This study will be performed on pediatric  patients at a  tertiary care 
 
academic center. The applicability of these  results to other  clinical sett ings may be limited. If this  
20 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-1000  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  08/29/[ADDRESS_535001] patient is enrolled, an interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_423641] & Safety Monitoring Board to ensure  there are no inc reased harms of  PVI and 
that on going study participation is not futile.

Harms will  entail but  not be li mited to: abnorm al thyroid tests requiring endocrinolo gy 
intervention or  adhesive small bow el obs truction requiring r eadmission or  surgery. There are no 
other  anticipated harms i mposed  by [CONTACT_423642]; how ever, any unexpected harms that arise 
will be includ ed in the interim and fin al analyses. At the ti me of the  interim analysis, if the 
probability of increased harms is >75% or the probability that PVI is ben eficial is <10%,  the 
study will be stopp ed and existing data will be reported.

Patient data  will be entered into a secure, UT-Houston REDC ap database [19] by [CONTACT_423643]. On ly study investi gators approved by [CONTACT_423644] R eview Board to p articip ate 
in the study will have access to the REDCap d ata. Upon completion of  the study, the REDC ap 
database will be permanently deleted.

oppo rtunity to discuss the  consent, ans wer and questions and dis cuss the protocol wi th the 
assistance of a certified interpreter. All patients willing to be enrolled in the study will receive a 
signed copy of the  consent form. 
 
 
A Waiver of Cons ent wi ll be requested for eligible study participants un able to p rovide assent or 
parents/guardians who refuse to sign an info rmed consent for the following r easons:  
 Emergent intervention requiring  medi cal sedation, incapacitation, and/or  endotracheal 
intubation (i. e. septic sho ck, cardiopulmon ary resuscitation) 
 Audito ry, visu al, or m ental impai rment  and/or l earning disabili ty 
 
 Parent or guardian p reference - refusal or d eclination to permit child to provide  assent  
 
(i.e. extreme fatigue, weakness, lethargy) 
 
 
 
10.0 Differences, Cos ts, and Funding 
 
Currently, each arm of  the study (PVI or no irrigation) has been deemed to  be safe and is utilized 
commonly by [CONTACT_423646]. The unique po rtion of  the 
intervention is si mply random izing all of the  interventions in a  system atic fashion rather than in  a 
arbitrary fashion (current practice). 
 
We do not f eel that any of the interventions or follow-ups r epresent a  cost to the p atient or 
healthcare system above  current practice. 
 
Currently, we are seeking funding to support this trial. Ho wever, without an IRB number  and 
approved IRB, many funding sources are not av ailable. We anticipate  seeking funding from 
intra- and extra-mural grants.

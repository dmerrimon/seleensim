1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.
The proposed project will use wearable  technology to test the feasibility and efficacy of 
delivering a novel  real-time smoking  intervention to improve standard tobacco treatment. 50 
adult daily smokers will be recruited  from an outpatient tobacco treatment center  to participate 
in an 8-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. Participants will be randomly assigned to a control  group 
(standard treatment ST, n=25) or experimental  group (standard treatment plus real-time 
smoking intervention  ST+, n=25).  The control  group (ST) will not receive real-time  feedback 
about their smoking.  The experimental  group (ST+) will receive real-time  feedback as soon as 
smoking is detected using wearable technology during the 8-week intervention. Specific aims 
include:
Aim 1: Evaluate  the feasibility, acceptability,  and helpfulness of the real-time smoking 
intervention. We will characterize  rates of adherence (i.e., number of days  wearing the 
smartband) and evaluate participant satisfaction and perceived usefulness  of the intervention 
using post-treatment  interviews and ratings.
Aim 2: Assess the preliminary  efficacy  of the real-time  intervention as an  adjunct to 
standard tobacco  treatment. We will compare biochemically confirmed 7-day point 
prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment  (week 8) to estimate  effect sizes  for ST+ vs. ST. 
Additional outcomes will compare total number  of days abstinent and changes in cigarettes per 
smoking day from baseline to end of treatment between ST+ and ST  as proximal indices of 
good clinical response  that are related to long-term  cessation outcomes.
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.
2 years.  We anticipate recruiting and enrolling  50 subjects over 20 months  and will complete data entry  
and analysis by [CONTACT_5638] 2 years.
3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Cigarette smoking is the leading  cause  of preventable death1. The majority of current smokers  
want to quit2, but most  smoking  quit attempts are unsuccessful2-4, suggesting treatment 
innovations are needed.  Mobile  smoking  treatments are gaining  popularity and  have many 
benefits, including  that treatments are highly  accessible, scalable, and can  be provided in the 
user’s natural environment5,6. However,  existing mobile interventions require users to manually 
record smoking behavior and decide  if and when to access support7, limiting the accuracy of 
information and the timeliness of the intervention.  Recent innovations  in wearable  technology 
(e.g., smartbands) now allow for passive, automatic identification  of smoking behavior through 
geospatial sensors  and adaptive learning algorithms. Preliminary research  indicates smoking 
can be identified reliably in real time using smartband technology8, yet no  studies have tested

4.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
Overview: The proposed study will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a real-time  smoking 
intervention as an adjunct to enhance standard  tobacco treatment. 50 adult smokers will be 
randomly assigned to a control group (standard tobacco treatment, ST, n=25) vs. an 
experimental group  (standard treatment plus a real-time smoking intervention,  ST+, n=25).
Randomization to group (1:1) will be stratified  by [CONTACT_421105] (< or ≥ 10 cigarettes  per day) to balance  groups on smoking intensity. Enrolled 
participants will complete research visits at 4 weeks and  8 weeks (see Figure 1).  Participants 
will receive financial compensation for their time spent completing research  activities:  $20 for 
each appointment  (week 0,4,8) for a total of $60. Participants  will earn a $[ADDRESS_531360] visit (week 8) and returning  the smartband and charger. These visits will 
take place  remotely in which  the participant will speak with our research  staff by [CONTACT_421106], at the tobacco  clinic, at our research office, or at a location  that is convenient, such 
as a public  place.
Recruitment: We will recruit from the Yale Tobacco Treatment Service (TTS) and the 
Winchester chest clinic.  These programs are a specialized outpatient services at  Yale-

Page [ADDRESS_531361] in person or remotely (e.g., phone, secure video 
conference) when  possible.
Screening Assessments: To screen for eligibility, participants will complete the following 
assessments including: 1) Smoking history to assess smoking quantity and frequency such  as 
number of cigarettes per day and number of years smoked, 2) self-reported other  tobacco  and 
drug use for the past 30 days. Participants may also complete biochemical verification  of 
smoking status, such as breath  carbon  monoxide (CO) measured in  parts per million or 
cotinine measured in a small sample  of urine  or saliva.
Participants: Eligibility criteria include:  (a) age 18 or older, (b) daily cigarette smoker, (c) 
seeking smoking cessation  treatment at Yale TTS or Winchester chest clinic,  (d) able to read 
and write in English, (d) owning a smartphone (smartphone ownership is estimated to be  
over 80% among adult  smokers who are motivated to quit12). Exclusion criteria include: (a)  
unstable psychiatric/medical  conditions  (e.g.,  suicidal ideation, acute  psychosis, dementia), 
(b) current use of other tobacco  products assessed via self-report,  (c) current daily  use of 
combustible marijuana. We exclude  participants  who use other tobacco products  or smoke 
marijuana because  the smartband  system  is only validated to  detect and respond  to 
cigarette smoking. We exclude participants  who are  regular users of combustible marijuana 
because this can elevate expi[INVESTIGATOR_421092]  (CO) making  CO an inaccurate  
measure to confirm  cigarette smoking status.
Experimental Methods: Eligible participants will be randomized  to one of  two treatment 
conditions (ST vs. ST+). All participants will receive standard  outpatient tobacco treatment (ST) 
at the Yale Tobacco Treatment Service (TTS) or Winchester chest clinic following clinical 
practice guidelines13. All patients  receive up to [ADDRESS_531362] clinic. The experimental group  (ST+)  will receive  standard care 
plus an adjunct treatment which involves wearing a smartband for the 8-week study and 
receiving real-time notifications as soon as smoking is detected with  the embedded geospatial 
movement sensors in the smartband. There are multiple commercially  available 
smartbands/smartwatches that are compatible with the real- time smoking monitoring system;  
for example, the Asus Zenwatch 2 pairs  with the user’s smartphone  via Bluetooth connection.  
When smoking is detected, an alert is sent to the user through the band (vibration) and their  
smartphone app (alert) with a message  indicating that smoking was just detected. The user 
can indicate yes/no  if this smoking  detection was accurate. Real-time smoking data is recorded 
for the user to review in their smartphone app and is available for the research team  to view on 
a password-protected  secure online dashboard. Data include only the timing  and number  of 
smoking events, labeled by [CONTACT_9178]. This real-time notification may disrupt the automaticity 
of smoking  behavior and help bring  awareness to smoking and related  cues in the moment, 
which may enhance  the individual’s ability to anticipate and respond adaptively to cues in the 
future. The control group will also receive  the smartband to wear for the 8 week  study to 
control for demands associated with remembering to wear  the band and  charge it.

Page 5 of 23Measures: Baseline measures will be used to characterize the sample. Repeated measures  
will be used to assess changes in smoking and related constructs  during treatment.
Demographic Questionnaires (week 0): Age, gender, marital status, employment  status, 
occupation.
Smoking History (week  0): Smoking characteristics  will be  assessed,  including the number 
of years of cigarette use, length of prior quit attempts, and prior treatments used.
Quitting Motivation  and Confidence (week 0): Readiness to quit  smoking and confidence 
quitting smoking will be measured on an 11-point scale (0=not  at all, 10=extremely)  using 
the contemplation ladder14.
Discounting task (week  0): A brief computerized discounting task will be administered (5 
questions each) to assess choice preference for cigarettes and money.  Participants choose  
between a hypothetical smaller sooner reward  or larger later reward,  which is a validated 
measure of decision-making that has been  shown to relate to treatment  outcomes15,16.
Timeline Follow-Back Interview (TLFB)17,18  (week 0,4,8):  A standardized, validated,  and 
reliable interview will be used  to obtain  quantity and frequency estimates of  tobacco use, 
alcohol, and other drugs for the 30-days prior to baseline  and at each research  visit.
Biochemical Verification of Smoking Status (week 0,4,8): Assessed when needed to 
confirm reported abstinence via either expi[INVESTIGATOR_421093] (CO) levels,  which 
have a half-life of 2 hours  or cotinine measured in a small sample of urine or saliva.
Nicotine Dependence  (week 0,8): Measured by [CONTACT_9860]öm Test for Nicotine 
Dependence19 and the 4-item NIH PROMIS® measure for daily smokers20.
Craving (week 0,4,8):  Measured  by [CONTACT_421107]-Brief21 (QSU- 
Brief).
Strength of Smoking  Habit (week  0,4,8) : Measured with a 6-item Self-Report Habit  index 
adapted and validated for smoking behavior22,23, e.g. “Smoking  is something  I do 
automatically” rated on a 5-point  scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly  agree).
Perceived Control Over  Smoking (week 0,4,8) : Measured with [ADDRESS_531363] demonstrated  associations  with smoking  outcome25,26, e.g., 
“How much control do you feel you have  over not smoking?” (1=no control, 7=complete  
control).
Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)  (week 0, 4, 8): An objective behavioral task that measures  
the tendency to automatically approach smoking  stimuli  (e.g.,  cigarettes). Our research  team 
has used an adapted  version  of the approach-avoidance task (AAT27) to measure  smoking  
approach and avoidance action  tendencies28-30. The task starts with 20 practice trials in which 
participants learn to push or pull the joystick in response to pi[INVESTIGATOR_421094] (landscape or 
portrait). The practice phase is followed  by [ADDRESS_531364] trials in which  pi[INVESTIGATOR_421095] 
(e.g., cigarettes, cigarette  packages) and non-cigarette  stimuli  (e.g., pencil) come equally in

response assignment (push or pull) is counterbalanced, with half the participants pulling 
landscape pi[INVESTIGATOR_421096].  The smoking  approach bias represents  the 
relative difference between pushing and pulling the joystick  in response to the smoking 
stimuli, measured as mean reaction time. Evidence supports reliable  approach tendencies 
related to substance  use and indicates that meaningful changes in automatic approach 
tendencies related to substance use outcomes can be detected after one week27,28,31-35 .
End of Treatment  Ratings (week 8): We will evaluate participant  satisfaction  and perceived  
usefulness of the treatment across  both conditions with post-treatment interviews and 
ratings.
Analytical Plan:
Data Management and Statistical Analyses: The proposed study will follow HIPAA guidelines  
for data collection, management, and monitoring. Data analyses will use the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) principle36, where  missing data will be treated as smoking. Data analyses will be 
conducted under the supervision of [CONTACT_205630] who is a biostatistician. Data on 
quantitative outcomes will be examined for conformity to the normal distribution and 
transformation or non-parametric methods  will be used if necessary.
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and helpfulness of the real-time smoking  
intervention. We will use descriptive  statistics to summarize participant  ratings of satisfaction  
and perceived usefulness of the intervention at the end of treatment,  including characterizing 
adherence and feasibility of using  the smartband device  based on  self-report and objective 
adherence (i.e., number of days wearing the smartband).
Aim 2: Assess  the preliminary efficacy of the real-time intervention as an adjunct to standard 
tobacco treatment. We will compare biochemically confirmed 7-day  point prevalence  
abstinence at the end of treatment (i.e., reported abstinence from cigarettes during the last 
week of the study that is confirmed  with CO≤ 4ppm or cotinine measured in a small sample of 
urine or saliva) to estimate effect sizes for ST+ vs. ST. We will also compare continuous 
outcome measures between ST+ and ST that are proximal indices of  good clinical  response: 
number of days abstinent and changes in cigarettes per smoking  day from baseline  to week 8. 
We will use independent sample  t-tests  to compare total days abstinent between ST+ and ST 
and a 2x2 mixed  ANOVA (time x condition) to compare changes in cigarettes  per smoking day 
from baseline to week 8.

9.Risks: Describe the reasonably  foreseeable risks, including risks to subject  privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with  subjects  participating in the research.
We feel that this research poses  minimal risks to adults  who are  seeking treatment to  stop 
smoking.
We provide  a detailed  description of risks below.
Smoking Intervention  Components: The smoking intervention components  pose minimal risk. All 
participants will receive standard  outpatient tobacco treatment (ST) at the Yale Tobacco  
Treatment Service  (TTS) or Winchester  chest clinic following clinical practice guidelines. 
Patients receive up to [ADDRESS_531366] and arm movements using  sensors in the smartband.  
When smoking is detected, an alert is sent to the users in the experimental condition through 
the band  (vibration) and their smartphone  app (alert) with a message indicating that smoking 
was just detected.  The user can indicate yes/no if this smoking detection was accurate.  Real-
time smoking data is recorded for the user to review in their smartphone app and is available 
for the research team  to view on a password- protected  secure online  dashboard. Data include  
only the timing  and number of smoking events, labeled by [CONTACT_421108].
Interviews/Self-Report Questionnaires: These are all noninvasive and should add no  risk. The 
major disadvantages are the time taken to complete  them, and possible breach  of 
confidentiality. We have  done  our best to make  the assessment schedule in this study as brief 
as possible. Also,  our past experience with these measures indicates that they are acceptable 
to subjects. [CONTACT_25274], a licensed clinical  psychologist,  will be available to meet with individuals  
and will provide staff with consultation should the need  arise. Careful efforts aimed at 
maintaining confidentiality will be made, which are described below,  and only participants’ 
study numbers  will be recorded  on the forms themselves  in order  to protect  confidentiality.
Breath, saliva and urine collections:  Breath  screening, saliva collections and urine collections  
should add no risks other than those normally associated with  these procedures.  Breath and

Loss of Confidentiality: Participants will be providing sensitive information,  including their  
smoking and alcohol use behaviors. There  are potential risks to subjects if such  information 
were to be made public.  Several  procedures  will help reduce  the risk of disclosure  of sensitive  
information, described in detail below.
Limits to Confidentiality: Participants will be informed that we  will aim to protect their 
confidentiality and not reveal  any personal  information collected as part of the research 
procedures, including  their reported  smoking  and other substance  use history.  All personnel to  
be involved in this study are already or will be certified by [CONTACT_421110] (HIC) as having completed training in the protection of the rights of  human subjects 
who participate in research. However,  participants  will be  informed  that if they report any 
information to us about child abuse or homicidal/suicidal behavior, we will be required  to report 
this information to the appropriate  authorities.  These  limits to  confidentiality will be clearly  
stipulated in the consent form.

A.Recruitment and Informed Consent
We will recruit individuals from the Yale Tobacco Treatment Service  (TTS) and the Winchester 
chest clinic. Yale TTS is a specialized  outpatient  service at  Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421097] a large  patient population  of current smokers. New 
patients referred to the TTS will be offered  the opportunity to participate in the study  via 
clinician referrals and will provide  verbal  consent to be contact[CONTACT_421111]. Research 
staff will meet with interested participants  for an intake visit  either remotely  or in person.  At the 
start of the intake  visit, consent to participate will be obtained from all participants after the 
research procedures and risks associated  with participation have been explained.  The entire 
consent form will be reviewed in detail  with the participant in a private, one-on-one setting with  
a research staff member. The consent form will provide clear and explicit language about  the 
smoking intervention  components,  smoking- monitoring procedures, and smartband use. Any 
questions the participant may have will be addressed.  If participants  wish, they may take the 
consent form home and consider it further before signing.  They may also request to  speak to 
anyone on the research  team about  questions they have or to consult  others, including their 
physician and family members.  Participants will sign [ADDRESS_531367] their relationship with any study  personnel. Following resolution of any 
questions, the participant will be asked to sign the consent form, if he/she agrees  to 
participate.
For remote intake visits, the approved informed consent form will be provided  online via 
Qualtrics to subjects in advance of participation. Research staff  will review  the consent  form by 
[CONTACT_421112],  and research staff will answer any 
questions regarding the study or consent  form at this time. Subjects who wish to participate will 
click “I accept”  and electronically  sign the document by [CONTACT_421113].  A copy of 
the consent form will be automatically  emailed  to the participant.

Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of minimal risk, the potential exists  
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse  events, serious  or otherwise, to occur since it is 
not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk  in any given individual  or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide  a plan  for 
monitoring the data and safety  of the proposed study.
[CONTACT_25274] will reduce the potential for risks by [CONTACT_421116]/or participation  
in the research study. Frequent in-person or remote assessment  and ongoing  visits  with 
treatment staff at the TTS and Winchester  chest  clinic will allow for close regular monitoring  
of participants. Research staff will check participants’ data sources for clinically significant 
changes and alert [CONTACT_25274] and the TTS/Winchester team  as needed.

Plan for Determining  Seriousness  of Adverse  Events: In addition to grading the adverse  
event, [CONTACT_25274], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_421098] a Serious Adverse  Event  (SAE). An adverse  event  is considered 
serious if it:
1.is life-threatening
2.results in in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]
3.results in persistent or significant  disability  or incapacity
4.results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect OR
5.results in death
6.based upon appropriate medical  judgment,  may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes  listed in 
this definition, OR
7.adversely  affects the risk/benefit  ratio of the study
An adverse  event may be graded  as severe  but still not meet  the criteria for a Serious  
Adverse Event. Similarly, an adverse  event may be graded as moderate but still meet the 
criteria for an SAE. [CONTACT_25274], the PI, will consider the grade of the event as well as its 
“seriousness” when determining whether  the event meets  criteria  for an SAE  and requires a 
report to the Yale University IRB or funding agency.
Adverse Event Reporting:
Every event that is reported by [CONTACT_421117]. Bold, the PI, or the designated 
research staff and that meets  criteria  above will be documented.  [CONTACT_25274] will report 
serious adverse events  and unanticipated problems to the Yale University IRB within 5 
days of it becoming known using the required documentation. An adverse  event  report 
will be generated  for each event and will include details of  the event in the report  (e.g., 
description of the event, when and how it was reported, as well as any official records  or 
documentation to corroborate  the event; determination of attribution).  Any action 
resulting in a temporary  or permanent suspension of this study  (e.g., IRB actions,  or 
actions by [CONTACT_473])  will be immediately  reported to the funding  agency. [CONTACT_421129], the PI, will conduct a review  of all adverse  events  upon completion of every study 
participant with key personnel. [CONTACT_25274] will evaluate the frequency  and severity  of the 
adverse events  with key personnel and determine if modifications to the protocol or 
consent form are required  or if a stop in protocol  is required. [CONTACT_25274] will submit an 
annual report  summarizing all adverse events.
Safety and Study  Progress Reviews:
[CONTACT_25274] will lead a weekly research meeting  with key personnel  to review the status  of all 
enrolled participants  and discuss the eligibility  of potential  participants. At this weekly 
meeting, [CONTACT_25274] will review study  progress (i.e., recruitment goals, retention, protocol  
adherence). Any adverse events will be reviewed at this meeting,  including serious  adverse 
events that may have  been attended to outside of this weekly meeting. An annual progress

summarizes adverse  events, documents whether adverse event rates are consistent  with 
pre-study assumptions, summarizes recruitment and retention  and reason  for dropouts,  and 
summarizes study progress related  to the stated aims.
Data Quality and Management:
[CONTACT_25274] will supervise and train the Research Assistant and all key personnel on  study 
procedures to ensure that all procedures are followed and are in compliance  with the 
approved Yale University IRB protocol.  [CONTACT_25274] will also provide training and oversight to  
study staff to ensure data are generated,  documented,  and reported  according to 
requirements by [CONTACT_421118].  The Biostatistician, [CONTACT_30323], will also oversee quality assurance of data.

12.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design.
Write here
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and helpfulness of the real-time smoking  
intervention. We will use descriptive  statistics to summarize participant  ratings of satisfaction  
and perceived usefulness of the intervention at the end of treatment,  including characterizing 
adherence and feasibility of using  the smartband device  based on  self-report and objective 
adherence (i.e., number of days wearing the smartband).
Aim 2: Assess  the preliminary efficacy of the real-time intervention as an adjunct to standard 
tobacco treatment. We will compare biochemically confirmed 7-day  point prevalence  
abstinence at the end of treatment (i.e., reported abstinence from cigarettes during the last 
week of the study that is confirmed  with CO≤  4ppm) to estimate effect sizes for ST+ vs. ST. We 
will also compare continuous outcome  measures between ST+ and ST  that are proximal 
indices of good clinical response: number of days abstinent and changes in cigarettes  per 
smoking day from baseline to week  8. We will use independent sample t-tests to  compare total 
days abstinent  between ST+ and ST and a 2x2 mixed ANOVA (time  x condition) to compare 
changes in cigarettes per smoking  day from baseline to week  8.
Sample Size Justification  & Power Calculation: This study  is a developmental project testing  
the feasibility and potential efficacy of adding a novel intervention to enhance standard 
smoking cessation treatment.  Sample  size for the current study is based  on guidelines for 
Stage [ADDRESS_531369] size estimate37. Our target sample (25  per group) is 
sufficient to determine preliminary  efficacy  and estimate effect  sizes for the binary  cessation 
outcome, 7-day point  prevalence  abstinence at the end of treatment. This sample size 
produces two-sided 95% confidence intervals  for the difference in  population proportions with a 
half-width that is equal to 22%-24%  when the difference in abstinence rates between  groups 
(ST+ vs. ST) in estimated sample  proportions is 10%-15%  (e.g., 25% vs. 15%, 30% vs. 15%,

abstinent (SD=5) and a difference  of 6 cigarettes per smoking  day (SD=8) between baseline 
and end of treatment by [CONTACT_19313].

treatment from the Yale TTS service and the Winchester chest  clinic so we will be 
collaborating with their clinical  providers (e.g., APRN tobacco  treatment specialists, clinical 
pharmacists) and the administrative staff who schedules appointments and manages 
referrals for tobacco treatment. The tobacco treatment providers will be  providing clinical 
services to each patient in addition to being part of the research team. Participation in the 
study is completely voluntary  and does not impact the patient relationships  with the 
tobacco counselors or their other  healthcare providers.  This is outlined in detail  in the 
consent form.

Confidentiality & Security of Data:
1.What protected health information (medical  information along  with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected and used  for the research? We will collect names  and demographic  information. Identifiable 
information will be collected and used to enroll, treat, and contact [CONTACT_4317].  It will only be used for 
this purpose. This information  will be stored  in locked cabinet apart from the research records. Given  
that this trial involves adding an intervention to the clinical care of the Tobacco  Treatment Service  at 
Smilow Cancer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421101],  all participants will have a medical  record  as part 
of their clinical care. The medical records are in an electronic  format on a secure server apart from the 
paper research  records. Additional medical  information collected for research will be recorded  only with 
the subject  ID number.
This includes  information on smoking  status,  smoking cessation medication used during the study,

2.How will the research data  be collected,  recorded and stored?  Research data will be collected using in- 
person interviews,  survey assessments, objective measures of smoking behavior (via the 
smartband), and self-reports.  All identifiable information (names  and demographic information) will 
be stored in a locked  file cabinet.  All participants  will be assigned a study participant ID made up of 
numbers and letters. Subsequently, participants will be identified  in the Case  Report Forms (CRFs)  
only by [CONTACT_205627] (e.g.,  CM24). A list of IDs and the corresponding  names  will be maintained  by 
[CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a locked research cabinet.  All other research data (interviews, 
survey assessments, objective measures of smoking behavior, and self-reports)  will not contain 
identifiable information and will be labeled only with the subjects'  unique numerical indicator. The 
smoking data captured from the smartband  includes the time and date of smoking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  These  
data are available for the research team on a password-protected secure online dashboard.

What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated  above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
Several steps will be taken to safeguard  the confidentiality of subjects  and their data. Right to privacy  
for participation in this research will be protected through coding of data and proper storage of 
research records.  All research data that is collected  will be assigned a study participant number  and 
that number will be the only link between participant names/identifying information and the digital 
databases. The names  of participants will not be associated  with these  data and assessments will be 
maintained according to participant study  number. A master list connecting participant study numbers 
to participant names  will be kept in a locked  file cabinet where it can only be accessed by [CONTACT_291558].  Any information published as a result of the study  will be in aggregate and such that it 
will not permit identification  of any participant.
We are not directly assessing incidents  of child abuse or elderly abuse. However, if this information 
is disclosed by a participant or volunteer  in the context of this research, a report will be made  to the 
Department of Child and Families Services or other agency  as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Subjects will be 
informed of this limit to confidentiality as it is stated in the informed consent document.
All investigators and key personnel have taken the required Yale University  HIPAA training. Right to 
privacy for participation in this research  will be protected through coding of data and proper storage 
of research  records. A list of numbers  and the corresponding names will be maintained by [CONTACT_421124][INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked research cabinet.
Individually identifiable health information will be protected in accordance  with the Health  Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  and by [CONTACT_421125] (CFR)  Part 2, Subpart  E. All research personnel

Potential Benefits: Identify  any benefits  that may be reasonably expected to result  from  the research, either  to 
the subject(s)  or to society at large. (Payment  of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.)
All participants in this study will receive  standard care evidence-based  treatment for smoking  cessation. 
Half of the participants will also receive  real-time feedback about smoking behavior while  quitting  that 
may increase awareness of smoking  behavior and help promote  abstinence during their smoking  quit 
attempt. All participants  will be provided compensation for their participation in research procedures.
This research has the potential to benefit  other smokers who are trying  to quit in the future. There is a 
need to improve  smoking  treatment because most  quit attempts are unsuccessful. The purpose of this 
study is to test an innovative smoking intervention that may help improve cessation success. Improving 
smoking cessation outcomes could reduce the substantial harms  and healthcare costs associated  with 
smoking.
Importance of knowledge  to be gained:  Cigarette  smoking  is the leading  cause of preventable death. 
Promoting smoking  cessation could greatly  improve public health. Most  quit attempts are unsuccessful, 
suggesting innovations are needed  in the way we deliver treatment. This study is designed to test 
whether a novel  technology-based intervention  that delivers real-time  notifications when smoking is 
detected promotes cessation success above  and beyond standard tobacco  treatment.  Identifying 
effective technology-based interventions  could  provide a novel way to enhance the reach of tobacco 
treatment and provide  additional support to patients  flexibly, conveniently, and remotely.
1.Alternatives: What other  alternatives are available to the study subjects outside  of the research?
All participants will be receiving tobacco treatment  from TTS at YNHH or the Winchester  chest 
clinic. Alternatives to study participation include continuing standard TTS treatment or seeking  
alternative smoking treatment through an external program.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments,  and the conditions for receiving  this compensation.
Participants will receive financial compensation for their time spent completing  research  activities:
$20 for each appointment (week 0,4,8) for a total of $60. Participants  will earn a $[ADDRESS_531373] visit (week 8) and returning the smartband and charger. Participants will 
be paid using a Bank of America pre-paid debit card. We will have to share  participant  name,  
address, and telephone  number with Bank of America for ePayments and this information  is 
communicated in the consent form. The participant  will receive a card in the mail with the first 
payment. Each additional payment will be automatically added  to the card.
3.Costs  for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly  describe the subject’s costs  associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects.

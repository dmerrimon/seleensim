1. Introduction and Purpose:  
One out of three adults in the US is obese and forecasts predict that >50% of the US population will be 
obese by 2030.1  Although obesity is associated with increased risk for diabetes, many obese individuals 
remain free of metabolic disease.2  One factor that contributes to the heterogeneity of risk among obese 
individuals is visceral adipose tissue (VAT) distribution.[ADDRESS_394752] is independent of body mass index (BMI).[ADDRESS_394753] of Empagliflozin (EMPA) on glucose homeostasis 
associated with visceral adiposity has not been explored previously.   
 
My long term goal  is to understand how VAT contributes to diabetes risk and to identify strategies to 
reduce the metabolic consequences of excess VAT.   
My objectives here  are to:  
 Elucidate the mechanistic relationship  between VAT and abnormal glucose homeostasis.  
 Determine the effect of EMPA , a sodium glucose co -transporter [ADDRESS_394754] glucose homeostasis in viscerally -obese individuals using 
functional studies of glycerol metabolism in hepatic gluconeogenesis using a well -valida ted nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy platform.  The rationale  of this project is to utilize emerging 
technology to investigate potential mechanisms underlying diabetes risk related to excess VAT and 
explore the potential beneficial effects of EMPA on these pathways.  I will achieve the scientific 
objectives of this application by [CONTACT_319880] : 
 
1. Elucidate the relationship between VAT mass and glucose homeostasis by [CONTACT_319881] .  Here we will  measure the 
differential enrichment of exogenous 13C3-labeled glycerol vs. adipose -derived glycerol in blood glucose 
among non -diabetic obese adults with high vs. low VAT using a single venous blood sample.  
Hypothesis 1 : Participants with high VAT will have greater  adipose contribution of glycerol and therefore 
lower 13C3 glycerol  enrichment compared with age, sex, and BMI -matched participants with low VAT.  
2. Determine the effect of EMPA on glucose homeostasis in non -diabetic obese adults with 
differing VAT mass .  In this aim we will measure changes in the enrichment of 13C3 glycerol in response 
to treatment with EMPA or placebo among age, sex, and BMI -matched participants stratified by [CONTACT_319882]. low VAT.  
Hypothesis 2 : 13C3 glycerol  enrichment will increase from baseline (signifying less contribution from 
adipose tissue ) among EMPA -treated participants with high VAT, with no change in EMPA -treated low 
VAT or placebo -treated participants.  
 
2. Background:  
 
 
Diabetes mellitus type II is the consequence of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell failure 
resulting from a variety of metabolic insults, one of which is excess body adiposity/obesity.  In the 
Version 8, 10/13/17 
Page 3 of 22 diabetic individual, hepatic gluconeogenesis may go uninhibited due to f ailure of the body’s normal 
feedback mechanisms to appropriately incorporate glucose into cells via insulin signaling, leading to 
excess gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia. The substrate for this excess glucose derives from 
multiple sources in the liver inc luding dietary glycerol, adipose -derived glycerol from lipolysis, and 
substrates from the citric acid cycle.  In the normal state, lipolysis is maintained at a steady state in 
equilibrium between stored dietary triglycerides and free fatty acids.  However,  in situations of 
triglyceride excess (e.g. in the obese state), lipolysis may become overactive resulting in increased free 
fatty acids and adipose -derived glycerol.  This excess glycerol drives hepatic gluconeogenesis and is 
incorporated into glucose and  released into the blood, leading to hyperglycemia,  and ultimately 
diabetes and its clinical sequelae.  
 
A popular hypothesis linking visceral fat with excess gluconeogenesis is delivery of glycerol arising from 
mesenteric triglyceride turnover directly in to the portal circulation and to the liver.  Glycerol is a primary 
substrate for gluconeogenesis in the liver.  Under normal conditions, hepatic gluconeogenesis begins 
from glycerol ingested in the diet which is converted to glycerol -3-phosphate and subseq uently 
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in the liver.  DHAP is converted to fructose -1,6-bisphosphate 
which undergoes a series of reactions to become a single 6 -carbon glucose molecule.  Adipocytes 
contribute glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis through li polysis of triglyceride stores (Figure 1).  
Although glycerol -gluconeogenesis has been extensively studied in animals, the traditional reliance on 
radioactive tracers makes translation to humans difficult for many reasons.  We aim to use new 
techniques to explore the mechanisms behind altered glucose metabolism related to excess visceral 
adiposity in obese adults by  [CONTACT_319883] -derived 
glucose.  One such method uses 13C3 labeled glycerol to trace the  incorporation of glycerol from dietary 
sources to hepatic gluconeogenesis.  This technology utilizes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy, a technique that does not require ionizing radiation and has been extensively validated, 
to analyze the NMR  spectra of plasma glucose and quantify the “percent enrichment” of the circulating 
glucose molecules with labeled glycerol.  In turn, differences in enrichment reflect variability in hepatic 
glucose metabolism as it relates to the contribution of glycerol  from visceral adipose tissue to 
gluconeogenesis.  
 
The rationale of this project is to utilize existing technology to investigate the impact of excess visceral 
adiposity on glycerol metabolism in hepatic gluconeogenesis in obese adults without diabetes an d to 
explore the effects of treatment with EMPA on visceral adiposity related glucose homeostasis.  Our 
hypothesis is that among individuals with excess visceral adipose tissue, high lipolytic turnover results 
in excess adipose -derived glycerol shunting to  the liver and hyperactive gluconeogenesis.  This 
phenomenon will be reflected in a relatively low enrichment of dietary (labeled) glycerol when analyzed 
by [CONTACT_319884]. We also 
hypothes ize that 13C3 glycerol  enrichment will increase from baseline (signifying less contribution from 
adipose tissue ) among EMPA -treated participants with high VAT, with no change in EMPA -treated low 
VAT or placebo -treated participants.  
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  
Study Population : 
Obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) participants who are referred, or enrolled in the DHS, without prevalent type [ADDRESS_394755] an MRI as part 
of this study will be recruit ed.  Participants with high VAT will be selected and matched (age, sex, BMI) 
with an equal number of low VAT participants, defined by [CONTACT_319885] -and-sex stratified 
decile of VAT in the study population .  Individuals with prevalent dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_319866] 13C3 glycerol enrichment will be excluded.  Recruitment is highly likely to be successful given 
that >[ADDRESS_394756] been recruited to participate in additional mechanistic studies to date.    
 
Exposure variables : 
Version 8, 10/13/17 
Page 4 of 22 For the DHS subjects visceral adipose tissue (intraperitoneal + retroperitoneal) was measured by a 
1.5-T MRI system (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) between 2000 and 2002 
using a prospectively designed and validated method of fat ma ss prediction from a single MRI slice at 
the L2 -L3 inter -vertebral level (Figure 2).  Single slice measurement of visceral adipose tissue mass at 
this inter -vertebral level has been shown to be highly concordant with total abdominal fat mass 
measured at al l inter -vertebral levels (R2=85 -96%).  Multiple studies have been published 
demonstrating the validity of this method of visceral fat quantification.  Body composition was 
measured using dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA, Delphi W scanner, Hologic Inc, Bedfor d, MA and 
Discovery software [version 12.2]) and proprietary software will be used to calculate visceral adipose 
tissue mass from the DXA data. For referral subjects, an MRI prior to glycerol administration will 
measure abdominal visceral adipose tissue (V AT). These participants will undergo a neck -to-knee 
scan on a 3T Philips Ingenia MRI scanner lasting approximately [ADDRESS_394757] of clinical research. The de -identified, HIPAA -compliant images will then be 
interpreted offline by [CONTACT_319886]’s study assignment and a report will be 
generated for use in the data analysis.  
 
Body compositi on will be measured using height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference; 
body fat percentage will be calculated using both skinfold thickness at 7 different anatomical sites and 
bio-impedence analysis.  
 
Plasma blood glucose (mg/dL) measured by [CONTACT_319887].   
 
Blood samples will also be used to measure hemaglobin A1C, adipocytokines, markers of 
inflammation, plasma insulin, alanine, catecholamines, and nonesterified free fatty acids.   
 
Intervention : 
[U-13C3] glycerol 50 mg/kg (obtained from Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) will be given to 
participants to drink.  It is non -radioactive and non -toxic.  There is no known risk to drinking glycerol.  
Ingestion of this item is similar to dr inking a commericial sugar sweetened beverage.  If a participant 
cannot tolerate the drink initially, they will be given a second attempt at ingestion.  If after two attempts 
they cannot ingest the entire item, they will be removed from the study and a rep lacement participant 
will be recruited.  
 
Aim 2 will be an extension of Aim 1 in which all participants from Aim 1 will receive empagloflozin study 
drug or placebo for 12 weeks and then return for repeat testing.  Participants stratified by [CONTACT_319888] (high vs. 
low) will be randomized to either treatment or placebo using a random number generator (0 -100, 
http://www.random.org) followed by [CONTACT_319889]; ≤median will be assigned to 
treatment and > median will be assigned to placebo.  The minimum approved dose of empagliflozin (10 
mg tablet daily by [CONTACT_319890]) will be used in Aim 2 of this study; 
this dose was chosen to minimize the chances of adverse events (spe cifically hypoglycemia, 
dehydration, and urinary tract infections) while still maintaining efficacy in clinical trials and preliminary 
data.  We expect that this dose will be well tolerated, with the most common side effects being urinary 
tract infection o r yeast infection (in women).  
 
Outcome variables :  
Version 8, 10/13/17 
Page 5 of 22 [U-13C3] glycerol enrichment in plasma blood glucose over time will be measured by [CONTACT_319891].  
 
 
 
4. Study Procedures:  
Study procedures are outlined below.  Study procedures will be performed at baseline and then 
repeated after 3 months of study drug administration.  There will also be two (2) interval visits during 
which study participants will meet with the study coordinator to review study drug adherence, obtain 
the next mo nth’s supply of study drug, and perform surveillance for any adverse effects.  
 
Study drug will be either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily by [CONTACT_1966]) or matching placebo (once daily 
by [CONTACT_1966]). Both active drug and placebo will be obtained from the manufacture r (Boehringer -
Ingelheim) and will be administered by [CONTACT_464] (blinded to treatment allocation) in oral tablet form.  
Participants will randomized to either active drug or placebo using a random number generator (0 -
100, http://www.random.org); ≤median w ill be assigned to emagliflozin and >median will be assigned 
to placebo.

Page 6 of 22 Study participants do not need to be fasting for Visits 2 or 3 and no blood will be drawn at these 
interval visits. They are for study drug adherence/monitoring and drug dispensing only.  Each study 
visit [ADDRESS_394759] exiting the study prior to the 
expected completion date include withdrawl of informed consent, intolerance of the glycerol drink, 
intolerance of study procedures (IV insertion, blood draws), or meeting exclusion criteria that were not 
previously known through telephone screening.  Resear ch subjects will not be responsible for any 
costs of the study.   
 
  
 
5. Sub -Study Procedures: N/A  
 
6. Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:  
      - Obese, defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, at both time of abdominal fat imaging and at study entry.  
      - Ages 30 -65 
      - No prevalent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, either at the time of abdominal fat imaging or     
        at study entry.   
- Previous abdominal fat quantification by [CONTACT_319893] -to-knee MRI for VAT measurement may be performed.  
   
7. Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:  
      - Pregnant or breastfeeding  
      - Incarcerated  
      - Chronic kidney or liver disease  
      - History of frequent (>2/year) urinary tract infections   
      - Non-obese either at time of abdominal fat imaging or at present.  
      - Greater than 10% change in body weight (kg) between time of abdominal fat imaging and  
         present.  
      - Has donated blood within last [ADDRESS_394760] of the protocol  
- If undergoing MRI, persons with metal implants contraindicated for 3Tesla MRI exams will be 
excluded. Severe claustrophobia will also be assessed prior to an MRI exam.  
 
The incl usion/exclusion criteria above were chosen because:  
- Subjects must be obese and non -diabetic to meet the study objectives and test the study 
hypothesis.  
- Pregnant or breastfeeding women, incarcerated individuals, and children/minors are excluded 
because these are special populations with higher risk and exclusion of these participants 
minimizes risk of the study.  
- Chronic kidney or liver disease can possibly affect the outcome measurement in the study and 
confound the results.  Additionally, for Aim 3, emp agliflozin should be avoided in persons with 
chronic kidney or liver disease, so participants with these disorders will be excluded to minimize 
risks to human subjects.  
Version 8, 10/13/[ADDRESS_394761] infections will be excluded to minimize risk to human subjects.  
 
8. Sources of Research Material:  
 The research materials that will be used for this proposal include demographic records and data 
(age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, abdominal MRI and dual x -ray absorptiometry imaging 
data currently collected and maintained in the Dallas Heart Stud y database), blood samples, and 
urine samples (females capable of pregnancy only).  The blood and urine specimens will be taken 
at the time of study procedures and processed immediately.  No samples will be stored.  The 
database records that will be utiliz ed include age, sex, race, cardiometabolic risk factor status, and 
data generated from blood tests and imaging phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_319868].  
 Prospective data to be obtained include current age, weight, height, waist circumference, hip 
circumference, calculated body fat percentage using both skinfold thickness at [ADDRESS_394762] (females only).  
 For Aim 2, the FDA -approved drug, empagl iflozin 10 mg by [CONTACT_34048], will be administered to 
those participants randomized to drug treatment.  A matching placebo will be administered to 
participants not randomized to empagliflozin treatment. Both active drug and placebo will be 
obtained from th e manufacturer (Boehringer -Ingelheim).  
 No member of the study team will have access to individually identifiable private information about 
human subjects in the DHS. The DHS study coordinators have access to this information but are 
not part of the study t eam.  
 Every study participant was assigned a randomly generated subject ID that is not linked to 
identifiable information. All data generated from a study participant is labeled with only their unique 
subject ID, including blood specimens and database reco rds. The database records are kept on 
password protected servers in the DHS research center and managed by [CONTACT_319894]. Investigators must have approved and authorized proposal to gain access to 
these data and all data trans fers are managed by [CONTACT_319895]. All analyses for 
this project will be conducted on site by [CONTACT_319896]. Measurements made during this 
study will be linked to participants in the database by [CONTACT_319897].  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
Obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) participants who are referred, or enrolled in the DHS, without prevalent type 
[ADDRESS_394763] previously undergone VAT imaging by [CONTACT_319898].  
Participants with high VAT will be selected and matched (age, sex, BMI) with an equal number of low 
VAT participants, defined by [CONTACT_319885] -and-sex stratified decile of VAT in the study 
population.  Individuals with prevalent dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_319869] 13 -C3 glycerol 
enrichment will be excluded.  Recruitment is highly likely to be successful given that >[ADDRESS_394764] been recruited to participate in additional mechanistic studies to  date.   All 
participants will be volunteers and not recruited from a clinical practice. Both genders as well as 
minorities will be actively recruited for participation in this study.  Participants will be recruited for a 
visit via telephone by [CONTACT_319899] (IN).  A confidential telephone translation service will be 
used if the participant is a non -English speaker.  All attempts to ascertain inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be made prior to the visit.  Subjects will participate after having the  purpose and benefits of the 
study explained in detail by a research nurse.  In addition, a detailed list of potential adverse reactions 
will be reviewed as part of informed consent.  These participants will be assured that the lack of 
participation in the  study will in no way affect their ability to obtain medical care at UTSW.  
Version 8, 10/13/17 
Page 8 of 22 Documentation of permission to participate in this study will be obtained using a UTSW IRB approved 
written informed consent form.  No waiver of informed consent will be requested.  Participants will be 
paid an incentive to participate in the research. Parking tickets from the Clements Imaging Building 
valet service will be validated.   
 
A partial waiver of HIPPA authorization for screening purposes will be requested.  This is a waiv er 
used only for collection of initial screening data to determine eligibility and/or recruit potential research 
subjects. Authorization by [CONTACT_319900].  This is justified because 
it is not practical to obtain a sign ed HIPPA Authorization form prior to review of the records of potential 
participants because review of records is required to screen for a participant's eligibility for study 
participation. Over 3000 HIPPA Authorization forms (all participants in phase 3 o f the Dallas Heart 
Study) would need to be completed prior to screening of records to determine the eligibility of study 
participants if records cannot be reviewed for eligibility purposes beforehand. This is not practical and 
the study could not be effect ively conducted in this manner.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria could not 
be determined without access to the PHI.  This would also not be possible with the use of de -identified 
information.  
 
10. Potential Risks:  
 Adverse Reaction to Empagliflozin  
Known a dverse effects of empagliflozin include hypoglycemia (0.4%), dehydration (0.3%), impaired 
renal function (change in eGFR -1.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared placebo), and an increased risk of 
urinary tract infection (9.3%) or vaginal yeast infection (5.4%).  The most common adverse reactions 
associated with empagliflozin were urinary tract infections and vaginal yeast infections.  
 Risks of IV Insertion and Blood Drawing   
Participants may experience a small amount of pain in the arm when the needle is inserted into the 
vein.  Risks associated with drawing blood from the arm include minimal discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, excess bleeding, clotting, and/or fainting also are possible, although unlikely.  Participants will 
have  less than 1½ cups  of blood collecte d because they are in this research study.  
 13C Labeled Glycerol   
Labeled glycerol is non -radioactive and non -toxic and there is no known risk to drinking labeled glycerol. 
The glycerol will taste sweet and will be mixed with a glass of drinking water.  
 MRI 
The subject’s experience during this procedure is identical to what they would experience during a 
clinical MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).  MRI involves the use of a magnet and radio frequency 
energy.  Therefore, patients who have implanted metal device s, such as pacemakers, certain aneurysm 
clips, or metal in the eye will be excluded.  If subjects have any potential for metal in the body, the 
technologist or investigators should be informed before entering the magnet room. Because of the 
strong magnetic  field associated with the scanner, it is rare, but possible, that a metallic object could fly 
through the air toward the scanner and hit the subject.  To reduce this risk, everyone near the magnet 
will remove all metal from his or her clothing or pockets when in the scanning environment. There are 
no known risks or adverse effects resulting directly from exposure to magnetic fields and radio frequency 
energy used in this study. Some people feel claustrophobic in the MR scanner. If the subject is unable 
to tolerate being in the scanner, the scan can be stopped at any time. In addition, the MR scanner 
produces tappi[INVESTIGATOR_173194], which may reach very loud levels. To minimize any 
discomfort from this noise, the subject will be provided with dispos able earplugs and/or headphones 
that suppress external noise levels but do not eliminate voice communication with the scanner operator. 
In some cases, it is possible that the subject might experience neurostimulation effects, such as muscle 
twitches and ti ngling sensations, due to the rapid switching of magnetic field gradients used in these 
examinations. There are no known risks associated with these effects.  
 
Version 8, 10/13/[ADDRESS_394765] will then consult with their primary care physician to discuss further 
tests and/or follow -up and tr eatment.  
 
 Risks to an Embryo, Fetus or Breast -fed Infant  
Females : If females are part of this study while pregnant or breast -feeding an infant, it is possible that 
they may expose the unborn child or infant to risks.  For that reason, pregnant and breast -feeding 
females cannot participate in the study.  If participants can become pregnant, a pregnancy test will be 
done from a urine sample, and it must be negative before they can be a part of this study.  If they do 
become pregnant during this study, they mu st tell the researchers immediately, and they will be 
removed from the study.  
 Loss of Confidentiality  
There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality any time information is collected.  Every effort will be 
made to keep participant information confide ntial; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  
 Other Risks  
There may be other side effects that are unknown at this time. If participants are concerned about other, 
unknown side effects, they will discuss this with the researchers.  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data  Monitoring:  
Type of Research Data or Events to be Monitored:  
All research activities described in the project summary will be monitored in addition to study data 
accrual, protocol deviations, protocol violations, unanticipated problems, and adverse events.  
 
Methods and Frequency of Analysis:  
All research staff will have appropriate training to ensure the safety of participants, the appropriate 
conduct of research, and the integrity of safety and/or efficacy of data.  This training includes completion 
of all University -required training in the policies and procedures to protect the rights and welfare of 
people who participate in research.   
 
Subjects will be fully informed about the study requirements throughout the conduct of the trial by [CONTACT_3433] e 
study personnel.  At the beginning of the study, it will be noted in the research record that the subject 
received complete information about the study requirements.  Study personnel will give participants 
information relevant to continued participation.    
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_319870]. Monitoring will be performed weekly by [CONTACT_978]. The conclusions 
of the monitoring will be reported to the IRB in writing if there is any change in the risk/benefit ratio for 
subjects or if there is any new info rmation which may affect a subject’s willingness to continue 
participation. Monitoring will include consideration for (1) progress of the trial, (2) data quality, (3) 
timeliness of data collection, (4) recruitment, (5) accrual and retention, (6) risk vs. b enefit for 
participants, (7) protocol violations, and (8) other factors that could affect the outcome of the study.  
Monitoring will be documented in the research record.

Investigational New Drug (IND) Exemption:  
Empagliflozin has been FDA approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control 
in adults with type 2 diabetes  The empagliflozin intervention component of the proposed study should 
be IND exemp t based on meeting IND exemption criteria.  Specifically,  
 
IND exemption criteria:  
(1) it is not intended to be reported to FDA 
in 
support of a new indication for use or to 
support any other significant change in the 
labeling for the drug;  As a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_319874] (glycerol enrichment in blood 
glucose), this will not support a label change or new 
indication.  
(2) it is not intended to support a significant 
change in the advertising for the product;  See response to  (1). 
(3) it does not involve a route of 
administration or dosage level, use in a 
subject population, or other factor that 
significantly increases the risks (or 
decreases the acceptability of the risks) 
associated with the use of the drug product;  The rou te of administration and dosage level are 
FDA approved for use in patients with type [ADDRESS_394768] population will be obese volunteers who are 
otherwise health y; it is expected that use of the drug 
product will not significantly increase risks in this 
population.    
(4) it is conducted in compliance with the  
requirements for IRB review and informed 
consent [21 CFR parts 56 and 50, 
respectively];  IRB review is b eing obtained for the 
intervention/clinical trial aim of this study.  
(5) it is conducted in compliance with the  
requirements concerning the promotion and 
sale of drugs [21 CFR 312.7];  Use of empagliflozin in this capacity will be 
investigational; promotional claims of safety and 
Version 8, 10/13/17 
Page 11 of 22 effectiveness for obesity or diabetes will not be 
made.  
(6) it does not intend to invoke 21 CFR 
50.24.  We will obtain written informed consent.  
 
12. Procedure s to Maintain Confidentiality:  
Subjects will be assigned an identification code. A subject's name [CONTACT_319904] a 
small notebook and will be kept in a locked cabinet in the research coordinator's locked office.  The 
research chart will contain personal health information and will be kept in locked file cabinet in the 
research coordinator's locked office.  All other data on a computer will be de -identified with the subject's 
identification code.  Blood samples waiting for analysis will no t be labeled with the subject's name, but 
with the assigned identification code.  
 
The study database will be password protected. No data will be sent over the internet unless it is 
encrypted. All email with subject -identifiable information will be password  protected.  Only key personnel 
will have access to the information in the study database on an as -needed basis. Key personnel may 
not alter the data in the database or directly view all of it without specific cause and approval of the PI.  
Subjects will b e advised that representatives of the Sponsor and the UT Southwestern Medical Center 
IRB may review their medical and research records to assure the quality of information used in this 
research. A HIPAA “Authorization for Disclosure” will be obtained from each study participant. A 
Certificate of Confidentiality is not needed for this study.  The research coordinator will keep the original 
signature [CONTACT_319905], which will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet in a locked office.  Each subject will receive a photocopy of consent documents.   
 
Neither the PI [INVESTIGATOR_319875]. All have submitted a report of financial interest to the Conflict of Interest Office at UT 
Southwestern within the past twelve months.  
 
13. Potential Benefits:  
 There is a potential benefit of the proposed research to study participants in the form of weight loss. 
However, researcher cannot guarantee any direct benefit to the study participants.  Knowledge 
gained from this project will likely lead to better unders tanding of diabetes in the general population 
and across ethnic minorities and women as well as potentially lead to improved targets of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_319876].  
 The risks outlined in this proposal are reasonable for this societal benefit  as it may lead to improved 
care to reduce diabetes risk, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S.  
 
14. Biostatistics – Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Aim 1 Sample size calculation : Assuming 20% 13C3 enrichment in subjects with low VAT (based o n prior 
work), and an expected enrichment of between 15 -18% among those with high VAT (SD 2%), for Aim 
[ADDRESS_394769] to require 20 subjects per group to achieve 87% power to detect a 2% difference between 
groups at an alpha level of 0.05.  Because we expect some patients may be deemed ineligible or 
withdraw consent in the interim between recruitment/informed consent is signed and undergoing study 
procedures , we will recruit up to a total of [ADDRESS_394770] udy procedures  (see sample size table).  The study will be stopped after [ADDRESS_394771]

Aim 1 Statistical analysis : Data will be expressed as means ± standard deviations.  The primary 
outcome of mean [ U-13C3] enrichment of blood glucose at study end will be compared between high 
VAT and low VAT groups using the Student’s t -test.  Plots of [ U-13C3] enrichment over time for each 
group will be constructed to compare the trajectory of glycerol enrichment over time between groups  
and compared using a mixed linear model.  The association between VAT and change in plasma blood 
glucose with glycerol challenge will be analyzed within each subject using a paired t -test and between 
groups by [CONTACT_319901]’s t -test.  The relationship between VAT 
and glycerol enrichment will also be modeled using linear regression and adjusted for potential 
confounders of age, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, triglycerides, lean mass, liver fat, abdominal 
subcutaneou s fat mass, and biomarkers.  
 
Aim 2 Sample size calculation : Assuming a mean change of 2% (SD 1.5%) [ U-13C3] enrichment after 
treatment with EMPA, for Aim [ADDRESS_394772] to require 8 paired measurements in each arm to achieve 
84% power to detect this differenc e at an alpha level of 0.05.  Assuming an estimated 20% dropout rate 
consistent across groups we will still have sufficient power to detect this mean difference within each 
treatment arm using the planned enrollment strategy.   
 
Aim 2 Statistical analysis : See Aim 1 above.  The primary outcome of change in mean [ U-13C3] 
enrichment of blood glucose within each treatment assignment will be tested using the paired t -test.  
Secondary outcomes comparing post -treatment glycerol enrichment across groups will be te sted with 
ANOVA.    
 
For all statistical testing, a 2 -sided p-value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  All 
statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS  Corporation, Cary, NC).

Figure 1.  
Title: Schematic of Glycerol Metabolism in Gluconeogenesis in Liver and Adipose Tissues  
Caption : Glucose as a product of hepatic gluconeogenesis is comprised of a 6 -carbon molecule 
derived from glycerol via multiple different metabo lic pathways including exogenous glycerol from 
dietary sources and adipose tissue -derived glycerol produced from lipolysis of triglyceride stores.  In 
the liver, glycerol (Gly) is converted to glycerol -3-phosphate (G3P) and subsequently 
dihydroxyacetone ph osphate (DHAP) which is in equilibrium with glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate 
(GA3P).  Both DHAP and GA3P are converted to fructose -1,6-bisphosphate which is serially 
enzymatically converted to fructose -6-phosphate, glucose -6-phosphate, and ultimately glucose.  I n 
adipose tissue, triglycerides (TG) undergo lipolysis to form free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol (Gly) 
which then shuttles to the liver to enter into the same gluconeogenesis pathway as that of exogenous 
glycerol.  Therefore, free plasma glucose can be c omprised of two glycerol molecules from either 
exogenous or lipolytic sources in any combination.

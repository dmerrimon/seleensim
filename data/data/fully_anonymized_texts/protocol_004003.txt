1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Primary objectives:  
1. To determine the clinical activity (CR +CRi)  of the combination of AZA and 
sorafenib  in patients with untreated  acute myeloid leukemia  and High risk 
MDS  with FLT3 -ITD mutation . 
1.2 Secondary  objectives:   
1. To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of AZA and sorafenib  in 
patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemias and MDS with FLT3 -ITD 
mutation.  
 
2. To determine potential mechanisms  of synergy  with this combination and its 
correlation with response.   
 
2.0 Background  
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a neoplasm involving  immature granulocytes or monocytes. 
AML  is characterized by [CONTACT_835191] o f leukemic blast s and blockade of normal bone marrow 
hematopoietic cell production resulting in thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. In the 
U.S., approximately 12,[ADDRESS_1159725] treatment for AML includes systemic combination chemotherapy to 
control bone marrow and systemic disease. Treatment is generally divided into an induction 
phase, to att ain remission, and a consolidation  phase. Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with 
AML can be expected to attain complete remission status following appropriate induction 
therapy. Remission rates in adult AML are inversely related to age, with an expected remi ssion 
rate of >65% for those younger than 60 years. Increased morbidity and mortality during 
induction appear to be directly related to age (Sheinberg, 2005).  
 
Signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is frequently deregulated  in hematological 
malign ancie s.1 FLT3 (FMS -like tyrosine kinase III) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that 
belongs to the Class III family of RTKs. FLT3 is primarily expressed on immature hematopoietic 
progenitors and also on some mature myeloid and lymphoid cells .2-4 FLT3 is activated following 
binding of FLT3 ligand, which causes receptor dimerization leading to increased kinase activity 
and activation of downstream signaling pathways including Stat5, Ras, and PI3’kinase .5  FLT3 
plays a normal role in the regulation of survival and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor 
cells, in particular by [CONTACT_835192]. FLT3 is also expressed in 
AML  cells from approximately 90% of patient s and stimulates survival and proliferation of 
leukemic blasts .6-8  
 
Additional ly, FLT3  is mutated in 30% of AML cases .9 The two leading types of mutations found 
in AML include internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (ITD, 17 -34%) and

 4 mutations in the activation loop (approximately 7%) .[ADDRESS_1159726] offered encouragement 
that when added to the conventional arsenal of AML treatments, patients with AML expressing 
mutated FLT 3 may experien ce significant clinical benefit.11 
2.1 Sorafenib  
Sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer -Onyx) is an oral, small molecule kinase inhibitor that was initially 
developed as a Raf inhibitor. Subsequent lab oratory characterization of sorafenib demonstrated 
that it is a multikinase inhibitor of several other targets including vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor -2 (VEGFR -2), VEGFR -3, and platelet -derived growth factor receptor -beta 
(PDGFR -[beta]) . Due to its inhibition of VEGFR, sorafenib has bee n classified as an 
antiangiogen ic drug.  Sorafenib garnered initial attention when its antitumor activity in renal cell 
cancer was noted in early clinical trials. More recently, on the basis of a phase III trial, sorafenib 
was approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic renal 
cancer and hepatocellular cancer . 
Sorafenib was initially identified through a library screen as a sm all molecule that inhibits C -Raf. 
In additio n to C -Raf, s orafenib is a multikinase inhibitor of several other targets including wild 
type and mutant B -Raf, VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, PDGFR -[beta], Flt -3, c-Kit, and fibroblast growth 
factor receptor -1. In contrast, Erk1, Erk2, insulin -like growth factor, c -met, EGFR, and protein 
kinase C are not inhibited by [CONTACT_44369].12 
A series of phase I trials involving a range of sorafenib doses (50 –800 mg) and schedules 
(intermittent and continuous) have been conducted. Plasma drug levels of 400 mg twice daily are 
well tolerated and higher than those necessary to inh ibit Raf kinase, as well as VEGFR and 
PDFGR. Thus the recommended dose for single agent phase II testing is 400 mg twice daily.  
In the phase I studies, sorafenib was well tolerated; the rate of grade [ADDRESS_1159727] common drug -related side effects were hand -foot 
syndrome (23%), rash (26%), fatigue (39%), diarrhea (55%), hypertension (35%), stomatitis 
(7%), neuropathy (22%) and alopecia (16%).  
Based on results from preclinical and phase I studies, soraf enib was expected to cause growth 
arrest and clinical disease stabilization rather than tumor shrinkage . Assessment of cytostatic 
drugs and disease stabilization in phase II studies is challenging in that it is often difficult to 
distinguish drug effect ve rsus prolonged natural history of the disease in any single patient . One 
proposed phase II design for cytostatic agents is the randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) . 
In the sorafenib RDT phase II trial, all patients initially received sorafenib 400 mg twi ce daily 
for 12 weeks; patients who experienced >25% tumor reduction in bidimensional measurements 
(modified WHO criteria) at the 12 -week evaluation were continued on the drug. Patients with 
>25% tumor growth in bidimensional measurements after the 12 -week  run-in phase, were taken 
off the study. Patients with <25% reduction and <25% growth within the first 12 weeks were 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – [ADDRESS_1159728], but 
also, and perhaps more i mportantly, selects (or enriches) the trial for patients most likely to 
experience the endpoint of disease stabilization.  
The latter trial design characteristic is especially important as the trial was originally designed to 
evaluate activity of sorafenib in colorectal cancer based on its Raf inhibitory properties and the 
role of the Raf pathway in this disease .  The trial also, however, allowed recruitment of patients 
with other malignancies. During the study, investigators noted tumor regression in renal cell 
cancer (RCC) patients and the protocol was thus amended to expand enrollment of this cohort. A 
total of 202 patients with RCC (502 total with all tumor types) were treated during the run -in 
phase, 73 had tumor shrinkage ≥ 25%; 66 patients with stable disease at 12 weeks were 
randomized to sorafenib or placebo. At 24 weeks, 50% of sorafenib -treated patients were 
progression -free in comparison with 18% of placebo -treated patients ( P = 0.007). Additionally, 
median progression -free survival from randomization was significantly longer with sorafenib (24 
weeks) than placebo (6 weeks; P = 0.009). Of note, only a small number of patients 
demonstrated objective tumor regressions that would qualify as partial responses according to 
RECIST criteria; thus the RDT design of this phase II trial allowed investigators to quickly 
identify an active therapy that may have been mistakenly classified as inactive in traditional 
phase II trial designs . 
A large multicenter randomized phase III trial in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC was 
initiated .16 Eligibility was limited to patients with clear cell RCC who progressed on one prior 
systemic therapy within 6 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grou p (ECOG) performance 
<2, and no brain metastases. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary endpoints 
included progression -free survival toxicity and response rate. The progression -free survival 
analysis was designed to be evaluated after 363 e vents with a nominal one -sided P-value of 0.01. 
The survival analysis was designed to be evaluated after 540 events with a nominal two -sided P-
value of 0.04 and with interim analyses after 270 events. 905 patients were randomized to 
receive either sorafeni b 400 mg twice daily or placebo; no crossover to sorafenib was initially 
allowed on the trial. The preliminary results were presented at the 2005 American Society of 
Clinical Oncology annual meeting. Among the 335 patients who received sorafenib, only 2% 
achieved a partial response according to RECIST criteria, but 78% demonstrated stable disease, 
with a majority of these patients experiencing some tumor shrinkage. Progression -free survival, 
however, was significantly prolonged in the treatment arm, with th ose receiving sorafenib 
demonstrating a time to progression of 24 weeks versus 12 weeks ( P < 0.000001). Due to this 
marked positive clinical benefit, the protocol was amended to allow patients on the placebo arm 
to receive sorafenib. In addition, sorafenib  was approved by [CONTACT_546080] 2005 for the 
treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic RCC.  
The analysis of this trial was updated recently after 367 survival events occurred: patients on the 
sorafenib arm had a continued improvement in overall s urvival of 19.3 months versus 15.9 
months for placebo arm ( P = 0.015; hazard ratio 0.77), despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 48% of patients

 6 initially randomized to the placebo arm crossed over to receive sorafenib . In the final report, the 
OS of patients receiving sor afenib was comparable with that of patients receiving placebo (17.8 
v 15.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; P = .146); however, when post -cross -over 
placebo survival data were censored, the difference became significant (17.8 v 14.3 months, 
respectively; HR = 0.78; P = .029).17 
Again, s orafenib was well tolerated with very few grade 3 or 4 toxicities seen. Toxicities 
experienced in the treatment arm included hand –foot syndrome, hypertension, rash,  and fatigue. 
In preclinical studies, sorafeni b induced dephosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK and induced 
apoptosis in AML cells.12 Further more, sorafenib was 1000 - to 3000 -fold more potent in 
inducing apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3 -ITD or D835G mutations than those with WT 
FLT3.[ADDRESS_1159729] dose of 400 mg twice daily.  In phase I studies and  used 
anecdotally in patients with advanced AML, sorafenib was capable of producing  significant 
clinical responses.   The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility, safety and 
efficacy of combining sorafenib with induction chemotherapy.  
2.2 Azacitidine  
 
Azacitidine  (AZA) , an analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine, has effects on c ell 
differentiation, gene expression, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and metabolism. 
Since the early 1970s, azacitidine has been investigated primarily in the US for the treatment of 
acute leukemia. Clinical studies have focused mainly on patien ts with disease refractory to 
conventional chemotherapy. Results of these investigations demonstrated activity of azacitidine 
in the treatment of AML. Clinical studies subsequently evaluated the effects of azacitidine in a 
variety of other malignant and he matologic disorders, including solid tumors, 
hemoglobinopathies (eg, thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), and MDS. In 1984, the Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) began a series of clinical studies with azacitidine in patients with 
MDS. These studies, in addition to other supportive data, led to the approval of Vidaza® 
(azacitidine) in May 2004 for the treatment of MDS.  
 
Azacitidine inhibits the methylation of newly synthesized DNA by [CONTACT_835193] (DNMT). Increased methylation of DNA ( hypermethylation) may result in the 
silencing of critical genes responsible for cell growth control and differentiation. 
Hypermethylation of CpG islands spanning the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is 
commonly associated with cancers. It is now widely recognized that hypermethylation of DNA is 
frequently associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and other cancers,  such as renal, 
melanoma, breast, colorectal, non -small cell lung and hematologic malignancies. Azacitidine is 
believed to exert its an tineoplastic effects through hypomethylation and cytotoxicity on abnormal 
hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes 
that are critical for differentiation and proliferation.  The cytotoxic effects of azaciti dine cause the 
death of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91786], including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal 
growth control mechanisms.

The cytotoxicity of azacitidine is proportional to dose and exposure time. Although the 
mechanisms of cytotoxicity a re complex and multifaceted, there is general agreement that 
incorporation of azacitidine into DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA), and inhibition of protein 
synthesis, are critically important. Cytotoxicity is greatest in cells that are proliferating (S  phase)  
and metabolically active. Cytotoxic effects may also be mediated through induction of the DNA 
damage response pathways. Non -proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine.  
 
Toxicology studies have been conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and Rh esus monkeys. Most of the 
studies were performed during the 1970s and early 1980s according to existing guidelines and 
standards in place during that period. The preclinical studies identified the bone marrow, liver, 
kidneys, and lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus) as the main target organs of 
toxicity for azacitidine.  In single -dose studies, the lethal dose of azacitidine after intravenous 
(IV) administration in mice, rats, and dogs was approximately 250 mg/m2. Repeated daily dosing 
appears  to increase the toxicity of azacitidine. The genotoxicity of azacitidine is consistent with 
that of other nucleoside analogs that interact with nucleic acids. Likewise, similar to other agents 
with cytostatic properties, azacitidine was embryotoxic and re duced the reproductive 
performance in mice and rats.  
 
Limited azacitidine pharmacokinetic data are currently available. Based on human plasma 
concentrations of total radioactivity (which represents parent drug plus circulating metabolites), 
azacitidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_165591] (SC), with maximum plasma 
concentrations found 0.5 to 2 hours after dosing. Azacitidine and/or its by -products are then 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_339104]. The half -lives and percent radioactivity recovered in urine a re 
similar following IV and SC routes of administration. The effects of renal or hepatic impairment, 
gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. A single dose 
(75 mg/m2) SC versus IV crossover study in 6 MDS subjects revealed an approximate 
bioavailability of 89% for the SC dose (range 52% to 128%) with mean half -lives of 0.69 hour 
and 0.36 hour after SC and IV administration, respectively. These results demonstrated that 
azacitidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_835178]. The apparent SC clearance (167 L/h or 2791  mL/min) and systemic IV 
clearance (147 L/h) of azacitidine exceeded the glomerular filtration rate (approximately 125 
mL/min) and total renal bloo d flow (1200 mL/min) in healthy subjects. This indicates that non -
renal elimination (eg, metabolism, hydrolysis, and/or degradation) plays a role in the elimination 
of parent azacitidine. In addition, azacitidine 75  mg/m2 was generally well -tolerated after  single 
SC injection or IV infusion over [ADDRESS_1159730] looked at different parenteral doses and schedules of azacitidine, 
finding maximum tolerated doses of up to 500 mg/m2 when administered weekly.  
 
During the two decades between the start of the CALGB studies and the approval of azacitidine, 
a new understanding of MDS has developed, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) 
diagnostic criteria, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), and the International 
Working Gro up (IWG) response criteria. Silverman et al. reevaluated the combined data 
(N = 309) from 3 of the CALGB studies using the WHO classification system for MDS and 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – 2014 -0076

 8 AML and the IWG response criteria. Using the IWG response criteria in MDS patients, response 
rates were between 40% and 70% in azacitidine treated patients. Ten to 17% of patients achieved 
a complete remission; partial remission was rare; and 23% to 36% of patients had a hematologic 
improvement. In patients with AML (N = 103), 35% to 48% had hematol ogic improvement or 
better responses. The median survival time for 27 patients assigned to azacitidine was 19.3 
months compared with 12.9 months for the 25 patients assigned to observation.  
 
A randomized international Phase III trial (Study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) for higher -risk 
MDS patients, classified by [CONTACT_525269], RAEB -T, or CMML with 0 -29% marrow blasts, 
with an IPSS of Intermediate -2 or High by [CONTACT_193403]/cytogenetic review was recently 
reported. Patients were randomized to azacitidine (75  mg/m2/day x 7days in 28 day cycles) or 
conventional care regimens (CCR) , where CCR was pre -selected by [CONTACT_835194] (transfusions, antibiotics, and G -CSF for neutropenic infection), low -dose 
cytarabine (20 mg/m2/day x 14 days in 28 day cycles); or standard chemotherapy (conventional 
induction/consolidation). Patients were stratified by [CONTACT_339122]/IPSS and randomized 1:1 to azacitidine 
or CCR. This trial did not allow erythropoietin. Three -hundred fifty eight patients (70% male) 
were rand omized at 79 centers to azacitidine (N=179) or CCR (N=179): best supportive care 
only (N=105, 59%), low -dose cytarabine (N=49, 27%), or standard chemotherapy (N=25, 14%). 
Median age was 69 years (range 38 -88 years). The azacitidine and CCR groups were comp arable 
for baseline patient characteristics. At baseline, 95% of patients were higher risk: RAEB (58%), 
RAEB -T/WHO AML (34%), CMML (3%), and other (5%). By [CONTACT_56623], 87% were higher risk: 
Intermediate -2 (40%), High (47%), and 13% Indeterminate/other. Azacitid ine was administered 
for a median of 9 cycles; low -dose cytarabine for 4 cycles. Median follow -up for the survival 
analysis was 21.1 months. Azacitidine demonstrated statistically superior overall survival 
compared to CCR, with a median overall survival of  24.4 months vs. 15 months for CCR 
(stratified log -rank p=0.0001, hazard ration 0.58). Two -year survival approximately doubled in 
the azacitidine arm compared to CCR: 51% vs. 26% (p<0.0001). Azacitidine was well tolerated 
with safety data consistent with p revious reports.  
 
Further details can be found in the azacitidine Investigator’s Brochure, which contains 
comprehensive pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, metabolism, 
preclinical, and clinical efficacy and safety data informatio n. 
A potential mechanism of resistance to FLT3 kinase inhibitors is high levels of FLT3 ligand (FL) 
which is commonly seen after treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We hypothesized 
that combining sorafenib with a less myelosuppressive agent, such  as 5-azacytidine (AZA), may 
lead to higher and more durable responses.  We have previously conducted a clinical trial 
combining azacytidine and sorafenib for the treatments of patients with relapsed AML. Patients 
received 5 -azacytidine (AZA) 75 mg/m(2) int ravenously daily for 7 days and sorafenib 400 mg 
orally twice daily continuously; cycles were repeated at ~1 -month intervals. This trial was 
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #[STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  Overall, 57 patients with AML with a median 
age of 65 years (rang e, 21 -87) were enrolled. They included 27 (47%) patients with normal 
cytogenetics, 12 (21%) with chromosome 5/7 or complex cytogenetic abnormalities, 15 (26%) 
with other miscellaneous abnormalities; 3 (5%) had insufficient metaphases. Prior to the 
initiati on of treatment, FLT3 -ITD was detected in 53/57 (93%) patients with a median allelic

 9 ratio of 0.348 (range, 0.009 – 0.934). They had received a median of 2 prior treatments (range, 0 
-7) including 13 previously untreated patients. Twenty (35%) patients had  received ≥3 prior 
regimens and 12 had failed prior therapy with FLT3 kinase inhibitors (6 with AC220, 2 with 
PKC412, and 9 with sorafenib, either as monotherapy or with chemotherapy or plerixafor); 4 
patients had failed 2 prior FLT3 inhibitors. The overal l CR/CRi/PR rate among the 57 patients is 
44%, including 16 (28%) with CRi and 8 (14%) with CR and 1 (2%) with PR. The response rate 
among the previously untreated patients was 62% and among relapsed patients 39%. Patients 
have received a median of 3 (rang e, 1 - 27) treatment cycles with the median number of cycles to 
response among the responders being 2 (range, 1 – 4) and the median time to achieving response, 
2.1 months (range, 0.8 – 4.6 months). The median duration of CR/CRi Is 2.4 months (range, 0.8 
– 24.8 months). Seven patients have proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant. The most 
common study drug -related adverse events were rash and fatigue with no deaths attributable to 
study medications. One patient developed grade 3 cardiomyopathy. With a m edian follow -up of 
8.6 months (range, 6.1 – 26.9), 13 patients remain alive, 5 still in remission. The median overall 
survival of the 57 patients was 6.3 months, and 12.4 months in the 25 responding patients. Mean 
FL levels at cycle 2, day 0 and cycle 2, d ay 10 were 27 pg/mL and 54 pg/mL, respectively, 
which is significantly lower than those seen previously in studies of FLT3 kinase inhibitor plus 
chemotherapy.18

status.  
 
*****  Labs will be colle cted once weekly for the first 2  cycles, then monthly t hereafter  
(differential can be omitted if WBC is ≤0.5 x109/L) 
****** Any tumor masses will be measured before and after the treatment to assess their 
response to treatment.  
 
4.2.1 Patients will be treated according to the following schedule:  
 
 Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 will be administered subcutaneously ( SQ) or intravenously 
(IV) daily for [ADDRESS_1159741] of the patient and 
only after discussion with the PI.  
 Sorafenib  will be administered orally  at a dose of [ADDRESS_1159742]  dose of each course of Azacitidine will 
constitute the beginning of the next cycle of treatment.  
 
Dose reductions for both agents are allowed but should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_835181].  
 
One cycle of therapy is defined 7 days of azacitidine and continuous dosing of 
sorafenib . Patients will receive one cycle of therapy  every 4 weeks  (with a desired 
dose schedule of 4 week cycles)  and can be delayed up to [ADDRESS_1159743]  PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473] .   
 
Subsequent courses of azac itidine will be given if the ANC is equal or greater tha n 
1.0 x109/L (or lower if the treating physician feels in the best interest of the patient 
and after discussion with PI ) and the platelets are equal  to or greater than 30 x109/L 
(unless transfusion dependent) , in the absence of residual leukemia in the bone 
marrow  (for the first 3 cycles of therapy, it is intended that the azacitidine cycles 
are administered every 4 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_835182]) . If prolonged myelosuppression (more than 60 days) 
with evidence of a hypocellular marrow (marrow cellularity less than 5% without 
evidence of leukemia) is observed subsequent courses of azacitidine may be given 
at a lower dose  after discussi on with the PI . If the peripheral counts do not recover 
(ANC <1 x109/L (or to baseline value)  and/or  platelets <30 x109/L (unless 
transfusion dependent ) but there is evidence of residual leukemia in the bone 
marrow , subsequent cycles can be administered earlier than 4 weeks at the 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – [ADDRESS_1159744] on the rate of releas e of the active sorafenib .   
 
Sorafenib will be administered 400 mg twice daily for 28 days/or until next cycle 
of Azacitidine is administered  in each cycle. Drug doses must be separated by 
[CONTACT_820797] 12 hours (+/ -3 hours).  
 
If a dose is missed, the next dose should not be increased to account for missing a 
dose. The subject should take the next regular dose at the regularly scheduled time.  
If a dose is vomited, do not take another dose of medication.  Wait until the next 
dose is due.  Tak e the next regular dose and do not increase it to account for 
missing a dose . 
 
Modifications to the schedule and/or dose of both/either drugs that are thought to 
be in the best interest of the patient are allowed after discussion with and approval 
by [CONTACT_941] P I. 
 
It is recommended that patients receive at least 3 cycles of therapy (as long as they 
are not clearly progressing and are tolerating it without significant toxicity) before 
deciding on termination of treatment . Patients will be eligible for efficacy 
assessment if they have received at least one full cycle of therapy (7 days of 
azacytidine and 28 days of sorafenib.  
4.3 Duration of Therapy :  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
1. Progressive disease  
2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
3. Patient request or  
4. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
It is planned that u p to a total of 24  cycles of therapy  will be administered for patients deriving 
benefit from this regimen. Continuation of th erapy for patients completing 24  cycles of therapy 
may be considered on a case by [CONTACT_835195].

 15 A minimum of 1 full course (defined as the administration of azacitidine for 7 days and 
sorafenib  for up to 28 days) will be required for a patient to be considered as having received an 
adequate trial to evaluate effica cy.  All patients receiving at least one dose of any of the two 
drugs will be considered evaluable for toxicity.   
 
4.4 Concomitant medications  
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307760]. Other anticancer agents including systemic 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic response modifiers are not permitted during the 
study.  No other investigational drug is allowed during the study. Patients must be off growth 
factors for five days in order to declare a neutrophil response. Prophylaxis may be used for the 
prevention of nausea and vomiting. Patients may be gi ven ondansetron  up to 3 times a day or 
granisetron  up to 2 times a day.  Ondansetron  and granisetron  are federally approved drugs and 
will not be supplied by [CONTACT_8996]/Onyx  or Celgene. Patients who suffer from Grade 3 or 4  nausea 
and/or vomiting, should be wit hheld from treatment and only restart if recovery occurs  when 
symptoms are controlled to a Grade 1 status Other antibiotics may be used at the discretion of 
the investigator  include, but are not limited to,  metoclopramide, promethazine , cyclizine,  and 
prochlorperazine . 
 
In the event of severe anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, patients may receive 
appropriate supportive care (e.g., transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals and/or 
antivirals, hematopoietic growth factors). In the event of hi gh white blood cell (WBC) counts, 
patients may receive hydroxyurea  or up to 2 doses  of ara -C prior to start  of study medication in 
order to keep their WBC at an acceptable level.  During the trial they may undergo 
Leukapheresis or receive further doses of hydroxyurea for the same purpose  (if necessary) .  
 
Concomitant administration of any other therapy specific for MDS, CMML or AML, including 
any use of systemic retinoids, is prohibited. Concomitant administration of any other anticancer 
therapy is prohibited.  Intrathecal chemotherapy is allowed, when indicated.  
 
Subjects may receive anti-infective prophylaxis  including azoles according to institutional 
practices. Use of recombinant myeloid colony stimulating factors  (CSF) is allowed, if patients 
have febrile neutropenia or documented infections.  The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers are not  
allow . 
5.0 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
 
Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity directly attributable to the study drugs should 
temporarily stop treatment ac cording to the guidelines in the dose adjustment schema.  
 
Toxicity grading will be according to the NCI CTCAE, v 4. To prevent unnecessary morbidity, 
the following guidelines for dose adjustment for drug -related toxicities are recommended.  
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – 2014 -0076  
 March 05 , 2015

 16 Dose Reductions  for non -hematologic toxicity possibly related to study drugs should be performed 
according to the following table:  
 
Toxicity  Grade  Actions

[CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_835183] . If toxicity 
recurs again, hold therapy unt il 
recovery to grade 1, then re -start 
and reduce one dose level.  Dose 
reductions below dose level -2 will 
be considered on an individual 
basis after discussion with the PI. 
For grade 4, the recommendation 
is to discontinue Sorafenib  
Non-hematological

recovery to grade 1, then re -start 
and reduce one dose level.  Dose 
reductions below dose level -[ADDRESS_1159745] the dose reductions implemented in subsequent cycles 
provided the toxicity has resolved as specified in the table above.  
5.1 Myelosuppression:  
Patients with leukemias and MDS usually present with abnormal peripheral blood counts at the 
time therapy is started and myelosuppression is an expected event during the course of therapy 
for acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes . Thus, no dose adjustments or treatment 
interruptions for myelosuppression will be planned for the first 4 weeks of therapy. After this 
time, treatment interruptions and dose adjustments may be considered according to the following 
guidelines:  
 
Patients w ith neutropenia or thrombocytopenia as a consequence of the  disease,  do not require 
treatment interruptions for myelosuppression. Dose -reductions in these patients should be 
considered in an individual case after discuss ion with the PI. The following guide lines can be 
used for these patients:  
 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – 2014 -0076  
 March 05 , 2015  
17 
 
 17 Patients with a response and pre -cycle  counts of neutrophils >  1 x109/L and platelets > 30 x109/L 
who have sustained low counts of neutrophils <0.5 x109/L or a platelet count < 20 x x109/L for 
more than 2 consecutive weeks in the current cycle, may receive a subsequent course.  A 
reduction of up to 2 dose levels may be considered if the myelosuppression was deemed severe 
and life threatening by [CONTACT_1963], and if it is in the pa tient's best interest  after 
discussion with the PI . 
 
If there are persistent peripheral blood  blast s, or the bone marrow shows >5% blasts, continue 
treatment regardless of neutrophil and platelet count and give supportive care as needed.  After 3 
cycles, th ere should be clear evidence of benefit (reduction in bone marrow blasts, improving 
counts with reduction in transfusion requirement or other clinical improvement in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_79465]) in order to continue treatment regardless of the co unts.  
 
If no marrow evidence of leukemia, may hold therapy with azacytidine until recovery of 
granulocytes to ≥1 x109/L and platelets ≥ 30 x109/L, then resume at same or 1 lower dose level 
according to guidelines mentioned above.  In general, in the absence of other toxicity, it is 
recommended that therapy with sorafenib is not interrupted in a responding patient even in the 
presence of cytopenias (unless discussed with PI).  
5.2 Dose escalation:   
Dose escalation of sorafenib to 60 0 mg twice daily will be permitted  provided:  
 
 Patient has not experienced any grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicity, and 
 Patient has not experienced hematol ogic grade 4 toxicity believed to be treatment related , 
and 
 This has been discussed and approve d by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_835184]’s clinical 
records  
Dose reductions /modifications/delays:    
Dose reductions for sorafenib -specific non  hematologic toxicity during subsequent cycles  should 
be performed according to the table  in section 5.[ADDRESS_1159746] not been met. The following tables describe the 
recommended dose modifications for sorafenib -associated toxicities:   
 
Variation in the dosing schedules discussed may be allowed if thought to be in the best interest 
of the patient and after discussing with the study PI.

Hypertension:  
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with Sorafenib 
treatment. Patients will have their blood pressure monitored and recorded weekly during the first 
cycle of therapy, either at the doctor’s office or by [CONTACT_835198] (such as 
those found at a local drug store or pharmacy). Patients will have a Blood Pressure Diary on 
which to record the measurements, which will be kept with research chart. If the patient’s blood

 March 05 , 2015  
20 
 
 20 pressure is sustained at an elevat ed level at any time (>150/100), they should contact [CONTACT_170122] . 
Blood pressure measurements considered out of the normal range are diastolic pressure > 90 mm 
Hg and/or systolic pressure > 150 mm Hg, or a 20 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure if the 
previous measurement was within normal limits.  
The dose -modification schedule to be followed in the event of treatment -induced  hypertension is 
outlined in Table 3.  The choice of anti -hypertensiv e medication to be used in cases 
of  treatment -induced hypertension will be at the investigator's discretion and based on 
site-specific treatment guidelines as applicable .  All anti -hypertensive medications used for the 
management of treatment -emergent hyp ertension should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.

6.0 Agent Formulation and Procurement  
 
Dose Preparation and Storage of azac itidine  (VIDAZA) : Azac itidine is commercially 
available and will  not be provided for the study by [CONTACT_27718]. Standard procedures should 
be used for preparation and administration of azacitidine . The following guidelines are 
suggested:  
 
VIDAZA is a cytotoxic drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution 
should be exercised when handling and preparing VIDAZA suspensions. (See Handling 
and Disposal.)  
 
If reconstituted VIDAZA comes into contact [CONTACT_8124], immediately and thoroughly 
wash with soap and water.  If it comes into contact [CONTACT_426881], flush  
thoroughly with water.  
 
The VIDAZA vial is single -use and does not contain any preservatives. Unused portions 
of each vial should be discarded properly.  See Handling and Disposal.  Do not save any 
unused portions for later administration.  
 
Preparation fo r Subcutaneous Administration : VIDAZA should be reconstituted 
aseptically with 4 mL sterile water for injection.  The diluent should be injected slowly 
into the vial.  Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved.  
The suspensio n will be cloudy. The resulting suspension will contain azacitidine 25 
mg/mL.  
 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – 2014 -0076  
 March 05 , 2015  
22 
 
 22 Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration:   Doses greater than [ADDRESS_1159750] be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution.  
 
Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration:  The reconstituted product 
may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. Doses greater than [ADDRESS_1159751] be refrigerated immediately, 
and may be held under refrigerated conditions (2ºC –8ºC, 36ºF –46ºF) for up to 8 hours. 
After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate 
to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration.  
 
Subcutaneous Administration : To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of 
the syringe must be re -suspended by [CONTACT_390220] 2 –[ADDRESS_1159752] ion (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at 
least [ADDRESS_1159753].   
Suspension Stability : Azacitidine reconstituted for subcutaneous administration may b e 
stored for up to 1 hour at 25°C (77°F) or for up to 8 hours between 2°C and 8°C (36°F 
and 46°F).   
 
Preparation for Intravenous Administration : Reconstitute the appropriate number of 
VIDAZA vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 1 0 mL sterile 
water for injection.  Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved.  The 
resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10mg/mL. The solution should be clear. 
Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulat e matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  
Withdraw the required amount of VIDAZA solution to deliver the desired dose and inject 
into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lac tated 
Ringer’s Injection.  
 
Intravenous Solution Incompatibility : VIDAZA is incompatible with 5% Dextrose 
solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the 
potential to increase the rate of degradation of VIDAZA and should therefore be avoided.  
 
Intravenous Administration : VIDAZA solution is administered intravenously.  
Administer the total dose over a period of [ADDRESS_1159754] be 
completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the VIDAZA vial.  
 
Solution Stability : VIDAZA reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored 
at 25°C (77°F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.

11.0     Background Drug Information  
       11.1   Sorafenib   
 
   Chemical Name:  
4–{4-[3-(4-chloro -3-trifluoromethyl -phenyl) ureido] -phenoxy} -pyridine -2 carboxylic 
acid methylamide -4-methylbenzensulfonate.  
 
  Other Names:    
  BAY 54 -9085 is the tosylate salt of SORAFENIB  
 
  Classification:    
  Kinase inhibitor (Raf, VEGF -R, and PDGF -R) 
 
  Mechanism of Action:   
 The ras/raf signa ling pathway is an important mediator of responses to growth signals 
and angiogenic factors. This pathway is often aberrantly activated in human tumors due 
to presence of activated ras, mutant b -raf, or over expression of growth factor receptors.  
     
 SORAFENIB is a potent inhibitor of c -raf, and wild -type and mutant b -raf in vitro. 
Additionally, further characterization of SORAFENIB revealed that this agent inhibits 
several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are involved in tumor progression (VEGF -
R, PDGF -R, Flt3, and c -KIT) and p38α, a member of the MAPK family.  
 
 Molecular Formula:   
  C12H16CIF 3N4O3 X C 7H8O3S

12.0     Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Refer to Appendix C  for Leukemia -Specific Adverse Event Recording and Reporting 
Guidelines.  Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Re port Form (CRF).   
 
12.1 Pregnancies :  
 
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study dosing period 
or within [ADDRESS_1159763] menstruation, estimated fertility date, pregnancy result and 
neonatal data etc., should be included in this information. The investigator will follow the 
medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the pregnancy is an SAE.  
When the outcome of the pregnancy falls under the criteria for SAEs [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly (including ano maly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAEs.  
- "Spontaneous abortion" includes abortion and missed abortion.  
- Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE r egardless of its 
relationship with the study drug.  
- If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as "possible" by [CONTACT_1275].  
- In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the "normality" of the infant is evaluated at the 
birth.  
- "Normality" of the miscarried fetus is evaluated by [CONTACT_612659] a congenital anomaly are obtained prior to  miscarriage.  
   
13.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
Sorafenib plus 5 -Azacitidine Initial Therapy – 2014 -0076  
 March 05 , 2015  
32 
 
 32 This is a single arm study using the dosage level recommended from a previously conducted and 
published phase I /II study in patients with relapsed AML . The sample size is 52. The trial will be 
conti nuousl y monitored for efficacy and toxicity (non -hematological ≥grade 3). The method of 
Thall, Simon, and Estey will be used to perform interim efficacy and safety monitoring.14  
13.1 Efficacy  
The primary endpoint is the overall response (CR+CRi) after three cy cles of treatment. The 
historical data suggested the overall response rate is 45%. With the assumption that the improved 
overall response rate to be 65%, it is estimated that a total of 52 evaluable patients will yield 
83% powe r at a significance level of 5% based on chi -square test. The trial will be continuously 
monitored. The study will be stopped early if the data suggest that:  
                                      Pr (
 > 0.45|data) < 0.05  
 
Here 
  is the overall response (OR) rate. That is, if at any time during the study we determine that 
there is a less than 5 % chance that the av erage OR rate is greater than 45%, we will terminate the 
study.  The OR rate is assumed to follow a non -informative prior of Beta ( 0.9, 1.1).  
13.2 Monitoring Of non -hematological ≥grade 3 toxicities  
With the concern of treatment related toxicity, the non -hematological toxicity ( ≥grade 3)  will 
also be closely monitored during the study.   
 
Denote the probability of toxicity by P E. We assume P E ~ beta (0.6,1.4 ).  Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_835188]:  
                                       Pr(P E > 0.3 | data)  > 0.9 5 .  
 
That is, we will stop the trial if, at any time during  the study, we dete rmine that there is more than 
95% chance that the toxicity is more than 30%.  
 
Patients will be monitored by a cohort size of 4 according to the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_835189] . The design software Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1) developed 
by [CONTACT_185997] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) was used to 
generate the futility/toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_185975].

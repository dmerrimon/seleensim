 Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial of AMG  [ADDRESS_298753] -line Therapy for Metastatic Adenocarcinoma 
of the Pancreas  
Study Phase:   3 
Indication:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  
Primary Objective:   To determine if the treatment of AMG 479 at 12 mg/kg and/or 20 mg/kg in 
combination with gemcitabine improves overall survival as compared with placebo in combination 
with gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To evaluate progression- free survival ( PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1  
• To evaluate the survival rate at 12- months,  and at the timepoints of   3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 
months  
• To evaluate objective response rate, time to disease progression, duration of response, and 
disease control rate (partial response [ PR} + complete response [ CR] + stable disease [ SD]) 
as per RECIST versi on 1.1  
• To evaluate subject incidence of adverse events, significant laboratory abnormalities, and 
immunogenicity  
• To evaluate AMG 479 dose exposure, dose intensity, and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and to evaluate relationships between AMG 479 exposure measures and selected safety and 
efficacy measures  
• To evaluate gemcitabine dose exposure, dose intensity in all subjects, and gemcitabine PK parameters in a subset of subjects  
• To evaluate patient reported hepatobiliary symptoms measured by [CONTACT_245676] – Hepatobiliary subscale questionnaire (FACT -Hep- HS) 
• To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 479 versus  (vs) placebo in combination with gemcitabine 
within an enriched sub- population defined by a single or composite biomarker (eg, high 
insulin growth factor binding protein- 3 [IGFBP -3] and/or low IG FBP-2) with respect to OS 
Hypotheses:    
AMG 479 at 12 mg/kg and/or  20 mg/kg in combination with gemcitabine will improve OS 
compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine in subjects wit h metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
H0: The OS hazard ratio of AMG 479 + gemcitabine relative to gemcitabine alone = 1.00  
H1: The OS hazard ratio of AMG 479 + gemcitabine relative to gemcitabine alone < 1.00  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study .  Subjects 
(n=825) will be randomized in a 2:2:[ADDRESS_298754] -line therapy in 1 of 3 arms : 
• Arm 1: AMG 479-p lacebo plus gemcitabine  
• Arm 2: AMG 479 at 12 mg/kg plus gemcitabine  
• Arm 3: AMG 479 at  20 mg/kg plus gemcitabine

Protocol Number:  20060540 Date:  20 September 2010 Page 4 of 115 
 Randomization will be stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (0 vs 1), the presence of liver metastases (Yes vs No), and by [CONTACT_101827] (Western Europe, [LOCATION_002], Canada, Australia vs rest of world). 
AMG 479 at 12 mg/kg, AMG 479 at 20 mg/kg, and placebo will be double-blind; gemcitabine will be open label.  Cycles of gemcitabine plus AMG 479 or gemcitabine plus placebo are planned to 
be administered every 28 days ( ± 3 days) by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion.  Gemcitabine at 
1000 mg/m
2 will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day cycle followed by [CONTACT_245677] 479 at 12 mg/kg, AMG 479 at 20 mg/kg, or placebo on days [ADDRESS_298755] guidelines ve rsion 1.1.  Subjects will be evaluated for tumor 
response every 8 weeks ( ± 7 days) independent of the treatment cycle until disease progression, 
withdrawal of consent, or initiati on of new systemic anti-cancer ther apy.  Subjects with symptoms 
suggestive of disease pr ogression will be evaluated radiologically for tumor progression at the 
time the symptoms occur.  
All subjects will be assessed for non-intensive AMG 479 PK.  Approximately thirteen evaluable 
subjects per arm will be assessed for intensive AMG 479 PK and gemcitabine PK and its 
metabolite (see Section 7.3 for additional details). 
Subjects who discontinue all protocol specif ied therapy (ie, AMG 479 or AMG 479-placebo and 
gemcitabine) will be followed for safety, immunogenicity and PK at the 30 (+3) day follow-up visit, 
and for post-protocol therapy and survival every 12 weeks ( ± 14 days) until death, withdrawal of 
consent or the end of the study.  The end of the study will be when a minimum of 90% of 
randomized subjects who have not wi thdrawn from the study have died. 
 
Primary and Secondary Endpoints:    
Primary Endpoint
:  Overall survival  
Secondary Endpoints : Progression-free survival, survival rate at the timepoints of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 
and 24 months, objective response rate, time to disease progression, duration of response, 
disease control rate (PR+CR+SD); incidence of subject adverse events, laboratory abnormalities 
and immunogenicity; AMG 479 dose exposure, do se intensity and PK parameters; gemcitabine 
dose exposure, dose intensity and PK parameters;  the change in hepatobiliary symptoms using 
the FACT-Hep HS. 
 
Sample Size:   [ADDRESS_298756] Eligibility Criteria:  
Key Inclusion criteria : Subjects must have histologically or  cytologically confirmed metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (American Jo int Committee on Cancer Stage IV); ECOG score 
of 0 or 1; Men or women ≥ 18 years of age. 
Key Exclusion Criteria : Islet cell, acinar cell carcinoma, non-adenocarcinoma, (eg, lymphoma, 
sarcoma, etc), adenocarcinoma originated from biliary tree or cystadenocarcinoma; currently 
treated or previously treated with biologic, sm all molecule, immunotherapy, chemotherapy (eg, 
gemcitabine), radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy or other agents for pancreatic cancer.

Date:  [ADDRESS_298757] Dosage and Administration:   
Arm 1:  AMG 479-p lacebo IV days 1 and 15 of a 28  day cycle  
Arm 2:  AMG 479 at 12 mg/kg IV days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle  
Arm 3:  AMG 479 at 20 mg/kg IV days [ADDRESS_298758] Dosage and Administration  
Gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 ( ±10) minutes on days 1, 8 , and 15 of each 28 day cycle 
in Arms 1 , 2 and 3  
Procedures :  A complete schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix  A. 
Statistical Considerations :  The primary goal of the statistical analysis is to determine if OS in 
Arm 2 and/or Arm 3 is statisti cally significant ly improved compared to Arm 1.  Eight hundred and 
twenty -five subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio (330 in Arm 1 and 2, 165 in Arm 3) to 
attain a total of approximately 642 OS events.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_245678] (0 vs  1), and the presence of liver metastases (Yes vs No), and by 
[CONTACT_101820] ( Western Europe, [LOCATION_002], Canada, Australia vs rest of world) .  A 
log-rank test  stratifi ed by [CONTACT_245679]’s 
procedure will be used to achieve an overall one- sided 2.5% significance level for declaring 
superiority of Arm 2 vs 1 and/or Arm 3 vs  1.  An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
external to [COMPANY_010] will be established to conduct two planned safety and one interim efficacy 
reviews .  The two safety reviews will occur after 50 subjects (approximately 20, 20 and 10  per 
arm) and 150 subjects (approximately 60, 60 and 30 per arm) have been enrolled and had the 
opportunity to complete 1 cycle of protocol specified therapy.   Thereafter the DMC safety reviews 
will occur approximately every 6 months until the primary analysis has been completed.  This will 
occur without a hold in enrollment.   The interim analysis of OS for lack of benefit  for Arm 2 and/or 
Arm 3 vs Arm 1 will be performed at approximately 3 0% (188 events)  of the primary analysis total 
event goal .

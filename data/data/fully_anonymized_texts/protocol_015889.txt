care and risks to both patients and clinicians associated with venipuncture. 
 
 
2.1 TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND  
 
Pulse oximetry is governed by [CONTACT_371330]: 
1. Oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) and deoxyhemoglobin (non-ox ygenated blood) 
differ in their absorption of red and infrared light (spectroph otometry).  
2. The amount of arterial blood in tissue changes with arterial  pulses 
(photoplethysmography). Therefore, the amount of light absorbed  by [CONTACT_789834].  
3. More generally, Masimo Pulse CO-Oximeters use a multi-wavele ngth sensor to 
distinguish between not only oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood, but also blood 
with carbon monoxide, oxidized blood and blood plasma. The CO-Oximeter utilizes a 
sensor with various light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that pass ligh t through the site to a 
photodiode (detector). See figure below.  
 
 
 
4. Signal data is obtained by [CONTACT_789835] a capi[INVESTIGATOR_789823] (for example, a fingertip, a hand, a foot) and measuring ch anges in light absorption 
during the blood pulsatile cycle. The maximum radiant power of the st ro nges t li ght is  
rated at ≤ 25mW. The detector receives the light, converts it into an electr onic signal 
and sends it to the Rad-57, or similar Masimo hardware platform , for calculation.  
5. Once the oximeter receives the signal from the sensor, it ut ilizes Masimo SET signal 
extraction technology for calculation of the patient’s function al oxygen saturation and 
pulse rate, total hemoglobin, and/or other physiological parame ters.

2.2.1 Current Masimo Predicate Devices 
Masimo rainbow SET® is a noninvasive monitoring platform featur ing Masimo SET® 
Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry with t he option to measure 
multiple additional blood constituents and physiologic paramete rs. Masimo rainbow and 
SET technology describes a line of sensors that all use the sam e pulse oximetry type 
technological concepts to read physiological parameters. Conven tional pulse oximetry uses 
two LED (light emitting diodes) to emit light through one side of the finger and a detector on 
the other side that reads the amount of light that makes it thr ough the digit.  With rainbow 
technology Masimo uses additional wavelength LEDs in order to c alculate more complex 
blood solute concentrations like hemoglobin concentration. The same principles described 
above that govern Masimo SET technology (pulse oximetry) also g overn Masimo Rainbow 
technology. These additional LEDs do not present any additional  risk to the end user since 
they radiate light in the same wavelength and power ranges. 
Depending on the number and type of LED Emitters, the investigational device can provide 
non-invasive estimates of a number of physiological parameters. See Table 1.

2.2.2 Masimo Rainbow Pulse CO-Oximeter and Other Non-Invasive S ensors 
The Masimo Rainbow SET CO-Oximeter platform is FDA 510(k) clear ed for the noninvasive 
and continuous monitoring of total hemoglobin concentration in adults. The devices under 
test may be investigational versions of the Masimo or Cercacor (Masimo Labs) approved 
pulse oximeters, sensors or other monitoring devices. 
 
Investigational devices are modifications of FDA-cleared produc ts. They may differ from 
FDA-cleared products listed in Table [ADDRESS_1087970] of th e investigational device’s 
modification is considered for impact on subject safety, and al l investigational devices 
undergo a risk analysis assessment to identify required safety tests or risk mitigation 
strategies prior to use on any study subject. For investigation al devices to be allowed to be 
tested under this protocol, the acceptable modification types a re listed in Table 2. 
Modifications not listed in Table 2 will require a protocol ame ndment and approval by [CONTACT_5040].

2.2.[ADDRESS_1087972] System is a multi-input platform designe d to duplicate the 
functionality of four Masimo Rainbow Technology Pulse CO-Oximet ers.  The instrument, 
approximately 6 inches x 8 inches x 12 inches (HxWxL) contains four Masimo MX circuit 
boards inside it (see Appe ndix 2) that are identical to the cir cuit boards in the commercial 
device. The circuit board is the component of the device that p erforms the functions of the 
pulse oximeter including the LED and photodiodes on the sensor and signal processing in 
the main unit.  The instrument receives input from four Masimo sensors and sends output to 
a specific data acquisition program on a computer.  The MX circ uit boards are FDA 
approved and are the primary component on the three currently m arketed Masimo devices, 
including the Radical-7, Rad-87, and Rad-57.   
The Rainbow 4-Board System is a non-significant risk device tha t has no additional risks 
compared to the commercially available pulse oximeter devices.   
2.2.4 Cercacor  Pronto Device and Sensors 
The Cercacor (Masimo Labs) Pronto System is a device that is fu nctionally very similar (For 
example, change in LEDs to qualify a new lot of LEDs, or change  in software; none of these 
changes would present any additional risk to the subject and no ne would be used outside 
the parameters of what the approved device would be used for. T he devices would be used 
as indicated)to the Masimo Rainbow SET technology. Data is coll ected by [CONTACT_3553] a 
noninvasive optical sensor and digitally stored for later post processing and analysis. The 
measurements are taken by [CONTACT_1299] a sensor on a patient, usuall y on the fingertip.  The 
sensor connects directly to the data collection instrument with  a patient cable. The sensor 
collects optical signal data from the patient and sends it to t he instrument to be stored.

6. PROCEDURE 
Overview: During this study we will recruit human subjects; thi s will include members of the general 
public and Masimo employees, to participate in a study. The stu dy may contain any subset of the 
procedures listed below. During this study we will be testing t he sensors in order to make a 
desaturation assessment of our noninvasive devices (listed abov e). Participants in this study will 
come in and be seated, review the consent information, agree or  not. One or more clinician(s) will 
place venous line(s) and arterial line(s), and sensors will be placed. The clinician will collect arterial 
blood samples which will be run on our internal blood analysis equipment (coulter counter, arterial 
blood gas analyzer etc.). This blood sampling will serve the pu rposes of a comparison tool for the 
readings that were recorded from the noninvasive devices and se nsors. 
Pulse oximetry monitoring will take place throughout the study.  During this study subjects may have 
any of the following done: continuous reference blood sampling from an established arterial or 
venous line and oxygen administration. Please refer to Appendix  A for an example of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_789824].

new environment. For most participants, only the initial record ed blood 
pressure and/or heart rate determines a subject’s qualification  for the 
continuation of the screening procedure.  In the case where hea rt rate and 
blood pressure changes suggest participant discomfort or a pote ntial 
safety concern, the participant will be removed from the study after 
qualifying.  This will be left to the discretion of medical and  study staff.  
6.3.3 A peripheral venous line will be placed in the volunteer’ s hand or arm. One or more 
venous sampling catheters may be used during the study for remo val of samples of 
blood to allow for determination of hemoglobin concentration, H ct, as well as other 
non-infectious blood solutes. This is a necessary study paramet er. 
[IP_ADDRESS] In the event that an IV is placed we will offer to use lidocaine (lidocaine 
injection, Ethyl Chloride and/or Pain Ease) to numb the site. L idocaine is 
not a required study parameter and is presented to subjects as a choice 
for comfortability and/or preference. Subjects will be given th e option to 
have Lidocaine or numbing spray used during IV placement. Lidoc aine 
and/ or numbing spray will be administered by [CONTACT_789841] (venous and/or arterial) 
placement more comfortable for the subjects. Although the subje ct would 
be receiving two “pokes” if they choose the lidocaine injection  prior to the 
IV placement, the IV may be a smaller gauge (larger size) than the needle 
used for lidocaine injection causing more discomfort to the sub ject. If the 
subject chooses to have Lidocaine used then it will be administ ered 
through a smaller-sized needle (28 gauge). Subjects may prefer the 
smaller size needle for the lidocaine knowing it may help the I V insertion to 
be less uncomfortable. 
6.3.4 After intravenous access is established, one or more intr a-arterial catheter(s) (arterial 
line or A-line) will be placed in the radial artery of the volu nteers wrist. This study is 
being done with an arterial line to facilitate continuous blood  sampling to allow for 
determination of arterial blood gases (ABG), hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), as 
well as other non-infectious blood solutes.

 administration. 
[IP_ADDRESS] It is normal for subjects to feel as though they have t o concentrate on 
their breathing more than they would normally.  This is due to the fact 
their nose is plugged and most subjects are not used to breathi ng with 
a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  The gas flow rate may be increased to help subje cts to 
feel less like their breathing is restricted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects will be instructed to spit out the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_789827], feel uncomfortable, or feel as tho ugh they

qualifying criteria they may be excluded from this study. 
• If the investigator/study staff notices a trend with (not lim ited to these examples) the 
subjects’ blood pressure fluctuating outside the parameters, th eir heart rate fluctuating 
outside the parameters, their need to repetitively void early a nd/or their inability to remain 
still for the majority of the study they will be removed from t he study and may not be used 
as a participant in that particular study in the future. We don ’t want to put the subject in 
any situation that makes them uncomfortable or may compromise t heir safety (ie. 
fidgeting, bladder tolerance, hypertension, inability to stay a wake, discomfort with

 13.1.1. Risks can be categorized into the following categories:  
x Those associated with the device 
x Those associated with the placement of venous access (venous c annulation) 
x Those associated with placement of the arterial line (arterial  cannulation) 
x Those associated with blood draws 
x Those associated with inflicted knowledge 
x Those associated with the Lidocaine injection 
x Those associated with the Lidocaine spray 
x Those associated with low oxygen concentration 
x Those associated with oxygen administration 
x Those associated with the nose clip 
x Those associated with loss of confidentiality/privacy 
x Those associated with Additional testing 
Note: In the very unlikely, worst case, complications from the study may result in death. The 
study shall be stopped by [CONTACT_789847] e this would occur. 
 
13.1.2. Device Risk 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The noninvasive devices used in this study are simila r in technology and 
design to some commercially available pulse oximeters and other  non-
invasive devices and hence have the same risks.  Pulse oximeter s and 
other non-invasive devices are commonly used and are considered  to be 
minimal risk.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. There is an extremely small risk of damage to the sub ject’s fingers, or other 
locations where sensors are placed, from the device including t emporary 
skin irritation or discomfort associated with exposure to the s ensor as well 
as potential temporary mechanical irritation or discomfort.  There is a 
remote, yet possible, risk of a burn from the sensor. In the ca se of a sensor 
burn there is the potential for permanent skin damage (scar/dis coloration). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. If there are any cuts and/or abrasions near the fin ger nail certain 
types of sensors may not be placed on the particular finger to 
avoid any discomfort for the subject. 
13.1.3. Venous Cannulation Risks: 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Risks associated with venipuncture include bleeding, swelling, infection, 
infiltration of fluids/ blood into area surrounding IV, bruisin g, hematoma, 
damage to the blood vessel and surrounding nerves or tissue. 
13.1.4. Arterial Cannulation Risks: 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The radial artery is the most common site for invasiv e blood pressure 
monitoring in anesthesia and critical care medicine because it is technically 
easy to cannulate and complications are uncommon, in part owing  to the good 
collateral circulation of the hand.  The widespread application  of invasive

[IP_ADDRESS]. Other risks include bleeding, infection, hematoma, da mage to the blood 
vessel and surrounding nerves, tendons or tissue; loss of feeli ng in hand 
and/or arm and even the loss of hand due to rare complications of the study. 
 
13.1.5. Blood Draw Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discomfort is generally associated with needle punctu re. The most common 
complications associated with blood draws are hematomas or brui sing. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. There is also a possible risk of infection, tendon or  tissue damage, damage 
to the blood vessel and surrounding nerves, loss of feeling in hand and/or 
arm and even the loss of hand due to rare complications of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other anticipated adverse events that may occur, incl ude but are not limited 
to: 
x Vasovagal (fainting) 
x Infiltrated IV 
x Lightheadedness 
x Feeling flush/ warm 
x Feeling nauseated 
x Throwing up 
x Seizures 
x Sudden drop in blood pressure/ sudden increase in blood pressu re 
x Sudden drop in heart rate/ sudden increase in heart rate 
x Tingling sensation of face, arms and/or legs 
x Sweating 
x Mouth dryness  
These anticipated adverse events are expected to be temporary. The listed discomforts and complications associated with blood draws can be 
expected and are not an act of neglect, failure to follow stand ards or related to the 
sensors or devices used in the study.   
13.1.6. Risk from Inflicted Knowledge 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The risk of inflicted medical knowledge to volunteers  is negligible since we 
de-identify all associated sample information including those r elevant to our 
clinical and engineering parameter studies. The monitoring and test results 
are not examined for diagnostic purposes and do not reflect an attempt to 
ascertain any subject's medical condition. The attending physic ian's role 
during this study is to ensure the safety of the subject during  the study. We 
will reduce the risk of inflicted knowledge by [CONTACT_789848] y. In the 
case that a subject becomes aware of a condition (anemia, hyper tension, 
arrhythmia etc.) they have during the course of our study our s tudy staff will 
recommend that they contact [CONTACT_789849]. As part of that process we will f ollow up 
with these individuals prior to enrollment if their condition m eets exclusion

to: 
x Flushing or redness of the skin 
x Itching skin 
x Small red or purple spots on the skin 
x Unusually warm skin 
x Bruising 
x Bleeding at the application site 
x S w e l l i n g  
These adverse events are expected to be temporary. Although not common, it is also possible to have an allergic re action to 
injectable lidocaine. Subjects should not take part in this stu dy if they are 
allergic to lidocaine injection or other types of numbing medic ine, or if they 
have a heart rhythm disorder called Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndr ome or 
Stokes-Adams syndrome. Subjects are instructed to tell the stud y staff right 
away if they experience hives; difficulty breathing; swelling o f your face, lips, 
tongue or throat.

[IP_ADDRESS]. There are no risks associated with high oxygen/oxyge n administration for 
less than [ADDRESS_1088008] any cardiac conditions, 
COPD or any other lung diseases. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subjects’ answers on the health questionnaire will h elp the medical staff 
decide if they can safely participate in this study; subjects a re encouraged 
to let the study staff know if they have any concerns. 
13.1.11. Nose Clip Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS]. It is expected that some people will have discomfort / pi[INVESTIGATOR_38633]/ scratches 
from wearing a nose clip. If or when this occurs, adjustments c an be made 
and/or the study can be stopped.  
13.1.12.  Risk from Loss of Confidentiality 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Masimo upholds the highest standards to protect hard  and electronic data 
however a complete promise for confidentiality cannot be guaran teed due 
to unforeseeable events.   
 
13.1.13.  Risk from Additional Testing 
During the conduct of the study, it is possible, but not likely , that someone could 
become exposed to the sample of blood drawn from the subject th rough an 
inadvertent needle stick or by [CONTACT_138496]. In suc h circumstances, 
it will be important to the exposed individual to know whether the blood to which 
he or she was exposed contained Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and ad ditional testing 
of the sample will be performed.  Within the consent subjects will agree to permit the company to  test the blood 
sample (or samples) by [CONTACT_44210]. The test results wi ll be maintained

typi[INVESTIGATOR_789830]. Please refer to the schemati c and study outline below for an example  of 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_789831] (please keep in mind this is an e xample and not all ORI studies will follow 
this same schematic, oxygen percentages and sequence of these e vents may vary): 
x We will start taking samples at a baseline of 21% and continue  sampling as the oxygen percentage 
gradually increases to 100% (ie. 21%, 24%, 27%, 30%, 33%, 36%, 100%). 
x We will then start to decrease the oxygen percentage back to 2 1% and continue to take blood 
samples (ie. 100%, 36%, 33%, 30%, 27%, 24%, 21%).  
x Once we have brought the subject back to 21% oxygen, we will d esaturate them by [CONTACT_789852] 13% (or slightly lower depending on the subjects ability to adapt to 
the desaturation) until their oxygen saturation reaches the des ired saturation level and continue 
obtaining blood samples. 
x The subject will receive 21% oxygen or breathe room air again at the end of the study; this brings 
the subjects oxygen saturation back to a normal range.

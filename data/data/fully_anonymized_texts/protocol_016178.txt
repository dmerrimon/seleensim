1.2 S
TUDY BACKGROUND  
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin that usually starts in early infancy, but also affects a substantial number of adults. AD affects 15- 30% of children and 
2-10% of adults globally, and its prevalence rate is rising (Alhazmi, 2017). AD onset is most common 
between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_26433] 90% by 5 years of age (Kay, 1994; Perkin, 2004).  While the majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease by [CONTACT_26464], 10% to 30% do not, and a smaller percentage of 
individuals first develop symptoms as adults (Ellis, 2012).  
AD is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history 
of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma (Eichenfield, 2014). AD typi[INVESTIGATOR_26434], xerosis, lichenification, and eczematous lesions. Excoriations and crusting are common and som e 
patients exhibit prurigo nodularis‒like lesions. The eczematous changes and its morphology are seen in different locations depending on the age of the patient. In adults, lesions are more diffuse with an underlying background of erythema. The face is commonly involved and is dry and scaly. The mainstays of treatment are moisturization (frequent lukewarm baths, and using petrolatum or Aquaphor, etc.), along 
with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (Eichenfield, 2014). For more severe cases, other treatment options such as 
immunomodulators (ex. tacrolimus  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_031]), biologicals (ex. dupi[INVESTIGATOR_26435] ), 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_22724] -4 (PDE -4) inhibitors  (ex. c risaborole), probiotics and phototherapy are also 
used (Sidbury, 2014). All of these options for AD management, and many of these treatment regimens 
are considered expensive and with various side effects in chronic use. Thus, patients with AD are in need 
of new treatment options that are efficacious and safe in the long term use.  
AMTX-[ADDRESS_25829] is for mulated as a water -based, topi[INVESTIGATOR_26436] a 28-amino 
acid synthetic polypeptide  (AMTX -100) as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).  
AMTX-100 is a chimeric, cell -penetrating, bifunctional nuclear transport modifier (NTM), that  is 
engineer ed to modulate nuclear transport of transcription factors  (NF-κB, NFAT, AP -1 and STAT1)  
involved in activation of gene expression of key mediators of inflammation (TNFα, IL -1β, IL -6, IL -17, 
MCP -1, etc.)  and metabolic syndrome (ChREBP and SREBP) by [CONTACT_26465] α/β complex and importin β,

respectively . This further leads to a reduction in pro-inf lammatory cytokine/chemokine production and 
carbohydrate and lipid metabolic products.  
Several nonclinical safety studies have been conducted with AMTX -100 and AMTX -100 CF to evaluate 
its toxicological profile and additional studies are currently ongoing. Substantial scientific literature is 
also available on the anti -inflammatory mechanisms of AMTX -100.  
The current study is designed to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of open- label topi[INVESTIGATOR_26437]-100 CF3 (in 1.1% concentration) and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_26437]-100 CF 3 (1.1% w/w ) in adult patients with mild to moderate AD.

This is an adaptive, Phase I/II study in 2 parts: Part 1 (Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) Finding by 
[CONTACT_26466]) and Part 2 (evaluating efficacy of AMTX -100 CF3 1.1% w/w 
concentration versus placebo (vehicle)). 
3.1 PHASE I (PART 1) STUDY DESIG N 
Part 1 of this study is an open- label, dose escalation study of the safety and tolerability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_26439] -100 CF in adult patients with mild to moderate AD. Part I of this study is designed to 
determine the MTD of AMTX -100 CF (1.1% w/w concentration) for the highest treated percentage of 
the BSA affected with AD. The MTD is defined as 1 cohort dose level below the dose, in which dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) as defined below were observed.  
In total, five (5) cohort dose levels will be tested sequentially by [CONTACT_26467] -100 CF 1.1% to 
higher percentage of BSA affected with AD at each cohort. Each enrolled subject will receive the assigned dose of Open- label AMTX -100 CF 1.1% w/w to be applied twice daily to all treatable lesions 
of AD (excl uding the scalp, face, eyes, eyelids, neck, hands, palms, feet, groin, genitals or in the axillae) 
for 7 consecutive days (14 applications in total), regardless of whether the lesions become clinically clear 
during the 7 days treatment period.

10 ADVERSE EVENTS (DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING)  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and 
definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when there is a safety 
evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be resp onsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
AEs and SAEs as detailed in this section of the protocol.  
10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs or is reported by [CONTACT_26487], or a worsening of a pre -existing condition. An AE may or 
may not be related to the study treatment.  
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormalities in visit 
evaluations, physical examination findings or laboratory results that the Investigator believes are 
clinically significant to the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study treatment 
will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as an AE.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_25880]’s medical records and on the CRF. AEs will be reported using 
customary medical terminology along with the following information: the onset and end dates, whe ther 
the event is considered to be an SAE (see Section 10.2), the impact the event had on study treatment (see 
Section 10.1.2), the CTCAE grade (intensity) of the event (see Section 10.1.3), the causality of the event 
(see Section 10.1.4), whether treatment was given as a result of the event (see Section 10.1.5), and the 
outcome of the event (see Section 10.1.6).  
10.1.[ADDRESS_25881] the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, study treatment 
interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. The “not applicable” assessment will be 
used only when the subject is no longer in the treatment phase of the protocol, or if the outcome of the event was “death”.  
10.1.3 
 SEVERITY (INTENSITY ) ASSESSMENT  
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v5.0 will be used for assessing the severity or intensity of the event. 
The general guidelines for assessing the AE grade appear below. Full guidelines may be obtained at 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE .

4. Unlikely related : In gener al this category can be considered applicable to those AEs which, after 
careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged likely to be unrelated to 
the study treatment. An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must have two): (1)  it does 
not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455]. (3) Disappears or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow a known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
5. Unrelated : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration at the time they 
are evaluated, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, 
etc.) and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study treatment.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_25882] in terms of treatme nt provided will be as either: none, medication administered, non-
medication therapy administered, surgery, or other (with a specification). 
10.1.6 OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death. 
Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are multiple 
causes of death for a given subject, only the primary cause of death will have an outcome of death.   
10.1.7 EXPECTED  /ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
 
  
 
 
10.1.8 A
PPLICATION SITE REACTIONS  
For this population, presence of signs/ symptoms similar to application site reactions  at the eczema 
lesions at the baseline is expected. Only significant worsening of these signs/symptoms from the baseline  
per the investigator would be considered adverse events.

sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event stabilizes at a 
level acceptable to the investigator (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further improvement 
expected, or death).  
For each SAE indicated as an unresolved event on the initial report, regardless of whether the subject completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow-up report with updated information.

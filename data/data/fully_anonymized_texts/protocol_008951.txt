ABSTRACT  
Context :  Unresolved psychological problems, such as anxiety, affect a significant number 
of our students and interfere with their ability to attend, actively participate, and prosper in 
school. This project will expand the capacity of selected  mental health agencies to provide 
services in the participating schools through school therapeutic services (STS). The project 
will provide enhanced training in evidence- based behavioral health interventions to school -
based mental health providers.  The services will be imp lemented by [CONTACT_766746] ’s level 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766635] (Internal Support) , who are 
in turn supported by [CONTACT_5051] (TT) or external consultants ( TT+).  
 
Objectives : The purpose of this intervention study is to test the effectiveness of FRIENDS 
(a program for overanxious children) compared to an adapted version ( CATS ) and to 
compare the total cost between the interventions.  The study also aims to compare support 
mechanisms: Train- the-Trainer (TT) to Train -the-Trainer Plus (TT+) for the implementation 
of CATS and to test mediators and moderators of type of support (TT vs. TT+) on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766636].   
 
Study Design : This is a 3 -arm, parallel group, Type 2 hybrid effectiveness -implementation 
trial in K -8 schools i n Philadelphia over 5 years .  
 
Setting/Participants:  Schools within the School District of Philadelphia that have STS 
programs managed by [CONTACT_766747].  
Schools  (3-6 per agency)  will be chosen for participation.  Students who present excessive 
anxiety in grades 4 -8 would be potentially eligible to participate in the interventions offered 
by [CONTACT_766748]’ therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766637].  
 
Study Interventions and Measures :  
This study is designed to test : a) the effectiveness of an adapted version of a group 
cognitive behavioral therapy program ( CATS ) compared to the original version of this 
program (FRIENDS), and b) the effectiveness of two implementation strategies for CATS : 
Train -the-Trainer and Train- the-Trainer Plus.  CATS is a shorter, more culturally sensitive, 
focused, and feasible CBT for anxiety in children than FRIENDS. CATS  addresses one of 
the major barriers to implementation (intervention- context fit).  
 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766638]: a) 
FRIENDS with Train -the-Trainer implementation strategy (i.e., Masters -level supervisors 
receive training by [CONTACT_766744]); b) CATS  with Train -the-Trainer 
strategy; c) CAT S using the Train- the-Trainer Plus strategy (i.e., supervisors receive 
training and consultation by [CONTACT_766744]). Effectiveness will be 
measured by [CONTACT_23992] A to B; Implementation will be measured by [CONTACT_23992] B to C. 
Agency therapis ts will conduct all treatment groups in the schools.  
   
   [ADDRESS_1051546] been linked to academic and 
social problems and emotional maladjustment later in life.  Schools in low -income urban 
communities present a context with gr eat potential for implementation of psychosocial 
EBPs. Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) is an EBP that has been found to be very 
effective in treating anxiety in various settings , including schools . Friends for Life 
(FRIENDS) is an efficacious group CBT protocol for anxiety . Unfortunately, CBT for anxiety 
is seldom employed in under -resourced urban schools, mainly because the treatment 
protocols are not tailored for the context or the population, existing behavioral health staff 
do not receive adequate tr aining or support to allow them to implement the treatment with 
fidelity, and school districts do not have the resources to contract outside providers or 
consultants.  Community Behavioral Health (CBH), a non- profit organization that manages 
Medicaid funds  for the City of Philadelphia, has approached us for help to develop cost -
effective implementation strategies for schools. The availability of a contextually relevant, 
feasible, and cost -effective evidence -based CBT protocol for urban schools designed to b e 
implemented and supported by [CONTACT_766749].  
  
1.[ADDRESS_1051547] or Intervention 
1.2.1  Interventions implemented for anxious students by [CONTACT_766750][INVESTIGATOR_11437]:  
 
Friends for Life (FRIENDS) : FRIENDS , a GCBT program, is an effective program for the 
prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in children evidenced by a meta- analysis on 
school -based interventions for at -risk and clinically anxious youth .  FRIENDS h as been 
successfully implemented in several countries with children from diverse ethnic 
backgrounds. FRIENDS was developed based on the view that anxiety is a tripartite 
construct involving physiological, cognitive, and behavioral components.  
Core components : Experts in CBT for childhood anxiety disorders have identified 5 
essential components: psychoeducation, somatic management skills training, cognitive 
restructuring, exposure methods, and contingency management. The FRIENDS protocol 
consists of 10 weekly sessions and two booster sessions. We included the booster 
sessions in the regular protocol for a total of 12 sessions.   
 
Adapted CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools  (CATS ): We conducted planned adaptations 
to the FRIENDS protocol based on our collective experience with the protocol and 
qualitative data (focus group and interviews). We followed procedures developed by [CONTACT_766751], including surveying service providers and trainers regarding the 
appropriate ness of FRIENDS for the target population. Changes were made to the 
language (idioms, metaphors, words), cultural fit (cultural values), methods (session length, 
number of sessions), activities (in -session practices), which resulted in additions and 
substi tutions in these areas while maintaining the 5 essential components of the treatment. 
CATS  is a briefer (8- session) and more engaging and culturally -sensitive protocol than 
FRIENDS.

1.2.2   Support Interventions (strategies) offered to city agency therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766639] (TT) by [CONTACT_766752], and then go on to train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
 
Train the Trainer Plus (TT+)  a modified train- the-trainer approach by [CONTACT_766753].  
 
1.3 Findings from Non -Clinical and Clinical Studies  
We pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested FRIENDS  with low- income urban children who were at risk or who met 
diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. The treatment was part of a school -wide positive 
behavioral  interventions and supports (SWPBIS) program (CDC, R18MN000003) in [ADDRESS_1051548] , 28% of the children were rated within the borderline range or 
higher (T score > 60) on the Anxious/Depressed subscale and 9% were rated within the 
clinical range  (T score > 70). The corresponding percentages for externalizing disorders 
were 29%, and 17%, respectively,  indicating that the number of children at risk for anxiety is 
very similar to the  number of children at risk for externalizing disorders .  
Six graduate students in applied  psychology and t hree counselors from each school  were 
trained in and co led FRIENDS groups. The fidelity scores  reflect ed the ability of graduate 
students and school counselors to implement the interventions with fidelity while receiving 
expert support.  Six FRIENDS groups were  conducted. All of the sessions were video 
recorded to assess content fidelity. Fidelity ratings were obtained  from an independent 
coder (IC). Average fidelity to the FRI ENDS manual across sessions and groups was  86%, 
considered moderate to strong fidelity.  Of the 33 children who participated, only 10 (30%) 
children participated in all 12 sessions.  Although only 30% of participants attended all 
originally scheduled sessions, 85% of participants received the entire content of the 
intervention. The procedure was for school counselors and project staff to review material 
with absent participants individually, or in groups of two, prior to the upcoming session. 
Following this procedure, 85% received all session content.  
The findings from  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_766640]: a) the prevalence of anxiety problems in the schools where the proposed project would 
take place is high; b) less than a third of the children participated in all 12 session, 
indicating that a briefer protocol would be more feasible in urban schools; c) counselors 
functioning as co- therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766641]; and (d) the treatment led to reductions in diagnostic lev el and 
symptom severity.  
Furthermore, in preparation for this project, we conducted qualitative interviews with [ADDRESS_1051549] (R01HD073430) and focus groups with 
school counselors implementing FRIENDS. A qualitative theme an alysis (i.e., frequency of 
themes) about consultants’ perceptions regarding context -fit of FRIENDS revealed that the 
protocol is too long, uses language and examples that are not congruent with the language 
and culture of low income, ethnically diverse chi ldren, and does not sufficiently emphasize 
teaching relaxation and exposure. Counselors thought the manual is “dry” and “boring” and 
   
   3 
that it needs to be “ tweaked ” in order to increase children’s engagement. Counselors 
requested more optional activities to support main ideas in the manual.  
1.4 Relevant Literature and Data  
Anxiety disorders (i.e., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia,  Specific Phobia and 
Separation Anxiety Disorder), affect up to 13% of the child population making them among 
the most common childhood conditions. Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among inner 
city school children and often go unidentified and untreated. Children wi th these disorders 
are more likely than their peers to have problems with social, peer and parent -child 
relations, academic achievement school refusal and future socio- emotional adjustment. 
School factors, such as peer problems, academic pressures, and school violence, can 
contribute to and exacerbate symptoms.   
Individual and group CBT (GCBT) have been shown to be highly effective for the treatment 
of anxiety in youth. GCBT requires fewer resources than individual CBT, such as one 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766642], thus making it less expensive for use in under -
resourced settings such as urban schools. GCBT for anxiety has successfully been 
employed in urban school settings by [CONTACT_83907]. FRIENDS, a GCBT program, is 
an effective program for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in children as 
evidenced by a meta- analysis on school -based interventions for at -risk and clinically 
anxious youth. Also, our previous research demonstrates that FRIENDS is an effective 
protocol for use in urban public schools.  
Public schools have become a common setting for the delivery of mental health services to 
children and may be the ideal context through which to narrow services disparities. The 
school is a convenient location where services can o ften be provided at little or no cost to 
families. Benefits of providing EBPs in schools include the ability to implement interventions 
in the very environment in which most symptoms are triggered and to incorporate protocol -
specific interventions, with peer and teacher involvement, as needed for generalizability. 
EBPs for anxiety disorders enable overanxious children to overcome behavioral barriers to 
learning.  
The most pressing challenge facing the mental health field is the dissemination and 
implementation (D&I) of EBPs: taking protocols that were developed in research settings 
and adapting them for specific community use. It has been estimated that it can take up to 
[ADDRESS_1051550]. These 
research designs are thought to facilitate “ more rapid tran slational gains, more effective 
implementation strategies and [yield] more useful information for deci sion makers. In the 
Type II design, effectiveness and implementation have equal importance. Type II 
effectiveness -implementation hybrid studies are most appropriate for treatments that have a 
strong record of efficacy and effectiveness, such as FRIENDS . 
Treatments that are developed and tested for efficacy in highly controlled research settings 
often do not fit into “real world” contexts. As a result most e ffective treatments in health and 
mental health settings need to be adapted for new contexts. Unfortunately, in the 
adaptation process, there is a potential for some of the main components of the treatments 
to be altered, rendering them less effective than in their original form. Lee and colleagues 
developed planned adaptation (PA) to address the tension between “implementing 
   
   4 
programs with fidelity and the need to tailor programs to fit the target population”. PA 
orients the provider to the program and its theoretical orientation. A central tenet of PA is 
that adaptation must be conducted without altering the program’s core components. PA 
helps the provider identify components of the program that can be modified, and provides a 
process for conducting adaptat ions and a direction on how to develop evaluation strategies.  
We applied PA to FRIENDS in order to make it more feasible for implementation in co-
location settings with low -income urban children.  
Substantial resources have been dedicated t o the D&I of ment al health EBPs. Key to that 
effort has been the identification of strategies for trai ning community -based clinicians. 
Studies have shown that effective training models include i nitial workshops for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766643], which of ten includes coaching and performance 
feedback . This was the strategy employed by [CONTACT_766754] R01 study  testing 
the effectiveness of consultation only vs. consultation plus coaching in the implementation 
of an EBP in public schools in the SDP.  Another important challenge facing publicly funded 
mental health agencies is finding cost -effective strategies for supporting supervisors. Most  
community mental health agencies, where low -income urban children receive services, do 
not have the resources t o pay for ongoing expert direct consultation for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766644]. As such, finding time - and cost -effective alternative strategies for 
supporting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766645] a significant public health impact . An important feasibility 
question is, “Can internal clinical supervisors  who are not familiar with EBPs provide 
effective supervision to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766646]?” A mostly self -sustaining system as previously described would 
likely be more practical and less expensive but perhaps lead to fewer positive child 
outcomes compared to a system where supervisors are provided extended consultation. 
Two alternative, and potentially cost effective, strategies are the cascade or train-the-trainer 
(TT) approach, by [CONTACT_766755], 
and then go on to train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]; and a modified train- the-trainer approach by [CONTACT_766756] (TT+) on conducting effective 
supervision. TT has been used with adult mental health populations. Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_766647] i mproved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766648] , 
but it is not known whether these findings could generalize to other settings or populations . 
TT+ has been used by [CONTACT_766757][INVESTIGATOR_766649] y supervisors who 
support therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766650] . Highlights of this 
approach include initial training, biweekly or monthly phone consultations with supervisors 
and a supervisor promotion review .  This modified train -the-trainer approach has been 
found to lead to moderate outcome effect sizes.  
This current study has the potential to demons trate that agency therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766651]. The use of group therapy can contribute to lowering services disparities in 
urban schools. Comparisons of th e two implementation strategies (internal supervision with 
or without consultation for supervisors) would provide large urban mental health systems 
with data to make decisions about adoption of EBPs. The study is consistent with the goals 
of the Affordable Care Act in that it would generate information on implementation of 
effective practices that optimize delivery of mental health care to traditionally underserved 
communities.   
 
1.5 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable Philadelphia Department 
of Public Health Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state 
   
   5 
laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_160534].  
 
The investigators will perform the study  in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent 
and assent (when appropriate), and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766652]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure 
the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
This stud y is designed to answer two important questions :  
 
1. Can publicly funded mental health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766653], expert support?  
 
2. What is the comparative cost effectiveness of these different implementation 
strategies?  
 
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objectives of this study are :  
• To compare pre-  to post -treatment effectiveness of different CBT treatments  
(FRIENDS vs. CATS ) and to compare the total cost between CATS  and 
FRIENDS.  
  
• To compare Train- the-Trainer (TT) to Train -the-Trainer Plus (TT+) for the 
implementation of CATS . 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objective is t o test mediators and moderators of type of support on 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72191].  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
This is a 3 -arm, parallel group, Type 2 Hybrid (effectiveness -implementation) design. The 
three groups are:  
 
A) FRIENDS with Train -the-Trainer (TT) implementation strate gy (supervisors 
participate in training workshops on conducting supervision)  
 
B) CATS  with TT strategy  
 
C) CATS  using the Train -the-Trainer Plus (TT+) strategy (supervisors participate in 
training workshop and receive further consultation on conducting supervision).  
 
   
   6 
The effectiveness part of the trial will compare A -B (different treatments); the 
implementation part of the trial will compare B -C (same treatment, different implementation 
strategies).  
 
Agency therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766654]. At the outset o f the study, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766655] (A, B, C).  
 
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Student Screening:  Students in grades 4 -8 who are referred to the STS programs in the 
participating schools will be screened for signs of anxiety using the Screen for Child Anxiety 
Related Disorders (SCARED). The screening criterion is a t otal score > 25 or elevated sub-
scale scores (as noted by [CONTACT_766758]) on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related 
Disorders (SC ARED), completed by [CONTACT_766759] a parent .  This will become  regular 
standard of care anxiety screening procedures  for students in the STS Programs .  In 
addition, STS agencies will also be trained and supported in screening students for 
traumatic life events using the Trauma History Questionnaire ( THQ, caregiver and child 
report).  This practice will also be encouraged to become regular standard of care.   
Referrals will be made to the research study team on the basis of the SCARED .  For 
parents who are interested in having their children participate, their  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766656] /THQ scores with the research team  after obtaining a 
parent signature [CONTACT_766785] . 
 
If a student meets screening criteria on the SCARED (as noted above) , they will be referred 
to the study and research staff will ask parents /caregivers if they are interested in having 
their child participate.  
 
Alternatively, STS Agencies may also refer students in grades 4- [ADDRESS_1051551] the SCARED Screener with students (in their school) 
in an effort t o identify students who are eligible for participation in the study.  If identified  as 
eligible, the study team will contact [CONTACT_766760] a 
consent meeting.    
 
3.1.2  Phase I:  Training of Supervisors & Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766657] [ADDRESS_1051552] 1 -2 days of training each year (i.e., 5 times over 
the course of the grant) for all new agency therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (including alternates) and supervisors. 
Training of supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766658]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133445] (CHOP) , at the site of a community agency , or at the school . Some of the 
training will be fo r supervisors only and some for supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766659].  
Supervisors will learn a competency fram ework for supervisors, strategies for identifying 
children who could benefit from the service (e.g., conducting in- service presentations to 
faculty on signs of anxiety in children), and how to use an  online  platform in the 
school /community  setting  (e.g., w ireless access; using fidelity forms)  to conduct, guide and 
track supervision sessions remotely . They will also be trained on the use of fidelity 
monitoring and conducting performance feedback with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  Supervisors will learn 
how to prepare therapis ts for each treatment session and how to conduct performance 
feedback using fidelity forms.  
   
   7 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766660] a scre ening instrument (SCARED) for 
the identification of potential participants. They  will be introduced to a competency model 
for CBT  for anxiety , which delineates generic therapeutic c ompetencies (e.g., professional 
practice), CBT competencies (e.g., relevance of theory and research), and  specific CBT 
techniques  for anxiety  (e.g., managing negative thoughts). Th ey will also learn about how to 
deal with  implementation barriers (e.g., scheduling sess ions, conducting exposure tasks).  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766661]  (A) and the STS 
programs using CATS  (B & C), will be trained separately  for activities related to each 
protocol. Trainers will follow training procedures used in other EBP dissemination studies in 
nontraditional settings and other training strategies found to be effective (i.e., activ e 
learning such as modeling and role -playing). At the conclusion of the training, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766662] (KT)  to measure knowledge of 
concepts taught during the t raining. Participants who score below 80% will be provided 
further training in the areas in which they scored low .  
 
3.1.3  Phase 2: Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766663] (FRIENDS & CATS ) & 
Implemen tation of Support Strategies (TT vs. TT+)  
STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766664], who meet the screening criteria, to the 
research team.  If the child has screened positive on either the parent - or child -form of the 
SCARED, then he or she is eligible to participate in the study.  The research team will 
conduct further evaluations using rating scales to understand symptoms and impairment 
across different aspects of child behavior (e.g., depressive symptoms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], 
disruptive behavior, etc.).  STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766665] (FRIENDS or 
CATS ) in the schools during lunch periods , or a non- academic period during the school 
day.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766666].  
The agency s upervisors will be  expected to conduct supervision with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
Supervisors will provide one 50- minute supervision session for each treatment session the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_139693] (12 for FRIENDS, 8 for CATS ). The session is divided into group 
preparation (i.e., discussing ref errals, preparing for upcoming session, engaging in problem 
solving around implementation barriers), and coaching (i.e., performance feedback). Prior 
to the first session, project staff uploads video- recorded samples of effective 
implementation of the main components of the treatments, as recorded during a previous 
implementation of FRIENDS. Periodically, the supervisor encourages therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766667]. Also, prior to the session, the supervisor will watch a 
recording of t he previous session and select clips for discussion. During the coaching 
portion of the session, the supervisor will ask for self -reflection of previous sessions and 
provide performance feedback. Then, the supervisor will provide the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168594] (a) 
fidelity data and (b) video clips bookmarked from the previous session showing effective 
and ineffective implementation of FRIENDS/ CATS . 
Simultaneously, TT and TT+ will be implemented by [CONTACT_766761][INVESTIGATOR_11437].   
If substantial time (45- 90 days) has  lapsed between training and the start of intervention, 
Supervisors will be offered  a booster training session after the original training in the weeks 
before starting their group . The purpose of the booster session is to review key points from 
the training (e.g., conducting performance feedback) and to answer questions about any 
aspect of the supervision process.  This subsequent training opportunity  for agency 
   
   8 
supervisors (on how to be effective supervisors  to the implementing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] ) will be 
conducted remotely , or in person .   
Supervisors in TT+ (Group C) will receive [ADDRESS_1051553] 
supervision, and will include performance feedback, impleme ntation fidelity, problem solve 
implementation barriers and will answer supervisors’  questions about the supe rvision 
manual. We will monitor whether supervision with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766668]. This 
information will be obtained from group fidelity scores.  
Supervisors will be instructed to supervise therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766669].  
 
 
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
3.2.1  Duration of Study Participation  
Agency Supervisors :  There is no time limit placed on the duration of participation for 
agency supervisors.  They may continue working with the research team for the duration of 
the study (5 years) or as long as their agency remains involved in the study or as long as 
they remain employed by [CONTACT_766762].   
Agency (STS) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766670] : Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766671].  After the initial year, the study team 
would prefer to train a new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766672] (yearly therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766673] 25%).  However, based on agency need and staff consideration, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766674]’s discretion.  This will be determined on a 
case -by-case situation.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766675].   
Students :  Students who are determined to be eligible, based on the SCARED , and for 
whom consent/assent  is obtained , will participate in a [ADDRESS_1051554] of  12 (FRIENDS) or 8 (CATS ) 40 
minute (or one -class period) intervention sessions, conducted at school.  They will also 
participa te in a similar post-treatment  data collection session once the intervention (12 or 8 
sessions) is completed.  Parents of the students participating in the intervention will also 
participate in two 30- minute data collection sessions (completion of the C BCL, CDI,  and 
MASC -2, see section 5.2 below).    
 
3.2.2  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted in a minimum of 36 (potentially up to 41)  public K -[ADDRESS_1051555] ther e to be a minimum of 36-41 agency supervisors (one per school at all 
times).  However , there is a 17% drop- out rate of supervisors across agencies.  Therefore, 
depending on supervisor turnover, the number of enrolled supervisors will be comparable. If 
   
   9 
all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766676], w e’d expect to enroll 90 agency therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] ([ADDRESS_1051556] per school (n=18), per year  of the study  (n=5) = 18x5 = 90).  However, given that 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766677] a second intervention group, we could end up with fewer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766678].  Yearly therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766679] 25%.  Therefore, depending on 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766680], the number of enrolled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766681].      
Each of the participating mental health agencies will make available extra supervisor s and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766682] a supervisor or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766683]. Alternate supervisors and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766684].  If a supervisor /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766685], s/he will be allowed to remain in the study and 
will be treated as a returning supervisor. Supervisors /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766686] A and B who 
move to a school assigned to a different study arm  can participate in the project pending PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_345]. Supervisors /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766687] C who move to a new school assigned to 
condition A or B will not be allowed to c ontinue in the study due to potential condition 
contamination.   They will be counted as drop outs.  
Given agency structure and high staff turnover rate, consented therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766688].  Similar 
to procedure stated above, any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766689] a role i n the study in 
condition A or B can participate in any other condition. If the participant is in condition C, 
then they can only participate in condition C regardless of a change in school or agency 
during the duration of the study.   
We expect each of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766690] [ADDRESS_1051557] that we will need to consider  426 referred students 
to yield 360 participating students (based on a 15% attrition rate).  
 
3.3 Study Population  
3.3.1  Inclusion Criteria  
1) Mental Health Agencies: Any CBH supported agency with 2 or more clinical supervisors 
implementing STS Programs in Philadelphia K -8 Schools.

baseline data collection.   
*Students meeting criteria in #2,  #3 & #[ADDRESS_1051559] be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Pr ocedures.  
4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Student S creening  / Referral Process  
Note Section 3.1.1.  
 
At the beginning of each project year, we will offer each participating school an in-service 
training for teachers and/or behavioral support staff on recognizing warning signs of 
excessive anxiety in children. Following the in- service, STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766692]. Either students  or parents  will 
be asked to complete the SCARED  and TH Q for identified  students . These are regular 
standard of care screening  procedures , so we will not collect these data for research 
purposes. If a student meets screening criteria (a total score >  25 or elevated sub- scale 
scores as noted by [CONTACT_766766] a 
parent ), the STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766693].  The study team may 
also assist in collecting the SCARED Screener from students, in cases where parental 
consent is obtained.  In these cases, the THQ will only be collected if the student is eligible 
and the parent/child consents/assents to the full study.  
4.2 Intervention Implementation (For Students) 
Families (students and caregivers) who consent to participate in this intervention, will be 
enrolled in one of two programs (FRIENDS  or CATS , depending on their school’s 
randomization), over the course of several  weeks.   The students will participate in the 
program during lunch or a non- academic period during the school day. The program s will 
be implemented by [CONTACT_752652]’s school -based STS Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Refer to section 1.2.1 for a 
description of the programs.  
   
   11 
Hectic periods of the year when student absenteeism and class trips are more common (1 st 
and 4th Quarters) as well as several class  breaks, including winter holidays (approximately 
10 days), snow days,  Spring Break (1 week) and state mandatory testing of students (2 
weeks) will interrupt group sessions. We  plan for the interventions to take place primarily 
during the [ADDRESS_1051560] the interventions differently, partly because one 
of the interventions is longer than the other (8 vs. 12 sessions). We were not able to l ocate 
a measure that would capture these factors. However, differences in length will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_766767] 5. We will then add up the  weekly average for each subsequent week 
and divide it by 8 ( CATS ) or 12 (FRIENDS). This will give us  an index of instruction time for 
each treatment, which we will then compare and use in covariate analysis.  
4.3 Implementation of Support Strategies  
Throughout the duration of the program, i mplementing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766694].  Depending on randomization, the research team 
will support the agency supervisors through the implementation of TT or TT+ (refer to 
section 3.1.3 for a descr iption of “supervision” and TT vs. TT +).  
4.[ADDRESS_1051561] Completion/Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care, education 
or employment.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the 
Inves tigator for lack of adherence to the study and/or development of exclusionary criteria.  
Student participants will be removed from the study if they develop exclusionary criteria 
during the trial (e.g. Bipolar Disorder I, acute suicidality, psychotic sympt oms, etc)  or if it is 
determined that the intervention group is not age/developmentally appropriate  based on the 
grade level of the majority of enrolled students . As examples, acutely suicidal participants 
would be excluded from study participation, as would participants who require medical 
attention for a severe medical illness.  It will be documented whether or not each subject 
completes the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related 
adverse events after the subject compl etes or withdraws from the study, they will be 
recorded in the study files . 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Screening Measurements (Students) 
Potential student participants will be screened using the SCARED . The SCARED is a [ADDRESS_1051562] information about Traumatic Life Events 
using the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ).  The TH Q is a 23 -item self -report measure 
for children that examines experiences with potentially traumatic events such as crime, 
general disaster, community violence, and sexual and physical assault using a yes/no 
format.   For each event endorsed, respondents are asked to respond “yes” or “no” if they 
have experienced or witnessed the event. The THQ is used in research and clinical settings 
and is available in English and Spanish.  
 
   
   [ADDRESS_1051563] this  
information, as well as the SCARED.  However, the THQ will not be used as a screening 
tool.  Students will be referred to the study solely on the basis of the SC ARED.     
  
5.2 Treatment Efficacy Evaluations (Information Collected about  the 
Student s enrolled in FRIENDS or CATS )  
Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC -2).  The MASC -2 is a 50- item rating 
scale for the assessment of anxiety symptoms in children. The MASC 2 has strong 
psychometric properties and is sensitive for measuring treatment effects. We will use the 
Total Anxiety score on the parent and child forms . 
Self-Report Copi[INVESTIGATOR_766695] (SRCM).  The SRCM is a 34- item 
self-report measure with good psychometric properties that is used to assess children’s copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274] (Seeking Social Support, Self -Reliance/ Problem -Solving, Distancing, I nternalizing, 
and Externalizing) .  The Total score for the SRCM will be used in outcome analyses.  
Children’s Depression Inventory –  2nd Edition (CDI -2). The CDI -[ADDRESS_1051564] (CBCL ). Completed by [CONTACT_3654],  this 118-item multi -axial rating scale 
provide s a measure of children’s (ages 6- 18) internalizing and externalizing difficulties , as well 
as social and academic competencies. Good psychometric properties ha ve been reported. We 
will use the Anxious/Depressed Somatic Complaints, Rule- Breaking Behavior and Aggressive 
Behavior scales in outcome analyses.  
Engagement v ersus Disaffection with Learning: Teacher  & Student  Report.   This is a 20 
item teacher and student report measure which include s four sub- scales: Behavioral 
Engagement, Emotional Engagement, Behavioral Disaffection and Emotional Disaffection. 
Validity of scores is supported by [CONTACT_766768], with in vivo observations in the classr oom, and with markers of self -system and 
social contextual processes. As such, these measures capture important features of 
engagement and disaffection in the classroom.  
*All measures noted above are validated / standardized.  
5.3 Implementation Outcome Measures   
All treatment sessions (across groups A, B and C) will be video recorded. Implementation 
will be measured by [CONTACT_766769] -five percent of sessions by 2 Independent Coders  (IC’s). 
IC’s will be Master’s level research staff members or advanced doctoral students in 
Psychology who have been trained to a reliable standard. Coder reliability will be checked 
quarterly. Kappa coefficients will be computed; a minimum of .[ADDRESS_1051565] I C will independently rate the session and the average of the 
three I Cs will be reported.  The I C’s will code the videos using the measures below (and 
attached to section 12 of the eIRB application):  
• Content fidelity  (how well therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766696] t as originally intended by 
[CONTACT_766770]), which is our main fidelity measure, will be assessed 
   
   [ADDRESS_1051566] (CFC). The CFC will reflect each activity 
component of the session agenda or outline of the original and adapte d treatment 
protocols. Raters will use a yes -no response scale to indicate whether or not an 
STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766697] a particular component .   
• Process fidelity  (delivering treatment content while actively engaging clients in 
therapy and doing it with a sense of competence) will be measured using an 
instrument based on a 12- item measure developed by [CONTACT_766771] (e.g., Counselor stops to clarify material; counselor’s tone is warm and 
positive; stimulated discussion; stopped to clarify material) rated on a 5 -point scale 
ranging from “not at all” to “very often.” We will use the total score (Overall Process 
Fidelity). This measure has excellent internal psychometric properties.  
Each supervision/consultation session will also be audio/ video -recorde d.  After each 
session, supervisors will complete the Supervision Rating Scale (SRS ) and the consultants  
(TT+)  will complete the Consultation Rating Scale (CRS) . Our team developed both 
measures. The SRS  and CRS  measure supervision/consultation content and process as 
detailed in the training manual (e.g., preparing for next session; Demonstrated empathy and 
provided positive reinforcement).   
The supervisions/consultation sessions will also be coded for interrupt ions and session 
length. Service interruption is defined as the degree to which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766698]. We will derive three scores averaged over the total 
number of sessions: a) Projected length of the session in minutes minus time spent on 
interruptions (e.g., answering a phone call, talking about unrelated topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]); b) Number of 
interruptions; c) Total number of supervision / consultation and treatment sessions per 
group.  
To measure differences  between suppor t strategies (TT vs. TT+), a gency supervisors (12) 
and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (60) in all groups, including participants who did not complete a treatment 
group but were consented and trained to participate,  will be interviewed regarding their 
perception of the appropr iateness and acceptability of the support they receive.  A study 
staff member  will cond uct open- ended, semi -structured interviews about the process, 
feasibility and acceptability of the type of support they receive. Interviewers will follow a 
script to ask questions of supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (e.g., “How acceptable is the level of 
support you received for the implementation of the FRIENDS protocol?”; “Was the 
supervision you received from your agency’s supervisor appropriate for running groups with 
children?”; “Was the consultation you received from the research team appropriate for 
preparing you to conduct supervision with STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]?” )  These i nterviews will be 
conducted at the end of each academic year, or on ce the treatment groups have 
completed . Qualitative methods will be used because there are currently no 
psychometrically validated measures that address these areas .   
To evaluate potential mediators and moderators of type of support on implementation 
fidelity , we will use the Index of Inter -professional Team Collaboration for Expanded School 
Mental Health (IITC -ESMH). The IITC -ESMH is a 26 -item measure rated on a 5- point 
Likert -type scale (1=never to 5=always) designed to measure four organizational 
constructs: Reflection on Process; Professional Flexibility; Newly Created Professional 
Activities; Role Interdependence. The measure has excellent psychometric properties. We 
will use the Total Score in mediator analyses.   All school staff members who parti cipate in 
referring students to the STS programs will be invited to participate in the completion of this 
measure.  For those school staff members who are not study participants, an information 
   
   14 
sheet will be provided to them explaining their participation in the completion of this 
measure.  
An additional measure of mediator and moderators of type of support will include a 
measur e of intention , specifically  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] ’ intention to conduct treatment sessions and 
participate in supervision. Th ese data will be used to 1) test for differences between the 
conditions. This is an important secondary outcome because high intentions to use  specific 
evidence based practices are necessary  but not sufficient for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s do use evidence-
based practices. T hese data will also 2) explain why child outcomes do (or don’t) differ: 
Intentions of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766699]  child outcomes .  We will measure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ 
intentions for each condition after training, and two  more times during treatment . 
6 STATISTICA L CONSIDERATIONS   
Variables pertinent to the study aims will be examined for skewed distributions and/or not 
meeting the assumptions of normality. For such variables, an appropriate method for 
variable transformation will be selected and applied to stabilize outcomes and their 
variances and to approximate the normal distribution. The geometric mean, the log 
transformation and the Box -Cox transformation are examples of such functions. In addition, 
we will consider non -parametric tests such as the Mann- Whitney test for comparing 
pre/post changes between two independent groups. Continuous variables will be 
summarized and described using means, medians, ranges, and standard deviation.  
Categorical data will be presented by [CONTACT_22977]. All summaries will be 
presented by [CONTACT_766772]. Since randomization was done at 
the school level, the potential for imbalances at pre- measurements between students who 
will be part of FRIENDS or CATS  groups are anticipated. We will first determine whether 
student’s related demographics, diagnostic, mental health, academic functioning, and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ level of experience are balanced in both conditions. We will account for any 
differences in the analysis by [CONTACT_766773].  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
Effectiveness between treatment groups (FRIENDS and CATS ) will be tested by [CONTACT_232839] 95% confidence limits (the width of the limit =|4.20|) for the differences in symptom 
severity, impairment, and academic competence (c hild outcomes) from pre to post between 
children receiving FRIENDS and children receiving CATS . If the calculated differences are 
within the 95% limit, then we will conclude that the two interventions have an equal impact 
or effect on child outcomes. If any of the differences in child outcomes is/are larger than the 
upper limit, then we will conclude that one intervention is better than the other. The limit of 
|4.20| was chosen based on the distribution of the reported mean effect sizes associate 
with FRIENDS . 
 
Qualitative interviews with supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (perceived acceptability of support 
strategies) will be audio -recorded, transcribed and entered into NVivo 10.0 for coding and 
analysis. For each interview, a codebook (of common themes related to the 
appropriateness and acceptability of the support they received)  will be developed and 
trialed by [CONTACT_766774], and revised through 
discussions and subsequent transcript reviews. Coders will meet regularly  to compare 
coding and revise the codebook. This will yield a stable set of qualitative codes that will be 
used to code the transcripts. Two independent coders will then code all of the transcripts. 
This iterative process will be continued until consensus is reached and saturation occurs. 
Coder reliability will be checked quarterly using the inter -rater reliability function in NVivo. 
   
   15 
Kappa coefficients will be computed; a minimum of .85 wi ll be required for each code . 
Retraining will be conducted should rater agreement fall below .85.   In order to aid with 
interpretation of results, IE’s will randomly select an additional 35% of the interviews and 
code them, as a measure of inter -rater-reliability.  We will conduct a structured content 
analysis for percei ved acceptability and appropriateness. The unit of analysis is each 
interview. We will create a case -by-variable matrix from the codes. The matrix will have an 
interviewee identifier number, type of support (i.e., TT, TT+), school, agency, subject 
demographic information, and codes. The code cells will contain the number of times the 
participant emitted words or phrases pertaining to perceived acceptability and 
appropriateness of the support they received. Once acceptability and appropriateness  are 
defined for each interview, percentages for acceptability (% acceptance) and 
appropriateness (% appropriate) out of the total number of words will be calculated. 
Comparison of % acceptance and % appropriate between TT, TT+ will be conducted using 
the Wilcoxon sum rank test.  
 
Datasets from the REDCap and NVivo databases will be combined using the statistical 
software SAS. Each session will be considered to be a “case” in the qualitative database 
and will be assigned a unique identifying number that will link it (ano nymously) to the 
quantitative database and individual session information such as fidelity scores.  
 
To measure the differences of implementation between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766700]. TT+, means of content fidelity will be calculated with its  95% Confidence 
interval. Similar analysis will be done regarding process fidelity.  
 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Costs will be assessed by [CONTACT_766775] (GLM). Links and families for 
the GLM will be empi[INVESTIGATOR_766701], Pregibon- Link test, Hosmer -Lemeshow test, and Pearson’s correlation test.  Measures 
of effectiveness will be derived from the “clinical” anal ysis of the trial data. Standard errors 
will be derived from a nonparametric bootstrap. Point estimates for the cost -effectiveness 
ratios will be based on the point estimates for the difference in costs and outcomes. 
Confidence intervals for the cost -effec tiveness ratio as well as an acceptability curve will be 
derived using the point estimates of the differences, their standard errors, and the 
correlation between the differences. Acceptability curves will allow agency administrators to 
judge whether the gains in children’s outcomes/fidelity are sufficient to justify any increases 
in cost.  
 
6.3 Sample Size and Power  
Number of students and statistical power . It is anticipated that a total of 284 (142 students 
per treatment protocol) will complete the proposed stu dy. The published reported effect size 
of FRIENDS has been estimated to equal 0.56 (cohen’s d ). In testing for equivalence of 
FRIENDS and CATS , using two one- sided tests with sample sizes of 142 in FRIENDS and 
142 in CATS  achieves 88% power at a 5% signifi cance level when the true difference 
between the means is 0 (null hypothesis), the standard deviation of the differences in 
means is assumed to be 11, and the equivalence limits are  
-4.[ADDRESS_1051567] and statistical power . To compare TT to TT+ for the implementation of 
CATS  (H2a), with 30 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766702] 30 in TT+ achieve 86% power to detect a 
   
   16 
difference of 8% between the null hypothesis that both group means are 80% (content 
fidelity) and the alternative hypothesis t hat the mean of group TT is 80% with estimated 
group standard deviations of 10 and 10 (an estimated effect size=.8) and with a significance 
level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1051568]. Similarly, group sample sizes of 
30 and 30 achieve 84% power to detect a difference of 0.7 in process fidelity between the 
null hypothesis that both group means are 4 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of 
group TT+ is 4.[ADDRESS_1051569] deviations of 0.9 and 0.9 (an estimated 
ES= .78) a nd with a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1051570].  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported t o the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at  the time of continuing 
review.  
For students enrolled in the treatment sessions :  Careful baseline screening will be 
conducted to identify participants whose risk for potential adverse effects are elevated were 
they to utilize the study treatment.  If a p articipant becomes more symptomatic (based on 
parent/child report or agency/ clinic ian judgment), the STS provider will review the 
participant’s clinical status with the project team and PI.  Concerns about deterioration will 
trigger an evaluation by [CONTACT_766776][INVESTIGATOR_766703] e study is in the best interest of the student .  Such participants will be 
removed from the study and treated openly with appropriate clinical care.   
In the event that suicidality is noted during the course of the eligibility evaluation or during 
participation in the study , CHOP evaluator will communicate finding to STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766704].  CHOP evaluator will 
also inform on- call CHOP -based licensed clinical provider to ensure any other potential safety 
measures that may need to be put in place to provide appropriate care, including but not limited 
to informing parents, STS staff, and other profes sionals involved with the child’s mental health 
care. If CHOP staff learns or observes of any changes in a child’s mental health status that 
would affect their eligibility status while participating in treatment groups, the child may be 
withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the PI. All eligibility decisions will be made in 
collaboration with the STS team.   
The procedures of reporting adverse events include immediately notifying their supervisor 
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_766705]. Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766706]’s cell phone number and beeper or cell phone contact [CONTACT_766777]. Children and guardians will also be given emergency contact [CONTACT_766778].

8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 
8.1.1  Randomization  
Selection and Randomization of schools, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766707]:  
At least thirty -six schools (potentially up to 41)  from mental health agencies will participate 
in this study. Computerized randomization lists will be generated with random assignment 
of schools (and therefore, the schools’ therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766708]) to Condition A (FRIENDS/TT),  B (CATS/TT), or C (CATS/TT+)  
with the goal of exposing all agenc ies to each of the three conditions over the course of the 
study .   
 
Schools will be stratified according to their size (greater than 625 students (yes/no)). 
Therefore, a list of 18 schools ( including their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) will be randomly assigned to the 
treatment groups and will participate in year 1 of the study (Randomize 1).   Schools listed 
in Randomize 1 will also be used in year 2 while recruit ing new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766709] (pote ntially repeat supervisors). We expect this to add 6 new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (and 
their supervisors), per intervention condition, to the study.  Schools spanning elementary 
and middle school grades will run interventions with middle school grades in year 1 and 
elem entary grades in year 2.   
   
From the remaining 18 schools (not randomized yet), a stratified new randomization list will 
be generated for year two and to be used again in year four (Randomize 2) of the study. As 
a result, a group of six new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526196] d their supervisors (potentially repeat supervisors) 
per intervention will be recruited for year [ADDRESS_1051571] of schools (Randomize 3) will be generated to recrui t a 
new group of 18 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766710] (6 per treatment group). Therefore, a new 
group of 18 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766711] (a total of 90 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) will participate in this study.  Each 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766712]. In schools spanning elementary and 
middle school grades, the study conditions will be evenly distributed across grade levels.  
  
The three randomization lists may result in assigning the same supervisors to different 
treatment groups. This may result in modifying the intervention effect due to the 
supervisor’s knowledge gained by [CONTACT_7624] a previous different treatment arm. 
Therefore, working with the agencies, we will make sure that supervisors will stay in the 
same support condition (i.e.: A or B; C)  they were originally assigned using randomize [ADDRESS_1051572] dropped schools by [CONTACT_766779] (size and 
type).

8.2 Data Collection and Management  
The data collection and management plan is consistent with CHOP Policy A -3-6: 
Acceptable Use of Technology Resources that defines the requirements for encryption and 
security of computer systems.  
• Identifiable data will be collected as part of this study.  This data includes full 
names/initials, date of birth, address, telephone number, e- mail addresses.  
However, participants will be identified by [CONTACT_766780].  This 
precautionary step allows for the electronic transfer of data without using data 
encryption techniques. At each stage of data collection and maintenance, measures 
are taken to ensure that all identifying information is taken out of data archives, and 
any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_766713], and that data files are password protected.  
Participant identification numbers are used that do not reveal the identity of 
participants (e.g., no use of birth dates, initials, social security numbers, etc). Only 
members of t he research team will have access to the data.  If the results of this 
study are presented at scientific meetings or published in professional journals, they 
will not contain information that could be used to identify parents, teachers, students 
or agency staff members.   
• Hard data will be kept in a locked file cabinet s at the Roberts Center for Pediatric 
Research .  Digital video and audio recordings (containing participant identifiers) will 
also be stored in locked file cabinets at CHOP.  The files will be transferred and 
stored to a CHOP computer network drive and analyzed by [CONTACT_766781]/fidelity scoring.  After all analyses are complete, the files will 
be destroyed and personal identifiers will not be retained with the data.  All 
computerized study databases for questionnaire data will be kept on a secure 
Windows NT server located at one of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s research buildings. This server 
is also protected by a firewall to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to study 
information.  
• Data collected as part of this study will be entered (data entry from CRFs or upload 
from Excel files) and stored using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) 
database, a secure web- based software database supporting clinical and 
translational research databases. The database will be password- protected, stored, 
and backed up on a daily basis by [CONTACT_137108]’s Research Institute.  REDCap provides 
data management functionality; including automated export procedures for 
seamless data downloads to Excel and commonly used statistical packages (SPSS, 
SAS, Stata, R). The database will incorporate range checks and between- variables 
consistency checks to ensure quality control. The system will signal the presence of 
questionable or potentially incorrect items.  A fter data cleaning and quality 
assurance procedures are completed, pertinent sets of data will be converted into 
SAS format for statistical analysis. The Biostatistics and Data Management Core 
(BDMC) of the Research Institute will provide staff expertise i n REDCap database 
design and implementation, randomization, and statistical analysis under the 
direction of the study’s biostatistician.  
   
   [ADDRESS_1051573] privacy and that the Investigator and other site 
personnel will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study.  
The following steps will be taken to maintain confidentiality:  (1) the inter view protocols and case 
record forms will be transported from schools to the research offices at CHOP in HIPAA 
compliant lockable bags and kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office; (2) subject identity 
will be de -identified using numbers keyed to a master list; (3) de- identified data will be entered 
directly into files that will be password protected; (4) all project staff will be trained in the 
importance of confidentiality, and will certify in writing to protect subject confidentiality; and (5) if  
the results of the study are published, data which might reveal the identity of any particular 
subject will be disguised.  Subjects and their families also will be informed about the limits of 
confidentiality, e.g., in cases of danger to self or others or  when previously undocumented 
physical or sexual abuse is discovered.  No identifiable data will be retained or used for future 
studies . The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the 
data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset 
(PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  
8.4 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The PI ([CONTACT_766786]) will assume overall responsibility for monitoring the integrity  of data 
collection and the safety of the interventions. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_269138] a weekly basis with 
members of the core research team, which has responsibility for data collection and 
supervising the STS clinical supervisors who will also oversee data collect ion conducted by 
[CONTACT_766782][INVESTIGATOR_11437].  The purpose of the meeting will be to monitor and ensure data collection 
and safety. Each member of the research team will be informed of his or her responsibility 
to ensure the integrity of data collection and the safety of children and families participating 
in the study. All adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRBs at CHOP, the City 
of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia School District and to NIMH. The IRB at CHOP will 
inform NIMH about actions taken in res ponse to the reporting of adverse events.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_1051574] rating scales from 
parents, children and teachers  for screening, to determine eligibility and to assess 
treatment outcomes. Children, parents and teachers could develop mild emotional 
discomfort or frustration associated with filling out questionnaires.  In the event that a child, 
parent or teacher becomes upset or irritated as a result of filling out the questionnaire, the 
clinicians or research staff collecting the da ta will try to determine the reason for the 
discomfort and provide any assistance that the informant might need.  If an informant 
expresses a desire to not complete the questionnaire, clinicians and research staff will no 
longer ask the informant to complete the questionnaire.   
Potential Risks Associated with FRIENDS.   There are no known physical or legal risks to 
participating in the study. One risk associated with the treatments, as with all therapeutic 
interventions, is that it might not be effective for every participant that enters treatment. If, 
after participatio n in the original or CATS  treatment, no improvement in symptoms is noted, 
   
   20 
or, if deterioration is noted during treatment (based on self -report, parent -, child -, teacher -
report or clinical judgment), or if a family is interested in further treatment, we wil l work with 
them to identify appropriate referrals. This will include the option to work with a clinician, 
either at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences 
(DCAPBS) of the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766714] &  Adolescent OCD, Tic, Trich 
& Anxiety Group (COTTAGe) at the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Psychiatry. 
Participants may experience at least some subjective distress during treatment, and their 
reactions will be closely monitored and addressed t herapeutically.  In the unlikely event that 
a child manifests unusually high levels of distress, suggesting prohibitive side effects or 
intolerance of treatment, he or she will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_766715] a case by [CONTACT_413]. In-
person parent meetings will be scheduled as needed should clinical need arise (e.g., address 
clinical worsening, address parent concerns, prevent premature termination).   
Potential Risks to ST S Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766716].  There are no known 
physical or legal risks for STS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766717]. One potential risk might be related to the video recording of treatment and 
supervision sessions. T herapi[INVESTIGATOR_766718]- recorded while 
conducting treatment sessions with children and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766719]- recorded while participating in supervision. In a current 
study we are conducting, school -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766720].  Supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766721]- recordings will be used for research purposes only and that they will not be 
shared with agency or school administ rators. If a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766722], we will not insist on having them participate or allow them to drop out of the study.      
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1051575] (amelioration or 
elimination of symptoms) and indirect (helpi[INVESTIGATOR_766723] -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]). If parents express interest in additional 
treatment for behavioral health concerns outside of current STS services at the end of study 
participation, a list of community behavioral health providers will be dis tributed .  The child’s 
STS team will also be informed of the parents’ expressed wish for additional services.  
8.5 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
8.6 Recruitment Strategy 
In collaboration with CBH  (during  the grant proposal and start -up phase s), the research 
team has  identified the participating mental health agencies.  Each agency will facilitate 
school selection as described in Sections 3.2 & 8.1.1.  S upervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766724] s will be approached for 
participation . However , participation is voluntary , so if a supervisor or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599138] 
   
   21 
consent to participate, we will ask a different supervisor/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (already in the school) to 
participate. All student recruitment will be based upon school /STS  referrals as noted in 
Sections 3.1.1.  Parents of students who meet screening criteria and who have indicated an 
interest in our program, will be contact[CONTACT_217702] a team member about the study.  
 
8.7 Informed Consent/Assent  and HIPAA Authorization  
Informed consent (parent) will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_766725].  Student assent will also be obtained.  In all cases, study procedures, as well as 
potential risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives will be clearly ex plained to both the 
parent and the child in a language understandable to each.  
Study procedures as well as potential risks, benefits and treatment alternatives will be 
described to subjects at the time participation in the study intervention is sought. No  student 
will be asked to participate if demonstrably unwilling, even if his or her parent wishes it. 
Students and their parents will be clearly informed of the voluntary and confidential nature 
of their participation, that treatment services will be provi ded in the school setting, and of 
their right to terminate their participation at any time without penalty.  Ample opportunity will 
be provided for them to ask any questions they may have of research staff.  If the family 
agrees to participate, the consent  form will be signed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_766726], and parents will be given a copy of these forms.  If the study 
team has exhausted all possible ways to meet a parent for the consent process and it is just 
not feasible, the study team member will discuss the ICF with the parent over the phone 
and answer any questions they may have about the study.  Afterward, if the parent/student 
is interested in participating, the parent may return a copy of the signed consent form to the 
STS or CHOP team member via fax or email.  Once parental consent is 
obtained/documented via fax/email, student assent will then be obtained in- person by a 
study team member in the school.  No study procedures will take place in the time between 
obtaining documentation of consent and obtaining student assent.  Children or families who 
are in need of treatment but do not qualify for this study or decide not to participate will be 
provided with appropriate treatment referrals.  
All treatment sessions  are video  recorded for fidelity monitoring. P arent consent for 
videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_766727] , so that the videos may be used for the training of future staff members and 
education purposes, potentially outside of CHOP (i. e.: presentations to professional and/or 
medical boards) .  
Consent for the participation of supervisors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766728]. They will be provided with a consent letter, outlining what their  participation will 
entail, and will be given the same opportunity as families to ask questions and make an 
informed decision regarding their involvement.  Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_766783], which will include Co -Investigators, Post -Doctor al Fellows, and other research 
staff.  Refusal to participate by a supervisor or STS  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766729].  
8.8 Payment to Subjects/Families  
The agencies providing the treatment will bill Community Behavioral Health (CBH) for 
services (i.e., fee for service) related to treatment provided for this study.  
   
   22 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_712472] a $37 stipend for each supervision session attended with their 
supervisor. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766730] $18.50 stipend per half -hour of “prep time” 
(e.g., preparation to run group, preparation for supervision, etc.)   Therefore, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766731] a maximum of $74 per session implemented, for which he/she prepared to 
implement and engaged in supervision with his/her supervisor.   
Supervisors will be reimbursed at a rate of $[ADDRESS_1051576]  (as is existing standard of practice via agency requirement ), any time spent 
preparing for supervision) , and for those supervisors enrolled in Condition C, any 
consultation session he/she participates in with the CHOP study team.  
Parents will re ceive $ 10 for completing baseline measures (pre- intervention time point) and 
$[ADDRESS_1051577].   
Teachers will receive $10  for completing measures pre- intervention and $10  for completing 
outcome measures at pos t.   
Students  will receive small gifts (e.g., pencils, notebooks, small toys) as reinforcement for 
participating and reaching certain goals in group sessions.

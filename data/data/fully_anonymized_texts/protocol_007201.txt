Title of Study:  An Open -Label Extension Study of Levoketoconazole (2S,4R-ketoconazole) in the 
Treatment of Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome  
Study center(s): This is a multicenter study at approximately [ADDRESS_365264] . 
Phase of development: Phase 3  
Objective :  
The objective of this study is  to assess long -term safety and efficacy durability of levoketoconazole as 
chronic treatment for endogenous Cushing’s S yndrome (CS). 
Criteria for evaluation:  
When calculating changes from Baseline for efficacy evaluations, Baseline will be either or both of : 
• Open-label extension (OLE) study Baseline ; 
• The original  parent study COR -2012- 01 [SONICS ] or COR -2017- 01 [LOGIC S]) Baseline ;  
With the choice of Baseline described in the Statistical Analysis Plan for each endpoint/analysis.  
Exploratory e fficacy  endpoint s:  
• Proportions of subjects with mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC): 1) Less or equal to the upper limit 
of normal (ULN) of the reference range; 2) Above the ULN to 1.5X the ULN; and 3) Above 1.5X the ULN;  
• Changes from B aseline in markers of  cortisol including mUFC and late  night salivary cortisol  
(LNSC); 
• Proportion of subjects with LNSC above the ULN of the reference range ; 
• Changes from B aseline in Clinical Signs and S ymptoms of CS, health -related quality of life (QoL), 
and symptoms of depression; 
• Changes from B aseline  in biomarkers of CS comorbidities ( fasting blood glucose  [FBG] , fasting 
insulin, homeostatic model assessment -insulin resistance [HOMA -IR], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], 
blood pressure, total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotei n-cholesterol [HDL -C], low -density 
lipoprotein- cholesterol [LDL -C], high -sensitivity C -reactive protein [ hsCRP]);  
• Frequency of usage and changes from B aseline in frequency of usage of anti -diabetic, anti-
cholesterol and anti-hypertensiv e therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ; 
• Complia nce (adherence) and persistence with therapy per  tablet counts . 
Safety  endpoints:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_299474] (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) as well as by [CONTACT_5292] s, safety laboratory 
panels (including adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ ACTH ], liver function tests [ LFTs ], blood chemistry , 
hematology), electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) (to include assessment of the QTc interval),  vital signs  and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_299420] ( MRI ) for subjects with a history of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_46608].

 Overall Design and Plan : This is a long -term, OLE  study of levoketoconazole in subjects with 
endogenous CS who have completed one or both parent studies or otherwise potentially qualify for this 
study, as defined  in the entry criteria.  
Long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy data will be collected at intervals consistent with re cognized 
standards of care.  
Subjects will remain on the  previously established Therapeutic Dose of levoketoconazole that they were 
last receiving prior to  entry into this OLE  study unless a change in dose is medically indicated .  Certain 
subjects that were enrolled in Study COR -2017- 01 when randomization was closed or subjects with a gap 
in treatment with levoketoconazole may require re -establishment or establishment of a Therapeutic Dose.  
As a result, dose titration may be required, and the Investigator will consult with the Medical Monitor to determine the starting dose of levoketoconazole.  
 Any planned dose increase of levoketoconazole above 
the previously establ ished Therapeutic Dose will require the M edical Monitor ’s prior approval and will 
require unplanned visits or additional evaluations to investigate the etiology underlying the need for higher dose levels.   If approved, d ose increases will generally be made as 150 mg/day and no more frequently than 
once every 2 week s, and will be accompanied by [CONTACT_299475].  Dose decreases may be made as needed for reasons of safety or tolerability and will be 
documented but do not require prior Medical Monitor  approval.
  
The study comprises S creening and B aseline V isits followed by [CONTACT_299476] 3 month s. Dose 
Adjustmen t/Safety Monitoring Visits will also be conducted in the event of a need for a dose increase of 
levoketoconazole during the study .  
Screening  and Baseline Visits  
Subjects entering directly from a parent stud y: The visit schedule for this OLE study can overlap with those 
of the parent studies  to ensure a smooth transition to the OLE  study with no break in levoketoconazole 
usage .

If necessary, t he OLE Screening  assessments may be conducted at a separate  Screening V isit that must be 
completed approximately 3- [ADDRESS_365265] be obtained within 2 weeks of the Screening/Baseline visit and UFCs must be obtained within 6 weeks of the Screening/Baseline visit.    
Subjects entering this study following a break in therapy of greater than or equal to six months  will 
undergo all Screening and Baseline procedures as outlined in Appendix A .

 Regular Study Visits  
Regular visits should occur every 3 months (+/ - 7 days) or more often as necessary for enhanced safety 
monitoring (e.g. if a dose  increase is required). Some procedures, however, are required only every 6 
months , and MRIs are required annually and only for subjects with history of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_46608] . The timings 
of each assessment are shown in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).

consent  and receive at least one dose of levoketoconazole in this OLE study . This population will be used 
for the analyses of safety and efficacy . 
Statistical methods:  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment [ADDRESS_365272] two -sided 95% confidence intervals . P-values from statistical tests for significance will be 
calculated for descriptive purposes only. For continuous endpoints, the change from each of the two 
Baselines to each regular visit in the OLE study, including the final visit, will be calculated. The 95% confidence interval for the mean change s and corresponding p- value s will be calculated using paired t -tests. 
For categorical  endpoints, the shifts from each of the two Baselines to each regular visit in the OLE study, 
including the final visit, will be presented. The 95% confidence interval for difference s in the paired 
proportions will be calculated using the adjusted Wald method, and the shifts will be evaluated for 
significance using McNemar’s test  or Bowker test of symmetry . The mean changes from Baseline to each 
regular visit will be compared between  the parent  studie s using unpaired t -test for continuous endpoints , 
and the proportions at each regular visit will be compared between the parent studies using Fisher ’s Exact 
test for categorical  endpoints. 
Interim analyses may be performed at the Sponsor’s discretion.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
Levoketoconazole is currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies. Study COR -2012-
01 (also known as SONICS)  is a single -arm, open -label, dose titration and maintenance 
study to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, and  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of 
levoketoconazole in subjects with endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome  (CS). Following  
initial Screening and wash out period s, as applicable, SONICS  comprises  three treatment 
phases:  a Dose Titration Phase to achieve an effective and tolerable maximum dose ( i.e., 
the Therapeutic Dose)  lasting approximately 2 to 21 weeks;  a Maintenance Phase of 6 
months treatment at the Therapeutic Dose, and an Extended Evaluation Phase of 6 
months of continued treatment. L evoketoconazole i s administered as 150 mg immediate 
release tab lets for oral twice daily dosing; total daily dose is titrated in 150 mg 
increments from a starting dose of 300  mg up to a maximal daily dose of 1200 mg.  
Ninety -four ( 94) subjects w ere enrolled into the Dose Titration Phase of Study COR -
2012- [ADDRESS_365280] 70  subjects completing the 6 -month Maintenance Phase.   
Study COR -2017-01 (also known as LOGICS ) is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled withdrawal following single -arm, open -label  levoketoconazole study to assess 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of levoketoconazole in subjects with endogenous 
CS. A blinded -treatment Restoration Phase is included for subjects who do not require 
early rescue and tolerate the [ADDRESS_365281] 26 study completers (either completed all visits in the 
Randomized Withdrawal Phase or required early rescue).  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a detailed description of all preclinical 
and clinical studies conducted with levoketoconazole.  
1.[ADDRESS_365282] been used previously without satisfactory results , the 
situation of many subjects enrolled in the parent studies .  
The emerging safety profile of levoketoconazole supports its use in an open -label 
extension (OLE) study  (OPTICS) .  Aggregate safety data from Study COR -2012- 01 has 
been reviewed  systematically at 6 -month intervals, by [CONTACT_105231]  (DM C). There have been  no changes to the study design or conduct required 
based on  DMC review s. Accumulating adverse reaction information from Study COR -
2012- 01, as described in the IB , is consistent with the safety profile gathered during the 
investigational use of levoketoconazole in patients with type [ADDRESS_365283]:   completed Study COR -2012- 01 (defined as those who complete the Extended 
Evaluation Phase)  or Study COR -2017-01 (defined as those who complete the 
Restoration Phase; or who are re scued early with levoketoconazole ); or who subsequently 
joined a n amed patient program or other Expanded Access Program ; or who were 
receiving treatment in Study COR -2017- [ADDRESS_365284] had experience using a prior -established safe and effective Therapeutic 
Dose  (most will have been levoketoconazole users for over 1 year  at time of entry into 
the current study ).  Certain subjects that were enrolled in Study COR -2017- 01 when 
randomization was closed or subjects with a gap in treatment with levoketoconazole m ay 
require re -establishment or establishment of a Therapeutic Dose.  As a result , dose 
titration may be required as outlined in Section 8.2. 
2 OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this study is  to assess long -term safety and efficacy durability of 
levoketoconazole as chronic treatment for endogenous CS.  
3 ENDPOINTS 
3.1 Criteria for Evaluation  
When calculating changes from Baseline for efficacy evaluations, Baseline will be either 
or both of:  
• Open -label extension (OLE) study B aseline; 
• The original parent study COR -2012- 01 [SONICS ] or COR -2017- 01 [LOGICS ] 
Baseline;  
with the choice of Baseline described in the Statistical Analysis Plan for each endpoint 
analysis.    
Exploratory  Efficacy Endpoints   
• Proportion s of subjects with mean urinary free cortisol ( mUFC ): 1) Less or equal 
to the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) of the reference range ; 2) A bove the ULN to  
1.5X the ULN; and 3) Above 1.5X the ULN ; 
• Changes from Baseline in markers of cortisol  including mUFC and late  night 
salivary cortisol  (LNSC) ; 
• Proportion of subjects with LNSC above the ULN of the reference range; 
• Changes from Baseline in C linical Signs and S ymptoms of CS, health -related 
quality of life ( QoL), and symptoms of depression;  
• Changes from Baseline in biomarkers of CS comorbidities (fasting blood glucose  
[FBG ], fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessmen t-insulin resistance [HOMA -
IR], hemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ], blood pressure, total cholesterol, high -density

 lipoprotein -cholesterol [ HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein -cholesterol [ LDL -C], 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ]); 
• Frequency of usage and changes from B aseline in frequency of usage of anti -
diabetic, anti- cholesterol  and anti-hypertensive  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ; 
• Compliance (adherence) and persistence with therapy per tablet counts . 
3.2 Safety Endpoints  
Safety will be assesse d by [CONTACT_299480] A dverse Events ( AEs), Serious 
Adverse Events ( SAEs ) and Adverse Events of S pecial Interest ( AESIs ) as well as by 
[CONTACT_5292] s, safety laboratory panels (including Adrenocorticotropic Hormone 
[ACTH ], liver function tests [ LFTs ], blood chemistry , hematology), electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ) (to include assessment of the QTc interval), vital signs and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] M agnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI)  for subjects with history of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_46608] . 
[ADDRESS_365285] completed  one or both  parent studies  or otherwise potentially qualify for this  study , 
as defined in the Inclusion Criteria (Section 5.1):  
For subjects entering directly from parent studies , the visit schedule for this OLE study is 
designed to overlap with those of the parent studies to ensure a smooth transition to the  
OLE  study with no break in drug supply for subjects  as shown below .

Subjects will remain on the  previously established Therapeutic Dose of levoketoconazole 
that they were last receiving prior to entry  in this OLE study .  
The study comprises Screening and Baseline Visits followed by [CONTACT_299481] 3 months . 
Dose Adjustment/Safety Monitoring Visits will also be conducted in the event of a need 
for a dose increase of levoketoconazole during the study .  
Details of study assessments and procedures are provided in Section  6.  Details of AE 
monitoring are available in Section 13.5. The timings of assessment s are shown in the 
Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ). 
Adequate medical coverage will be provided by [CONTACT_299482] (including nights, weekends and holidays) to ensure that prompt safety decisions 
can be made and appropri ate medical interventions provided.   The Investigator should 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 24 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 provide all subjects with instructions how to access the medical staff reg ardless of day 
and time  to obtain medical care.  
 
4.2 Rationale for Study Design 
The chosen design has taken into consideration the reported experience treating subjects 
with CS with ketoconazole [ Castinetti et al., 2014].  Like ketoconazole, dosing of 
levoketoconazole needs to be individualized, since therapeutic need varies considerably among subjects.  As such, entry into the study is limited to subjects who have established 
a safe, tolerated  and effective Therapeutic Dose of levoketoconazole in one of the two 
parent studies.   
Long -term safety and tolerability data will be collected at 3-month intervals, with 
efficacy measures also regularly ass essed .  Details of safety and efficacy data collection 
and reporting in this study are provided in Section  6.  
If needed, dose increases of levoketoconazole are associated with enhanced monitoring 
and reporting requirements as summarized in Section  6.1.[ADDRESS_365286] be 
approved by [CONTACT_1689] , and should not exceed 150 mg/day , and the dose 
should not be increased more frequently than every 2 weeks.  
Any SAEs and AESIs ( i.e. adrenal insufficiency, persistent QT prolongation and potential 
hepatic events) require reporting within [ADDRESS_365287] every 3 months at the  clinic visits.  
4.3 Study Duration  
There is no predefined completion timeframe for this OLE study, and interim analyses may be performed at the Sponsor’s discretion.  Subjects may continue receiving or 
discontinue levoketoconazole based on the medical judgement of the Investigator while 
the study remains open.   It is anticipated that subjects’ participation may continue for at 
least [ADDRESS_365288]’s enrollment criteria to ensure that subjects meet the eligibility criteria.  
5.[ADDRESS_365289] meet ONE of the following  
criteria :  
1. Completed the Extended Evaluation Phase of Study COR -2012- 01 (i.e. M12) . 
2. Completed the Restoration Phase of Study COR -2017- 01 (i.e. RES2).  
NOTE:  Subjects meeting criteria [ADDRESS_365290] had a break in therapy should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor to determine the starting dose of  levoketoconazole . Prior to resuming 
treatment with levoketoconazole, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_299427]’s syndrome must 
undergo an appropriate washout period , with  minimum durations as follows : 
• Ketoconazole or metyrapone: 2 weeks;  
• Dopamine agonists: bromocriptine (2 weeks), cabergoline (8 
weeks);  
• Octreotide acetate LAR, lanreotide Autogel®, pasireotide LAR: 12 
weeks;  
• Lanreotide SR: 8 weeks;  
• Octreotide acetate (immediate release) or short -acting pasireotide: 
1 week;  
• Mifepristone (RU 486, KORLYM®): 4 weeks;  
• Megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate (and selected 
other synthetic progestins): 6  weeks.

All medical care providers identified by [CONTACT_423], in addition to the Investigator, 
MUST be given  sufficient written instructions about the potential risks of adrenal 
insufficiency associated with the use of cortisol synthesis inhibitors, such as levoketoconazole.   Such written instructions will be provided to Investigator s for 
distribution to other m edical care providers.  
In addition to the protocol -specified procedures, at any time during the study 
appropriate medical evaluations and safety interventions should be implemented, as necessary, based on the clinical presentation of the subject per  standa rd of care, at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  Changes to the medical conditions, history and 
medications and all other medical interventions will be documented in the 
Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF s). 
6.1 Summary of Procedures by [CONTACT_299484].  This 
is to ensure a smooth transition to the OLE study and no break in drug supply for subjects 
transitioning from a parent study.  Appendix A  indicates the procedures and assessments 
that are required for each of the OLE  study visits, including those  overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] a 
parent study . Data collected from parent studies will be used in this OLE study and 
assessments that overlap should be performed once (e.g. data from vital signs  may be 
recorded in a n eCRF  for the parent study and in a n eCRF  for this OLE study).  
Subjects who have completed a parent study  and are currently receiving drug in a n amed 
patient program  (or equivalent study e.g., individual subject IND) or other Expanded 
Access Program  and are to be rolled over into this  OLE  study  will also follow the visit 
schedule outlined below and in Appendix A .

 6.1.1 OLE Screening Visit 
In addition to scheduled assessments conducted for the parent study  (i.e., Visit M9 for 
Study COR -2012-01 or Visit RES1 for Study COR -2017- 01) when there is an overlap of 
parent and OLE study visits, the following assessments will be performed at Screening  
for enrollment into this OLE study : 
• Informed consent: p rior to any study p rocedures, all subjects must understand and 
sign the informed consent.  
• Review an d confirmation of eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria).   NOTE:  
Assessments from the parent study w ill also be used to support eligibility 
assessment for this OLE study.  
For subjects whose parent study visits align with the OLE Screening and/or Baseline,  
Appendix A  does not account for additional tests required as part of Study COR -2012-01 
or Study COR -2017-01. Refer to the parent study’s respective Time and Events Schedule  
to ensure all required tests are completed .  Subjects from an Expanded Access Program 
will have all tests conducted per Appendix A . 
In some cases, subjects may  have a gap between completing a parent study and enrolling 
in this study that may in some cases involve a break in treatment.   For subjects who have 
completed a parent study within [ADDRESS_365295] be obtained within 2 weeks of the Screening/Baseline visit and UFCs must be 
obtained within 6 weeks of the Screening/Baseline visit.   
 
Subjects entering this study following a break in therapy of greater than or equal to six months  will undergo all Screening and Baseline procedures as outlined in Appendix A. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_365296] treatment visit of the parent study ( Appendix A ). This visit will include a final 
assessment of subject qualifications for this OLE  study , prior to treatment  being 
dispensed . Subjects from an Expanded Access Program will have all assessments 
conduc ted per Appendix A . 
In addition to the scheduled assessments being conducted for the parent study at either 
M12 or RES2  (depending on the corresponding parent study) , the following assessments  
will be performed at the Baseline Visit: 
• Reconfirm no changes in eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria ) from OLE 
Screening Visit .  NOTE:  Assessments fr om the parent study  will also be used to 
support eligibility assessment for this OLE study.   
• Fasting insulin and hsCRP ( For COR -2012- 01 subjects only , as these assessments 
are not included in M12).

After eligibility is confirmed and the assessments shown  in Appendix A  are recorded, 
levoketoconazole will be dispensed for con tinued use.  
NOTE:  ECGs from  the parent study will occur prior to taking the morning dose  of 
levoketoconazole.  Following the first dose of drug in this study, another ECG will be 
performed 1 -2 hours later.   
6.1.3 Regular Study Visits 
Regular visits are to occur every 3 months  (+/- 7 days) , or more often as necessary  for 
enhanced safety monitoring  (e.g. if a dose increase is required) . Some procedures, 
however, are required only every [ADDRESS_365297]’s Final Study Visit, all procedures that occur every 3 months, every 6 
months, and an nually, will be performed (as shown in Appendix A ). 
6.1.[ADDRESS_365298] will be asked about any changes in their health since  the Final Study Visit.  
6.1.6 Dose Adjustment/Safety Monitoring Visits  
In the event of a need for a dose increase of levoketoconazole during the study, regardless 
of dose level or prior treatment at that dose level, additional safety monitoring, as 
described in  Table  1 and in  Appendix A , is required  in addition to all other assessments 
listed in Appendix A  under Dose Adjustment/Safety Visits .  
NOTE:  Doses should not be increased without permission of the Medical Monitor . 
Dose increases should not exceed 150 mg/day and the dose should not be increased 
more frequently than every 2 weeks . A careful history should be obtained to look for a

A decrease of levoketoconazole requires additional reporting  if it occurs as a reaction to 
an AESI associated with the use of levoketoconazole.    
6.2 Study  Assessments 
6.2.1 Physical Examination and Assessment of Clinical Signs and Symptoms 
of CS  
Full physical examinations will be performed by a study physician or designee (e.g. a 
nurse practitioner  or physician’s assistant ) at the times indicated in Appendix A . The 
physical examinations will be inclusive of all body systems  (except genitourinary and 
rectal)  and should include height (cm) and weight (kg).  Body mass index will be derived  
based on data entere d in the eCRF  during th e visit.   
At some visits, t he examining physician  will be asked to complete a questionnaire related 
to the assessment of Clinical Signs and Symptoms of CS (see Appendix L).  The results 
will be used to quantify changes in Clinical Signs and Symptoms of CS.    
6.2.2 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will include temperature, sitting systolic blood pressure ( SBP), 
sitting diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and heart rate (HR) at the OLE Baseline Visit and 
at each  subsequent  visit throughout the study (see Appendix A ). Blood pressure and HR 
will be done in triplicate at each visit.  
For proper measurement of blood pressure, the following procedures should be followed:  
• An appropriately sized cuff for the size of the subject’s arm circumference should 
be used to minimize inaccurate readings ;  
• Subjects should not smoke  or exercise for at least  30 minutes before blood 
pressure measurement s; 
• Subjects should sit in a chair with a back support and the arm supported at heart 
level with feet flat on the floor ;  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 32 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Subject s should void prior to the measurement  and; 
• Blood pressure measurements will be made  in triplicate over a minimum of 
approximately [ADDRESS_365299] be repeated if reported as clinically significant or if 
machine/equipment errors occur.   Not clinically significant, out-of- range blood pressure 
or HR measurements may  be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion.   Any confirmed, 
clinically significant adverse change from the OLE Baseline in vital signs must be  
recorded as an AE. 
Guidelines for classification of blood pressure readings and recommendations for follow -
up of abnormal values  are provided in Appendix H. 
6.2.3 Spaulding 12-Lead Electrocardiograms (ECG)  
QTc interval prolongation is considered an important identified risk of levoketoconazole 
therapy ( as discussed in the  IB).  The mechanisms by [CONTACT_299485]: direct hERG (IKr potassium 
channel) inhibition (observed  in vitro ), interference with metabolism of drugs that 
prolong the QTc (observed  in vitro and in clinical studies ), changes in adren al hormone 
levels that lead to hypokalemia (theoretical) and induction of nausea (observed  in clinical 
studies ). 
The QTc interval is highly variable  and readily influenced by [CONTACT_299486].  For 
examples, f ood intake increases the  QTc interval.  Nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, 
dizziness and electrolyte abnormalities ( especially relevant to this study, 
hypokalemia/ hypo magnesemia) can also prolong the QTc interval.   Such factors should 
be avoided  when possible (e.g. electrolytes should be replaced as needed to maintain 
serum levels well within the normal range) during QTc measurements  and should be 
considered when interpreting QTc interval findings .     
In this study, ECG monitoring is being performed at the designated times shown in 
Appendix A  using a Spaulding ECG device that ac quires a 12 -lead ECG continuously 
over a pre -programmed period (minimum time of 1 minute to maximum time of 5 
minutes).  A summary of the ECG assessment will be generated via  central reading  by 
[CONTACT_119286] , with the results serving as the definitive measurem ent of QTc .  Additionally, 
the Spaulding device will provide a real -time automated analysis (using the University of 
Glasgow diagnostic 12 -lead algorithm, [ Macfarlane 2005] ) of the ECG that can serve as 
an unconfirmed measurement of QTc interval for purposes of safety monitoring.  
NOTE: The Spaulding ECG device should be used for all assessments during the study 
unless it is non -operational, in which case another ECG m ay be performed on a local 
device or a device other than the Spaulding device supplied for this study  and transmitted 
to Spaulding for central reading via printout.   A 12-lead ECG  will be obtained within 
approximately 1 to 2 hours after drug administration  (i.e., at approximately  the peak 
plasma concentration  of levoketoconazole)  after the subject has rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] [ADDRESS_365300] 2 hours 
(small snacks may be allowed for subjects with diabetes).  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 33 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 In general, QTc interval measurements are considered “normal” or “abnormal prolonged 
(clinically significant)” or “abnormal prolonged (not clinically significant)”.   If the QTc 
results have been identified as “abnormal prolonged”, whether  it is deemed clinically 
significant  or not , these results should be reported to the Sponsor’s designated safety 
group as an AESI ( Section  14.1.1  and 14.1.2 ), appropriate action taken  and the event 
recorded in the eCRF .  Other than the AESI for QTc interval prolongation, there is no 
additional formal reporting of ECG findings required for this study; however, clinically significant findings other than QTc prolongation should be reported as an AE, SAE or 
AESI, as applicable per definitions in  Section 13.5 and 14. 
NOTE: For subjects entering directly from Study COR -2012- 01, the Spaulding device 
previously used in the parent study is not planned for use in  this OLE study.  However, it 
is acceptable to use the prior device for the OLE Screening and/or Baseline Visit. 
Additional information for assessment of QTc i nterval  is available  in Appendix N . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures for Evaluating and Managing Prolonged QTc 
Interval Greater than 500 Msec or More than 60 Msec Above Baseline 
If at any time during the study, the  Spaulding automated ECG reading indicates a QTc 
interval greater than 60 msec above Baseline or an absolute QTc interval more than 
500 msec:  
• The other ECG findings and the subject’s clinical condition must be considered to 
determine the plan of action.  QTc prolongation that is accompanied by [CONTACT_299487], polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or ECG abnormalities 
accompanied by [CONTACT_299488]/symptoms of serious arrhythmia might require 
urgent intervention and inpatient monitoring; immediate cardiology consultation 
is recommended.   
• With one abnormal ECG reading, the subject should first be questioned about : 
o Recent ingestion of food within the preceding [ADDRESS_365301] increased QTc interval, either 
directly (via direct effect on the QTc interval) or indirectly because of a drug 
interaction that may have increased the concentrations of study medication 
(see Appendix I).  If such a drug is identified, it should be stopped 
immediately.  
o Symptoms of nausea or vomiting just prior to the ECG assessment, or 
lightheadedness or similar symptoms th at may influence the QTc interval.   In 
such cases, an ECG evaluation should be repeated once the subject's symptoms have abated.  Study medication may have to be withheld if the 
symptoms are protracted and the QTc interval prolongation remains evident. The Investigator should ensure that the symptoms as well as the ECG results 
are not due to a cardiovascular event, such as a myocardial infarction.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 34 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • If the subject has not eaten, has no confounding medical symptoms/events, does 
not have a concomitant medication that may be increasing the QTc interval, and 
there are no other significant abnormalities on the ECG warranting imm ediate 
medical intervention then:  
o A repeat ECG evaluation should be undertaken within approximately 
30 minutes of the observed ECG prolongation or as soon as it is practical.  
• If the repeat ECG evaluation continues to demonstrate a QTc interval more than 
[ADDRESS_365302] for evaluation of electrolyte abnormalities, 
including  at a minimum magnesium , calcium  and potassium.  
o If electrolyte abnormalities are subsequently identified, these should be 
corrected before re -evaluation of the ECG.  Study medication  may be 
temporarily withheld until electrolytes can be normalized.   It is recommended 
to keep serum potassium concentration in the high -normal range  (i.e. 4 mEq /L 
or higher) . 
o If electrolytes are normal and no other cause can be identified to account for 
the absolute QTc interval above [ADDRESS_365303].  
• In all cases, abnormal morphology of the ECG (especially T wave changes), if 
present, should be considered an AE  and be recorded in the e CRF.  
6.2.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical lab oratory  testing should, at a minimum, be conducted at the times indicated in 
Appendix A . As noted in Section 6.1.6 , subjects require more frequent ( biweekly  or 
weekly ) monitoring of liver function in the month following an increase in dose during 
the OLE study .  Clinically significant changes in laboratory analyte values should be 
reporte d as an AE, SAE or AESI, as applicable per definitions in Section  14. 
A complete list of all the analytes is provided in Appendix B .  
All testing will be conducted in the morning  following a [ADDRESS_365304] (small snacks may 
be allowed for s ubjects with diabetes; a ny food intake should be recorded in  the subject 
source documents  for reference) unless indicated otherwise in  the laboratory manual.

levels should be monitored biweekly for 1  month (Section  6.1.6 ).  
NOTE: The clinical diagnosis of a drenal insufficiency (for which guidance is provided in 
Section  14.3 should be reported as an AESI.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   24-Hour UFC  
24-hour urine collections for determination of UFC are needed for  drawing reliable 
efficacy inferences from this study.  Subjects should be fully informed prior to initiating 
procedures that they will be asked to collect 2 4-hour urine samples at regular intervals 
throughout the study, possibly including during work days and holidays.  
Please see the SPM and the Laboratory Manual for details on urine collection procedures.  
Note that, lifestyle and dietary restrictions listed  in Section  7 state su bjects should be 
instructed to avoid consuming more than 4 L/day of liquids on the day of urine 
collections.  
Urine will be collected in provided containers. The parent study’s materials will be used for all tests that overlap with this OLE study. Three adequate [ADDRESS_365306]’s OLE 
Baseline Visit overlaps with M12 (as part of COR -2012- 01), then 2 collections will be 
collected. The total volume of urine and urine creatinine excretion rates will be measured 
from the 24 -hour collections as markers of collection adequacy, as detailed below in this 
section.  Collections judged to be inadequate should  be repeated; the rationale for repeat 
collections should be captured in the eCRF s.  
Urine collections will ideally begin enough in advance of a visit to allow discussion of the results at the visit (i.e. usually 7 -14 days prior) if being delivered by [CONTACT_30367].  
Collections can also be delivered by [CONTACT_299489]. Careful 
instructio ns must be provided to the subject for proper urine collection and cold -storage 
of samples until delivery.  All supplies  (i.e. waterproof pen, urine jugs, urine hats and 
labels)  needed for proper collection and storage of urine will be provided by [CONTACT_299490].  
Determining urine collection adequacy  
The total volume of urine and urine creatinine excretion rate w ill be measured from 
24-hour collections as markers of the adequacy of collection.  Total urine volume should

Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 36 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 be between 400 and 4000 mL/day.  E xpected values for normal 24 -hour creatinine 
excretion rates  for subjects  up to age 70  years are provided in  Table 2. 
 
Table 2 Expected  Normal 24- Hour Creatinine Excretion from Adequate Urine 
Collections  
Males  1. Age 18 to 50: 18.5 mg/kg/day  
2. Age 51 to 70: 15.7 mg/kg/day 
 
Females  1.   Age 18 to 50: 16.5 mg/kg/day

In subjects over [ADDRESS_365307] 24 -hour urine creatinine 
excretion rates below the values reported in  Table 2 [Petersenn 2013 ]. Therefore, 
creatinine excretion values that are somewhat below the normative value will be 
considered indicative of adequate collection  when  urine volume is adequate.  The 
Medical Monitor will provide guidance as to the adequacy of the collection.  
Urinary Free Cortisol Sample Analysis  
UFC levels from the 24 -hour urine collections will be assayed at a central laboratory per 
validated methodology using high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectroscopy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Collection of Late Night Salivary Samples for Free C ortisol  
LNSC  samples from [ADDRESS_365308] be done between 11 PM and midnight and 
following  the dietary restrictions listed in Section  7.  Subjects should not sleep and 
subsequently awaken within 2 hours of collecting the saliva sample.  
All samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  Details for collection and handling 
of samples are provided in the SPM and laboratory manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Morning Cortisol and Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH)  
Morning serum cortisol (untimed) will be measured in all subjects every 3 months and at 
Dose Adjustment/Safety Monitoring Visits in the event of a need for a dose increase of 
levoketoconazole during the study.  ACTH levels will be measured in all subjects every 6 
months  and at Dose Adjustment/Safety Monit oring Visits, as listed in Appendix A .

 10 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
10.1 Common Permitted Medications  
For management of dysli pi[INVESTIGATOR_035], pravastatin, fluvastatin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_299439] “statins”.  
For management of hypokalemia, slow -release potassium supplements are encouraged.  
Maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range and above 4.0  mEq /L 
may reduce the risk of drug -induced QTc prolongation.  
Most medications used to treat t ype [ADDRESS_365326] commonly used treatments for osteopenia or osteoporosis —excluding certain 
hormonal treatments —are allowed .  Calcium supplements shou ld be taken at least  
[ADDRESS_365327] the Medical Monitor  for any questions.  
• Total daily dose of acetaminophen (paracetamol) above 2 g (increased liver 
toxicity risk);  
• Prescription or over the counter H2 -receptor antagonists  or proton -pump 
inhibitors  or sucralfate ( inhibition of drug  absorption , Appendix I , Table 12; 
• Statins other than  pravastatin, fluvastatin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_299440]  (
Appendix 
I, Table 13); 
• Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Appendix I , Table 14 );

 • Steroidogenesis inhibitors or dopamine agonists (interference with study drug 
assessment , Appendix I , Table 7  and Table 8 ); 
• Megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate and selected other synthetic  
progestins (see Appendix I, Table 9) [Schindler 2003 ]; 
• Any other drug treatments used to lower cortisol in CS that are subject to washout 
(Appendix I, Table 10) are prohibited throughout the study;  
• Weight loss medications , either prescription or over the counter ( Appendix I , 
Table 11 ); 
• Drugs whose systemic exposure is potentially increased significantly by [CONTACT_299495]  (Appendix I, Table 13); 
• Drugs that pose unacceptable risk due to overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_299441]  (Appendix I ). 
• Medications that are strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers as they may 
interfere with the metabolism of levoketoconazole .  As examples, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
rifabutin, isoniazid, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_299442]3A4 induction, and ritonavir may 
increase levoketoconazole  concentrations via CYP3A4 inhibition, and are 
therefore prohi bited ( Appendix I , Table 14 );  
• Medications resulting in QTc prolongation as a direct effect or as a result of interaction with levoketoconazole , examples include: cisapride, dofetilide, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], and quinidine . (Appendix I , Table 1 3 and Table 15 ).  However, in 
selected cases where no alternative medications are available, permission from the 
Medical Monitor  may be sought;  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_299443] , except for low  potency 
preparations  (interference with study drug assessment , Appendix I , Table 17);  
• The following herbal medicines: St John’s Wort ( Appendix I , Table 14 ), 
echinacea, gingko, goldenseal, yohimbe, red yeast rice ( Appendix I , Table 18), 
danshen, Silybum  marianum, Asian ginseng, Schissandra  sphenanthera , 
shankhapushpi , and Asian herb mixture (Xiao chai hu tang and Saiboku -to); 
10.3 Medications to be Used with Caution 
There are some medications that are often considered contraindicated when used with 
ketoconazole due to an increased risk of AEs ( Appendix I , Table 18).  These medications 
should generally be av oided while the subject is participating in the study.   However, 
they may be used in selected cases, particularly when they are used prior to study entry 
and when no alternative medications are available.   Such usage should follow 
consultation with and explicit permission from the Medical Monitor .  
Medications that are weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers or that are metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 enzymes (CYPs) and plasma concentration that 
increase in exposure moderately in the presence of ketoconazole, potentially resulting in 
increased drug effect, should be avoided if alternative therapy is available or should be used with caution .  In such cases, careful monitoring, with possible adjustments in doses, 
is recommended  (see Appendix I, Table 16).

• Withdrawal of informed consent  or lost to follow -up; 
• Safety reasons, as stipulated in Section  [ADDRESS_365329]’s request;  
• Protocol violations a t the discretion of the Sponsor; 
• Plan to receive or need concomitant therapy that could interfere with the safety of 
the subject including, but not limited to use of prohibited medications ( Section  
10.2  and Appendix I),  
• Use of any other medications to treat CS or CD due to the lack of data on the 
safety of levoketoconazole used in combination with other CS medications, or  
• Subjects scheduled for surgery or radiothe rapy for treatment of their CS or CD 
should be withdrawn and such subjects should be transitioned to an alternative medication if necessary.   
All study withdrawals and their causes must be documented, to include the specific 
reason(s) prompting withdrawal,  by [CONTACT_240734] , and, if need be, on the

If the subject chooses to withdraw or is otherwise withdrawn from the study, the 
Investigator should make e very attempt to have the subject return to the clinic to 
complete safety assessments as outlined for the Final Visit in Appendix A .  All data 
gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to the Sponsor.   
All safety data pertaining to a causally related AE, SAE or AESI associated with study

 12 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Population for Analysis  
Intent -to-treat (ITT)  Population : The ITT population will include all subjects who 
provide informed consent  and receive at least one dose of levoketoconazole in this OLE 
study . This population will be used for the analyses of safety and efficacy.  
12.2 Hypothesis 
There is no formal hypothesis to be tested in this OLE study.  
12.3 Sample Size Determination  
Given that this is a  single -arm OLE  study  with exploratory efficacy endpoints only , there 
is no formal hypothesis to be tested, and the sample size to be enrolled is not pre -
determined.   
12.4 General Consideration for Data Analysis  
The SAS S ystem, Version 9.2  (or higher), will be used for all analyses, unless otherwise 
specified. Continuous variables (e.g., age) will be summarized using the number of 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables (e.g., sex) will be summarized using the number of observations (n) 
and percentage in each category.   
Data summaries will be presented for all subjects combined and, where a ppropriate, by  
[CONTACT_7169] (i.e., the previously established Therapeutic Dose that subjects w ere last 
receiving prior to entry to this OLE study)  as well . 
For the purposes of analyzing changes or shifts from Baseline, whether for safety or 
efficacy evaluations, two Baselines will be used , namely, the OLE study Baseline and the 
original (i.e., pare nt) study Baseline , as applicable . 
All data used in analyses and/or collected during the study will be provided in listings.  
A more detailed description of the planned summarie s and analyses of the data collected 
in this OLE study will be provided in the S tatistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
12.4.[ADDRESS_365331] withdrawals, as described in Section 11.1 and 11.2 
will be summarized .  
In general, missing data will not be replaced or imputed  for the mai n analyses of the 
exploratory efficacy endpoints and safety endpoints . Imputation may be performed for 
some endpoints as part of supportive or sensitivity analyses. Details of such imputation s 
will be described  in the SAP.  
12.5 Safety Analyses  
Ongoing AEs/AESIs/SAEs that first occurred during a parent study  will continue to be 
reported in the parent study eCRF  until resolution.   An AE/AESI/SAE that worsens

 during the OLE will be reported using the OLE study process.   Only new treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including AEs, AESIs and SAEs that first occurred  
during the OLE study are to be reported using the OLE  study process ).  
Interim analyses of safety will be performed and reported on a limited basis to  satisfy 
requirements of study ov ersight, for example to IRB/IEC  and Competent Authorities.  
These analyses may include the worsening of any TEAEs  relative to the original parent 
study and relative to the OLE B aseline.  The effect of cumulative dose and 
levoketoconazole  treatment exposure may  be evaluated as risk factors for increased AE  
incidence and severity .  These  limited analyses (e.g. common adverse reactions 
summary) will not be accompanied by [CONTACT_299496].  Any unplanned 
interim efficacy analyses will be accompanied by [CONTACT_299497].    
12.5.[ADDRESS_365332] as the treatment stop date minus treatment start date plus one 
day. 
The occurrence and timing of dose discontinuations as well as dose increases will be 
displayed in a listing. Reasons for discontinuation and dose increases will also be 
reported in the listing.  
12.5.2  Adverse Event s 
AEs will be coded using MedDRA and graded per  the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 3 [NCI CTCAE , 2010 ].  
TEAEs will be of primary interest.  The number and proportion of subjects reporting the 
following will be calculated and reported:  any TEAE, drug-related TEAE s, serious 
TEAE s, TEAEs of special interest, severe TEAE, TEAE s leading to discontinuation of 
study drug, and TEAE s leading to withdrawal from the study will be computed.  The 
most common TEAEs (frequency above 5%) will also be reported.   
TEAE summaries will include freque ncy by [CONTACT_299498] ( e.g., by [CONTACT_765], by [CONTACT_299499] ).  Additional summaries and 
listings will be created to explore TEAE signals  over time . 
12.5.3  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
A labo ratory value (from LFTs , blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) that is within 
the central laboratory’s normal range will be considered normal.   A laboratory value that 
is outside the central  laboratory’s normal range  will be considered an abnormal  value.  
The number and percentage of subjects with abnormal laboratory values will be 
summarized for each scheduled visit.  Shift tables by [CONTACT_299500].  
Differences in continuous laboratory values between Baseline and each scheduled 
assessment will be calculated for each analyte and summarized descriptively.

HR, SBP and DBP will be measured in triplicate at each visit.  The mean of these 
measurements will be used as the final value for each visit.   Change s and shifts from 
normality  from Baseline for each measurement at each visit will be summarized.  In 
addition, values of clinical importance ( Table 3 ) will be identified in the data listings.

12.5.5  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and QTc Intervals 
Summary ECGs, based on the measurement of  ECG s as described in Section 6.2.3  will 
be used for each evaluation.  Quantitative ECG measurements (PR interval, QRS 
duration, HR, QT interval, QTcB interval, and QTcF interval) and changes from Baseline 
will be summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_134997] .  ECG results will be available 
to the Investigator shortly after being obtained and all ECGs will be reviewed by a central reading by [CONTACT_299501] “over -reading” that will serve as the definitive 
study v alue.  While on study treatment, a QTcF above 500 msec or above 60 msec above 
OLE Baseline will be an AESI  (See Section  14.1). 
Categorical changes from Baseline (increases only) and QTc values from each visit will be summarized by [CONTACT_299502] . The 
clinically important categories ( Table 4) of actual and change values will be tabulated

physical examination findings will be listed.  
12.[ADDRESS_365333] two -sided 95% confidence intervals. P-
values from statistical tests for si gnificance will be calculated for descriptive purposes 
only. For continuous endpoints, the change from each of the two Baselines to each 
regular visit in the OLE study, including the final visit, will be calculated. The 95% 
confidence interval for the mean  change and corresponding p -value will be calculated 
using paired t -test. For categorical endpoints, the shifts from each of the two Baselines to 
each regular visit in the OLE study, including the final visit, will be presented. The 95% 
confidence interval  for the difference in the paired proportions will be calculated using 
the adjusted Wald method, and the shifts will be evaluated for significance using McNemar’s test  or Bowker test of symmetry. The mean changes from Baseline to each 
regular visit will be  compared between the parent studies using unpaired t -test for 
continuous endpoints , and the proportions at each regular visit will be compared between 
the parent studies using  Fisher ’s Exact test for categorical  endpoints.  
12.6.1  UFC and LNSC Analyses  
The number  and proportion  of subjects with mean UFC  (mUFC)  and LNSC less or equal 
to the ULN will be summarized at each visit. In addition, the numbers and proportions of 
subjects with mUFC above the ULN to 1.5X the ULN and above will be summarized at 
each visit.  Shifts from Baseline will be evaluated using McNemar’s test or Bowker test of symmetry.  
Changes in UFC  and LNSC from Baseline  
The m UFC will be calculated from adequate [ADDRESS_365334] two adequate samples.  The m UFC  from the 
collections at each visit will be used in the analysis of UFC  unless only one adequate 
sample is available, in which case the single sample will substitute for the mUFC . 
The m UFC will be summarized by [CONTACT_299505] .  Paired t -tests will b e performed  for the change from Baseline to each nominal

13 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and 
SAEs during scheduled safety evaluations and whenever such information is brought t o 
their attention. This section of the protocol provides definitions and detailed procedures 
to be followed.  
During each visit, the Investigator will question the subject about AEs using an open 
question taking care not to influence the subject’s answers, e.g. "have you noticed any 
change in your health?”  
13.[ADDRESS_365338].  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, 
including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated), 
whether related to the study drug or study conduct  or not .  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms of a drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication.  
• A laboratory abnormality worsening or newly occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after the OLE Baseline V isit) that results in subject withdrawal from the study or 
medical treatment or further follow -up.

 NOTE: Abnormal values that reflect hypercortisolism (UFCs, LNSC  and serum cortisol) 
will not be recorded as AEs. AEs may include pre- or post -treatment events that occur as 
a result of protocol -mandated procedures (i.e., invasive procedures, modification of 
subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
13.[ADDRESS_365339] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
(a) results in de ath; 
(b) is life -threatening;  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if  it were more severe.  
(c) requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
NOTE : In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -
patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236],  the event is serious.  When in 
doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred,  or was necessary, the AE should be 
considered serious.  
(d) results in disability/incapacity;  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduc t 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
(e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
(f) Medical or scientific judg ement  should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299444].  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
13.2.1  Disease-Related Events  
Although symptoms of CS are quite non -specific, all AEs and their attributions will be 
collected and reviewed.  The reduction in cortisol levels, regardless of therapeutic 
intervention, is known to  cause symptoms (e.g., nausea, lethargy, muscle aches), and 
these too will be captured as AEs for evaluation.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment [ADDRESS_365340] (AESI)  
Adverse Events of Special Interest are defined in Section 14. 
AESIs should be reported to the Sponsor’s designated safety group with [ADDRESS_365341] should be asked a non -leading 
question such as: "How do you feel?"  
Ongoing AEs/AESIs/SAEs that first occurred during a parent study  will continue to be

AESIs and SAEs that first occurred  during the OLE  study (after subj ect completes parent 
study) are to be reported using the OLE study process.  All new AEs must be recorded 
irrespective of whether they are considered drug -related.  
At each visit/assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_299514].  
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing, 
should be reviewed at subsequent visits as necessary.  Resolution of AEs should be 
documented to include the date of resolution and any interventions made . Chang es in 
intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate AEs (i.e., a new event 
record started).  
13.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs  
All clinical events, including either observed or volunteered problems, complaints or symptoms are to be recorded on the A Es page(s) of the eCRF . The need to capture this 
information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with study treatment. Adverse clinical events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to 
concurrent medications are also to be recorded.  To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the 
subject’s own words.  
Each adverse clinical event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and whether the 
event may be associated with the study drug or other causes.  Start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, medical management, and presumed cause of the event  (if not 
thought to be study  drug related)  must be recorded in the A Es section of the eCRF . AEs 
believed to be possibly related to study drug must be followed until event resolution  or a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_365342] dose of levoketoconazole .

 13.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  
13.5.1  Severity Rating  
The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded per  NCI CTCAE , Version 4.0 3.  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  An event is 
defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the predefined  outcomes as described in Section 
13.2 “Definition of a SAE”.  
13.5.2  Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship to study treatment is to be assessed using  the following definitions: 
• Not related:  The AE is definitely not related to the drug.  This designation should 
be reserved for those events which occur prior to study treatment or for those  
events which cannot be even remotely related to study participation (e.g., injuries 
sustained in an automobile accident  that itself was not precipi[INVESTIGATOR_216020] a possibly  
related AE). 
• Unlikely:  There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the 
suspected event, and a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_299445] (e.g., a therapy used outside of the study or the subject’s underlying 
clinical condition).  
o For purposes of expedited regulatory reporting, unlikely causality will be 
considered as not  related causality.  
• Possibly related:   The suspected event may or may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type 
of reaction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.  The event could have been 
produced or mimicked by [CONTACT_423]'s clini cal state or by [CONTACT_299515].  
• Probably related:  The suspected event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s 
clinical state.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 55 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Definitely related : This designation should be reserved for those events which 
have no uncertainty in their relationship to treatment administration.  
 
13.6 Follow- Up of AESI s and SAEs  
After the initial AE SI/SAE report, the Investigator is required to follow the event status 
actively . Further information on SAEs should  be provided to the Sponsor’s designated 
safety group on the subject’s condition within 24  hours as described in  Section 13.7. 
New or updated information on SAEs should  also be recorded on the “SAE” eCRF  within 
[ADDRESS_365343] be reported by [CONTACT_299516]’s designated safety group within 24 hours  even if the SAE does not appear to 
be drug -related. This should be done by [CONTACT_264198] a copy of the SAE Report 
form plus other related information to Sponsor’s designated safety group.  The SAE may 
be reported by [CONTACT_756]; however, this should be  followed up within 24 hours with a 
copy of the SAE Report form.  Additionally, it may be necessary for the designated safety group to communicate with the Investigator if additional information is required.   
Regardless of seriousness or causality, AEs de signated as AESI s (instances of persistent 
QTc prolongation, potential hepatic events, and potential adrenal insufficiency) should be reported to the Sponsor’s designated safety group within 24 hours, in the same manner as SAEs (see also Section  13.7). 
During both business and non- business hours, the email address listed below should be 
used to report SAEs and AESIs.  
 Reportable Events Hotline  
Email: [EMAIL_2959]  
 
An SAE Report form must be completed and forwarded via email to the Sponsor’s  
designated safety group using the email address  listed above within [ADDRESS_365344] be reported to the Sponsor’s  designated safety 
group.  Such data should be sent to the Sponsor within 24 hours.  All SAEs will be followed until the Investigator and Sponsor a gree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for completing the safety report and for notifying the 
relevant authorities of any SAE as outlined in the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines and per local regulatory requirements.  The Investigator 
and the Sponsor’s  designated safety group will also ensure that the appropriate IRBs / 
IECs  are notified of the SAE.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment [ADDRESS_365345] (AESI): 
DEFINITIONS AND MANA GEMENT 
An AESI is defined as a serious or non -serious event of scientific and medical concern 
specific to a Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_221289].   
The AESIs for this study are defined in the  sections that follow along with instructions 
for the management of AESIs.  
14.1 Persistent QTc Prolongation :  
Persistent elevation of the QTc interval is defined as absolute QTc interval above 500 
msec (or above 60 msec above the OLE Baseline), with an ECG evaluation on repeat 
determination continuing to demonstrate QTc prolongation in the absence of plausible alternative explanations.  
Determination of persistent and confirmed QTc prolongation  
To decide whether a QTc prolongation is persistent and likely  to be related to 
levoketoconazole, QTc will be evaluated via central reading of the ECG by [CONTACT_119286]. 
The Investigator should consider alternative possibilities as causative or contributory to 
QTc prolongation prior to discontinuation of levoketoconazole, includ ing concomitant 
medications that may result in prolongation of the QTc interval either directly or through interference with the metabolism of levoketoconazole, recent food ingestion (temporary 
QTc elevation), and electrolyte abnormalities (particularly se rum calcium, magnesium 
and potassium). Interfering concomitant medications with QT prolongation potential are contraindicated in co -administration with levoketoconazole and must be stopped ( Section 
10.2). Please see Appendix N  for guidance on the assessment of apparent QTc interval 
prolongation. Regardless of seriou sness or causality, instances of persistent QTc 
prolongation should be reported to the Sponsor’s designated safety group within 24 hours from the time the persistent prolongation has been confirmed, in the same manner as 
SAEs (see Section 13.7).  
In the event QTc prolongation occurs additional safety monitoring is required, including 
medical observation of the subject until the QTc interval has returned to a value less than or equal to [ADDRESS_365346] will include the potential requirement for additional 
ECGs and laboratory assessments (see Appendix N ).  Cases of persistent, confirmed QTc 
prolongation as described above should be reported to Sponsor’s designated safety group 
as AESIs ( Section  13.7). 
14.1.[ADDRESS_365347] is receiving doses greater than 150  mg/day, persistent and presumed study 
medication -related QTc changes may be managed by [CONTACT_299517].  Note that a prolonged QTc  interval  that is less than 500 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 57 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 msec  may not always warrant temporary  medication stoppage , depending on patient -
specific clinical factors, e.g. if the QTc does not exceed normal reference values (ULN 
for men is 440 msec and for women is 460 msec) .    
Withheld study medication may be resumed at the same or lower dose after resolution of 
QTc prolongation is confirmed by [CONTACT_299518].  After restart of study medication, ECG evaluation should occur within 
1 to 2 hours of dosing, and future ECG monitoring should be continued per the visit schedule to monitor.  
Temp orarily withheld study medication for QTc prolongation may be resumed using the 
prior  regimen, after confirmed QTc correction.  However, unless an etiology other than 
study drug has been implicated, QTc prolongation reoccurrence above 500 msec will 
usually  result in permanent study medication discontinuation and study withdrawal  unless 
the dose can be lowered permanently  (see Section  14.1.2 ). 
14.1.[ADDRESS_365348] levoketoconazole dose (150  mg/day), administration 
of levoketoconazole should stop permanently  and the subject should be withdrawn.  
Persistent, confirmed levoketoconazole -related QTc interval prolongation that represents 
an increase gr eater than 60  msec from baseline but that may not be of sufficient duration 
to cause concern  of arrhythmias  (e.g. less than 440 msec in men or less than 460 msec  in 
women), depending on other clinical factors (e.g. recalcitrant hypokalemia) need not be 
managed with dosage reduction or result in withdraw al. 
Additional information for QTc Interval is available in Appendix N . 
14.2 Hepatic Abnormalities:  
Signs and/or symptoms indicative of hepatic dysfunction or injury, including asymptomatic but clinically relevant abnormalities of LFTs, should be reported as an AE, 
AESI, or SAE, as applicable.  Events meeting the below criteria should always be 
reported as either an AESI or SAE, as applicable, and should prompt temporary (or 
permanent —see below) study medication interruption : 
• ALT or AST above 8X ULN;  
• ALT or AST rises to above  5X ULN in less than 4 weeks or persists for over 
2 weeks;  
• ALT or AST above 3X ULN and TBN above 2X ULN not explained by [CONTACT_299519];  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 58 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • ALT or AST above 3X ULN with new onset of or worsening of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, fever, ra sh or eosinophilia, in the absence of other evident cause, or  
• Signs and /or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (any of the following: nausea, anorexia, fever, fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, pruritus, dark urine or acholic stool) coupled with ALT and/or AST above 3X ULN and/or AP 
above 2X ULN, and/or TBN above 2X ULN in the absence of evidence for 
obstruction or Gilbert syndrome. An ultrasound evaluation of the gallbladder and 
bile duct should be conducted to exclude cholestasis as the cause for elevated AP 
and/or TBN.  
Please see Appendix N  for guidance on the assessment of abnormal LFTs and Section 
14.2.1  for monitoring abnormal LFTs  
14.2.1  
Safety Monitoring and Dose Interruptions for Hepatic Abnormalities : 
When a clinically significant liver test abnormality is observed, the battery of liver Screening tests should be repeated as soon as possible after initial determination of the 
abnormality and thereafter at 3 - to 4-day intervals or as the clinical situation dictates.   
If ALT and/or AST levels at any time exceed 8X ULN or if AST/ALT are persistently 
higher than 5X ULN and are accompanied by a concurrent rise on TBN, or if abnormal 
liver safety test studies are accompanied by [CONTACT_299520], the study medication must be interrupted  immed iately.   
The need for levoketoconazole interruption will be influenced by [CONTACT_299521]’s clinical condition at the time of the abnormal liver safety test 
finding.  For example, small increases in ALT/AST above a subject’s Baseline 
concentration that are unaccompanied by [CONTACT_299522], whereas large increases from a subject’s Baseline, even if not to o high 
absolute concentrations, might warrant withholding medication temporarily.  Even if ALT and/or AST continue to rise slowly ( but only if  unaccompanied by a concurrent rise 
in TBN exceeding the cut -offs for study drug cessation/early withdrawal), asymp tomatic 
subjects may continue to receive study medication uninterrupted with cautious 
monitoring, depending on the clinical condition.   
If on serial measurements and in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, the ALT 
and/or AST continue to rise and do not meet the criteria for immediate treatment interruption,  subjects may continue levoketoconazole  without interruption.   
If abnormally elevated liver safety tests return to the subject’s OLE Baseline while the 
subject continues to be dosed with study medication, serial, frequent liver safety test 
measurements may be discontinued, with usual safety monitoring thereafter.   
Appropriate diag nostic evaluations and interventions should be implemented based on the 
clinical presentation of the subject and following the instructions for AESI -liver safety 
test abnormality follow -up (Appendix N ).   
Rechallenge with Study Medication  
If levoketoconazole dosing has been interrupted and liver safety tests normalize, subjects 
may be rechallenged (i.e. restarted on medication at prior or lower dose) at the discretion 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment 2  
23 September 2019 Page 59 of 97 CONFIDENTIAL  
 of the Investigator AND following discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_1689] .  
Note that rechallenge has been associated with relatively more severe liver injury among 
some patients treated with ketoconazole who interrupted medication temporarily 
[Ketoconazole 2014  HRA Assessment Report]. Therefore, it is important to recheck liver 
safety tests within [ADDRESS_365349] develops symptoms referable to acute liver injury and recheck them again 7 to 10 days later.  Subjects who 
are uneventfully rechallenged may remain in t he study with usual safety monitoring 
thereafter.  
14.2.2  Withdrawal due to Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Any event qualifying as an AESI or SAE as per Section 14.2 may prompt consideration 
of study withdrawal .  Howev er, Section 14.2.1  describes m onitoring and management 
procedures that may be followed in lieu of withdrawing from medication permanently, as  
the clinical condition warrants.  
If ALT and/or AST levels at any time exceed 8X ULN or if AST/ALT are persistently higher than 5X ULN and are accompanied by a concurrent rise on TBN, or if abnormal 
liver safety test studies are accompanied by [CONTACT_299520], the study medication must be stopped immediately.   In nearly all  such cases, study 
medication should no t be restarted  owing to the heightened risk of liver injury , and the 
subject will discontinue from the study and be followed until resolution or normalization of the laboratory abnormality that resulted in the withdrawal.  
If other clinically significant LFT elevations persist beyond [ADDRESS_365350] should continue to be followed after 
withdrawal unt il resolution or normalization of the laboratory abnormality that resulted in 
the withdrawal.  
More detailed information on evaluation of LFTs is available in Appendix N .  
14.3 Adrenal Insufficiency  
It is well recognized that subjects with a good response to treatment for CS resulting in decreased, but not low, cortisol concentrations may exhibit signs and symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency (not life -threatening) which may not be different than those of acute 
adrenal crisis, which is a life -threatening event warranting immediate medical 
intervention.  Discrimination between the two may not be readily evident by [CONTACT_299523].  Furthermore, subjects may have adr enal insufficiency without 
abnormal cortisol concentrations, but the cortisol concentrations, while within or above the normal range, are inappropriately low for the degree of physiological stress being 
experienced.   
Symptoms attributable to adrenal insufficiency may include: nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, headache, arthralgias/myalgias, 
gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness (particularly upon standing), irritability, depression, 
sweating, and fever.  Signs of adrenal insuff iciency are few and uncommonly observed, 
but postural hypotension and hypoglycemia can occur.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE 
Amendment [ADDRESS_365351] be given sufficient written instructions about the potential risks of adrenal 
insuffi ciency associated with the use of cortisol synthesis inhibitors, such as 
levoketoconazole. 
14.3.1  Safety Monitoring for Adrenal Insufficiency  
Subjects with suspected adrenal insufficiency should be assessed for signs and symptoms 
of adrenal insufficiency and cortisol levels as described above .   
Should adrenal insufficiency be deemed present or probable, study drug should be 
temporarily discontinued for mild symptoms/signs.  For moderate or severe 
symptoms/signs, study drug should be tempor arily discontinued and rescue 
glucocorticoids administered as indicated.  Study drug at the same or an appropriately 
lower dose may be restarted once the medical situation is deemed sufficiently resolved by 
[CONTACT_737].  Cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency should be reported to Sponsor’s designated safety group as AESIs ( Section  13.7). 
If the dose associated with adrenal insufficiency is the lowest dose of  150 mg/day, the 
subject might be exhibiting exquisite sensitivity to the cortisol -lowering effects of 
levoketoconazole.  In such cases, the subject should be informed of the heightened risk of 
future occurrences of adrenal insufficiency before resuming st udy medication with 
consideration given to permanent drug discontinuation.  
Subjects should be assessed for symptoms and objective measures relatable to adrenal 
insufficiency as follows: 
• Random serum cortisol as close to the onset of the event as possible and (if possible) morning serum cortisol.  Laboratory evidence of hypoadrenalism is 
defined as morning serum cortisol level less than 3 μg/dL ([LLN] or the lower 
limit of the assay being used for clinical testing).  Even if serum cortisol and/or 
24-hour UFC  are within the normal range, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency 
should be considered, based on other clinical signs and symptoms.  Please see 
Appendix J for a list of clinical signs and symptoms; 
• Full review of systems;  
• Lying and standing blood pressure measurements and pulse to evaluate postural 
changes;  
• Random glucose and electrolytes;  
All cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency, whether deemed to be drug -related or not, 
should be reported as AESIs to the Sponsor/CRO ( Section 13.7).

analytes may be required to follow -up certain abnormalities.  While the central laboratory 
will be used for most analytes, in some cases additional studies may be assayed at a local 
laboratory, for example, when a rapid result is needed; prior discussion with the Medical 
Monitor  is suggested .  For example, AESIs and SAEs indicative of liver injury will 
usually require additional laboratory tests  that will need to be sent to the central 
laboratory in addition to the local laboratory .

 APPENDIX C STUDY MANAGEMENT AND MATERIALS 
Study Documentation  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
(i.e., source documents and/or Medical Record Supplement) designed to record all 
observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant.  This includes 
accurate documentation of accountability of study medications.  The medical records must 
contain adequate information to allow for verification of subject identity throughout the study.   
Electronic CRF s (eCRFs) will be completed for each subject who is enrolled in the study .  
Subject numbers will be assigned systematically  immediately following the execution of 
written informed consent.  A subject Screening /enrollment log, noting reasons for screen 
failure where applicable, will be maintained for all subjects who are consented.  
All information recorded on the eCRF s for this study must be consistent with the 
subject’s source documentation (i.e., source documents and/or Medical Record Supplement).  The source documents may include the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or the physician’s 
chart, X -rays, or laboratory test documentation.   
The eCRF s for each subject will be periodically checked against the subject’s source 
documen ts at the study site by [CONTACT_25007].  Instances of missing or unclear data will 
be discussed with appropriate site personnel for resolution.  A quality assurance audit will 
be performed on the database.  
Archiving of Study Documentation  
The Investigator shall retain records for two years following the date that a marketing 
application is approved for the indication pertaining to this clinical study; or, if the drug 
is planned to be terminated or if a regulatory application is not planned to be progressed,  
until two years after the investigation is discontinued and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) or a competent regulatory authority is notified.  
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need to be maint ained.  
Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
During  the study, a monitor will make routine site visits to review protocol compliance, 
compare eCRF s with individual subject’s original source documents, assess drug 
accountability and ensure that the study is bein g conducted per  pertinent regulatory 
requirements.  The review of the subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a 
manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2017- OLE  
Amendment [ADDRESS_365358] of Study  
The Investigator(s) should conduct the study in accordance with this protocol, the 
Declaration of Helsinki , ICH GCP guidelines and FDA regulations.  The Investigator(s) 
and the Sponsor will sign the protocol and study contract, to confirm agreement.  The 
Investigator(s) will not implement any amendment (deviation or changes of the protocol) 
without agreement by [CONTACT_299524]/IEC approval, except where necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involve only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  
Records that may reveal the identities of subjects must be well protected, with consideration given to confidentiality and the right to privacy of subjects.  
Informed Cons ent 
Each subject or his/her parent/legal representative must be provided with a statement that 
the investigation involves research and that the IRB/IEC has approved solicitation of 
subjects to participate; a fair explanation of the procedures to be followed and their 
purposes, including identification of any procedures that  are experimental; a description 
in lay language of any possible side effects; a description of any attendant discomforts and risks reasonably to be expected; a description of any benefit s reasonably to be 
expected; a disclosure of any appropriate alternative procedures that might be advantageous for the subject; an offer to answer any inquiries concerning the procedures, 
and instruction that the person is free to withdraw consent and disc ontinue participation 
in the project or activity at any time without prejudice to the subject.  Payment to research

DIABETES  
Reference: American Diabetes Association. Classification and diagnosis of diabetes. 
Sec. 2. In Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes —2016. Diabetes Care 
2016;39(Suppl. 1):S13 –S22.  
The American Diabetes Association standards for the diagnosis of prediabetes  consider 
three different categories of prediabetes, based on measures fasting glucose, HbA1c, or [ADDRESS_365362] ( OGTT). For 
purposes of this study, however, the diagnosis of prediabetes will be limited to a single 
prediabetes category of impaired fasting glucose, as follows:  
Prediabetes is defined by a fasting glucose of ≥ 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and less than  
126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) (after no caloric intake for ≥ 8 hours and in the absence of 
antihyp erglycemic medications).   
Diabetes Is Diagnosed by [CONTACT_299539]:  
1. A fasting glucose of ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) after no caloric intake for ≥ 8 hours  
     
OR 
2. A random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) associated with classic 
diabetes  symptoms: increased urination, increased thirst and unexplained weight loss   
OR 
3. 2-hour post -glucose load plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) following oral 
ingestion of a 75 -gram anhydrous glucose solution in water.  NOTE : Oral glucose 
tolerance testing is not necessary if the subject has a fasting glucose level of 
≥ 126 mg/dL.  
OR 
4. A1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a 
method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program -certified and 
standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay.  
NOTE : In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results indicating diabetes should 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_299540].

dexamethasone is both a systemic corticosteroid and a strong CYP3A 4 inducer). Where 
drugs are categorized into more than one category, the most restrictive category should 
hold precedent . 
Although an attempt was made to provide a comprehensive list of relevant medications 
that are believed to present a potential risk of clinically significant drug interaction with 
levoketoconazole , the lists intentionally omit some medications that should not be used 
concomitantly with levoketoconazole , since concomitant use is not expected (e.g. some 
chemotherapeutic agents), and the lis ts probably omit others unintentionally. 
Furthermore, these lists will evolve as new drugs come to market and more is learned about the pharmacology of levoketoconazole  and other medications. Therefore, they 
should be regarded as a minimum set of excluded and precautioned concomitant 
medications.

Additional Information for LFT evaluation  
Although newly recognized LFT abnormalities will be less likely in the population for 
this extension study than in the parent studies, subjects will be monitored and withdrawal 
due to abnormal liver function tests will likewise be prompted per  the criteria  and 
evaluation procedures  outlined in Sections 13.7and 14.2. 
The recommendations within the FDA Guidance on Drug -Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (May 2009) have been adopted for use in this protocol to address abnormal LFTs.  LFTs, including AST, ALT, TBN, LDH  and AP, will  be 
measured at every study visit.  In addition, LFTs will be measured immediately if subjects 
develop signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (any of the following: 
nausea, anorexia, fever, fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, pruritus, dark urine or 
acholic stool).  Nausea, anorexia, and fatigue are non -specific symptoms and may be 
caused by [CONTACT_299550]; however, appropriate medical evaluation of such 
symptoms must include assessment of LFTs.   
Testing that is performed to evaluate abnormal LFTs, including laboratory assessments to 
exclude confounding causes (such as, hepatitis [A, B, C, E], autoimmunity), imaging and 
consultation with a liver specialist should be done prior to  planned withdrawal  of 
subjects due to elevated LFTs, so that the etiology of the abnormalities might be determined definitively while the subject remains available for evaluation.  The Medical 
Monitor  will provide Investigators with suggested evaluation procedures as outline d in 
Instructions for Liver Function Test Abnormalities Follow -up
 below . All such 
evaluations and any interventions to address LFT abnormalities sho uld be recorded in the 
eCRF . While LFTs may be assayed at a local laboratory for immediate medical 
intervention, simultaneous samples must  be sent to the central laboratory to ensure 
consistency of assay and interpretation.   
Evaluation of LFT Abnormalities  and Study Medication Dosing Interruption 
Prior to considering study withdrawal, subjects meeting the above criteria at any visit 
should be evaluated with serial (repeated) LFT s and potentially additional diagnostic 
evaluative testing to establish an etiology of the abnormality.   
The first repeated LFT assay should be performed as soon as possible after initial 
determination of abnormality to confirm the observation and thereafter at [ADDRESS_365372] and 
following the instructions for AESI -LFT abnormality follow -up (Instructions for Liver 
Function Test Abnormalities Follow -up).  
Instructions for Liver Function Test Abnormalities Follow -up 
If a patient experiences a potential hepatic event, the following information will be 
requested.  
1. Pertinent details of the patient’s medical history (inclusive of alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, special diets, non -alcoholic steatohepatitis, and prior 
elevations in LFTs ), with start/end dates were known.

cold/allergy medications containing acetaminophen/paracetamol) with start/stop 
dates and doses.  
3. Concomitant medications (including herbal and non- prescription medications, and 
dietary supplements), with start/stop dates and doses.

7. Results of any LFTs  performed to date (including Baseline and repeat testing).  
8. All INR, prothrombin time (PT) and prothromboplastin time ( PTT) readings 
(NOTE: coagulation tests are not routinely  performed  in this study but should be 
performed  and followed if abnormal in the event of suspected liver injury) .

Indication under 
investigation The study data is collected from ICD indicated patients. No new 
indications are being explored in this study.
Investigation Purpose The purpose of the Medtronic Tachy Prediction Download (TPD) study 
is to collect data from an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) device 
that will be used to identify markers for imminent onset of ventricular 
arrhythmias.
Product Status All hardware used in the TPD study is mark et released, however 
investigational TPD RAMware will be installed on the Evera MRI ICDs 
and the TPD investigational software application will be loaded onto 
the 2090 programmer. The Evera MRI ICD will therefore be considered 
investigational while the TPD is present on the ICD and the 2090

application is active.
Primary Objective(s) The primary objective of this study is to collect data that can be used to 
predict the imminent onset of ven tricular arrhythmias.
Study Design The TPD Study is a prospective, non -randomized, non -interventional, 
multi -site data collection clinical study to collect ICD longitudinal data 
that may be used to develop a VT/VF prediction algorithm. The study 
subjects will include patients currently impl anted, or who will be 
implanted with a market -approved Medtronic Evera MRI® ICD. The 
expected study duration is 3 years, with an enrollment period of 
approximately 2 years and a follow -up period of approximately 1 year.
Sample Size Up to 300 subjects at u p to 20 sites in the US and Hong Kong may 
participate in this study.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria

test within one week of enrollment and must practice a reliable 
form of birth control while enrolled in the study)
Subject meets exclusion criteria required by [CONTACT_1769] (e.g. age, 
breastfeeding, etc.)
Study Procedures and 
AssessmentsThe TPD study requires a baseline visit and a follow up visit. At the 
baseline visit, baseline characteristics will be recorded and the TPD 
investigational RAMware will be installed onto the Evera MRI ICD. 
At the follow up visit (ideally 365 -400 days later) the TPD RAMware 
will be removed from the ICD and the device programming will be 
evaluated and adjusted as needed. Required study data will be 
transmitted over the CareLink Network as it is collected. At any visit 
not required by [CONTACT_910959], it is recomm ended to confirm that the TPD RAMware is 
installed on the device and that the parameters are appropriately 
configured.
Safety Assessments No significant risks have been identified in this study design.
3.Introduction 
3.1. Background 
Clinical studies demonstra te that ICDs can reduce mortality in selected patient populations by [CONTACT_910960].  However, defibrillation shock therapy is applied after 
the development of VF (or fast VT) and may not prevent the morbidity of syncope during the event nor 
the pain and potential injury of the shock itself.  Significant effort has been focused on reducing the 
need for defibrillation with ICDs by [CONTACT_910961] -tachycardia pacing 
(ATP) to prevent a slow ventricular tachycardia from developi[INVESTIGATOR_910946]. Although these clinical 
studies were successful and shock rates were reduced , the need for defibrillation still exists.  One 
strategy to reduce the need for shock therapy further is to prevent monomorphic ventricular 
arrhythmias (which can develop into VF) or idiopathic VF from developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  This might be accomplished
by [CONTACT_10056] a marker in real time to predict the imminent onset of VT/VF in the seconds to minutes 
before it starts and inhibiting the arrhythmia by [CONTACT_910962].  Alternatively, if the 
arrhythmia cannot be successfully prevented from initiating, the pati ent might be warned that an 
arrhythmia is imminent to avoid injury from syncope or to provide time for medical intervention.

This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan TemplateIn a Medtronic internal research report entitled “Prediction and Prevention of Imminent Ventricular 
Arrhythmias -Review” compi[INVESTIGATOR_910947], Musley, and Kornet. (2016), the following 
recommendations were made, based on the literature search: All previous research has been population 
based.  Because there are large variations in the underlying mechanism and trigger for VT/VF from 
patient to patient, none of the studies has shown high enough accuracy of prediction to use for 
imminent patient or caregiver int erdiction.  We should, therefore, consider studying individual patients 
who have serial arrhythmias to identify markers specific to a patient.  Using that dataset , develop an 
algorithm to identify which repolarization markers of impending arrhythmias are m ost accurate 
predictors in an individual patient. It may be possible to identify marker changes that have useful 
prognostic value in individual patients, even though they fail to accurately correlate with initiation of an 
event on a population level. The r esearch study would consist of:
1.Taking serial ECG or EGM measurements for multiple VT/VF epi[INVESTIGATOR_910948] a 
certain patient group.
2.Evaluating parameters that are known to have some predictive value for VT/VF in a time period of 
several hou rs before the VT/VF epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Determine if there is a consistent change for any of the 
parameters before a VT/VF epi[INVESTIGATOR_910949].
3.Determining if the next epi[INVESTIGATOR_910950](s) or combination 
of paramete rs for a particular patient?
4.Determining if exogenous factors may contribute to arrhythmia risk and trigger and if they can be 
used to identify subgroups of patients in which prediction is more accurate
3.2. Purpose
The purpose of the Medtronic Tachy Prediction Download (TPD) study is to collect data that can be used 
to determine if an ICD device algorithm can be developed to predict the imminent onset of ventricular 
arrhythmias. 
4.Objectives and Endpoints
4.1. Objectives
4.1.1. Primary Obj ective
The primary objective of this study is to collect data that can be used to predict the imminent onset of 
ventricular arrhythmias. These data will include pre -storage device EGMs, RR intervals, PVC density, 
activity and other physiologic variables be fore these ventricular arrhythmias, and matching control data.

This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template4.1.2. Endpoint
Due to the feasibility nature of this trial, there is no sample size requirement for this objective. Up to 
300 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure sufficient data sets (at least 50 VT/VF events 
collected from unique subjects) are collected for analysis.
5.Study Design 
The TPD Study is a prospective, non -randomized, non -interventional, multi -site data collection clinical 
study to collect ICD longitudinal data that may be u sed to develop a VT/VF prediction algorithm. The 
study subjects will include patients currently implanted, or who will be implanted with a market -
approved Medtronic Evera MRI® ICD. Up to 300 subjects at up to 20 sites in the US and Hong Kong may 
participat e in this study.
5.1. Duration
It is expected that study subjects will remain in the study for 12 months, then be seen in -office for 
follow -up and study exit. Study data will be collected from enrollment until exit via CareLink ®such that 
study involvement will not affect the normal follow -up practice or schedule.
5.2. Rationale 
Sparse long -term pre -VT/VF onset EGM, RR interval, activity, and PVC density data exists because it is 
hard to collect. Ideally, Holter recordings could provide this data without altering th e function of the ICD 
under investigation. Unfortunately, the yield of spontaneous VT/VF events on Holter recording is 
minuscule due to the relatively short -term monitoring provided by [CONTACT_910963]/VF 
events in most patients. The best meth od for collecting periodic and longer pre -onset data is to modify 
an ICD’s RAMware to allow it to collect the desired EGM, RR interval, and other data prior to VT/VF and 
HF events. This can be done without affecting device therapy.  The data will later be used to determine if 
there are algorithmic indications that can predict imminent VT/VF.
6.Product Description

protection authorization, as required by [CONTACT_2371], must be given to the subject in a language he/she is able to 
read and understand. 
The process of obtaining informed consent shall:
Ensure that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_910953].
Include all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate 
throughout the clinical study.
Avoid any coercion or undue improper influence on, or inducem ent of the subject to participate.
Not waive or appear to waive the subject’s legal rights.
Ensure the IC Form and a data protection authorization as required by [CONTACT_2371], are given to the subject 
in a non -technical language the subject is able to read and unde rstand.
Provide ample time and opportunity for the subject to read and understand the Informed Consent 
Form to inquire about details of the study, and to consider participation. All questions about the 
study should be answered to the satisfaction of the su bject.
Include a personally dated signature [CONTACT_910983].
Include a personally dated signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_978], or authorized designee responsible for obtaining the 
informed consent, as required by [CONTACT_1769].
Provide the subject with a copy of the IC Form and a data protection authorization as required by 
[CONTACT_2371].
Ensure subjects are notified of any significant new findings about the study that become available 
during the course of the study which are pertinent to the safety and well -being of the subject, as 
this could impact a subject’s willingness to participate in the study.
If the informed consent is obtained the same day the subject begins participating in study -related 
procedures, it must be doc umented that consent was obtained prior to participation in any study -
related procedures. It is best practice for the process of obtaining the informed consent to be 
documented in the subject’s case history, regardless of circumstance.
In the event the sub ject cannot read and/or write, witnessed (impartial third party) informed consent 
will be allowed, provided detailed documentation of the process of obtaining the informed consent is 
recorded in the subject’s case history and the witness signs and dates th e Informed Consent Form.

Version 1.[ADDRESS_1279734] should “make his mark” (sign or otherwise physically mark the docume nt so as to 
indicate consent) on the IC Form as well. The IC Form should document the method used for 
communication with the prospective subject and the specific means by [CONTACT_910965]. 
The original of the signed IC Form must be filed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinical chart and/or with the subject’s 
study documents. 
The IC Form and a data protection authorization as required by [CONTACT_910966], 
auditing, and regulatory inspecti ons. Any Medtronic personnel who support the initial programming of 
the TPD study RAMware download must be able to review the subject’s signed and dated IC Form and 
verify its completeness prior to proceeding with the programming. In the event the designat ed 
Medtronic personnel identify the IC Form as being incomplete, the programming will not be allowed to 
occur until the consent of the subject can be adequately and appropriately obtained.
8.5. Enrollment/Baseline
When a patient and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_910954] e (if applicable) signs and dates the IC Form, the patient 
is considered a subject enrolled in the study.  The date the subject signed the IC Form and data 
protection authorization must be documented in the subject’s medical records.  Enrollment can be a 
stand -alone visit or can occur on the same day as the baseline visit.  Medtronic should be notified (via 
Enrollment eCRF) as soon as possible to aid in enrollment tracking. Once consent is obtained, report 
adverse events, device deficiencies, study deviatio ns, system modifications, and subject exits or deaths 
as they occur.  
The following information is required to be collected at the baseline visit:
Patient Informed Consent Date (Enrollment Date)
Eligibility Verification (Inclusion/Exclusion Assessment)
Patient Demographics
Medications
Relevant Medical History
Device Characteristic (including presence of atrial lead, if applicable)
Device Interrogation (Initial and Final) and Save -to-media/USB
Device Disposition Log
Adverse Event Assessment
8.5.1. Subject History
Demographic, medical history, and cardiac arrhythmia/intervention information will be collected at the 
Baseline Visit.

Version 1.[ADDRESS_1279735] -to-media/USB
An initial device interrogation is recommended. If completed, save the data via save -to-media/USB and 
submit the data to Medtronic.
8.5.4. Device Programming Prior to Installation of the TPD
The following device conditions must be satisfied before the TPD feature set can be installed ona 
device:
Device cannot have a projected longevity of less than 4 years
Must be one of the Evera MRI models found in Table 1System Component Information
Must not have an active electrical reset
8.5.5. TPD Download
The investigational TPD Software Application is used to install the TPD RAMware into an Evera MRI 
device.  The TPD Research System requires an access code to be entered before the investigational 
RAMware can be installed on the device .
The TPD Research Sys tem uses the source and range of one of the EGM channels (EGM1) and will lock 
the desired configuration for the TPD study.  The TPD Software Application will add the RVcoil -Can 
programmable option to EGM1 such that the TPD Software Application will properl y display the EGM1 
source and EGM1 signal data. If the EGM1 source is programmed to something other than RVcoil -Can 
during the programmer session, the RAMware will program the EGM1 source to RVcoil -Can upon 
session end.
The EGM source TPD Research System i s using (RVcoil -Can) is not a navailable option for EGM1 in the 
market -released software. Therefore, if the device with RAMware is interrogated by [CONTACT_910967] 2090 programmer software, “ ???” will display for the EGM1 source.
The TPD Research System will not control the EGM2 source and range.  This EGM configuration is 
reserved for the Wavelet feature, and TPD will not impact this feature.  It is recommended that, during 
the study, the EGM2 configuration remains at nominal: Can to RVcoil.  
Refer to the TPD User Manual for instructions on how to download the TPD RAMware onto the 
Medtronic ICD.

Version 1.0 Page 25of 51
Medtronic Confidential
This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan TemplateDevice Interro gation and Save -to-media
Confirm TPD Parameters
System Modification, if applicable
Document any reportable AEs
8.8. System Modifications
A system modification will be reported in the event the device and/or leads require invasive 
modification (e.g., generator o r lead explant, generator or lead replacement, lead repositioning).  In the 
event of a system modification, the follow -up schedule for the subject will remain unchanged and will 
continue to be followed until the subject is exited. For a system modification , the following activities are 
required:
Complete a system modification eCRF
Initial Device Interrogation and Save -to-media 
Download of TPD RAMware, as applicable (e.g., ICD changeout for new Evera MRI device)
Final Device Interrogation “Interrogate All” and Save -to-media 
If the device is taken out of service (e.g., explanted) and there is a possible replacement Evera MRI at a 
later date, the subject should remain in the study if possible. If a replacement Ever a MRI device is 
received, the TPD RAMware should be loaded on it, as applicable. If the device is taken out of service 
and a replacement will not be implanted or the replacement is not a study approved device, the subject 
will be exited from the study.
Allexplanted product (device, leads, etc.) should be returned to the respective manufacturer for analysis 
when permissible by [CONTACT_10976]. 
In the event that a subject has a re -attempt after a previous unsuccessful system modification, the 
subsequent attempt(s) must be reported via eCRF as separate system modifications.
8.9. Subject Consent
Prior to initiation of any study -specific procedures, informed consent must be obtained from the 
subject. Likewise, privacy or health information protection r egulation may require subjects to sign 
additional forms to authorize sites to submit subject information to the study sponsor. Additional 
information is found in Section 8.4.
8.10. Assessment of Safety
Medtronic has established procedures to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information, further 
detailed in Section 10.
Tachy Prediction Download Clinical Investigation Plan 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_1279740].  Exited subjects will not be rep laced with newly 
enrolled subjects.
Subjects are urged to remain in the study as long as possible, but may be exited from the study for any 
of the following situations:
Study closure
Subject lost to follow -up (refer to Section 8.13.1 )
Subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Subject did not provide consent or data use protection authorization
Subject chooses to withdraw (refer to section 8.13.2 for more information) 
Investigator deems withdrawal necessary (e.g., medically justified, inclusion/exclusion criteria 
not met)
Subject completed study
Medtronic may recommend subject exit at any time if the assessment of accumulated epi[INVESTIGATOR_910956].
For study exit visits the following information is required:   
Document any reportable AEs (refer to section 10Error! Reference source not found. ).
Perform a device interrogation and save on a USB fl ash drive.  Device interrogation data must be 
sent to Medtronic, with a copy being maintained at the site in the subject’s file.  A deviation is 
required if a device interrogation is missed. RAMware should be removed from the device and 
programming reviewe d and optimized for the patient . 
Document the reason for subject exit or withdrawal.
Tachy Prediction Download Clinical Investigation Plan 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_1279741] or two letters.  In addition, follow the regulati ons set forth by [CONTACT_114021]/EC. 
8.13.2. Subject Withdrawal
A subject will be exited from the study in the event that he or she is unable to participate, expresses a 
desire to withdraw, or is unwilling to continue participation in the study.  In addition, a subject may be 
exited from the study if an investigator feels it is necessary to withdraw the subject from the study due 
to a medical condition, if the inclusion/exclusion criteria are not met, or other reason.  In such cases, the 
subject will be notified and provided an explanation regarding the reason for the study exit. If the TPD 
RAMware has been installed on the subject’s ICD, the subject should have the TPD RAMware removed,
and their device programming reviewed and optimized.
The subject should be in formed that their future care or treatment will not be affected in any way as a 
result of choosing to not participate in this study.  Furthermore, alternative treatments and medical 
consequences of exiting the study should be discussed with the subject.  A ny significant new findings 
related to the study that may develop, which may relate to the subject’s willingness to continue 
participation, should be communicated to the subject.
9.Risks and Benefit s
9.1. Potential Risks
Medtronic follows rigorous Q uality Assurance and Control procedures throughout the life of the 
product, from the research and development phase through the study phase. 
Although the rate of occurrence is expected to be low, a detailed review of potential hazards associated 
with the T PD Research System identified possible scenarios that could occur. 
First and foremost, the study personnel and a Medtronic representative will be properly trained on the 
investigational TPD system and study protocol. In addition, the TPD User Manual will provide the proper 
instructions. Risks normally associated with device follow -ups will be minimized by [CONTACT_910969], interrogation, and 
monitoring of these devices. 
The TPD Researc h System will cause an increase in current drain on the device battery resulting in a 
device longevity reduction of six months or fewer during 400 days of TPD operation, with 95% of 
patients having less than 5.33 months of reduction. 
Tachy Prediction Download Clinical Investigation Plan 
Version 1.0 Page 28of 51
Medtronic Confidential
This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan TemplateBecause the TPD featu re changes the source and range of one of the EGM channels, the EGM source 
value will appear as invalid (“???”) to a clinician using the market released software. This could present a 
risk to the subject by [CONTACT_910970]. 
To transmit data in a timely manner, the TPD feature uses an existing CareAlert to trigger data 
transmission. This may cause additional burden when triaging CareLink data. This could present a risk to 
the subject by [CONTACT_910971] -office follow -up when it is not necessary. This could also present the 
risk of becoming desensitized to the CareAlert with a potential to miss a non -study cause for the alert. In 
addition, the CareAlert will be reset by [CONTACT_910972]. As such, 
the alert may not be presented as being active when interrogated by a programmer, either by [CONTACT_910973].
There may be additional risks related to study participation that are unknown at this time. 
9.2. Risk Minimization
Medtronic has minimized the risks to the subject by [CONTACT_716]:
Implementing quality control measures into development and production processes.
Providing guidelines for subject selection and evaluation, and subject inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.
Providing adequate instructions and training.
Selecting Investigators that have demonstrated previous experience with the programming, 
interrogation, and monitoring of pacemaker devices.
After enrollment in the clinical study, at each protocol re quired follow -up, the Investigator must 
evaluate the subject’s health, assess for any adverse events, and interrogate the study device to 
verify appropriate study device function.
Providing notification on the market released software indicating the subjec t’s participation in a 
study.
Providing the subject with a card indicating participation in the study and impact tothe 
displayed data
If the subject is lost to follow -up, the investigational software system has an internal timer
that automatically deactiv ates the software 400 days after the date of installation.
Additionally, subjects cannot be in concurrent studies as the device will allow the
download and operation of only one inv estigational feature at a time.
9.3. Potential Benefits
The TPD data collection RAMware download in the Evera MRI device offers no direct/immediate benefit. 
The potential benefits of having the TPD data collection RAMware download in the Evera MRI device 
include:
Tachy Prediction Download Clinical Investigation Plan 
Version 1.0 Page 29of 51
Medtronic Confidential
This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan TemplateClosely monitoring the patient which may lead to more prompt follow -up following clinical 
events.
Additionally, information collected from this study may assist in the design and improvements of 
new product(s)/therapy(ies) and/or instructions for use. 
9.4. Risk-Benefit Rationale
All identified risks as described in the previous sections have been mitigated to as low as possible. While
there may be minimal or no benefit of participation in the study, there is the potential to aid in 
collecting information that may lead to more prompt follow -up following clinical events.
10. Adverse Ev ents and Device Deficiencies
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information for clinical studies are 
crucial for the protection of subjects. Medtronic has established procedures to ensure appropriate 
reporting of safety informa tion.
10.1. Definitions/Classifications
10.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions
Adverse Event definitions are provided in Table 4Adverse Event and Device Deficiency Definitions . To 
ensure that all AEs that are potentially relevant are collected, the following will be collected throughout 
the study duration, starting at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form:
All potential TPD RAMware Related AEs
All potential TPD Software Application Related AEs
All subject deaths (regardless of relatedness)
Reporting of these events to Medtronic will occur on an AE Form, including date of AE, treatment, 
resolution, assessment of both the seriousness of the AE and the relatedness.  Each AE must be 
recorded on a separate AE eCRF. 
For AEs that require immediate reporting (see Table 6Reporting Requirements ) initial reporting may be 
done by [CONTACT_648], fax, or on the eCRF completing as much information as possible . The original completed 
AE eCRF must be submitted to Medtronic as soon as possible.  
Each AE must be reported separately. Any medication, whether cardiovascular or not, associated with 
the treatment of an adverse event must be reported on the medication log. 
Subject deaths are also required to be reported. Refer to Section 10.[ADDRESS_1279742] Complaint: Any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to 
the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a medical device that 
has been placed on the market. It is the responsibility of the investigator to report all product 
complaint(s) associated with a medical device distributed by [CONTACT_13735], regardless whether they are 
related to intended use, misuse or abuse of the product. Reporting must be done immediat ely and via 
the regular channels for market -released products. Medtronic will notify the regulatory authorities, as 
applicable for the following incidents immediately upon learning of them:
Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or per formance of a device, as well as 
any inadequacy in the labeling or instructions for use which led or might have led to the death or 
serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user, or other person.
Any technical or medical reason resulting in the withdrawal of a device from the market by [CONTACT_13989].
A serious deterioration in the state of heath includes:
Life-threatening illness or injury, or
Permanent impairment of a body structure function or a body function, or
In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or
Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function.

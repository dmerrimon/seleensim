Name [CONTACT_3261]:  olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530647]:  A Phase 2 Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Study of ALKS 3831 in Schizophrenia with 
Alcohol Use Disorder  
Investigator(s): Multicenter, multinational study  
Study Period:  
Estimated date of first subject’s consent: May [ADDRESS_689234]’s completion: CY 2017  Phase of Development:  2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530648] (ALKS 3831) 
compared with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530649] (AUD)
 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in schizophrenia with AUD  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ALKS  [ADDRESS_689235] 
recently (within the last 6 months) experienced an exacerbation of disease symptoms (as defined in the 
protocol). ALKS [ADDRESS_689236] other psychiatric disorders. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_530650], there is no approved 
treatment that has been clinicall y tested for treating schizophrenia in this group. 
Potential subjects for this trial are adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, text revision [DSM- IV-TR]) and AUD (based on 
DSM 5th edition [DSM- 5]). Subjects must also have recently experienced an exacerbation of disease 
symptoms (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) but cannot exceed a pre- defined level of symptom severity at the time of 
screening (as measured by [CONTACT_530766] [PANSS] and 
Clinical Global Impression -Severity [CGI -S]). 
All study visits will be outpatient. After informed consent and screening, subjects will begin a 4 -week 
open-label olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530651] a 2- week open -label ALKS  3831 period (see study 
schematic below). Once-daily, open- label olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530652] 2 with the dose level 
determined by [CONTACT_458] (PI). Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530653] 3 weeks of treatmen t but should be fixed beginning with Visit 5. Once daily open- label ALKS  3831 
dosing (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530654] 10 mg samidorphan using separate tablets) will begin at Visit [ADDRESS_689237] until Visit 8 (randomization). ALKS  [ADDRESS_689238] of  a once -daily dose of

Page 4 olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (with dose level determined by [CONTACT_978]) plus samidorphan 10  mg to be taken at the same time 
(ie, coadministered) using separate tablets.  
At Visit 8, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  fashion to 1 of 2 treatment groups and will begin a 
double-blind treatment period. The two treatment groups are as follows: 
• ALKS 3831: (ie, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [dose determined by [CONTACT_978]] plus samidorphan [10 mg])  
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (dose determined by [CONTACT_978]) plus placebo  
Subjects randomized to double-blind treatment will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_689239] of clinical assessments plus drug dispensing or drug dispensing only. After the end of the double-
blind treatment period, subjects will complete a 3-week safety follow -up period. 
 
Abbreviation: V = Study Visit; ALKS 3831=olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + samidorphan  
Number of Subjects Planned:  
Approximately 450 subjects will enter the open -label olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530655] 2. Of those, 
approximately 270 are expected to be randomized at Visit 8. 
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Men and women 18 through 65 years of age (inclusive) with a DSM- IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia 
and a DSM -[ADDRESS_689240] also meet sponsor criteria for a recent (within 6 months) exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms and have experienced at least 10  drinking days in the 30 days prior to 
screening (as measured by [CONTACT_9859] -Back [TLFB] method), with at least 2 of these drinking 
days meeting criteria for a heavy drinking day (4 drinks in a day for women and 5 drinks in a day for men), to be eligible for this study.  
Investigational Product Dosage, Duration, and Mode of Administration:  
ALKS 3831 refers to the combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]. In this study, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530656]. Commercially available olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530657]. All subjects will take olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530658].  
Alkermes will prov ide samidorphan as 10 mg tablets. All subjects will take open -label ALKS  3831 for 
2 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects randomized to the double-blind treatment period will take ALKS  3831 (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530659]) or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530660]-
blind period. 
Whether or not samidorphan is classified as a controlled substance varies from country to country; some 
3 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689241] not. Sites will be given 
handling and storage instructions applicable to their country to ensure compliance with local regulations 
for controlled substances. 
Reference Therapy Dosage, Duration, and Mode of Administration: 
Placebo consists of tablets identical in size and appearance to the samidorphan tablets but without active 
samidorphan. Subjects who are randomized to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530661], 
once daily at the same time for 9 to 15 months.  
Duration of Study:  
The duration of the study period for a given subject will be approximately 12 to 18 months which 
includes up to 30 days for screening, a total of 6 weeks of open-label treatment, a 9 to 15 month 
double-blind treatment period, and 3 weeks for safety follow -up. 
Primary Efficacy Measure:  
The primary efficacy measure will be an event of exacerbation of disease symptoms (EEDS) based on the 
occurrence of pre- specified events indicative of exacerbation of disease symptoms, as confirmed by [CONTACT_329098] (IAC). These events are pre- specified in the body of the protocol. 
Other Efficacy Measures:  
In addition to the primary efficacy measure, efficacy will be evaluated with the following measures:  
• Pre-specified psychosocial events indicative of exacerbation of disease symptoms  
• PANSS  
• CGI-S 
• CGI-Improvement (CGI- I) 
• TLFB assessment of alcohol drinking 
• Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for perception of desire for alcohol 
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be evaluated with the following measures:  
• Adverse events (AEs)  
• Columbia- Suicidal Severity Rating Scal e (C-SSRS) results  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis  
• Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Weight  
• Abnormal movement rating scales results [Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS)]

Page 6 Statistical Methods  
Efficacy:  
The efficacy analyses will be carried out using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population defined as all 
randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_689242] model will be used to further examine the treatment 
difference adjusting for various covariates.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Pharmacokinetic data may be used in a subsequent population pharmacokinetic evaluation conducted separately. By -subject listings of plasma concentrations of olan zapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan, and RDC-9986 
(metabolite of samidorphan) will be provided. 
Safety:  
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan, or placebo) will be 
included in the safety analysis. Safety will be evaluated based on the incidence of treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory test results, vital signs, ECG findings, C -SSRS results, change in 
weight, abnormal movement scale results, and concomitant medications. Descriptive summary statistics 
and by-subject li stings will be provided for safety measures.  
Sample Size Considerations:  
The sample size calculation is based on the detection of log-hazard ratio for the first EEDS during the double-blind treatment period. 
Based on the previous clinical studies with olan zapi[INVESTIGATOR_530662], the cumulative proportion 
of EEDS by [CONTACT_5638] a 9-month double-blind treatment period (the minimum duration for subjects in 
this study) is estimated to be 15% and 30% for the ALKS [ADDRESS_689243] at α=0.05, a 
total of 70 recurrent events will be required for approximately 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.45 
between ALKS 3831 and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530663] a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 
(ALKS  3831:olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99556]). An estimated 270 subjects (135 subjects per treatment group) will 
need to be randomized at Visit 8 to observe 70 total EEDS.

Page 14 5. INTRODUCTION 
ALKS 3831 is a combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674] (previously referred to as ALKS 33 
or RDC -0313) being developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530665] (US) and Europe since 1996 and was originally approved for the treatment of schizophrenia [ EMEA 2013;Lilly [LOCATION_003] 2013]. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530666]- recognized efficacy and other advantages such as 
decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms [Lieberman, 2005]. However, its efficacy and 
safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Furthermore, the use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530667] 
(AEs) related to weight gain and unintended metabolic effects. 
Samidorphan is a μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_530668] (ALKS 3831) for treatment of 
schizophrenia. In ALKS 3831, samidorphan has a range of potential benefits for patients with 
schizophrenia, such as reducing alcohol consumption and attenuating weight gain. Both of these benefits have the potential to improve long-term outcomes, such as reducing schizophrenia 
symptom severity and decreasing the frequency of events of exacerbation of disease symptoms 
(EEDS). ALK3831-401 is designed to assess efficacy of ALKS 3831 on time to EEDS after randomization to ALKS 3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530669] a recent exacerbation (within 
6 months prior to screening) in schizophrenia with AUD. A separate study (ALK3831-302) is ongoing to assess other potential benefits of ALKS [ADDRESS_689253] other psychiatric disorders or the general 
population. In an epi[INVESTIGATOR_530670], approximately 1 out 
of every 3 people with schizophrenia (33.7%) were found to meet or have met criteria for AUD, which is nearly triple the lifetime prevalence found in the general population (13.5%) 
[Regier,  1990]. Conversely, schizophrenia is seen more than 3 times as often in people with 
AUD as in the general population (odds ratio=3.3). 
An increased risk for AUD in people with schizophrenia may be a part of a more general reward 
disorder that is part of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and one of the core features of the 
disease. Evidence for a reward disorder includes the fact that most substance use disorders occur in schizophrenia more often than in the general population and often occur simultaneously 
[Regier, 1990] . In substance use disorders, the rewarding effects of a substance result in  
abnormally high levels of craving and drug-seeking with abnormally low consideration of the 
risks and negative effects of substance use. In AUD, this skewed risk/reward perception and 
alcohol drinking leads to physical and psychological effects that motivate use even when 
negative physical and psychosocial outcomes are frequently experienced (or are predictable) [Ahmed 2004]. Patients with schizophrenia are known to have difficulty with reward processing 
and this underlying neurobiological deficit, a pharmacologic predisposition for poor control of self-initiated activity, and the relative ease of access to alcohol, may explain why this population 
is particularly prone to AUD [ Chambers, 2001]. Although the association between schizophrenia 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689254] of nearly all psychiatric disorders, there are a substantial number of 
people with schizophrenia who may not be receiving treatment that specifically addresses their 
AUD [Drake, 1998]. 
In schizophrenia, AUD is a significant barrier to treatment and typi[INVESTIGATOR_276019] a poor disease 
course punctuated by [CONTACT_530767] “crisis settings” like jails, emergency rooms, and 
homeless shelters [Drake, 1998] . Ineffective treatments for schizophrenia with  AUD directly 
contribute to the higher frequency of crisis outcomes in these patients [ Dickey , 2000]. 
Schizophrenia with AUD is more strongly associated with violent behavior and incarceration; depression and suicide; family problems; and housing instability, all of which greatly complicate 
treatment. Poor outcomes are often the end of a long period of stable but deteriorating mental health as patients face the daily challenges associated with managing schizophrenia with AUD. 
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires long-term coordinated care and management, 
and AUD introduces specific challenges to treating schizophrenia by [CONTACT_530768] a patient’s ability to maintain stable housing and depend on caregivers. As a result, a patient’s 
functional status, stress level, and symptoms may worsen until he/she experiences a crisis 
situation and/or requires acute treatment (eg, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
For this study, the target population will be identified using standard diagnostic criteria for 
schizophrenia (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, text 
revision; DSM- IV-TR [American Psychiatric Association 2000 ]) and AUD (DSM -5 [American  
Psychiatric Association 2013]) as confirmed by [CONTACT_491171], the 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [Sheehan, 1998] , as well as other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as confirmed by [CONTACT_530769] (C -VISA
™). Subjects will have recently experienced an exacerbation of disease 
symptoms, and the primary efficacy endpoint will be time to EEDS (after randomization) using the pre-specified events defined in the protocol ( Section  11.1)  and confirmed by [CONTACT_530770] (IAC).  
5.2. Clinical and Nonclinical Experience  
ALKS  [ADDRESS_689255] containing olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530671]. In this study, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530672]. Details of the studies summarized below are available in the  ALKS 3831 Investigator’s  
Brochure . 
Samidorphan is a potent μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_530673]/antagonist activity at κ and δ receptors. To date there has not been any observed abuse potential in clinical or 
nonclinical studies. Other than binding at these human receptors, samidorphan (at 10 μM) has 
exhibited no significant receptor, transporter, or enzyme-ligand binding in [
35S]GTPγS assays of 
functional activity.  
5.2.1. Clinical Studies  
In the clinical studies of samidorphan to date, [ADDRESS_689256] received samidorphan orally (1-55.7 mg) or sublingually (1–16 mg) for up to [ADDRESS_689257] been observed in clinical 
Protocol Amendment #6 CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
01 Mar 2016 ALK3831-401 
Page 16 laboratory analytes, vital sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data. No deaths have 
occurred in these studies. 
Samidorphan has been shown to block opi[INVESTIGATOR_530674]- experienced ad ults and 
decrease alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent adults. In opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- experienced adults, 
samidorphan blocked both the subjective (eg, Drug Liking measured with a visual analog scale 
[VAS]) and physiological effects (eg, pupil constriction measured with pupi[INVESTIGATOR_115726]) of the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_530675] ( Study ALK33-004)  and buprenorphine ( Study ALK33-008). In 
adults with alcohol dependence (N=410), samidorphan (1, 2.5, or 10 mg) was associated with a 
reduction in drinking behavior ( Study ALK33-005 ) compared with placebo; the largest reduction 
was seen with the highest samidorphan dose administered in this study (10 mg). 
In addition to the reduction of alcohol drinking, samidorphan may attenuate weight gain associated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A Phase 1 proof-of-concept study has been conducted in healthy 
adults ( ALK33 -301) to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of samidorphan when 
taken with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530676] -related weight gain. In this study, significantly less 
weight gain was seen in the ALKS [ADDRESS_689258] to evaluate (as a secondary outcome) attenuation of weight gain by [CONTACT_203844] [ADDRESS_689259] common AEs seen with samidorphan are similar to 
those seen with naltrexone (an approved medication for addiction that is also a μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_238310]) and do not include AEs suggestive of addiction potential [ Duramed Pharmaceuticals,  
Inc 2013]. 
Although samidorphan is a μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727], agencies responsible for substance control may 
not consider a drug’s mechanism of action when determining whether an unapproved drug should be handled as a controlled substance. For example, the US Drug Enforcement Agency 
(DEA) has classified samido rphan as a Schedule II substance because it is derived from opi[INVESTIGATOR_530677]. In countries where samidorphan has been designated a controlled substance, 
samidorphan (and blinded study drug) will require handling consistent with local regulations for 
drugs o f this class.  
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530678] -recognized efficacy 
and other advantages such as decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms [Lieberman,  2005]. The safety and tolerability profile of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249682], and AE 
labeling is supported by [CONTACT_530771] 8,500 adult patients. 
5.2.2. Nonclinical Studies  
Nonclinical data to  date provide supporting (secondary pharmacology) evidence of samidorphan 
as a μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_530679] a benefit in reduced alcohol consumption. In vivo nonclinical 
pharmacology studies have been conducted to demonstrate that samidorphan, at doses that res ult 
in exposure similar to therapeutically relevant doses in humans, blocks μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_530680] #[ADDRESS_689260]-like properties. 
The nonclinical safety assessment program for samidorphan and ALKS 3831 is based on 
recommendations for nonclinical drug toxicity and abuse liability testing in International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirem ents for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use (ICH) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. A summary of completed GLP studies with samidorphan and ALKS 3831 can be found in the ALKS 3831 Investigator’s Brochure.  
Nonclinical abuse li ability studies examining self -administration, drug discrimination, and drug 
dependence in rats indicate that samidorphan itself has no rewarding properties and carries no abuse potential. Furthermore, general toxicology studies of samidorphan (exposure up to 
39 weeks: 2 -week and 13-week rat/dog, 25-week rat, and 39-week dog studies) and ALKS 3831 
(39-week dog study) have included non-dosing recovery periods during which clinical 
observations were made following abrupt samidorphan or ALKS 3831 discontinuation (ie, without a taper period). In these studies, there have been no clinical observations noted 
suggestive of withdrawal effects following samidorphan or ALKS 3831 administration.  
Samidorphan has not been found to be genotoxic in vitro or in vivo at expo sures (measured as 
area under the plasma concentration curve [AUC]) well above the ALK3831 -401 samidorphan 
dose level (10 mg). General toxicology studies (referenced above) have identified findings only at systemic AUC
∞ (AUC extrapolated to infinity) exposures far above the samidorphan dose 
level of this study. In developmental and reproductive toxicology studies conducted with samidorphan, dose- related effects were observed at systemic AUC
∞ exposures far above the 
proposed samidorphan dose. 
Overall, nonclinical findings to date do not suggest a human safety risk as findings occurred at 
exposures significantly above dose levels used in this study and were associated with increases in serum transaminases that can be readily monitored in the clinic. Moreover, exclusionary criteria 
and study procedures are designed to further mitigate any potential risk. 
5.3. Dose Selection  
Clinical and nonclinical safety and efficacy data support the selection of a once-daily [ADDRESS_689261] 2 weeks of treatment. Starting all subjects on samidorphan not 
only establishes similar pharmacological states in the 2 groups prior to randomization but also

If a subject withdraws from the study at any time for any reason
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_530692] a reasonable 
effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully respecting the subject’s rights. The subject should be encouraged to return to the study center for an early termination (ET) visit, 
which will match the procedures at Visit 38 (s ee Section  , any ongoing AEs will be 
followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_978] , or until the subject is deemed by [CONTACT_530779]-up. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_164976], it is necessary to

8), and to complete a subsequent safety 
follow-up period. The safety follow-up period for subjects who discontinue early should mirror the safety follow -up visits displayed in Table 3. If the subject fails or refuses to return to the 
study center, an attempt must be made to contact [CONTACT_530780]. All data collected over the telephone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. 
The investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to compl ete the study. A full 
explanation of the reason for study discontinuation will be made on the appropriate electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689275] will be documented. The reason for discontinuation will be documented. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_434105] a change in the subjects' status or receives more information about a subject’s 
disposition, this information will be documented. 
7.5. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who are discontinued or lost to follow-up after randomization will not be replaced. 
7.6. Identification of Informant or Caregiver  
In some cases a caregiver may be required for a subject to join the study (eg, by a local 
institutional review board [IRB] or independent ethics committee [IEC]). As per 
inclusion/exclusion crite ria, subjects in Bulgaria are required to have an informant or caregiver 
who meets the following criteria:  
a. Informant or caregiver will be in contact [CONTACT_530772].  
b. If necessary, the informant or caregiver will accompany the subject to visits.  
c. Informant or caregiver will help ensure maximum subject adherence to study 
procedures. 
In all other cases, an informant or caregiver (hereafter, caregiver) should be identified whenever 
possible. This person should be in contact [CONTACT_530781] (including attending study visits when needed). 
7.7. Withdrawal and Replacement of Informant or Caregiver  
Some sites may require the caregiver to sign a caregiver ICF (separate from a subject ICF). A 
caregiver who is required to sign a caregiver ICF may withdraw consent at any time, in which 
case he/she can no longer fill the caregiver role for this study. Any other caregiver may decide to 
stop cooperating with study staff or be lost to follow-up, in which case he/she can no longer fill 
the caregiver role for this study. If a caregiver can no longer fill the caregiver role, he/she should 
be replaced if possible. If the caregiver cannot be replaced, most subjects will be able to continue in the study. In Bulgaria, the caregiver must be replaced in order for the subject to continue in the 
study. If the subject must also withdraw from the study (eg, the subject is in Bulgaria, and no 
alternative caregiver is available or the caregiver provided transportation to the site and no other travel arrangements can be made for the subject), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_530692] a reasonable effort to 
ascertain the reason(s) for the caregiver’s withdrawal, while fully respecting the caregiver’s and 
subject’s rights.

This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ALKS  3831 in schizophrenia with AUD. 
Subjects experiencing disease symptom exacerbation (eg, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) within the 
past 6 months will be considered for screening. Assessment of eligibility is based on DSM -IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia and DSM-5 diagnosis of AUD (supported by [CONTACT_1560]’s medical history, subject self -report, and caregiver or informant report of medical 
history and/or drinking behavior and confirmed via the MINI and C- VISA ). Subjects must also 
meet certain clinical criteria at screening and prior to randomization. These criteria include (but 
are not limited to) having a PANSS score between 50 and 90 (inclusive) at screening and Visit 2 
and between 50 and 80 (inclusive) at Visit 6 and Visit 8; a PANSS item score of ≤4 on Positive (P) Scale and General Psychopathology (G) items P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, and G8; and a CGI- S score 
≤4 at screening, Visit 2, Visit 6, and Visit 8. Subjects who do not meet PANSS or CGI- S criteria 
at screening but were prescribed olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_338955] a recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (discharged within the 2 weeks prior to screening) may be eligible for the study if they meet symptom severity 
criteria at Visit 2, Visit 6, and Visit 8. Other eligibility criteria assessed between screening and 
randomization are ECG (Visit 2) and drug screening (Visit 6) criteria. Complete eligibility criteria are given in  Section  7.1 and Section  7.2, and randomization criteria are given in 
Section  7.3. 
All study visits will be outpatient visits. The olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530694].  
Subjects who are taking an antipsychotic other than olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530695] 2 will be tapered off of current medication (if applicable) and titrated onto olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530696] 2 (see  Figure  1) according to a schedule determined by [CONTACT_530782]. Subjects who are already taking olanzapin e will take 
their medication as currently prescribed at Visit 2 and for a period of 4 weeks (Visits 3–5) prior to initiation of ALKS  3831 (Visit 6). After Visit 2, all subjects will return to the clinic weekly for 
dose adjustment, as necessary (permitted at Visits 3 and 4 only), and safety monitoring 
(Visits  3―5). A cross-taper period of up to 3 weeks is expected when switching to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530697]. 
Unless a change in olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530698], it will remain fixed for the remainder 
of the study after Visit 5. An increase in dose between Visit 5 and randomization may be a reason for withdrawal from the study, and an increase in dose after randomization is considered 
an EEDS (see Section 11.1) . A decrease in dose is always allowed when medically indicated. If a 
dose reduction occurs after randomization, any subsequent dose must be greater than the dose at 
randomization for this increase to be considered an EEDS.

ALKS  3831 during this open-label period may be discontinued from the study prior to 
randomization. 
At Visit 8, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  fashion to 1 of 2 treatment groups and will begin 
a double-blind treatment period. The 2 treatment groups are as follows: 
• ALKS 3831: (ie, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [dose determined by [CONTACT_978]] plus samidorphan [10 mg])  
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (dose determined by [CONTACT_978]) plus placebo

Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689286] 
should be assisted by [CONTACT_530783] (whenever possible) each time he or she is asked to 
complete the TLFB and this person should not conduct the subject’s supportive counseling sessions.  The TLFB and supportive counseling sessions should not be conducted by [CONTACT_113804]. 
8.3.1. Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject and caregiver 
(in Bulgaria, and other locations where required) by [CONTACT_530784]  17.3. When a caregiver is required (eg, in Bulgaria), the 
caregiver ICF will also be completed. Prior to the administration of any study -specific 
procedures, authorized study personnel will obtain written informed consent from each potential subject.  
8.3.2. Eligibility Criteria Review  
Eligibility for participation in the study will be confirmed as specified in  Table [ADDRESS_689287]’s demographic data an d medical history will be reviewed and documented at the time 
points specified in the  Table  1, Table 2, and Table 3. 
At later visits, each subject’s medical and psychiatric history since the prior visit will be 
reviewed and any identified significant change will be recorded in the source documents and 
eCRF, as appropriate.  
8.3.4. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum or urine pregnancy test will be administered to all women at the time points specified in 
Table 1.  At the screening visit, results must be negative for the subject to be eligible for the 
study. As highlighted in Section  7.4, a positive pregnancy test result at any time will necessitate 
the subject’s immediate withdrawal from the study. Additional follow -up may be required as 
detailed in Section  8.4.1. 
8.3.5. Drug Testing  
All subjects will undergo urine drug testing via a dipstick for a panel of substances at the time 
points specified in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  Results will be analyzed by [CONTACT_27396]. Urine drug screening may be repeated based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_137929]. Urine drug screening may also be conducted at any time during the study, should the investigator feel it is warranted.  
The drug testing panel will include benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (including buprenorphine, 
norbuprenorphine, codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, 
and oxymorphone), amphetamine/methamphetamine, tetrahydrocannabinol, phencyclidine and cocaine (and its metabolite).  
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689288] is not eligible for this trial if he/she has a positive test for opi[INVESTIGATOR_530703] 6 (see Section  7.2 and 7.3) . Drug testing that is not being done to determine eligibility will 
be used to collect data on substance use across t he trial in support of study objectives. 
8.3.6. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and 
Table 3.  A full examination will occur at screening only. After screening, a brief physical exam 
will be conducted. 
8.3.7. Clinical Validation Inventory for Study Admission and Ongoing Rater Review 
Rater (ie, study staff) accuracy at screening on pre -specified study measures will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_530785] C -VISA.  
Later reviews will take place according to a pre -specified schedule (subject to change based on 
rater accuracy) after the measure has been administered using an audio recording of the 
screening interview. Rater review is necessary for mitigating inaccurate inclusion/exclusion 
assessments and inaccurate efficacy assessments.  
Rater assessments require subject interviews to be audio recorded. The audio recording will be disclosed and explained to the subject by [CONTACT_530786]. No subject will be recorded without the knowledge that a recording is 
being made.  
8.3.8. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  
The MINI is a short, clinician -administered,  structured diagnostic interview, with an 
administration time of approximately 15 minutes [Sheehan, 1998]. The MINI has been validated 
against the much longer Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Diagnoses (SCID). A sample of the MINI can be found in Appendix A . The MINI will be administered by [CONTACT_3436].  
8.3.9. Readiness to Change Quest ionnaire 
The Readiness to Change Questionnaire ( Appendix B ) [Rollnick, 1992] is a self -report measure 
that will be administered at screening.  
The Readiness to Change Questionnaire is included as an exploratory measure that may be useful 
as a potential predictor of efficacy or stratification factor for assessing efficacy in sub -groups. 
8.3.10. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530704] e PANSS [Kay, 1987] according to  the schedule in Table 1, 
Table 2, and Table 3 using the Structured Clinical Interview for the PANSS (SCI -PANSS; 
[Opler, 1999] ). A sample SCI -PANSS is given in Appendix C . 
8.3.11. Clinical Global Impression  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_353021] -S and Clinical Global Impression -Improvement 
(CGI -I) (Appendix D ) scales at the time points specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  The 
Structured Interview Guide for Global Impressions (SIGGI; see Appendix E ) will be used for 
administration of CGI -S. The CGI- S measures mental illness severity and the CGI -I measures 
[COMPANY_003]
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689289] assessment [Guy 2000] . For illness severity, clinicians 
are asked to rate su bjects relative to their past experience with patients in the same population as 
the individual being rated. 
8.3.12. Timeline Follow -Back  
Alcohol use will be recorded using the TLFB method [ Sobell and Sobell 1992] at the time points 
specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. At the screening visit, alcohol use data will be 
collected for the prior 30-day period as per TLFB instructions for administration. At all other 
visits, data will be collected for the period between the last comple ted TLFB assessment and the 
current visit, not to exceed [ADDRESS_689290]’s 
supportive counseling sessions. 
8.3.13. Cigarette Use  
Data on cigarette use will be collected by [CONTACT_530787], “How many packs of cigarettes did 
you smoke over the past 7 days?”, at the time points specified in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  
8.3.14. Visual Analog Scale for Perception of Desire for Alcohol 
A pen and paper 1- item VAS will be presented at the timepoints specified in  Table 1, Table 2, 
and Table 3. The VAS is a horizontal line with a unipolar scale, anchored on the right side with “No desire at all for alcohol” (marked with a “0”) and on the left side with “Strongest imaginable 
desire for alcohol” (marked wit h a “100” with a line connecting the two ends; see Appendix F ). 
Subjects will mark the appropriate point to indicate where their “desire for alcohol” falls on this 
line. 
8.3.15. Exacerbation of Disease Criteria Review  
The criteria for an EEDS (see Section  11.1)  should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_530705] 2 and Table 3.  
8.3.16. Personal and Social Performance Scale 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530706] 5 -point Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale 
(Appendix G ) [Morosini, 2000] according to the schedule in Table 1, Table  2, and Table 3.  
8.3.17. Abnormal Movement Rating Scales 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530707]: The Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS; see  Appendix H ) [Guy 1976], Barnes Akathisia Rating 
Scale (BARS; see Appendix I ) [Barnes 1989], and Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS; see Appendix J ) 
[Simpson and Angus 1970] at the timepoints specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  
After administration of the first dose of study drug, if a subject compl ains of extrapyramidal 
symptoms on days when the abnormal movement rating scales are not scheduled to be 
performed, an unscheduled assessment should be performed.

Page 41 8.3.18. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Adverse events will be monitored continuously from the time a subjec t signs the informed 
consent document until the completion of the final study visit (see  Table 1, Table 2, and 
Table 3) . Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined in  Section 13.1 and  
13.2,  respectively. Section 13.4 provides guidance on the monitoring and rec ording requirements 
for AEs. Section  13.5 provides guidance on the reporting requirements for SAEs. 
8.3.19. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530706] C -SSRS ( Appendix K ) according to the schedule in 
Table 1, Table 2, and Table  3. At screening, the “Baseline/Screening” version will be 
administered [Posner, 2009a ], and at all other visits, the “Since Last Visit” version will be 
administered [Posner, 2009b]. For “Since Last Visit” versions, subjects should be asked to report 
on ideation and behavior since the last scheduled C- SSRS assessment. The C -SSRS should be 
administered by a clinician trained to assess and manage suicidal ideation and behavior. 
8.3.20. Concomitant Medication Review  
At the time points specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, prospective subjects will be asked 
about the medications they have taken since the last visit and are currently taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and supplements. 
The investigator will record the following data on all medications used by [CONTACT_423]: name, 
dose, regimen, route of administration, start date, stop date, and the indication for use. 
8.3.21. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature) will be 
assessed at the time points specified in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  
An effort will be made to consistently use the same arm (preferably the subject’s dominant arm) 
to measure blood pressure and pulse throughout the study. The blood pressure cuff will be 
calibrated per study site standard operating procedure. Automated measurement is preferred, but 
if performed manually, pulse will be measured in the brachial artery for at least 30 seconds.  
Orthostatic blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_530708]  (except at screening) in the following manner: 
• Allow subject to be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes 
• Measure blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] 
• Have subject stand for 2 minutes 
• Measure blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_530709] a visit where it is scheduled.  
8.3.22. Hematology, Biochemistry, and Urinalysis 
Blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments will be collected at the time points specified 
in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  Specific hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments 
are listed in  Table 4.  Samples will be collected in accordance with the site’s usual procedures 
Protocol Amendment #6 CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
01 Mar 2016 ALK3831-401 
Page 42 and analyzed by a central laboratory. Follow-up samples may be obtained for repeat testing as 
clinically indicated.  
An absolute neutrophil count ≤1.0 × [ADDRESS_689291] should be discontinued. 
For all timepoints (except screening) where samples will be collected, fasting assessments 
(fasting for at least 10 hours prior to collecting samples) should be attempted as per standard of 
care [Lilly [LOCATION_003] 2013]. However, fasting may present challenges, including an increased 
frequency of m issed visits and re-scheduling, that could negatively impact the subject’s 
treatment. Therefore, failure to fast should not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Whether or not a subject fasts and the number of hours since the subject’s last meal will be 
entered onto the appropriate eCRF. 
TSH will only be measured at screening.

Page 44 analysis will be stored at -20°C ± 10°C. These PK data may be included in a subsequent 
population PK analysis or other post- hoc analys es conducted outside of this study. 
8.3.24. Body Height, Body Weight, and Waist Circumference 
Body weight (in kilograms) will be measured 3 times whenever weight is being assessed. The 
median weight will be entered into an electronic data capture system. The median is the middle number when the 3 measures are put in numerical order (eg, in the sequence 1, 2, 3; the median 
number is 2). Subjects should be asked to void immediately prior to the body weight 
measurement. Subjects should be weighed on the same scale for each measurement under the same conditions. Conditions should be as consistent across visits as possible. Subjects should 
remove all personal items, such as watches and jewelry, prior to body weight measurement. 
Subjects should be weighed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_530711] a consistent amount of undergarments for each measurement.  
At each time that body weight is measured, waist circumference (in cm) will also be measured. These measurements will be made where indicated in  Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.  
Height (in cm) will be collected at screening only (see Table 1).  
8.3.25. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A [ADDRESS_689292] ECGs and assess ECG results using equipment that has been 
calibrated according to the site’s s tandard operating procedures. The following ECG parameters 
will be collected: pulse, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QT interval corrected using the Bazett 
Formula (QTcB).  
ECGs will also be evaluated by a central reader.  
8.3.26. Supportive Counseling  
Supportive counseling will be provided as per investigator’s judgment as specified in Table 2, and Table 3. Counseling will focus on the following: 
1. Disease education  
2. Encouragement of treatment adherence 
3. Crisis intervention  
The person who conducts supportive counseling sessions should not assist the subject with 
TLFB.

Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530712].  
Samidorphan/placebo and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530713] (eg, blister cards 
and bottles). Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their original containers and not combine pi[INVESTIGATOR_530714] a single container. Subjects will also be instructed to return the original 
containers and any remaining study drug(s) (both olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]/placebo, as 
applicable) at ea ch visit following dispensation. Study drug should not be re-dispensed to the 
subject after the containers have been returned. Study drug accountability will be documented as 
the number of tablets dispensed, dosed, lost/missing, or remaining. If applicable , the site will 
discuss noncompliance with the subject. 
8.3.28. Emergency Treatment Card  
An emergency treatment card will be distributed to each subject and collected from each subject 
at the timepoints specified in  Table [ADDRESS_689294] and/or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530715]’s contact [CONTACT_3031], a 
suggested pain management plan, and information regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_249694]. Subjects will be 
instructed to keep the emergency treatment card with them at all times. Study personnel will 
confirm that the subjects have the card in their possession at each study visit indicated on Table 1, Table 2, and Table  3. 
8.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.4.1. Contraception and Pregnancy  
All male a nd female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study. At a minimum subjects must agree to use one of the following. Additional 
restrictions, if required, will be clarified in the locally -approved ICF or a re clarified below.  
• Double-barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
• Intrauterine device  
• Oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_229370] (eg, a vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant); oral contr aceptives must have been

9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include samidorphan and matching placebo tablets, and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530727], a ll for 
oral administration.  
For all subjects, open-label samidorphan 10 mg will be taken once daily for 2 weeks prior to 
randomization. For subjects in the double-blind treatment period, samidorphan 10 mg (or 
placebo) will be taken once daily for up to 15 months. 
For all subjects, the dose of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530728] (to be taken at the same time as 
samidorphan/placebo) at an individualized dose level. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530729], including transition 
from another antipsychotic (as applicable), is a highly individualized process. Formalizing the potential clinical scenarios may pose undue burden and/or risk to subjects. Clinical judgment is 
essential, and for this reason, the details of this process are left to the discretion of the treating 
physician, who will follow current clinical practice.  
All subjects will be administered olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_689300] has stable psychiatric symptoms with side effects that may be 
reduced if the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530730]. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_530731], only an increase above the dose level at randomization will be considered an EEDS.  
At study drug dispensation visits, all subjects will receive blister cards containing samidorphan or placebo for self- administration; subjects will also receive olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530732]. 
Subjects will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_689301] in addition to their 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530733](s) once daily in the evening or at bedtime. The subject will take the final samidorphan/placebo dose the night before the final visit of the double-blind treatment period. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530734]. Any subject who 
prematurely discontinues from the study will be asked to return to the clinic for an ET visit and 
[ADDRESS_689302] demonstrated treatment adherence 
during the open-label olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530681] 3831 treatment period will be randomized to 
double- blind treatment ( samidorphan or placebo). Study personnel may be able to identify non-
adherence during study visits (eg, based on responses during clinical assessments) and may also 
ask the subject or caregiver (if applicable) directly about adherence. Additional measures of 
adherence may be used at the sponsor’s and PI’s discretion. During the double- blind treatment

9.3. Random ization  to Treatment  
At Visit 8, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens in a 1:1 ratio: 
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (10 mg)  
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Placebo  
Randomization will be performed centrally through an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). A unique randomization number will be assigned by [CONTACT_530789]. Once a randomization number has been assigned, that number must not be used 
again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from the study. Codes will be prepared by a third -
party biostatistician who is not otherwise involved in this study. 
9.4. Blinding  
All Alkermes staff, clinical staff, subjects, and caregivers will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment until the final database lock. All  staff  will remain blinded except

Page 55 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed on the basis of:  
• Treatment -emergent  adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) 
• Laboratory findings (ie, hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis)

13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untowar d medic al occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that 
does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the ICF are considered to be pre-existing conditions 
and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the 
study are entered on the AE eCRF.  
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded as suc h on the eCRFs. 
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy must be reported to Alkermes 
and additional follow-up may be required. 
13.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening, meaning the subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurs. This definition of life-threatening does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Protocol Amendment #6 CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
01 Mar 2016 ALK3831-401 
Page 56 • Results in disability/ incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a con genital anomaly/ birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above. 
Some outcomes of pregnancy may meet the criteria as an SAE. All neonatal deaths that occur

any infant death occurring more than 1 month after birth that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should be reported. See Section  8.4.1 for details 
on reporting pregnancies. 
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by [CONTACT_093] (or designated sub 
investigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in  Table [ADDRESS_689311] be present to be indicative of 
a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions listed in the table. However, relationship and action taken will be assessed separately 
in the EDC (electronic data capture) system for olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]/placebo. It is 
possible that a PI [INVESTIGATOR_530742] a given AE is related to both study drugs (eg, possibly related

Other efficacy endpoints will include (but are not limited to) the following: 
• The rate and number of EEDS  
• The proportion of subjects with psychosocial events indicative of exacerbation of 
symptoms during the double- blind treatment period  
• The rate and number of psychosocial events indicative of exacerbation of symptoms during the double- blind treatment period  
• Change from baseline in PANSS total and sub-scale score during the double-blind 
treatment period  
• Change from baseline in CGI-S score during the double- blind treatment period  
• CGI-I score during the double- blind treatment period  
• Complete response profile of drinking during the double- blind treatment period  
• Change from baseline in VAS score for perception of desire for alcohol during the double- blind treatment period  
The statistical methods include, but are not limited to, the following: Negative binomial 
regression will be used to compare treatment difference in the number and rate of EEDS and the 
number and rate of psychosocial events indicative of exacerbation symptoms during the double-
blind treatment period. Logistic regression will be used to compare trea tment difference in the 
proportion of subjects with psychosocial events during the double-blind treatment period. An 
ANCOVA model with LOCF (last observation carried forward) approach will be used to 
compare treatment difference in change from baseline dur ing the double-blind treatment period 
in PANSS total and sub- scale score, CGI -S and VAS score for perception of desire for alcohol. 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare treatment difference in CGI -I score. Drinking

Page 64 17. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1. Ethics Review  
The clinical site’s IRB/IEC must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. Th e study protocol 
and ICF will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC prior to enrolling subjects into the study; written 
approval from the committee must be received by [CONTACT_182121]. The protocol must be re-approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC upon receipt of amendments 
and annually, as local regulatory requirements require. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530747]/IEC according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational 
new drug safety report must be immediately reported.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB/IEC will be forwarded by [CONTACT_530800] a timely fashion.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all 
applicable local regulatory requirements. Alkermes is committed to complying with GCP 
standards; GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard used for designing, 
conducting, r ecording, and reporting studies involving the participation of human subjects. 
Complying with these standards provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study 
subjects will be protected, consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The PI (or authorized designee) at each center will ensure that the subject and caregiver (in 
Bulgaria, and anywhere a caregiver is required) are given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. 
Each prospective subject and caregiver will receive the required, IRB/IEC -approved ICF(s) that 
summarizes all pertinent study information. The subject and caregiver will be given ample time 
to read the forms and ask questions about the study. All information is to be provided in a 
language understandable to the subject and must not include any language that waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective subjects must also be informed of their right to withdraw 
consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject chooses to participate, 
he/she must sign the main ICF and when required, the caregiver must sign the caregiver ICF. 
All subjects will be informed of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to Alkermes, the IRB/IEC, the CRO if applicable, and to regulatory authorities 
for review and evaluation for the duration of the study and until the project has been approved for marketing, or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed that the study 
monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and completeness of the study 
records and results. 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_689320]’s source documents. A copy of the signed ICF(s) must be given to the subject.

responsible for handling data in a manner consistent with local and international regulations on 
personal data (including health information) collection and protection. 
18.1. Data Capture  
As stated in  Section  16.1,  this study will use eCRFs for capturing data. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_182123]. All data 
entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The electronic 
data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
If available, a paper copy of all laboratory reports will remain with the source documents at the 
study site. All out of range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs.  
AEs and medical history conditions will be coded using MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be categorized using the WHO -ATC classification system.  
18.2. Inspection of Records  
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator agrees to allow 
the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, 
subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
18.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of essential clinical study documents (eg, worksheets, drug accountability 
forms, and other administrative documentation) shall be governed by [CONTACT_530801]’s CSA. If the CSA does not st ate specific document retention terms, then the site shall 
keep essential clinical study documentation for the longer of: 
• Ten years after discontinuation of the study, or 
• Two years following the date a marketing application is approved for the study drug for the indication for which it is being investigated pursuant to the study, or 
• If no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, 
until 2 years after the date the study is terminated.

   3 GENERAL	
  INSTRUCTIONS	
  
	
  
	
  
The	
  M.I.N.I.	
  was	
  designed	
  as	
  a	
  brief	
  structured	
  interview	
  for	
  the	
  major	
  Axis	
  I	
  psychiatric	
  disorders	
  in	
  DSM -­‐IV	
  and	
  ICD -­‐10.	
  	
  Validation 	
  
and	
   reliability	
   studies	
   have	
   been	
   done	
   comparing	
   the	
   M.I.N.I.	
   to	
   the	
   SCID -­‐P	
   for	
   DSM -­‐III-­‐R	
   and	
   the	
   CIDI	
   (a	
   structured	
   interview	
  
developed	
  by	
  [CONTACT_281719]).	
  	
  The	
  results	
  of	
  these	
  studies	
  show	
  that	
  the	
  M.I.N.I.	
  has	
  similar	
  reliability	
  and 	
  validity	
  
properties,	
   but	
   can	
   be	
   administered	
   in	
   a	
   much	
   shorter	
   period	
   of	
   time	
   (mean	
   18.7	
   ±	
   11.6	
   minutes,	
   median	
   15	
   minutes)	
   than	
   the	
  
above	
  referenced	
  instruments.	
  	
  It	
  can	
  be	
  used	
  by	
  [CONTACT_15098],	
  after	
  a	
  brief	
  training	
  session.

INTERVIEW: 	
  
	
   In	
  order	
  to	
  keep	
  the

  the	
  patient	
  that	
  you	
  will	
  conduct	
  a

Page 1 of 1 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)  
 
Instructions: Patient should be observed while they are seated, and then standing while engaged in neutral conversation (for a 
minimum of two minutes in each position). Symptoms observed in other situations, for example, while engaged in activity on the 
ward, may also be rated. Subsequently, the subjective phenomena should be elicited by [CONTACT_81257].   
Please circle the appropriate scores.  
 
Objective  
 
0 Normal, occasional fidgety movements of the limbs  
1 Presence  of characteristic restless movements: shuffling or trampi[INVESTIGATOR_530761]/feet, or swinging of 
one leg while sitting, and/or rocking from foot to foot or “walking on the spot” when standing, but  movements 
present for less than half the time observ ed 
2 Observed phenomena, as described in (1) above, which are present for at least half the observation period  
3 Patient  is constantly engaged in characteristic restless movements, and/or has the inability to remain seated or 
standing without walking or pacing, during the time observed  
 
Subjective 
 
Awareness of restlessness  
0 Absence of inner  restlessness  
1 Non-specific sense of inner restlessness  
2 The patient is aware of an inability to keep the legs still, or a desire to move the legs, and/or compla ins of inner 
restlessness aggravated specifically by [CONTACT_530816]  
[ADDRESS_689367] of the time and/or reports strong desire to walk or pace most 
of the time  
 
Distress related to restlessness 
0 No distress  
1 Mild 
2 Moderate  
3 Severe  
 
Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia  
0 Absent . No evidence of awareness of restlessness. Observation of characteristic movements of akathisia in the 
absence of a subjective report of inner restlessness or compulsive desire to move the legs should be classified 
as pseudoakathisia  
1 Questionable . Non-specific inner tension and fidgety movements  
2 Mild akathisia . Awareness of restlessness in the legs and/or inner restlessness worse when required to stand 
still. Fidgety mov ements present, but characteristic restless movements of akathisia not necessarily observed. 
Condition causes little or no distress  
[ADDRESS_689368] of the time. Unable to sit 
or lie down for more than a few minutes. Constant restlessness which is associat ed with intense distress and 
insomnia.

 Scoring the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)  
 
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is scored as follows:  
Objective Akathisia, Subjective Awareness of Restlessness and Subjective Distress Related to Restlessness are rated on a 
4-point scale from 0 – 3 and are summed yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9.  
 The Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia uses a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 – 4.

1. GAIT  
The patient is examined as he walks into the examining room: his gait, the swing of arms, his 
general posture; all form the basis for an overall score for this item. This is  rated as follows:  
0 Normal  
1 Mild diminution in swing while the patient is walking  
2 Obvious diminution in swing suggesting shoulder rigidity  
3 Stiff gait with little or no arm swing noticeable  
4 Rigid gait with arms slightly pronated; or stopped- shuffling gait with propulsion and retropulsion  
2. ARM DROPPI[INVESTIGATOR_530762]. In a normal subject a stout slap is heard as the arms hit the sides. In the patient with 
extreme Parkinson’s synd rome, the arms fall very slowly .

2 Moderate resistance to swing  
3 Marked resistance and dampi[INVESTIGATOR_530763]  
4 Complete absence of swing 
7. HEAD ROTATION  
The patient sits or stands and is told that you are going to move his head side to side, that it will not hurt and that he should try and relax. (Questions about pain in the cervical area or difficulty in moving his head should be obtained to avoid causing any pain.)

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any in
tent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.  There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?

Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would 
have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any int
ent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?

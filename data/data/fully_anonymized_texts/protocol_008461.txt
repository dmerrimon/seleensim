Protocol Title  A Phase 1 , Open -label, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety and 
Tolerability , Biologic Activity, Pharmacodynamics, and 
Pharmacokinetics  of Single and Repeated  Escalating Intravitreal 
Doses  of ICON -1 in Patients with Uveal  Melanoma W ho are Planned 
to Undergo Enucl eation  or Brachytherapy  
Protocol Number  IT-003 
Study Phase  Phase 1 
Study Sites  Approximately 7-10 centers located in the U nited States  
Study Objectives  Primary Objective  
 To evaluate the safety  and tolerability  of single and repeated 
escalating i ntravitreal injections of ICON -1 administered  in 
patients wi th uveal  melanoma  who are planned to undergo  
enucleation  or brachytherapy . 
Secondary Objectives  
 To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effect 
of ICON -1 in patients with uveal melanoma.  
 To describe preliminary evidence of  the biologic activity  of 
ICON -1 as determined by [CONTACT_574598], and tumor 
size 
Exploratory Objective  
 To explore the prognostic in dicato r of the genetic profile  of 
the tumor  in relation to Tissue Factor  expression and response 
to ICON -1 therapy .    
 To describe preliminary evidence of the biologic activity of 
ICON -[ADDRESS_754161] for which the selected treatment management 
plan is enucleation or brachytherapy may be screened for this study. 
Eligible p atients will be assigned to one of three cohorts  that will be 
enrolled consecutively :  
Cohort 1  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Single dose of 0.3 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1, (n=2)   
Cohort 2  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Two doses of 0.3 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1 each administered one week apart , 
(n=3)  
Cohort 3  (enucleation or brachytherapy ): Two doses of 0.6 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/ 100 µl ) ICON -1 each administered 
one week apart , (n=5)   
Each dose level will be evaluated for clinical safety before escalating 
to the next cohort. Clinical and safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_574599]-003 Safet y Review Committee (SRC)  comprised of at least one  
participating Clinical Investigator and the Iconic T herapeutics 
internal Safety Management Committee. The following ocular 
adverse events (even if non -serious)  are considered A dverse Events 
of Special Interest (AESIs) , and will be reported  by [CONTACT_574600] : 
 Ocular in flammatory event of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with 
visualization of the tumor or retina of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset treatment -emergent vision -threatening 
condition as assessed by [CONTACT_574601] (DLT) events. An ocular DLT is defined  as 
an ocular inflammatory adverse event of 3+ or more severity or a 
grade [ADDRESS_754162]. If no patient s experience  a DLT in cohort 3, then cohort 3 will 
be considered the maxi mum administered dose (MA D). If on e patient 
experiences a DLT  in any cohort , an add itional patient will be 
enrolled and evaluated at that dose level. For cohorts 1 and 2, i f two 
or more patients experi ence a DLT  in the original cohort or the 
expanded cohort, then enrollment in that cohort will be suspended 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 8 of 86 and any subsequent cohorts will  not be enrolled . For cohort 3, if two 
or more patients experience a DLT in the original cohort or the 
expanded cohort , then enrollment in the cohort will be suspended and 
the IT -003 Safety Review Committee will examine  the safety data to 
determine if  chan ges are warranted.  
If an AESI  occurs while the patient is at the study center and requires 
clinical management, the patient will remain at the study center 
according to the Investigator’s judgment. The patient will be 
managed according to the routine treatment practices of the study 
center. The patient will complete all subsequent study visits.  
All AESI s, serious adverse events , patient discontinuations and 
pregnancy reports must be reported to Iconic Therapeutics within 24 
hours of the investigator learn ing of the event.  
ICON -1 will be administered on Day 0 for all cohorts, and in addition 
on Day 7 for cohorts 2 and 3 only. Patients will return to the study 
center on Day 1 for a safety follow -up visit (all cohorts) and [ADDRESS_754163] Day 7  (cohorts 2 and 3 on ly). All patients will return to the clinic 
for safety, clinical, and imaging assessments prior to the scheduled 
surgical procedure. Patients will have their planned Standard of Care 
surgical procedure (enucleation or brachytherapy ) as early as [ADDRESS_754164]-procedure for follow -up safety assessment s (and ocular  
assessments for brachytherapy patients)  and end of study visit .  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_574602], 
clinical laboratory tests ( serum chemistry, hematology,  coagulation , 
and anti -drug antibody levels (ADA) ), vital signs measurements, 
abbreviated physical examinations, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), and dilated ophthalmoscopy.  
Pharmacodynamic and biological activity will be measured by [CONTACT_574603], spectral -domain optical coherence tomography 
(sdOCT), color f undus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography 
(FA), ophthalmic ultrasound, and optionally (according to 
investigator judgment) indocyanine green ( ICG) angiography and 
enhanced -depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI -OCT) . 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_574604] -1, 
serum cytokine levels, circulating tissue factor  (TF), 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , and circulating tumor DNA (CTDNA) .  
For enucleation patients:  immediately f ollowing the enucleation  
procedure , vitreous humor will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_574569] -1 
and proteomic analysis of  TF and cytokine levels. Following the 
clinical site ’s standard of care pathology of the tumor, prepared slides 
and/or tumor block samples will be sent to a central laboratory  for the

IT-[ADDRESS_754168] is human Immuno -conjugate 1 ( ICON -1). 
ICON -1 is a recombinant fusion protein  that targe ts and binds to the 
aberrantly expressed  Tissue F actor in retina l disease , tumors and 
supporting stroma (vasculature, infiltrating mononuclea r cells). It is a 
dimeric antibody -like protein  with a molecular weight of 157 kDa ; 
each monomer has two functional domains joined by a linker. The 
targeting domain of ICON -1 is a mutated FVIIa protein conjugated to 
an Fc effector moiety of a human IgG1 im muno globulin .   
ICON -1 is supplied in single -use glass vials containing 0.28 mL of a 
sterile solution of ICON -1 at a concentration of 3 mg/mL in 15 mM 
HEPES , 150 mM NaC l, 25 mM Arginine, pH 7.4 with 0.01% of 
Polysorbate -[ADDRESS_754169] Article 
Adm inistration  Patients will be enrolled in  one of three cohorts :

8.1 Background  
Ocular melanoma (OM) is the second most common primary malignant melanoma in adults and 
leads to significant mortality and ocular morbidity [1]. About 95% of OM tumors can be 
described as Uve al Melanoma (UM), which develop in the melanocytes (pi[INVESTIGATOR_482429]) of the 
eye and primarily affect the choroid, iris and ciliary body of the uveal tract [2,3]. Using data 
from the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End Results (SEER) program the mean age -adjusted 
incidence of UM in the US is estimated to be 5.1 per million . An estimated 2,000 new cases of 
UM are diagnosed each year (2,4). In Europe the rate of new cases ranges from over 2 per 
million in Spain and Italy to over 6 per million in northern European countries  [5,6]. 
Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574576] -of-Care (SOC) for OM is currently radiation therapy  or surgical r emoval of the eye 
(enucleation ).  There are no chemotherapy agents or targeted biologics approved by [CONTACT_574610].  Small tumors (<10 mm in diameter and <2 mm in height) are often observed 
until growth is documented. Symptomatic patients wit h medium or large tumors usually receive 
some form of radiation, either plaque radiotherapy (brachytherapy) or proton beam radiation  [2]. 
However, th ese radioactive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574577], cataracts, glaucoma and significant vision loss. For large tumors 
enucleation is usually performed. Thus, there is a need for treatment of OM that avoids the  loss 
of an eye or the acute and chronic complications of radiation, while still preserving sight.  
Neither radiation nor enucleation affects the rate at which metastatic disease occurs [7]. While 
local recurrence in the eye is rare, five - and ten -year rates of distant metastasis of [ADDRESS_754184] been reported [8] and nearly half of all ocular melanomas will eventually develop 
distant metastasis , primarily in the liver , with lung and bone marrow the other sites. Once 
metastases have occurred, median survival is between [ADDRESS_754185], approximately 
50 percen t of all patients will die of metastatic disease within 10 years following diagnosis, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_574578], successful local treatment, and close follow -up [9]. 
There is an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies for OM that are not only less or non -
invasive, but that also have a potential to slow the onset of metastas es.  
Prognostic Markers in Uveal  Melanoma  
Proper assessment of the extent of disease and propensity for metastasis is one of the major 
challenges in the current management of UM.  For example, UM is not only a localized ocular 
disease; circulating  tumor  cells (C TCs) have been observed as early as initial diagnosis [10].  In 
uveal  melanoma patients, the presence of tyrosinase RNA in the peripheral blood was found to 
be associated with the stage of disease an d predicted disease progression in patients with early as 
well as advanced melanoma [11,12,13]. In fact, the presence of tyrosinase or MelanA /MART1 
transcripts is an independent prognostic factor in patients with high -risk primary UM [14,15,16]. 
However, as with cutaneous melanoma  [17], multiple markers will likely be needed to increase 
the sensitivity of tumor cell detection, i.e. micrometastasis, in UM.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 86 The Molecular Pathogenesis of Uveal Melanoma  
Uveal melanoma harbors early activating mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 found in 80 percen t of 
primary uveal melanomas [18].  Mutations in BRCA1 -associated protein -1 (BAP1) and splicing 
factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) occur later in tumor progression and are mutually exclusive [19]. 
Ciliary  body tumor location has also been associated with monos omy 3 and gains in 
chromosome 8 , both  molecular markers of poor prognosis [20]. 
Uveal Melanomas Classificat ion 
Type 1  Low Risk of Metastasis or Type 2 High Risk of Metastasis are based on gene expression 
profile. Genes that discriminate class 1 (low -risk) from class 2 (high -risk) include highl y 
significant clusters of down -regulated genes on chromosome 3 and up -regulated genes on 
chromosome 8q [21]. Tumors have begun to be classified as having low (class 1) or high (class 
2) metastatic potential, depending on the e xpression of 15 genes [22]. 
Why Target Tissue Factor in Uveal  Melanoma  
Tissue Factor is a 46kd 263 amino acid single chain transmembrane glycoprotein. Tissue Factor 
plays a key role in health and disease . In normal homeostasis it is involved in the initiation of 
coagulation via its external domain and mediation of pro -inflammatory pathways via extra and 
intracellular signaling . In tumor biology it has been show n to trigger angiogenesis, tumor growth 
and metastasis , and promote an inflammatory  immune environment (via extra - and intracellular 
signaling) .   
Two studies support the role of TF in UM. Direct evidence comes from Walker et al who 
showed TF was expressed at elevated levels in cell lines of uveal melanoma compared with 
normal uveal melanocytes by [CONTACT_574611], RNAase protection 
and Reverse Transcription PCR [23].  In another study, Van Raamsdonk et al found that 83% of 
the 713 uveal melanomas they analyzed had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, both of 
which are genes coding for the alpha subunit of G prot eins. They concluded that GNAQ and 
GNA11 are activated in a MET -PI3K -dependent manner, and are significant contributors to the 
development of UM [18]. Activation of  the MET -P13K pathway has been shown to increase TF 
expression in cancer ( Figure 1) [24].

(Figure 1  from Han et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2014,7:54)   
Molecular Basis for Tissue Factor Signaling in Tumorigenesis and Metastasis  
1) TF regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The TF/Vll  complex initiates many of its 
activities by [CONTACT_574612] (PAR2) ( Figure 2). The TF/Vll/PAR2 
complex can lead to activation of enzymatic  pathways (PKC, MAPK, P13K) regulating cell 
proliferation as well as inhibition of apoptosis by [CONTACT_574613] 3  [25]. 
2) TF promotes tumor an giogenesis and metastasis . Blood vessels in tumor tissues are essential 
for tumor progression and neovasculatu re is a prerequisite for blood -borne metastasis. 
TF/FVIIa/PAR2 induces the production of proangiogenic factors (VEGF) and migration 
promoting fact ors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), cysteine -rich 61 (Cyr61), CXCL1 
and IL -8 [26]. TF exhibits its pro -metastatic characteristics in part by [CONTACT_574614] -coagulant 
cascade in the tumor microenvironment, including thrombin formation, fibrin generation and 
platelet activation. This fibrin -platelet “clot” formation is essential for generating a shield around 
tumor cells to facilitate the spread of tumo r cells and the escape of newly formed 
micrometastasis  from natural killer (NK) cell -mediated cytolysis [27].

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 26 of 86 Figure 2: Function of TF in Cancer Progression  
 
 
Immuno -oncology:  TF can modulate immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. 
Once thrombin is generated, it can directly cleave complement component C5 to produce C5a 
and C5b. C5a has a pro -tumor effect via recruiting myeloid derived suppressor cells to the tumor 
microenvironment, resulting in an immunosuppressive milieu [28]. 
Increased TF expression by [CONTACT_574615] a variety 
of chemokines, cytokines  and to the accumulation of Type 2 macrophage s (TAMs) within the 
tumor. Tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs) actively promote tumor growth by [CONTACT_574616] (MDSCs). Tumor 
associated macrophages (Type 2 macrophages) produce high levels of  IL-10, TGF -beta and low 
levels of IL -12. Type 1 macrophages produce low levels of IL -10 and high levels of IL -12.   
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are characterized by [CONTACT_574617] T cells and NK cells  - a key m echanism of tumor defense. MDSCs originate from 
myeloid progenitor cells and are immature cells that do not differentiate into granulocytes, 
macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs).  
Figure 2. Function of TF in cancer progression.  TF forms TF/FVIIa complex and subsequently induce PAR 
signaling us ing GPR alpha, beta, gamma (G protein coupled receptors). PKC is phosphorylated by [CONTACT_574618], which leads to p -PKC translocation. PAR can also induce MAPK and PI3K activation, both of which 
trigger pro -tumor effects, such as proliferation, angi ogenesis and metastasis. Binding to activator protein (AP) can 
also induce c -Jun up regulation and in turn promote tumor progression. Moreover, TF binding to ABP -280 leads 
to actin modulation, resulting in tumor cells metastasis. As TF binds to integrin re ceptor and enhances the ability 
of migration, in turn leading to tumor cell angiogenesis and migration (From Han et al. Journal of Hematology & 
Oncology 2014, 7:54) .

low, and lineage markers (Lin) (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD56) negative. Multiple tumor -derived 
factors secreted from the tumor and tumor stroma (tumor associated macrophages, fibroblasts 
and vascular endothelium) drive MDSC recruitment and different iation. These tumor - derived 
factors include granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF), granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor (G -SCF), macrophage colony -stimulating factor (M -CSF), IL -1𝛽, IL-6, 
VEGF, I L-13, IL -10, prostaglandin E2. Among t hese factors, GM -CSF and IL -[ADDRESS_754187] 
powerful in inducing MDSCs from bone marrow progenitors. GM -CSF is required for 
recruitment of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment. Tumor -derived CXCR2 ligands (IL -8, 
CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5) also attract MDSCs to the tumor microenviro nment  [29]. 
ICON -1  
Iconic Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a therapeutic immunoprotein known as ICON -1 to target  
and bind  TF. ICON -1 is a  recombinant fusion protein , an antibody -like protein with a mo lecular 
weight of 157 kDa, that has two functional domains, one targeting and one effector domain 
joined by a linker  (Figure 3). The targeting moiety of ICON -1 is a mutated factor VIIa protein 
and the Fc portion from a human IgG1 immunoglobulin is unchanged and maintains its effector 
function . The mutated VIIa is defective as a clotting signal but retains its specific high affinit y 
for TF. When ICON -1 binds to TF expressed on the surface of cells, the Fc moiety is activated as 
it binds to the Fc receptor on NK cells, initiating cell -mediated cytotoxicity [30]. Secondary 
mechanisms of action that may be involved include complement activation and interference with 
TF int racellular signaling.  
Figure 3: Molecular Structure of ICON -[ADDRESS_754188] tumor growth and 
development. Early pre -clinical work demonstrated the ability of ICON -1 to cause antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity of tumor target cells, and vascular endothelium. Other 
mech anisms under investigation include complement mediated cytotoxicity of targeted tissues 
and blockade of TF dependent internal signaling. The therapeutic potential of ICON -1 is derived 
via the FVIIa targeting moiety, I CON -1 binds to the TF expressed on the surface of endothelial

and their function of inducing angiogenesis and mediating inflammat ion. Secondly, the TF -

natural killer (NK) cells and initiate cell -mediated cytotoxicity towards the tumor and its 
supporting stroma (vascular endothelium and infiltrating inflammatory cells).  
8.2 Nonclinical Studies  
Several  in vitro  and in vivo  studies support the characterization of the nonclinical 
pharmacodynamic s, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxico logy of ICON -1 in 
models of TF overexpression.  
A summary of th e toxicology and immunoge nicity studies conducted with ICON -1 via 
intravenous, intravitreal and subcutaneous administration are listed in Table 1. The intravitreal

Single intravitreal ( IVT) administration of ICON -[ADDRESS_754194] immune response in anti -

These nonclinical results indicated that a single IVT dose of up to 600 μg of ICON -1 was 
tolerable and safe in mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. The mutated FVIIa present in the ICON -1 molecule has minimal 
thrombin generation activity. The ocular reactions observed with the repeated IVT dose in mini-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_574579] -drug antibody (ADA) response after sub cutaneous administration in dogs 
and monkeys, suggested a species -specific immune response most likely due to the heterologous 
nature of the human protein in the three different species.  
These results were the basis of and supported the initiation of a sin gle IVT ascending dose study 
of ICON -[ADDRESS_754195] that part of the mechanism of action of ICON -1 is due to cell -
dependent cytotoxicity. Cocco et al [ 30] examined the response of chemotherapy -resistant 
primary uterine serous papi[INVESTIGATOR_448553] (USPC) cell lines to ICON -1 treatment in 
chromium release assays. Using rituximab as a control , USPCs overexpressing TF were shown 
to be highly sensitive to ICON -1 as measured by [CONTACT_79371] -mediating killing (65.6% ± 3.7%; range 
57.5 - 77.0%, P< 0.001). In contrast, virtually no cytotoxicity against USPCs was observed in 
controls (controls = untreated, n o ICON -1; rituximab treatment).  
When the molecule was tested in animal models of carcinoma, murine ICON -1 (delivered by [CONTACT_574619]) was shown to be effective in SCID -Hu and full murine models against

8.3 Clinical Experience with ICON -1 
In clinical studies conduc ted by [CONTACT_574620], more than  one hundred  (100) patients  have 
been administered ICON -[ADDRESS_754196]-in-human Phase 1 study  (IT-001) initiated in October 
2010 and completed in July 2012, evaluated administration o f single doses of ICON -1 in 18 
patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to  age-related macular degeneration (wet 
AMD). The study population included both treatment -naïve patients and patients previously 
treated w ith chronic anti -VEGF therapy. In an ongoing Phase 2 , randomized, double -masked, 
active -controlled study (IT -002) in pa tients with CNV secondary to AMD , [ADDRESS_754197] been 
enrolled.  
The Phase 1 s tudy (IT-001) was an open -label , single intravitreal dose,  dose-escalating design. 
There were no control groups in this study. Six patients each were enrolled in one of three 
different cohorts of ICON -1; 60 μg, 150 μg, and 300 μg . The three cohorts were enrolled 
sequentially employing a traditional 3+3 design. The planned maximum adminis tered  dose in 
this study was 300  μg ICON -1. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ICON -1 would be 
identified as the maximum dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients had a confirmed 
significant safety event  (or [ADDRESS_754198] dose contemplated in the p rotocol) . At the 
investigator’s discretion, treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin ®) or ranibizumab (Lucentis ®) 
therapy was allowed two weeks after injection of ICON -[ADDRESS_754199] frequently reported adverse events were ocular (conjunctival hemorrhage [n=5], 
vitreous floaters [n=3], conjunctival edema [n=3], and signs of macular degeneration [n=3]) and 
commo nly related to the injection procedure or the retinal signs of the underlying AMD. Only 
one adverse event, a case of vitritis in the 300 μg cohort was considered by [CONTACT_303811]. No retinal or choroidal abnormalities were no ted on clinical examination or 
angiographically. There were no systemic adverse events reported. No significant systemic levels 
of ICON -1 or antibodies to ICON -1 were detected.  Single dose administration of ICON -1 in the 
Phase 1 study demonstrated prelimin ary evidence of biologic activity and pharmacodynamic 
effec t relevant to wet AMD;  clinical improvement in BCVA , associated with a reduction in CRT 
(on OCT) and a decrease of CNV area of leakage (on FA)  in some patients .  
The ongoing Phase 2 study (IT -002) is the first study to examine administration of repeated 
intravitreal doses of ICON -1. Eighty eight (88)  patients ≥[ADDRESS_754200] the safety of repeated intravitr eal injections of 0.3 mg ICON -1 
administered as monotherapy or in combination with ranibizumab (Lucentis ®) compared to 
ranibizumab monotherapy , and to test proof of conc ept by [CONTACT_574621] . Patients will receive up to six (6 ) monthly 
intravitreal administrations of study treatment  and followed for safety  and efficacy  through one 
month following administration of  the last intravitreal treatment . Safety is evaluated by [CONTACT_574622], and changes in clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs and ophthalmic evaluations. In addit ion, the pharmacokinetic and immunogenetic 
evaluation of the presence of ICON -[ADDRESS_754201], FA, fundus 
autofluorescence imaging ( FAF) and CFP.  
Eighty six (86)  patients received three or more doses  of ICON -1 alone, in combination with 
Lucenti s®, or Lucentis ® alone.  Thirteen  SAEs in nine patients  have been reported to date.  There 
are currently no ocular or non -ocular safety events that led to study unmasking. No ocular or 
non-ocular safety signals have emerged to date and the study continues to be conducted as 
planned.  
8.4 Study Rationale  
Uveal melano ma is a life -threatening and devastating  disease chara cterized  by [CONTACT_574623]. Data  from preclinical studies , and current a nd ongoing clinical 
studies in wet AMD (described above) support s investigating ICON -1 as a potential ly less

Patients scheduled for enucleation or brachytherapy as treatment of uveal melanoma provide an 
opportunity to examine the clinical safety of intravitreal administration of ICON -1 within a 
tumor environment. Examini ng the excised tissue after enucleation  will allow c onfirmation of

9.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is : 
 To evaluate the  safety and tolerability of single and repeated escalating intravitreal 
injections of ICON -1 administered  in pa tients with uveal  melanoma  who are planned to 
undergo enucleation  or brachytherapy . 
9.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
 To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effect of ICON -1 in patients wi th 
uveal melanoma.  
 To describe preliminary evidence of the biological activity of ICON -1 as determined by 
[CONTACT_574624], and tumor size . 
9.3 Exploratory Objective  
 To explore the prognostic in dicator of  the genetic profile of the tumor  in relation to Tissue 
Factor  expression and response to ICON -1 therapy . 
 To describe preliminary evidence of the biological activity of ICON -[ADDRESS_754203] for which 
the selected treatment management plan is enucleatio n or brachytherapy  may be screened for this 
study. Eligible patients will be assigned to one of three cohorts that will be enrolled 
consecutively:  
Cohort 1  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Single dose of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1, 
(n=2)   
Cohort 2  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Two doses of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1 
each administered one week apart , (n=3)  
Cohort 3  (enucleation or brachytherapy ): Two doses of 0.6 mg (300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/ 
100 µl) ICON -1 each administered one week apart , (n=5)   
Each dose level will be evaluated for clinical safety before escalating to the next cohort. Clinical 
and safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_214144] -003 Safet y Review Committee (SRC)  comprised of at 
least one  participating Clinical Investigator and the Iconic T herapeutics internal Safety 
Management Committee. The following ocular adverse events (even if non -serious)  are 
considered A dverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) , and will be reported  by [CONTACT_574625] : 
 Ocular in flammatory event of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with visualization of the tumor or retina 
of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset treatment -emergent vision -threatening condition as assessed by [CONTACT_574626] 
(DLT) events. An ocular DLT is defined  as an ocular inflammatory adverse event of 3+ or more 
severity or a grade 2  or higher unexpected  vitreous or retinal hemorrhage  interferi ng with the 
visualization of the tumor or retina .   
If an AESI  occurs while the patient is at the study center and requires clinical management, the 
patient will remain at the study center according to the Investigator’s judgment. The patient will 
be manag ed according to the routine treatment practices of the study center. The patient will 
complete all subsequent study visits.  
All AESIs , serious adverse events, patient discontinuations and pregnancy reports must be 
reported to Iconic Therapeutics within 24  hours of the investigator learning of the event.

[CONTACT_36792]-[ADDRESS_754206] time in patients with 
uveal melanoma. The starting dose of ICON -1 (300 µg/100 µl)  is the maximum dose 
administered in the Phase 1  single IVT administration  study , and the  ongoing Phase 2  repeated 
IVT administration  study in patients with CNV secondary to AMD . As this dose has been 
administered to approximately sixty ( 60) patients and  found to be well tolerated to date, a cohort 
of two patients which may be expanded to thre e patients is thought to be sufficient to make a 
determination to escalate to the subsequent higher dose level of two doses of 0.3 mg ( 300 µg/100 
µl) ICON -1 administered one week apart .  The cohort size is increased  (cohort 2; n=3, cohort 3; 
n=5), as the dose and volume is escalated  in subsequent cohorts .  Each of these cohorts may be 
expanded by [CONTACT_574630] a DLT. A toxicity rate of one third or less in a cohort is 
within the accepted clinically observed toxicity standards  to establ ish a preliminary safety profile 
of ICON -1 administered in patients with uveal melanoma  and to support additional studies.  In 
this study, the maximum administered dose will not exceed 0.6 mg ( 300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/100 
µl) ICON -1. 
Pharmacodynami c and biolo gic activity markers are utilized to explore preliminary evidence of 
activity with respect to target engagement (ICON -1 binding to TF in the tumor) as measured by 
[CONTACT_574631],  assessment of 
immune infiltrate in the tumor,  measurement of TF  and PAR2  dependent cytokines/chemokines 
in blood, TF and cytokine levels in vitreous humor, and changes in tumor size and volume as 
well as changes in BCVA by [CONTACT_63365].  Ophthalmic ultrasound is utilized to assess and measure 
changes in the size of the ocular tumor. Ophthalmic imaging including sdOCT, EDI-OCT, FA, 
ICGA, and C FP are utilized for measuring and evaluating  changes in vasculature , in the 
anatomic layers of the re tina, choroid, and ocul ar tumor  and the associated pathology of the 
lesions ( such as exudation) .  
The study duration, including a  one to two week  dosing period  prior to a scheduled enucleation 
or plaque placement procedure is considered an adequate period to assess sa fety, PK an d 
preliminary pharmacodynamic and bio logic activity without delaying or interfering with standa rd 
of care treatment for uveal melanoma .

modalities are routine assessments and are appropriate for documenting clinical findings of the 
retina, choroid, the ocular tumor and their vascularization at baseline and changes  across the 
duration of the study for comparison.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 53 of 86 14.9 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary due to AEs or other reasons. The Investigator may examin e 
a patient  as often as is medic ally necessary while the patient  is enrolled in the study. Any follow -
up that is performed to monitor patient safety should be recorded  as an Unscheduled Visit . 
14.10  Patient  Withdrawal from Treatment or Study  
14.10.1  Handling of Withdrawals  
Patients  (or their legally authorized repre sentative) may choose to withdraw from the study for 
any reason at any time without prejudice . The study assessments for the Early Terminati on Visit 
should be conducted in the event a patient  discontinues from the study prematurely.  If a patient  
withdraws from the study, he or she may not reenter the study.  
The Princi pal Investigator or the Sponsor may withdraw a patient  from the study for any of the 
following reasons:  
 Adverse event  
 Prohibited therapy ( patient  requires concomitant medication or a medical procedure 
prohibited by [CONTACT_760] ) 
 Subject noncompliance ( patient  does not adhere to the requirements specified by [CONTACT_12695] ) 
 Subject improper entry ( patient  was enrolled in the study but did not meet the  eligibility 
criteria ) 
 Subject withdrawal of consent  
 Pregnancy ( patient  becomes pregnant ) 
 Lost to follow -up 
 Death  
At the time of withdrawal, the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_574589]. When a patient  is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the reason(s) for 
withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. For any patient  who withdraws due to an AE, the 
reason for withdrawal must be recorded as an AE and not any other reason. Whenever possible, 
all patient s who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo assessments listed for the 
Early Termination  visit.  
If a patient  fails to return for a scheduled visit, it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_574590].  If a patient  cannot be contact[CONTACT_213229] [ADDRESS_754227] a known reason for discontinuation (e.g., 
withdrawal of consent or an AE), the reason for discontinuation will be recorded as “lost to 
follow -up”. The date that the certified letter was mailed will be considered the date of study 
withdrawal.  
In the event of a patient  death during the study, the date of death (a s listed on the death 
certificate) will be used as the date of study withdrawal.  
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any patient  who is withdrawn due to an AE. In such cases, 
every effort must be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up pr ocedures.  
The Medical Monitor should be notified promptly when a patient  is withdrawn.  
The Sponsor may terminate  the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons and may 
discontinue participation by [CONTACT_574637].  
14.10.[ADDRESS_754228] injection may  be replaced.  
14.10.3  Sponsor or Regulatory Agency Termination of the Study

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 of 86 15 STUDY A SSESSMENTS  
This section describes the study assessment procedures. Se e Study Flowchart and Assessments  
(Section 21.1 - Appendix A) for timing of each assessment.  
15.1 Informed Consent  
Each site will be required to obtain IRB/EC approval of the ICF. Before any study specific 
procedures are performed, the investigator o r designee will provide the subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative with a copy of the current IRB/EC approved ICF and allow 
adequate time for review and t he opportunity to ask any questions regarding the study and/or 
ICF. The Investigator should answer all questions to the best of his ability and to the satisfaction 
of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative before performing any stud y visit 
assessments.  The ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_35323]’s legally authorized 
representative, the Investigator or his designee, and witness (where applicable) before any study 
specific procedures are performed.  
The consenting proce ss must b e conducted in accordance with  ICH GCP and local regulatory 
and/or IRB/EC requirements. A copy of the signed and dated ICF should be given to the subject 
or the subject’s legally authorized representative and a copy should be maintained in the 
subject’s medical records. The consenting process should be documented in the subject’s source 
record including the names of persons participating in the discussions and a brief summary of 
what was discussed including questions and responses.  
If the protocol is amended or new safety information becomes available, and revisions are 
required to the ICF, the subject or subject’s legally authorized representative will be required to 
sign the updated IRB/EC approved ICF.  
If a subject or subject’s legally authorized  representative withdraws consent at any time the date 
and time and details of the discussion should be recorded in the subject’ s source record along 
with the names of the persons participating in the discussion.   
15.[ADDRESS_754229] study visit  
will be recorded . The patient ’s source record should incl ude start and stop dates, dose, route, 
frequency, and indication.  
15.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs should be taken when the patient  is adequately rested (after the patient  has been 
resting in a seated position for at least 5 minutes). Vital signs measurements include blood 
pressure (systolic and diastolic in millimeter of mercury (mmHg)), heart rate (beats/minute), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/minute), and temperature (◦C).  
15.7 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
Abbreviated physical examination should include at a minimum assessments of general 
appearance, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], neck/HEENT  (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), and 
dermatologic. Height and weight will be measured  at Screening only. Additional assessments 
should be c ompleted at the judgment of the Investigator.  
15.[ADDRESS_754230]-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) will be measured for each eye, pre -treatment prior to 
dilating eyes, using standard Early T reatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) -like retro -
illuminated charts. BCVA will be recorded as the total letter score in each eye.  
Visual acuity testing  will be performed by [CONTACT_574638] , and should occur before any 
examination requiring contact [CONTACT_222199]. In order to provide standardization and well -
controlled measurements of BCVA during the study, all measurements at a single site must be 
consistently done using the same lighting conditions, correction, chart type, and measurement 
procedure for an individual  patient throughout the study.  
A study specific refraction and BCVA testing protocol will be provided in a separate BCVA 
testing and imaging procedures manual.

15.22  Evaluation of Adverse E vents  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously during the study from the time that the 
subject has provided written informed consent through the subject’s last day of study 
participation. A Es may be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_574644], or  observed through physical examination or other means. It is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to assess and document all A Es that occur during the course 
of the study, regardless of the causal relationship with the study drug.  
The following information will be collected for all A Es and recorded on the subject’s source 
document and AE eCRF:  
 Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, reco rd the signs/symptoms)  
 Onset and resolution dates  
 Severity (intensity)  
 Frequency (intermittency)  
 Relationship to study drug (causality) as determined by [CONTACT_737]  
 Seriousness  
 Action taken with study drug  
 Corrective action taken  
 Outcome  
15.22.1  Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 62 of 86 An AE can the refore be:  
 Any unfavorable and unintended medical diagnosis, sign or symptom  
 Any new undesirable medical occurrence or unfavorable or unintended change in a pre -
existing condition that occurs during or after study treatment  
 Laboratory abnormality, vital s ign or ophthalmic assessment that is assessed as clinically 
significant and different from baseline (e.g., requiring discontinuation of study treatment, 
specific treatment, or a change in subject management). If possible, changes in laboratory 
results or c hanges in vital signs that meet the definition of an AE should be reported as a 
medical diagnosis rather than as the abnormal value (e.g., “hypertension” rather than 
“blood pressure increased”).  
The following are special considerations when determining an d reporting A Es: 
 Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a 
single diagnosis under a single AE term (e.g., “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”).  
 Pre-existing conditions are not considered A Es unless the condition worsens (increase in 
frequency, severity or specificity) during or following study drug administration. 
Fluctuations in a pre -existing condition should be assessed by [CONTACT_737], and those 
that fall within the limits of expected fluctuations for the disease state, and are not 
assessed as worsening of the disease, should not be considered A Es. Any change assessed 
as clinically significant worsening of the disease from baseline must be documen ted as an 
AE. 
 Elective surgery (including the planned enucleation surgery or brachytherapy , and 
associated inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , as applicable ) or routine diagnostic procedures are 
not considered A Es. However, an untoward medical event occurring durin g the pre -
scheduled elective surgery or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as an AE.  
 Death itself is not considered an AE; it is instead the outcome of an AE.  
 Pregnancy is not considered an AE, but it is an important medical event that must be 
followe d up as described in Section 15.22.8 . 
 For cohort 3, i f the IOP in the study eye following the first intravitreal injection does not 
stabilize sufficiently to the pre-injection level (i.e., within 5  mmHg of the pre -injection 
IOP) to perf orm the second intravitreal  injection , the change in IOP should be reported as 
an AE.  
 For cohort 3, e levated IOP in the study eye following the first intravitreal injection s hould 
be considered an AE if : (1) two or more follow -up IOP measurements are required to 
demonstrate stabilization to the pre -injection level (i.e., within 5 mmHg of the pre -
injection value), thereby [CONTACT_574645];  or (2) 
interventional therapy is required to return IOP to within 5 mm Hg of the pre -injection 
value.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63 of 86 A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE with an onset from any time after the patient  has 
received study drug  through [ADDRESS_754246] dose of study drug , whether or not it is 
considered causally related to the study drug.   
15.22.2  Serious Adverse Event  
All A Es will be assessed as either serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any 
event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening (i.e., if in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, the event’s occurrence 
placed the subject at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a pre -existing condition or for surgery planned 
before study entry is not considered an SAE.)  
 A persistent or significant disability /incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to perform normal life functions). This definition is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor or temporary medical significance.  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect (an A E that occurs in the child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy).  
Important medical event or serious medical condition that does not meet any of the above criteria 
may be considered an SAE if, based upon appro priate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
15.22.3  AE Severity  
The severity of an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_574646] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.03 (June 14, 2010)  Eye Disorders section . 
Table 3:  CTCAE Grading  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or dia gnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 64 of 86 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, usin g the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden  
15.22.4  Study Drug Causality  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to the study drug as either “Related” or 
“Not Related”. The following should be taken into consideration when assessing SAE ca usality:  
 Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn and 
the AE resolved or the event recurred after re -introduction.  
 If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant  illness.  
 Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy.  
 No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology 
exists.  
 If the AE is directly related to study procedures or lack of efficacy.  
15.22.[ADDRESS_754247] (AESIs)  
AESIs  are events of medical and scientific concern specific to the investigational product, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communications by [CONTACT_574647] y Review Committee is appropriate. Ocular adve rse events that qualify as an AESI (even if 
non-serious) include the following:  
 Ocular inflammatory event of CTCAE  Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with visualization of the tumor or retina 
of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset trea tment -emergent vision -threatening condition as assessed by [CONTACT_574648].  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-[ADDRESS_754248] at each 
scheduled or unscheduled study visit. At each visit, study personnel should ask the following 
question: “Have you had any problems since your last visit?” A Es may also be detected when 
they are volunteered by [CONTACT_574649], 
or other assessments. All A Es (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_574650] a qualified physician participating in the study and must be recorded on the subject’s source 
documents and AE eCRF.  
An AE that is classified as “serious” requires expeditious handling and reporting to the Sponsor 
or designee within [ADDRESS_754249] be reported immediately to the 
Sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_246955] /AES I information directly into the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system (AE eCRF)  within [ADDRESS_754250] also be 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness of the 
event.  
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully d ocument an SAE before 
reporting the event to the Sponsor  or designee . If only limited information is initially available, 
follow -up information regarding the SAE is  required. Additional relevant information such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory test results , discharge summaries  and/or autopsy reports should be 
provided as soon as these are available.  These  SAE follow -up documents should  be uploaded 
into the EDC system for informational purposes; however, if a document  cannot be uploaded , it 
should be submitt ed to  Iconic Therapeutics Drug Safety : 
Safety  Notification  
Email:  [EMAIL_10969]   
Fax:  650 -246-9011  
(or email or fax number provided on Safety Notification Cover Sheet ) 
 
15.22.7  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
An AE, whether serious or non -serious, is considered “unexpected” if the event is not reported in 
the clinical safety section of the reference document (e.g., Investigator Brochure or Package 
Insert) or if the event is of greater severity or frequency than is reported in the reference 
document.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 66 of 86 Expedited SAE reports are those SAEs that are both unexpected based on the reference 
document and considered related to the study drug (i.e., the relationship c annot be ruled out). 
The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting.  
Reports of those SAEs that qualify for expedited reporting submitted to regulatory agencies in 
accordance with applicable local regulation (e.g., 21 Code of Federa l Regulations [CFR] 312.32 
and, as applicable, European Union Directive 2001/83/EC and 2001/20/EC).  
Expedited reports will be also distributed to Investigators. Upon receiving such notices, the 
Investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately 
submit a copy of this information to the governing IRB/IEC in accordance with institutional 
guidelines and local regulations.  
15.22.[ADDRESS_754251]’s last administration of study drug, and that becomes known to 
the Investigator, must be reported to the Sponsor even if the subject is withdrawn from study.  
If a subject or Investigator suspects that a subjec t may be pregnant prior to study drug 
administration, the study drug administration must be withheld until the results of blood serum 
pregnancy tests are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the study 
drug and must not be enro lled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is 
receiving study treatment, the study drug must be withheld immediately until the result of a 
pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently 
discont inued and the subject withdrawn from the study. The Investigator must follow the 
pregnancy to conclusion, and collect data on both maternal and fetal outcome including follow -
up information regarding the course of the pregnancy and perinatal and neonatal o utcomes.  
A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the Sponsor, at a minimum, initially and at the 
end of the pregnancy. The Investigator is also encouraged to submit to the Sponsor trimester 
follow up reports during the pregnancy. The outcome of the p regnancy and any complications 
occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery must be reported to the Sponsor.  
A miscarriage or spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and will be reported to the 
Sponsor according to the procedure described in Section 15.22.[ADDRESS_754252] and the event is determined by [CONTACT_574651], the SAE should be reported to the Sponsor and followed in accordance with the procedures 
described in this protocol.

corresponding summary statistics at each sampling time will be calculated for the ICON -1. 
Plasma ICON -1 versus time profiles (with concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be 
plotted for each patient; corresponding summary time plots will likewise be co nstructed for 
cohort .  
When applicable, p harmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental 
techniques from plasma ICON -1 concentrations and will include the following parameters: t 1/2, 
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-∞. Individual ICON-[ADDRESS_754257]’s source documents (which may include medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic 
charts/notes, diagnostics tests such as x -rays, laboratory tests and ECGs, and electronic 
recordings), and transcri bed onto electronic case report forms (eCRFs) provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Investigator agrees to maintain accurate source documentation as part of the case history for 
each subject. Recorded data should be updated/corrected in a manner that does not oblit erate, 
destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g., by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect 
entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected an 
entry should make clear who made the correction and when, by [CONTACT_574654]/her initials and the 
date of the correction.  
Designated site staff must complete the applicable eCRFs as soon as possible after each subject 
visit, and the eCRFs must be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. 
Elect ronic case report form completion guidelines that describe how to appropriately enter data 
into eCRFs from the source documents will be provided to the study sites. If an item is not 
available or is not applicable, this should be indicated. Blank data fiel ds should not be present 
unless otherwise directed.  
Prior to locking the clinical database, the Investigator must review and approve all completed 
eCRFs to verify their accuracy.  
18.2 Monitoring of the Study  
Qualified individuals (CRAs  or Study Monitors ) design ated by [CONTACT_574655], and monitor all aspects of the study according to ICH/ GCP and standard operating 
procedures for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Principal Investigator 
(PI) agrees to allow the CRAs d irect access to study drug accountability records and drug 
supplie s, dispensing and storage areas,  clinical files of the study patients  (including original 
medical records)  and the regulatory files . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_574594]. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_574595].  
The CRA will maintain necessary email, telephone, fax, and/or mail contact [CONTACT_574656] , and will visit the study sites at periodic intervals. The 
CRA will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the con duct of the study with the 
Investigators and study site staff. During those visits, the CRA will compare the subject data 
entered in the eCRFs against original source documents at the clinical site, and evaluate the 
eCRFs for completeness and accuracy. Dat a that are modified on the eCRFs to resolve any 
discrepancies must be supported by [CONTACT_574657]. The review of subject medical records 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-[ADDRESS_754258] Research Organization (CRO) 
designated by [CONTACT_1034]. All data management procedures will be detailed in separate, 
specifically identified documents that collectively will be referenced as th e Data Management 
Plan (DMP).  
The designated site personnel will transcribe the information required by [CONTACT_574658] a fully v alidated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system 
conforming to FDA requirements for the capture of electronic data. The data will be checked for 
missing data or suspect errors upon entry against validation programs, and appropriate flags will 
be displayed on the eCRFs. The Investigator or designee will make the necessary corrections or 
verify the correctness of the data based on these flags. The database will be backed up regularly 
throughout the study by [CONTACT_574659].  
Study Monitors representing the Sponsor will review the eCRFs against the source 
documentation at the site for completeness and accuracy, and will discuss the need for further 
corrections with the Investigator or designee. In addition, computerized edit checks a nd manual 
review processes will also be performed by [CONTACT_574660].  
In order to classify adverse events and concomitant medications, preferred terms will be assigned 
to the or iginal terms entered on the eCRFs using MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, 
respectively.  
After all data are entered and all data queries resolved, the Investigator must certify that the 
subject data are complete and accurate by [CONTACT_574661]. Once all eCRFs for the study are signed and the analysis populations are 
determined and documented, the clinical database will be locked.  
After the clinical database is locked, disks containing electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a ll applicable subjects’ 
eCRFs will be provided to each Investigator to be maintained on file by [CONTACT_737].  
18.4 Inspection of Records  
Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study -related monitoring, audits, 
IRB/IEC review, and r egulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_33035]. The 
Investigator or study site may be audited by [CONTACT_143294]/or regulatory 
agencies at any time. In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, 
representatives of the Sponsor, the FDA, or other regulatory agency access to all study records.  
The Sponsor will review case report form data and perform electronic edit checks on the data.

Records containing subject medical information must be hand led in accordance with the 
requirements of the applicable privacy rules and consistent with the terms of the subject 
authorization contained in the ICF for the study. Care should be taken to ensure that such records 
are not shared with any person or for an y purpose not contemplated by [CONTACT_9535]. Furthermore, 
eCRFs and other documents to be transferred to the Sponsor should be completed in strict 
accordance with the instructions provided by [CONTACT_1034], including the instructions regarding 
the coding of subjec t identities.  
Essential study documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_754260] be notified in writi ng by [CONTACT_574662]. If requested, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable 
regulatory agencies, and applicable IRB/IEC with direct access  to original source documents.

Study Title A Phase 2 Randomized, Single-Blind Study of a Single Dose of 
Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) Compared with Placebo in 
Outpatients with Mild COVID-[ADDRESS_1252723] University 
Description Single-blind randomized controlled trial 
Study Objectives 1. To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) injections of a 
single dose of 180 mcg of Peginterferon Lambda-1a compared with placebo in reducing the duration of viral shedding of SARS- 
CoV-2 virus in patients with uncomplicated COVID-19 disease. 
2. To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous injections of a single 
dose of 180 mcg of Peginterferon Lambda-1a compared with placebo, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and the duration of 
symptoms, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or ED visits in patients with uncomplicated COVID-19 disease. 
3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous injections 
of a single dose of 180 mcg of Peginterferon Lambda-1a compared with placebo. 
Scientific rationale Recently, a novel corona virus has been identified as the causative pathogen of a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_894150]. COVID-19, originally identified 
in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, has now spread across the globe and has been declared by [CONTACT_7543] a global pandemic. 
While the majority of infected patients display mild symptoms if any, 
death rates of up to 4% due to development of severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (COVID-19 SARS), have been reported in patients with co-morbid conditions and in the elderly population. With the unprecedented global health and economic threats imposed by [CONTACT_4113]-19, development of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894151]. 
The interferon (IFN) system represents a major element of the innate 
immune response against viral infections. Virus-induced IFN is a complex mixture of biologically active molecules, which includes type I and type III IFNs. Binding of type I IFN and type III IFN to their cognate 
receptor complexes triggers signaling cascades that result in the 
activation of a large number of genes, many of which encode antiviral proteins. Type III IFN (i.e. IFN- ȜXVHVDGL stinct receptor complex 
(IL28R) for signaling which appears to be expressed on only a few cell types, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_894152], resulting in demonstrated improved tolerability profile. Based on 
IFN-Ȝ
VPRUHO imited receptor distribution and therefore expected 
improved tolerability profile, a pegylated form of recombinant Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) has been developed for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitides such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and recently also hepatitis D. Lambda has so far been administered in

Treatment 
assignment Study participants will be randomly assigned 1:[ADDRESS_1252728] of care 
Treatment arms 1. Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda), 180 mcg, administered as 
subcutaneous injection 
2. Normal saline, 0.45 ml administered as subcutaneous injection 
Dose Justification A single dose PK of Peginterferon Lambda-1a given subcutaneously 
has been assessed in four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and in 
two phase 2 studies in subjects with HCV. In these studies, Lambda 
exhibited dose-proportional PK over the dose range of 80 to 240 mcg. 
 Phase 2 studies established the optimal dose for virologic suppression 
and minimizing treatment-related adverse events for hepatitis C at 180 
mcg; this dose is also currently being used in hepatitis D trials. 
Screening, 
enrolment, 
randomization, and follow-up of participants Patients will be screened, and a baseline physical examination and 
laboratory assessment performed. Eligible patients will be randomized 
1:1 to receive Lambda 180 mcg SC (intervention arm) or normal saline placebo (control arm) (Day 0). Patients will complete an at-home symptom questionnaire on each day of follow-up, including in-home assessments of temperature and O2 saturation and collection of anterior nare swabs and stool. Patients will then be seen at follow-up 
visits at Day 1r 1, 3r1, 5r1, 7r1, 10r 1, 14r1, 21r 1, and 28r 1. At each 
visit, vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate per minute, 
breath rate per minute and oxygen saturation), will be performed. 
Efficacy of Lambda will be assessed by [CONTACT_894191]-19 in respi[INVESTIGATOR_894155], and by [CONTACT_894192]. Clinical laboratory measurements (CBC, chemistries, LFTs) 
will be performed at enrollment and Days 5 r1, and 14r 1. Additionally, 
~25 mL peripheral blood will be collected from study participants at 
enrollment and at Days 5 r1, 14r 1, and 28 r1 for processing and 
cryopreservation into a specimen biobank. Safety and tolerability of 
Lambda will be assessed by [CONTACT_60235] (AE) monitoring, vital signs 
assessment and clinical laboratory tests. Patients will reach the end of 
study at day [ADDRESS_1252729] after 50% of study participants are enrolled and have completed 1 day of follow-up following study drug 
administration. 
Statistical Analysis and Sample Size 
Considerations We will evaluate the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as the 
original treatment assignment groups after randomization, for the 
primary efficacy analysis. We will analyze the per-protocol group as 
supportive evidence for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Approximately 120 patients with COVID-19 infection are planned to be 
enrolled and randomized, and we conservatively assume that 90% of participants will complete follow-up. The primary endpoint will be assessed in all patients. We assume that the mean duration of virologic shedding is [ADDRESS_1252730] deviation of 4 days (Zhou et al, Lancet 2020). With [ADDRESS_1252731] 80% power to detect a minimum 50% reduction in virologic shedding in participants receiving Lambda. 
2 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
 
2.1.1 COVID-19, a novel coronavirus with an urgent need for novel therapeutics to 
decrease viral shedding and transmission 
 
Recently, a novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative pathogen of a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_894156]. COVID- 19, originally identified in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China[1], has now spread across the 
globe and has been declared by [CONTACT_7543] a global pandemic. While the majority of infected 
patients display mild symptoms if any, death rates of up to 4% due to development of severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (COVID-19 SARS), have been reported in patients with co-morbid 
conditions and in the elderly population[2]. With the unprecedented global health and economic 
threats imposed by [CONTACT_4113]-19, development of ther api[INVESTIGATOR_894157]. 
 
In a recent report, COVID-19+ patients presenting with mild symptoms had a median viral load 
of 1 X 106 copi[INVESTIGATOR_894158] (an average of 2-[ADDRESS_1252732] 
symptom onset), and this declined in the subsequent period and correlated with resolution of 
symptoms[3]. All patients had evidence of viral shedding in the oropharynx 7 days following 
symptom onset; by [CONTACT_4475] 14, 22% of patients had evidence of oropharyngeal shedding. In 
contrast, nearly 80% of subjects had evidence of viral shedding in both sputum and stool 
specimens at [ADDRESS_1252733]-spectrum antiviral 
 
Peginterferon Lambda-1a (hereafter referred to as Lambda) is 
a covalent conjugate of human recombinant non-pegylated interferon lambda and a 20-kDa linear PEG chain. Lambda is 
a type III interferon (i.e. IFN- ȜWKDWVWLPXODWHVLQQDWHLPPXQH  
responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections[4]. Similar to type 1 
interferons (including IFN-a), binding of IFN- ȜWRLWVFRJQDWH  
receptor complexes triggers signaling cascades, including those mediated by [CONTACT_167193]/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, that result 
in the activation of a large number of genes, many of which 
encode antiviral proteins (Fig 1)[5]. However, IFN- ȜXVHVD

Fig. 2 In a study of patients with SARS-CoV, patients given IFN- D and corticosteroids had improved 
clinical outcomes compared with patients given corticosteroids alone. recombinant interferon lambda (Lambda) was de veloped for the treatment of chronic viral 
hepatitides[6, 7]. 
 
 
Lambda was previously investigated by [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb (BMS) for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infection. This development was discontinued in [ADDRESS_1252734]-spectrum antiviral activiti es of Lambda and fewer side effects of Lambda 
compared with pegylated IFN alfa-2a in HCV and HBV clinical studies, Eiger BioPharmaceuticals is investigating Lambda in the treatment of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection, licensing worldwide rights to  Lambda from BMS. Lambda has so far been 
administered to over [ADDRESS_1252735] been shown to induce inhibition of respi[INVESTIGATOR_129713][8- 
10]. In in vitro experiments, type 1 interferons were also effective in inhibiting severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686]-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)[11]. In a study of patients with SARS-CoV, a 
synthetic formulation of IFN-a, when given with corticosteroids, was associated with reduced 
disease-associated impaired oxygen saturation and resolution of radiographic lung 
abnormalities, in comparison with a group receiving corticosteroids alone (Figure 2)[12]. These 
data suggest that therapeutic use of interferon may be efficacious in the treatment of SARS- CoV. 
 
The presence of IL28R in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_894160]- ȜLQSRVVLEOHmitigation of viral 
induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. In a murine model of influenza infection, IFN- ȜWUHDWPHQWSRVW -infection was 
associated with significantly lower mortality compared to mice treated with IFN-a, and this was associated 
with lower influenza viral loads[13]. Furthermore, 
studies in animal models have shown that IFN- ȜPD\ 
play an important role in restricting viral replication of 
SARS-coronavirus (Figure 3)[14]. The use of Lambda 
for treatment of COVID-19 infection has to our 
knowledge not yet been explored
. 
 
2.2. SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF LAMBDA 
 
Approximately 3,743 subjects (including 237 healthy subjects; 3,276 subjects with HCV; 197 
subjects with HBV; and 50 subjects wi th HDV) have received Lambda to date. 
In a study of healthy volunteers administered a single s.c dose of lambda up to 7.5ug/kg, 
reversible dose-related increases in liver transaminases (ALT and AST) were seen in 5/17 
(29.4%) subjects. One of the 2 subjects treated with Lambda 7.5 ȝJNJ experienced reversible 
Grade [ADDRESS_1252736] common AEs associated with s.c administration 
of lambda were abdominal pain and venous puncture site hematoma. All AEs were mild in 
intensity. One (3.3%) subject in the 180- ȝJ group had reversible Grade [ADDRESS_1252737] and 
ALT not associated with clinical symptoms or bilirubin elevations. 
 
In a recently completed 48-week study of patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection, 
treatment with 180ug lambda, 7/14 (50.0%) patients reported a Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related 
AE with the following frequencies: injection site reaction 1 (7.1%), ALT or AST increase 5 
(35.7%), bilirubin increase 2 (14.3%), decreased  neutrophil count 1 (7.1%), flu-like symptoms 
including fever/chills 9 (64.3%), arthralgia or myalgia 7 (50.0%) and fatigue 8 (57.1%). At the 
end-of-treatment ALT or AST >5xULN <10ULN was reported in a single patient. There were no 
increases in bilirubin >2xULN concurrent with increases in ALT or AST at the end-of-treatment. 
In other studies of lambda as a combination therapy for hepatitis B or C, clinically meaningful increases in total bilirubin occurred in 7.6% and 2.6% of patients dosed with Lambda/Ribavirin 
(RBV) and Lambda/RBV/Daclatasvir (DCV), respectively. Similarly, increases in serum ALT 
were noted in 6.2% and 3.7% of subjects on Lambda/RBV and Lambda/RBV/DCV, respectively. 
All increases were manageable with dose withholding, reduction, or discontinuation. 
Lymphopenia was not seen with any significance in  prior Lambda studies of 48 weeks. Pyrexia 
occurred at a frequency of 9.9% of patients treated with the 180ug lambda + RBV. 
 
IFN-based treatment induces a variety of psychi atric adverse effects, including depression, 
manic condition, acute and chronic cognitive dysf unction, suicidal behavior, and relapse of

2.3 DOSAGE JUSTIFICATION 
The single dose PK of Peginterferon Lambda-1a given subcutaneously has been assessed in 
four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and in two phase 2 studies in subjects with HCV. In 
these studies, Lambda exhibited dose-proportional PK over the dose range of 80 to 240 mcg. 
Phase 2 studies established the optimal dose for virologic suppression and minimizing 
treatment-related adverse events for hepatitis C at 180 mcg; this dose is also currently being 
used in hepatitis D trials. 
2.4 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
As no known effective treatment is available for COVID-19, participants may have access to effective therapy in the trial. They may have the added benefit of reducing household and 
community transmission of the virus

week, we will also advertise for newly diagnosed COVID cases on social media and hand out 
flyers at other screening sites as possible. We are also exploring the possibility of calling all 
COVID positive patients directly; this recruitment approach will be added to an amended 
protocol if we find it is possible. 
 
6.5. Phone Screening Interview 
Individuals who provide informed consent to be contact[CONTACT_894194]-19 positive via 
the emergency department or occupational health will be contact[CONTACT_3012]. At the initial phone call, we will screen for inclusion and exclusion criteria; the clinical research coordinator 
(CRC) will fill out the RedCap screening form and determine if the subject is eligible and 
interested in participating. If the patient meets the criteria in the phone interview, we will invite them to the clinical research site (Stanford University) where we will review inclusion criteria 
again at the first patient visit. The subject will also be asked to bring in their proof of infection 
with them or to have it a ccessible in on-line form. 
 
6.6. Study Enrollment Procedures and Baseline Evaluation 
 
At the initial intake visit, screening eligibility criteria will be reviewed and confirmed. Subjects will 
undergo a standardized history, including time since symptom onset, and physical examination 
and have blood collected by [CONTACT_40145]. We wi ll conduct the laboratory screening with 
complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and, in premenopausal women, beta HCG. Additional blood will be collected for biobanking. Inclusion/exclusion labs will 
be performed stat in the clinical lab. Participants will be asked whether they are enrolled in another study; they cannot be enrolled in other studies of investigational agents. After initial 
screening, the participant will then provide written informed consent to participate in the study 
and for the future use of biological specimens. 
 
6.6. Potential Limitations on Recruitment and Mitigation Strategies 
 
Given the fast-changing landscape during the COVID-[ADDRESS_1252746] of care 
and/or slower than planned enrollment. The study team plans to evaluate the rate of enrollment 
two weeks after enrollment opens. If fewer than [ADDRESS_1252747] 
two weeks, a potential solution to increase enroll ment is to change the randomization ratio to be 
2:1 on treatment:control. We have selected a 1:1 ratio under the assumption of equipoise; however, we anticipate that participants may not want to have a 50% chance of being 
randomized to placebo. To address this concern, we could increase the ratio in order to reduce 
the chance of being randomized to placebo to 33 %. Under the assumptions described in our 
sample size estimates (Section 12.6 below), the change in the randomization ratio will not 
require a larger sample size. 
7. CONCURRENT MEDICATIONS 
7.1 Allowed medications and treatments 
a. Acetaminophen b. Ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
c. Symptomatic care for cough/URI (e.g., decongestants/cough syrups) 
 
7.2 Prohibited medications and treatments 
a. Other investigational and/or immunomodulatory agents for treatment of COVID-19, 
including but not limited to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. 
b. Heparin or coumadin 
 
8. STUDY TREATMENTS 
 
8.1 Method of assigning subjects to treatment groups 
Up to 120 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to Lambda or placebo in a 1:1 ratio to the 
treatment and control arms using a REDCAP-based computer-generated randomization 
scheme developed by [CONTACT_894195]. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (>=50 and <50 years old) and sex. The investigator or designee will complete a password- 
protected electronic spreadsheet containing the randomization allocation, along with the code 
used to generate the allocation along with the seed used in the random number generation, will 
be stored on secure servers at Stanford. 
 
8.2 Blinding 
Administration of all study drugs will be single-blind (blinded to the study participant). All doses 
of study drugs will be prepackaged by [CONTACT_894196] a 
study nurse not involved in data analysis. The stud y biostatisticians will be blinded to subject 
randomization, with the exception of an unblinded subgroup who will generate the 
randomization scheme and perform unblinded interim analyses. The subgroup will not discuss 
the unblinded data or interim results with the blinded biostatisticians and will save their materials 
on a server that is inaccessible to the blinded members. This study blind will be broken on 
completion of the clinical study and after the study database has been locked. During the study, 
the blind may be broken only in emergencies when knowledge of the patient’s treatment group 
is necessary for further patient management. When  possible, the Investigator should discuss 
the emergency with the data safety and monitoring board prior to unblinding.

current records of receipt, use, or disposition of study drugs, including: 1) dates of receipt, 2) 
dates of dispensing, 3) quantities currently maintained for dispensing, 4) name [CONTACT_894226], and 4) amounts remaining at the end of trial and method of disposition. 
Medications will be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protected 
from long-term (> 24 hours) exposure to light; refrigerators will have temperature logged. 
 
[ADDRESS_1252752] Follow-up 
 
9.1.1. In home assessments. 
Participants will complete an at-home symptom questionnaire by [CONTACT_894199]- 
up through day 28, including in-home assessment s of temperature and O2 saturation. These 
assessments will be reviewed daily by a clinical research coordinator, and patients will be telephoned by a physician if they report an elevated temperature, diminished O2 sat (<94%), or 
signs/symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_894164] y distress (e.g. shortness of breath, dyspnea 
on exertion). On each day through day 28, patients will also be instructed to collect an anterior nare swab in a pre-labeled container and to store these specimens in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C, and to bring these in to their next scheduled appointment. Prior to the optional follow 
up visits at months 4, [ADDRESS_1252753] a stool specimen to  bring to their next scheduled appointment. 
 
 
9.1.2. Follow-up in-clinic assessments. 
Participants will be seen at follow-up visits at Day 1 r1, 3r1, 5r1, 7r1, 10r 1, 14r 1, 21r 1, and 
28r1. At each visit, a subjective medical history will be performed, including assessments for 
use of any concomitant medications. Vital signs will be obtained (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate per minute, breath rate per minute and oxygen saturation), and oropharyngeal and 
anterior nare swabs will be collected. Participants  will also submit at-home collected anterior 
nare swab specimens for evaluation. Clinical laboratory measurements will be performed at 
days 5r1 and 14 r1 to assess for safety, with additional clinical laboratory assessments 
performed as needed for clinical follow-up and/or patient management. Additionally, ~25 mL 
peripheral blood will be collected from study participants at enrollment and at Days 5 r1, 14r 1, 
and 28r1 for processing and cryopreservation into a specimen biobank. Safety and tolerability 
of Lambda will be assessed by [CONTACT_60235] (AE) monitoring, vital signs assessment and clinical laboratory tests. Patients will reach the end of study at day [ADDRESS_1252754]

Fig. 4 Laboratory assessments. 9.2 Clinical laboratory measurements 
All clinical laboratory measurements (CBC and CM P) at enrolment and during follow-up will be 
performed using point-of-care CLIA-waived devices or in the Stanford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894165]. Follow-up clinical laboratory assessments will be performed at Day [ADDRESS_1252755] randomization, with additional clinic al laboratory assessments performed as needed 
for clinical follow-up and/or patient management. (Fig 4). 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1252756] stool at home (between days 0-3, 10-14, and 21-28; and at 4, [ADDRESS_1252757]- randomization). All swabs will be collected in viral transport media or phosphate buffered saline. 
Stool will be collected in stabilization tubes, kept at room temperature, and brought to the next 
study visit. Samples collected in the clinic will be refrigerated and transported the same day to 
the Stanford clinical virology laboratory for proces sing. We will ask that swabs collected at home 
be stored in a [ADDRESS_1252758] udy visit, at which point they will be transferred 
to the study team and transported to the clinical virology laboratory. Fridges will be provided to 
the participants at enrolment. In the clinical virology laboratory, samples will undergo 
automated nucleic acid extraction followed by a FDA-cleared quantitative real-time PCR assay 
for SARS-CoV-2, which will generate both qualitative (positive or negative) and quantitative (estimated viral copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) results. The assay is validated for nasopharyngeal , oropharyngeal, and 
anterior nare samples. The stool assays have been analytically validated and are undergoing 
clinical validation. 
9.4 Biobanking/Immune phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_894166]. This will allow 
for ongoing studies to define the dynamics of the host immune response to COVID-19, with the eventual goal of gaining insight into mechanisms by [CONTACT_894200]. For biobanking activities, samples will be collected at enrolment, day [ADDRESS_1252759]-randomization (Fig 4). The window of r3 weeks is allowed for these long term follow up 
visits. Stool will be collected as above and biobanked for microbiome assessments. 
 
At the time of blood draw, one 2.5 ml PaxGene tube and two 10 ml CPT (or green-top heparin) 
tubes will be collected for biobanking and brought to the BSL2+ research lab in Grant S146b. 
This whole blood then be stored in either stored in specific fixatives, used directly to assess 
innate immune phenotype and/or the immune response to toll like receptor stimulation, and/or 
separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononucl ear cells (PBMC) using a Ficoll gradient, 
following standard protocols. All samples will have unique labels with barcodes and unique study identifier. Specimens will be logged into the Stanford Biobank through the OpenSpecimen 
database tracking system. Plasma will be stored at -80°C for future immunologic and/or 
pharmacokinetic studies, which may include meas urement of levels of  cytokines, antibodies, 
and other features related to the host immune response. PBMCs will be stored in liquid nitrogen 
to maintain viability, and will be evaluated using flow cytometry, RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, and 
other assays to assess the host immune response. 
 
In a subset of patients, we will consider a finger stick blood sample at day 14 and/or [ADDRESS_1252760] blood on a dry blood spot to validate performance characteristics of a serologic assay in 
comparison to venipuncture. 
 
9.5 Reimbursement of subjects 
 
Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_1252761] 28 days. For the optional visits at months 4, 7 and 10, 
subjects will receive $100 per visit; this is to encourage study retention. Preferred method of payment is gift card after the completion of each study visit. Subjects will receive a thermometer 
and a pulse oximeter for study use which they may keep after study completion. 
 
9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
 
10.1. Monitoring and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
10.1.1. Definitions 
 
An adverse event is defined as "any untoward m edical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment" (ICH Guid elines E2A). An adverse event can further be 
broadly defined as any untoward deviation from baseline health, which includes: 
x Worsening of conditions present at the onset of the study 
x Deterioration due to the primary disease 
x Intercurrent illness 
x Events related or possibly related to concomitant medications 
(International Centers for Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_894167], Monitoring 
and Reporting Adverse Events, 2003). 
 
10.1.2. Identification of Adverse Events 
 
At each scheduled and unscheduled visit to the c linic, study clinicians will assess patients 
according to a standardized case record form. A severity grading scale, based on toxicity grading scales developed by [CONTACT_894201] (DAIDS) Toxicity Tables, will be used to 
grade severity of all symptoms, physical exam fi ndings, and laboratory results (Appendix 3). All 
participants, regardless of treatment arm, will be assessed using the same standardized case record form. Adverse event monitoring will occur during the period when study drugs are given and up to 1 month after cessation of study drugs. 
 
Data will be captured on the incidence of all adverse events, regardless of severity. For each adverse event identified and graded as severe or life threatening and felt to be possibly, 
probably or definitely related to study drugs, an adverse event report form will be completed. In 
addition, an adverse event form will be completed for all serious adverse events and unexpected events, regardless of severity. An adverse event report form will not be completed 
for events classified as mild or moderate (unless they are serious or unexpected), as mild and 
moderate symptoms are common and difficult to distinguish from signs and symptoms due to 
COVID and other common illnesses. The following information will be recorded for all adverse 
experiences that are reported: 
 
1) Description of event 
2) Date of event onset 
3) Date event reported 
4) Maximum severity of the event 
5) Maximum suspected relationship of the event to study drugs (either SP or DP) 
6) Whether the event is a serious adverse event 
7) Initials of the person reporting the event 
8) Outcome 
9) Date event resolved 
 
10.1.3. Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Guidelines for reporting of adverse events provided by [CONTACT_894202] (FDA) in the U.S. will be followed as summarized in 
Table [ADDRESS_1252762] PI

awareness 
 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death, 
• Life-threatening adverse experience. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38101], 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or 
• Any other experience that suggests a significan t hazard, contraindication, side effect or 
precaution that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above, 
• Event occurring in a gene therapy study 
• Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of the study. 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event An adverse event is defined as being unexpected if the event 
exceeds the nature, severity, or frequency described in the protocol, consent form and 
investigator brochure (when applicable). An unexpected AE also includes any AE that meets 
any of the following criteria: 
• Results in subject withdrawal from study participation, 
• Due to an overdose of study medication, or 
• Due to a deviation from the study protocol 
 
[ADDRESS_1252764]-randomization, with optional follow-up for up to 10 months. Study participants will be prematurely withdrawn from the study for: 1) 
inability to be located for >7 consecutive days, 2) withdrawal of informed consent, 3) inability to comply with the study schedule and procedures (e.g., missing [ADDRESS_1252765] 6 in-person visits), 4) 
at the discretion of the site investigator if the study is not in the best interest of the participant, 5) 
subject judged by [CONTACT_894204]. If a subject is withdrawn for reasons # [ADDRESS_1252766] is withdrawn for reasons # 3-5, plans to obtain appropriate follow-up 
tests outside of the study will be individualized for each subject depending on the health status of the subject at the time of withdrawal and the willingness of the participant and his or her 
parent/guardian to proceed with additional testing. 
10.[ADDRESS_1252767] monitoring procedures, standardized 
reporting of adverse events (Adverse Event Report Forms are completed by [CONTACT_894205]), and review of the study by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at both an interim and fi nal analysis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894168], including the safety of human subjects. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_525723] (1) conduct of the informed consent process (e.g. that informed consent is obtained before proceeding with study procedures); (2) enrollment of study subjects; (3) collection and 
analysis of data; (4) implementation of study procedures to ensure consistent monitoring of 
subjects for possible adverse events; (5) review of adverse events and reporting to the DSMB 
and the IRBs; and (6) maintenance of the privacy and confidentiality of study subjects. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_525724]. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_525725] a regular basis to review the progress of the study 
and address any human subject issues that occu r. These discussions may involve adverse 
event prevention measures, recruiting of appropria te study subjects, research staff training on 
protection of human subjects, as well as occurrence of adverse events, unexpected incidents, or 
protocol problems. 
 
11.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
 
A DSMB will be established by [CONTACT_894206] a clinical trial, safety data, and critical efficacy variables and 
recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or terminate the trial. The DSMB will 
operate according to guidelines documented in a DSMB charter. Minutes will be taken to 
provide a written record of the DSMB meetings, in cluding interim results; these will be available 
for review when the trial is complete. The DSMB will be a separate entity from the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB). The independence of the DSMB is intended to control the sharing of 
important comparative information and to protect the integrity of the clinical trial from adverse 
impact resulting from access to trial information. DSMB members will not participate in the 
study as investigators and will not have conflicts of interest regarding the study or the 
investigational product. The composition of the DSMB will include at minimum: 
 
DSMB Chair, having experience and expertise in clinical trials 
Scientist with expertise in viral infectious diseases. 
Scientist with expertise in pharmacology 
Biostatistician with expertise in clinical trials. 
 
The DSMB will meet before the study, during an interim analysis, and at the conclusion of the 
trial to review progress of the clinical trial and safety data. 
The DSMB will review the study for progress and safety. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894169]: 
· The research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data safety and 
monitoring; 
· Periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study outcome; · Factors external to the study when relevant information, such as scientific or therapeutic developments, may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial; 
· Study performance to make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems; 
· The safety of the study participants; 
· The safety and scientific progress of the trial; 
· The continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed 
beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study; 
· The confidentiality of the data and the results of monitoring; and 
· Any problems with study conduct, enrollment, sample size and/or data collection. 
 
The first meeting of the DSMB will take place prior to the initiation of the study to discuss the 
protocol and the Data Safety Monitoring Plan. Meetings of the DSMB shall be held according to 
the plan outlined above. Meetings shall be closed to the public because discussions may 
address confidential patient data. Meetings may be convened as conference calls as well as in 
person. An emergency meeting of the Board may be called at any time should questions of patient safety arise. The DSMB may request the presence of study investigators at such 
meetings. 
 
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_894170] a scheduled meeting. The 
DSMB may request additions and other modifications to this information on a one -time or 
continuing basis. This information will consist of two parts: (1) information on study progress 
such as accrual, baseline characteristics, and other general information on study status and (2) 
any confidential data on study outcomes, including safety data. A formal report from the DSMB 
should be supplied to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 3 days of each meeting. Each report should conclude with a 
recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This recommendation should be made 
by [CONTACT_7558]. A recommendation to terminate the study should be transmitted to the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_7527], by [CONTACT_7559]. In the 
event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. At the conclusion of the DSMB meeting for the interim safety review 
planned at 50% enrollment, the DSMB chair will convey the DSMB’s recommendation to the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_894171]. 
 
11.2. Interim analysis 
 
An interim analysis for safety and overwhelming efficacy will be performed once 50% of patients have 24 hours of follow-up complete. Enrollment will pause once 50% of patients have received 
treatment and will remain paused until the DSMB makes their recommendation after their safety 
review. The DSMB will meet one or two days after enrollment is paused to review the safety 
data collected within the first [ADDRESS_1252768] blood count labs collected at day 5 to be available in approximately 25% of patients at 
the time of the DSMB review. 
 
The DSMB will also review the efficacy data on all randomized participants at this meeting. The 
interim efficacy analysis will use the same meth ods as are planned for the final analysis using 
the ITT analysis. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DSMB will either recommend to the sponsor to terminate the study for overwhelming efficacy (p<0.[ZIP_CODE] at the interim 
analysis), terminate the study for safety concerns, modify the study, or continue the study as 
planned. No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s for futility are planned. 
 
12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1 Analysis population 
We will evaluate the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will 
include all randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed according to their assigned treatment 
arm. All efficacy analyses will be completed in the ITT population. The per-protocol (PP) 
population will include all randomized patients who completed follow-up and adhered to study 
procedures. All efficacy analyses will be also be completed in the PP population as supportive 
evidence for the primary efficacy analysis. The safety population will include all patients who 
receive study treatment. Patients will be analyzed  according to actual treatment received. All 
safety analyses will be completed in the safety population. 
 
12.2 Descriptive analyses 
Descriptive statistics (proportions for categorical variables, means, medians, standard 
deviations and interquartile ranges for continuous variables) will be reported for all key patient 
variables, including baseline and demographic characteristics, use of medications, compliance, 
and study completion status. Data that are missing on key patient characteristics and the 
outcome will be fully described, including any patterns of missingness (i.e., any relationships between missingness of a variable and patient characteristics). 
 
A CONSORT diagram displaying the number of patients screened, eligible, and consented 
along with reasons for ineligibility will be provid ed. Graphical tools such as histograms, boxplots, 
and scatterplots will be created to assess qual ity of data and to display patterns over time. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1252769] will be performed at 
the alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1252770] ratio for shedding cessation will be estimated, 
along with its 95% confidence interval, from  a Cox proportional hazards model. If the 
proportional hazards assumption is not met, we will consider an extended Cox model that 
relaxes the proportional hazards assumption. 
 
The distribution of shedding cessation will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to shedding cessation at 
the end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each 
treatment arm. 
In a subgroup analyses, the time until shedding cessation analyses will be performed separately 
in the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1252771] and/or generalized es timating equations with robust standard errors. 
The area-under-the-curve (AUC) SARS-CoV2 vira l RNA levels during follow-up will be 
estimated using the linear trapezoidal method , and mean AUC levels compared between groups 
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
 
The distribution of cessation of symptoms will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to cessation of symptoms 
at the end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each 
treatment arm. The hazard ratio for cessation of symptoms will be estimated, along with its 95% 
confidence intervals, from a Cox proportional haza rds model. Time to cessation of symptoms 
will be estimated in the subgroup of pati ents who are symptomatic at baseline.

12.6 Sample size and randomization 
 
For the primary comparison, the following will be tested: 
 
x Null hypothesis: time to cessation of oral  shedding is equal in control and treatment; 
x Alternative hypothesis: time to cessation of oral shedding differs between control and 
treatment. 
 
Hypothesis tests will be two sided and conducted at an overall alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1252773] deviation of 4 days
1. 
 
Assuming 1:[ADDRESS_1252774] at the alpha=0.[ZIP_CODE] level of significance for the final analysis, 79 events will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 
2.03. This leaves alpha=0.[ZIP_CODE] to check for overwhelming efficacy after 50% of participants 
have completed [ADDRESS_1252775] patient, and a drop out of 10% in the control arm, 
it is estimated that the total sample size required to achieve 79 events is 120 (60 patients in 
each arm). 
As described in section 6.[ADDRESS_1252776] the study’s operating 
characteristics. If fewer than [ADDRESS_1252777] two weeks, a 
potential solution to increase enrollment is to change the randomization ratio to be 2:1 on 
treatment:control, which would reduce the chance of being randomized to placebo to 33%. 
Under the assumptions described above, the change in the randomization ratio will not require a 
larger sample size. 
 
We also consider how a change in the standard of care could impact our study’s power. If the 
standard of care changes and our expected effect size decreases, our expected power would 
decrease to 61%, 41%, or 22% under an assumed hazard ratio of 1.8, 1.6, or 1.4, respectively. 
The impact of the change to the standard of care will depend on what proportion of patients 
have been enrolled. If the standard of care changes before enrollment is 90% complete, we will 
estimate the conditional power based on the current enrollment and the expected decrease in 
the effect size; we would not look at the blinded study data or outcome data to estimate the 
conditional power. If the conditional power is < 70%, the study will be modified by [CONTACT_894207] 80%. If the total required sample size to reach 80% conditional power is greater than 18 0, the study will be stopped for futility.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH 
 
You are invited to participate in  a research study of Peginterfer on Lambda-1a. We hope to learn 
whether a single injection of this  medicine decreases the time until you test negative for SARS- 
CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus diseas e (COVID-19). We will al so assess whether it 
improves your symptoms and whether it causes any side effects. You were selected as a possible 
participant in this study because you are an outpatient with mild COVID1-9. 
 
If you decide to terminate your pa rticipation in this study, you s hould notify [CONTACT_894233][INVESTIGATOR_894178] 
[PHONE_11895] 
 
This research study is looking for [ADDRESS_1252782] on you or your medical care. You can decide to participate now, but 
withdraw your consent later and stop being in th e study without any loss of  benefits or medical 
care to which you are entitled. 
 
DURATION OF STU DY INVOLVEMENT 
This research study has two parts: the first part—w hich is required for pa rticipation--is expected 
to take approximately 6 months to complete, with each of the 120 participants followed for up to 
28 days. The second part, which is optional for study participation, will require an additional 9 
months of follow-up per participant. The total study will take one year. 
 
PROCEDURES 
This study is to assess whether a new drug, gi ven on one occasion under the skin, can decrease 
the time until you no longer sh ed the virus SARS-C oV (Coronavirus) from your respi[INVESTIGATOR_14921]. We will also assess whether it helps you fe el better faster and wh ether it causes any side 
effects. The medication we will use, Peginterfe ron Lambda 1-a (Lambda), has previously been 
tested in over [ADDRESS_1252783] e and over 3000 people in the treatment of viral hepatitis. 
Because we don’t know if it will work for SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19), we will give the 
medication only to half of the people who join  the study. The other half will receive a placebo 
injection of normal saline (sal t water). In addition, particip ants in both groups will receive 
standard of care for COVID-19. Th e subjects who get the medica tion will be chosen at random 
and enrolled participants will not know whether th ey are receiving the dr ug or the placebo. The 
Lambda and control groups can then be comp ared to see whether the medication is more 
effective than the symptomatic care at home. You have a 50% chance of receiving Lambda. 
Lambda is experimental and is not approved by [CONTACT_1622]. 
If you choose to participate, the Protocol Direct or and her research study staff will ask you to do 
the following 
x At the first visit, you will 
o Review the research protocol and ask and answer questions confirming that you 
understand it. 
o Be given an ID number that we ask you to save for future use. 
o Provide 30 ml (two tablespoons) of bl ood by [CONTACT_48571]. This blood will be 
used to confirm your eligibility for th e study. Any remaining blood will be stored 
for future studies of immune re sponses and viral biology in Biobank 
o Have you throat and anterior (front part) of your nose swabbed for SARS-CoV2 
(the virus that causes COVI D-19) and other viruses. 
o Be randomized to either receive a single injection under your skin 
(subcutaneously) of Peginterferon Lambda -1a or placebo along with standard-of- 
care. Because there is no know n treatment for this virus,  the standard-of-care is 
rest at home, quarantine from others, and follow-up with healthcare providers as 
needed. 
o If you receive the injection, wait in clinic  for 30 minute to en sure you don’t have 
an allergy to the medication 
o Be given a thermometer, blood oxygen moni tor and mini-fridge for use at home. 
You will be instruct ed in their use. 
x At home, after the first visit, you will: 
o Take your temperature and blood oxygen leve ls daily and record the time when 
these are obtained 
o Record these values daily in a very short, online questionnaire accessible by 
[CONTACT_894209]. On this questionna ire, you will also be asked to respond 
daily to questions about symptoms of COVID-[ADDRESS_1252784] a sample of anterior nasal swab s daily in the receptacles provided to. 
o Stool samples (optional) will be collect ed at home (between days 0-3, 10-14, and 
21-28). 
 
x Eight required follow-up visits (Treatment Study) 
o Over the subsequent 28 days, you will be  asked to attend 8 follow-up visits. We 
will provide you with a calendar and appoi ntments for these visits. These will 
occur at 
 1 day after enrollment 
 2-4 days after enrollment (no visits will occur on weekends) 
 4-6 days after enrollment. 
 7 days after enrollment 
 9-11 days after enrollment 
 14 days, 21 and 28 days  after enrollment 
o At these visits we will obtain: 
 A swab of your throat for SARS-Cov2 
 On days 4-6, 14, and 28, we will ask for 30 ml (two tablespoons of blood) 
by [CONTACT_48571]. These samples will be used to look for medication side 
effects and to store for future work on immune responses and viral biology 
in Biobank. 
 Optional finger stick blood will be collected at visit Day 14 and Day 28 on 
a dry blood spot to validate performance characteristics of a serologic 
assay in comparison to venipuncture. 
 
o Optional long-term follow-up (Biobank study) 
 If you agree to longer term follow -up, we will collect 30 ml (two 
tablespoon) blood samples on three occas ions, 4 months, 7 months and 10 
months after your enrollment, along with  additional optional stool samples 
at 4 months, 7 mont hs and 10 months. 
 At each long-term follow up visit, you will be asked to answer questions 
about how COVID-[ADDRESS_1252785] University and/or ot hers. However, donors of specimens do not retain 
any property rights to the materials. Therefore, you would not  share in any financial benefits 
from these products, test s or discoveries.

Women of Childbearing Potential 
If you are a woman who is able to become pregnant, it is expected that yo u will use an  effective 
method of birth control to prev ent exposing a fetus to a potentia lly dangerous agent with unknown 
risk. If you are pregnant or curr ently breast feeding, you may not participate in this study. You 
understand that if you are pregnant, if you become pregnant, or if you ar e breast-feeding during 
this study, you or your child ma y be exposed to an unknown risk . 
 
To confirm to the extent medically possible th at you are not pregnant, you agree to have a 
pregnancy test done before beginning this re search study. You must agree to avoid sexual 
intercourse or use a birth contro l method judged to be effective by [CONTACT_894210] r three months after re ceiving Lambda. You must 
accept the risk that pregnancy could still result despi[INVESTIGATOR_894179] e of reliable method of 
birth control. You agree to notify the investigator as soon as possible of any failure of proper use 
of your birth control method, or if you become pr egnant, either of which may result in your being 
withdrawn from the study. 
 
If you are a man partic ipating in this study and your partner is able to become pregnant, you and 
your partner must use adequate contraception while you are participating in the study and for at 
least three months Your docto r will discuss with you what me thods of birth control are 
considered adequate. You should inform your st udy doctor if your part ner becomes pregnant. 
 
Future Use of Private Info rmation and/or Specimens 
Research using private informati on and/or specimens is an impor tant way to try to understand 
human disease. You are being gi ven this information because th e investigators want to save 
private information and/or sp ecimens for future research. 
 
Your specimens will be stored with a study ID . After the study is co mplete, all personal 
identifiers linked to the study ID  will be destroyed. Because your specimens will not be linked 
to your name [CONTACT_894227], you cannot withdraw your consen t to the use of the specimens 
after they are taken. 
 
Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and/or identifiable specimens 
and, after such removal, the information and/or specimens could be used  for future research 
studies or distributed to anothe r investigator for future rese arch studies without additional 
informed consent from you. 
 
Genetic Testing and Future Research 
As part of the analysis on your specimens, th e investigators may do ge netic testing. Genetic 
research is research that studies  genes, including gene characteris tics and gene versions that are 
transmitted by [CONTACT_373233]. Genetic research may include l ooking at inform ation, such as 
personal appearance and biochemist ry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family 
medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to trea tment. Genetic research raises 
certain questions about informing you of any results. Possible risks of knowing results include: 
anxiety; other psychological dist ress; and the possibility of in surance and job discrimination. A 
possible risk of not knowing incl udes being unaware of the need for treatment. These risks can 
change depending on the results of the research a nd whether there is a treatment or cure for a 
particular disease. 
 
Sometimes patients have been required to furnis h information from genetic testing for health 
insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generall y makes it illegal fo r health insurance 
companies, group health plans, and employers with [ADDRESS_1252786] will be used for research 
purposes only, and you will not be to ld the results of the tests.

POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFO RTS, AND INCONVENIENCES 
 
There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated w ith any research study. These 
deserve careful thought. You should talk with the Protocol Direct or if you have  any questions. 
x You will be asked to come to our research clinic on nine occasions (eight more following 
this visit) and twelve occasions if you agre e to participate in th e longer term follow-up 
study). This is an in convenience to you. 
x We will collect blood samples on four occasions (save if you agree to the longer term 
study). Blood draws can cause di scomfort, bruising and very, ve ry rarely, infection at the 
needle site. Some people also feel faint. We will try to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_894212]-trained blood drawing staff draw your blood. 
x We will collect throat swabs on 9 occasions. Throat swabs cause some people to gag and 
rarely to vomit. We will minimize these ri sks by [CONTACT_894213][INVESTIGATOR_2595]. 
x Half of the subjects will receive an experime ntal drug, Lamda. Those who receive this 
drug may: 
o Experience discomfort at the in jection site for several days 
o Have abnormalities in liver tests for a short period (expected in 20%). These 
abnormalities are not expected  to be severe and the liv er tests are expected to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_894181] 
o Have other potential side effects including fatigue, head ache or diarrhea. Based 
on previous studies of healt hy individuals, we do not expect these side effects to 
be common or severe. 
x We do not know if this medication will be e ffective. All subjects, whether receiving 
treatment or the standard-of-care, may have progression of disease. Because we will be 
monitoring your symptoms daily, and because you can contact [CONTACT_894214], you 
will have rapid access to further medical care 
x Any study may have unforeseeable consequences  to subjects. By [CONTACT_894215], we will be able  to respond to these problems in a timely 
manner.
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
 
We hope that this medicine will reduce sheddi ng of SARS-CoV-2 (the  virus that causes 
COVID-19) from your respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (mout h and nose). Lambda may also reduce the 
duration of symptoms related to  COVID-19, reduce the risk of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_894182] c ontracting COVID-19 within 28 
days. 
 
We cannot and do not guarantee or pr omise that you will receive a ny benefits from this study.

Appendix 3. DAIDS Toxicity Ta ble (clarification Aug 2017) 
 
Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of ADULT AND PEDIATRIC Adverse Events Version 2.1, 
July 2017 
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) oversees more  than 300 clinical trials domestically and 
internationally, which evaluate the safety and ef ficacy of therapeutic products, vaccines, and 
other preventive modalities. Adverse event (AE) data collected during these clinical trials form 
the basis for subsequent safety and efficacy an alyses of pharmaceutica l products and medical 
devices. Incorrect and inconsistent  AE severity grading can lead to  inaccurate data analyses and 
interpretation, which in turn can impact the safety  and well-being of clinical trial participants 
and future patients using pharmaceutical products. 
 
Over the years, DAIDS scientific knowledge and experience have expanded, necessitating 
revisions of the DAIDS grading table which serves  as a guide for assessing the severity of AEs 
(including clinical and laboratory abnormalities)  in participants enrolled in DAIDS-sponsored 
and -supported clinical trials. The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1 (July 2017) updates and replaces 
version 2.1 (March 2017). 
 
Glossary/Definitions of terms used in tables:

Instructions for use 
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events, Version 2.1 consists of parameters, or AEs, with se verity grading guidance that are to be 
used in DAIDS clinical trials for safety data re porting to maintain accuracy and consistency in 
the evaluation of AEs. The term “severe” is no t the same as the term “serious” in classifying 
AEs. The severity of a specific event describes its intensity, and it is the intensity which is 
graded. Seriousness, which is not graded, relates to an outcome of an AE and is a regulatory 
definition. 
 
Clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters in the DAIDS grading table as they are 
written to maintain data consistency across clinical trials. Howe ver, since some parameters can 
be reported with more specificity, clinical si tes are encouraged to report parameters that 
convey additional clinical info rmation. For example, diarrhea could be reported as neonatal 
diarrhea; seizures, as febrile seizures; and pain, as jaw pain. 
 
General Considerations 
The DAIDS grading table provides an AE severity grading scale ranging from grades 1 to 5 with 
descriptions for each AE based on  the following general guidelines: 
Grade 1 indicates a mild event 
Grade 2 indicates a moderate event Grade 3 indicates a severe event 
Grade 4 indicates a potentially life-threatening event 
Grade 5 indicates death (Note: This grade is not sp ecifically listed on each page of the grading 
table). 
 
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters “Between Grades” 
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under eith er one of two grades (e.g., the severity of an 
AE could be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the two grades for the AE. If a 
laboratory value that is graded as a multiple of  the ULN or LLN falls between two grades, select 
the higher of the two grades for the AE. For exam ple, Grade [ADDRESS_1252792] (which is between the two grades), the 
severity of this AE would be Grade 2, the higher of the two grades. 
 
Values Below Grade [ADDRESS_1252793] and grade 1 (for high 
values) or the LLN and grade 1 (for  low values) should not be graded  or reported as an AE.  Sites

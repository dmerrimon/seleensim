    SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The changes introduced under Version 4 of the protocol (dated 28-Jan-2021) are being 
made to  increase study enrollment to more accurately reflect the expected frequency of 
evaluable subjects  and update the statistical methods  to more accurately reflect the 
planned statistical analys es.

Determination of sample 
size 
Sentences 1 and 2  Revised:  
Data from 34 patients provides 9095.6% power to detect a 
statistically significant difference between the treatment 
groups in the primary endpoint (percent change from baseline in EASI scores). This power calculation is based upon a 1-
sided treatment contr ast within a [ADDRESS_193128] ANOVA model and  
assumes group means of 65% and 20% for ATI-1777 and 
vehicle, respectively.  
Protocol Summary –  
Statistical methods  
Efficacy Analyses Revised:  
All efficacy summaries will be conducted on both the FAS 
and PP populations. All p -values for efficacy will be based on 
a 1-sided hypothesis test of the superiority of ATI-1777 to 
vehicle. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the treatment 
comparison betw een ATI -1777 and vehicle for the percent 
change from baseline in EASI scores at Week 4. This 
treatment comparison will be made within the context of a 
Mixed Model Repeated Measures analysis where the EASI 
scores over time are treated as repeated measures w ithin a 
given patient. Treatment group, time (study visit), and treatment by [CONTACT_166516], baseline EASI score and/or baseline 
severity of AD will be included as a continuous covariate, and 
patient ID will en ter the model as a random effect. Treatment 
group model -based means and model -based differences in 
treatment groups will be provided along with corresponding 
9590% confidence intervals and 1- sided  p-values.  
Treatment comparisons between ATI -1777 and vehic le for 
each of the continuous efficacy endpoints that are conducted over time (Change in IGA, BSA, and PP- NRS) will be 
analyzed using a similar model as described for the primary 
endpoint. Treatment comparisons will be made for each post -

logistic regression model will include treatment group as a 
factor and the baseline value and/or baseline severity of AD 
as a covariate. Model- based point estimates for the treatment 
proportions will be provided as well as model-based 
differences and corresponding 9590 % confidence intervals 
and 1- sided  p-values.

based upon a 1-sided treatment contrast within a 1-way 
ANOVA model and  assumes group means of 65% and 20% 
for ATI -1777 and vehicle, respectively. The group means 
were based upon slightly more conservative estimates than 
were observed in a Phase 2 study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_166457] (Kim et al 2020b ). The variance for the percent change from 
baseline in EASI was assumed to be 38.3%. This variance assumption was based upon data observed in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166458]-502 (ATI-502- AD-201). 
Section 9.4.5  – Treatment 
Period Revised:  
All efficacy summaries will be conducted on both the FAS 
and PP populations. All p -values for efficacy will be based on 
a 1-sided hypothesis test of the superiority of ATI-1777 to 
vehicle. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the treatment 
comparison between ATI -1777 and vehicle for the percent 
change from baseline in EASI scores at Week 4 based on the FAS. This treatment comparison will be made within th e 
context of a Mixed Model Repeated Measures analysis where 
the EASI scores over time are treated as repeated measures 
within a given patient. Treatment group, time (study visit), 
and treatment by [CONTACT_166517], baseline EASI score and/or baseline 
severity of AD will be included as a continuous covariate and 
patient ID will enter the model as a random effect. Treatment group model -based means and model -based differences in 
treatment groups will be provided along with corresponding 
9590% confidence intervals and 1- sided  p-values.  
Treatment comparisons between ATI -1777 and vehicle for 
each of the continuous efficacy endpoints that are conducted 
over time (change in IGA, BSA, and PP- NRS) will be 
analyzed using a similar model as described for the primary endpoint. Treatment comparisons will be made for each post-
baseline scheduled visit utilizing an appropriate analysis 
window scheme.  
Treatment group comparisons for categorical efficacy 
endpoints (IGA Response, EA SI-50, EASI-75, and EASI-90) 
that are conducted over time will employ a logistic regression model fit at each scheduled visit separately, where 
appropriate. The logistic regression model will include 
treatment group as a factor and the baseline value and/or 
baseline severity of AD as a covariate. Model -based point 
estimates for the treatment proportions will be provided as

Pharmacokinetics 
A sparse sampling approach will be employed because it is not anticipated that clinically relevant plasma 
concentrations will be observed.  A total of 8 PK samples will be collected from each patient.  
One sample will be collected before study medication application,  and 1 sample will be collected 
approximately 2 hours after application on each of Days 1, 8, and 15.  
Samples for Day 28 will be collected from 3 subgroups of patients within each of the specified time 
windows as follows:  
• Subgroup 1: One sample predose and one sample at 0.[ADDRESS_193140] application  
• Subgroup 2: One sample at 2.[ADDRESS_193141] 2 hours later  
• Subgroup 3: One sample at [ADDRESS_193142] 2 hours later (prior to the subs equent application)  
Statistical methods: Details of all statistical summaries will be provided in the study -specific statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Determination of sample size: 
Data from 34 patients provides 95.6% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the 
treatment groups in the primary endpoint (percent change from baseline in EASI scores). This power calculation is based upon a 1-sided treatment contrast within a 1-way ANOVA model and assumes group 
means of 65% and 20% for ATI -1777 and vehicle, respectively. The group means were based upon 
slightly more conservative estimates than were observed in a Phase 2 study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_166466]. 
The variance for the percent change from baseline in EASI was assumed to be 38.3%. This variance assumption was based upon data observed in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166467] -502 (ATI-
502-AD-201).  
Analysis populations : 
• Full Analysis  Set (FAS) : All patients who have been randomized and administered at least one 
dose of study medication. The efficacy analyses  will be conducted on the FAS population as 
randomized ; the safety analyses and summaries will be conducted on the FAS as treated.

 Confidential   
    • Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  All patients who have non- missing  Week  4 EASI scores 
recorded. The PP population will be analyzed as treated.  
• PK Population:  All patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_193143] 
1 plasma concentration value.  
Analysis methods:  
All data will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean,  
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, and 
counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables. Baseline is defined as the last 
non-missing measurement before or on the date of first administration of study medication.  
Efficacy Analyses : 
All efficacy summaries will be conducted on both the FAS and PP populations. All p -values for efficacy 
will be based on a 1-sided hypothesis test of the superiority of ATI -1777 to vehicle.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be the treatment comparison between ATI -1777 and vehicle for the 
percent change from baseline in EASI scores at Week 4. This treatment comparison will be made within the context of a Mixed Model Repeated Measures analysis  where the EASI scores over time are treated 
as repeated measures within a given patient. Treatment group , time (study visit), and treatment by [CONTACT_166520] s, baseline EASI score and/or baseline severity of 
AD will be included as a continuous covariate , and patient ID will enter the model as a random effect. 
Treatment group model -based means and model -based differences in treatment groups will be provided 
along with corresponding 90% confidence intervals and  1-sided  p-values.  
Treatment comparisons between ATI -1777 and vehicle for each of the continuous efficacy endpoints that 
are conducted over time (Change in IGA, BSA, and PP -NRS) will be analyzed using a similar model as 
described for the primary endpoint. Tr eatment comparisons will be made for each post -baseline 
scheduled visit utilizing an appropriate analysis window scheme.  
Treatment group comparisons for categorical efficacy endpoints (IGA Response, EASI -50, -75, and -90) 
that are conducted over time will  employ a logistic regression model fit at each scheduled visit 
separately, where appropriate. The logistic regression model will include treatment group as a factor and the baseline value and/or baseline severity of AD  as a covariate. Model -based point es timates for the 
treatment proportions will be provided as well as model -based differences and corresponding 90% 
confidence intervals and 1-sided p-values. 
Safety Analyses : 
The FAS will be used for the analysis of safety data (AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical 
examination results, and ECG s). AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities  (MedDRA) . TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset dates on or after the date of first 
administration of study medication and before the end of the study, or that exist prior to the first dose and worsen with dosing.  TEAEs  will be presented by [CONTACT_166521]. Patients  with multiple AEs will be counted only once within each preferred term and system 
organ class. Key patient information for patients with an AE with an outcome of death, patients with SAEs , and patients with an AE leading to discontinuation of study medica tion will be listed.  
Laboratory data (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be converted to Système International units for reporting and processing purposes. Absolute values and changes from baseline will be presented descriptive ly. Laboratory data outside study- specific reference ranges will be 
listed. Vital signs and ECG  parameters will be presented descriptively.  
Plasma Drug Concentrations  
Plasma concentrations of ATI -1777 will be summarized by [CONTACT_166522].

    1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Atopic Dermatitis  
AD is a chronic, relapsing pruritic inflammatory skin disease involving inflammation 
and skin barrier defects in relation to environmental stimuli ( Hanifin et al 2001; Rajka 
and Langeland 2020; Tanei et al 2020). It is currently estimated that 10 % to 30% of 
children and 0.3% to 14% of adults in developed countries are affected by [CONTACT_166523] 
(Kim et al 2 020a ; Montillo et al 2019; Napolitano et al 2020 ). AD has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_166468] (age <2 years), childhood (age 2 to 12 years), and 
adolescent/adult (>12 years, but not over middle age) types according to patient age and 
characteristics of typi[INVESTIGATOR_166469]; most recently, a newly defined subgroup of elderly patients (≥60 years) was added into the classification system (
Tanei et al 2020 ). 
The highest prevalence of AD (i .e., 95% of the cases) is in children aged under 5 years  , 
but overall, 60% of the AD cases are reported in children aged under one year ( Souta et 
al 2019). No matter what age, the disorder results in significant morbidity and adversely 
affects quality of life. Intense itching characteristic of the disease often leads to skin 
trauma and significant sleep disturbances ( Kapur et al 2018).  
1.1.2 Current Treatments  
Current pharmacological approaches for treatment of AD aim to reduce inflammation, eradicate infections induced by [CONTACT_166524], reduce pruritic symptoms, 
and prevent eczema propagation ( Souta et al 2019 ). Behavioral management to reduce 
exposure with antigen sources from pollens, mite dust, traffic or tobacco smoke, volatile 
organic compounds, and animal fur is recommended. Frequent bathing to remove 
surface allergens and use of moisturizers is also an integral part of managing AD and can reduce disease severity.  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for AD include corticosteroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_166470]), calcineurin inhibitors (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), a phosphodiesterase- 4 (PDE -4) inhibitor (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) , and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (systemic), a humanized 
monoclonal antibody that blocks signaling of interleukin (IL) -4/IL-13.  
Corticosteroids are available for treatment of AD by [CONTACT_166525]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_166471]- line in 
pharmacologic treatment of AD for those individuals who have failed to respond to good skin care and regular use of emollients alone. Systemic steroids for treatment of AD are not recommended by [CONTACT_166526]. Although corticosteroid 
use may result in rapid disease improvement, skin lesions commonly recur with worse 
severity on discontinuation. In addition, corticosteroids carry the risk of hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] - adrenal axis suppression, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid 
insufficiency.

    Two non-steroid topi[INVESTIGATOR_166472] a PDE-4 
inhibitor. The FDA-approved calcineurin inhibitors include tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, 
tacrolimus 0.03% ointment, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] 1% cream. These treatments are 
considered second-line agents for the management of AD flares. They are intended for short-term use and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate AD in non-
immunocompromised adults and children [ADDRESS_193156] failed to 
respond adequately to other topi[INVESTIGATOR_73200], or when those treatments are not advisable. The PDE-4 inhibitor, crisaborole 2% ointment, is approved for mild to moderate AD.  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the shared alpha subunit of IL-[ADDRESS_193157]- line systemic treatment for moderate  or 
severe AD in adults. Phototherapy may also be an option for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. However, phototherapy may require frequent in- office visits (e.g., 
several times a week). Risks from phototherapy may vary according to the type of 
phototherapy and may include actinic damage, sunburn-like reactions (erythema, 
tenderness, pruritus), skin cancer (nonmelanoma and melanoma), and cataracts.  
Additional to the FDA-approved treatments specific for AD, systemic 
immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine, ciclosporin, methotrexate, and mycophenolate 
mofetil), antihistamines , and antimicrobials are used in common practice. 
Although there are FDA-approved products for the treatment of AD, there is a role for 
additional efficacious drug products with acceptable safety profiles. 
1.1.3 Janus Kinase Inhibitors for Treatment of Atopic D ermatitis  
Lesional skin from patients with AD contains elevated levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines and cellular infiltrates of CD4+ T cells that propagate disease pathophysiology 
(Howe ll et al 2019; Rodriques and Torres 2020). The cytokine microenvironment in AD 
appears complex, with patients presenting with different cytokine signatures at different 
stages of the disease ( Solimani et al 2019 ). The Janus kinase ( JAK) family of signal 
transducers presents itself as an advantageous treatment target since a variety of 
cytokines exert their biological effects through the JAK–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. The JAK family comprises 4 cytoplasmic  tyrosine 
kinases: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 , and TYK2; there are 7 STAT proteins: STAT 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5a, 5b, and 6. The JAK-STAT signaling molecules interact downstream of numerous cytokines involved in the autoimmune and inflammatory responses. AD  is driven 
particularly by [CONTACT_125433]- 4, IL -13, IL -15, and interferon gamma. All of these 
cytokines are largely regulated by [CONTACT_166527]1 and JAK3. As such, inhibitors of these [ADDRESS_193158] on filaggrin expression ( Amano et al 2015).  
The efficacy of orally administered JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib (J AK1/2 ; 
Guttman -Yassky et al 2019), upadacitinib (JAK1; Guttman -Yassky et al 2020) and 
abrocitinib (JAK1; Gooderham et al 2019 ), and topi[INVESTIGATOR_166473] : Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

    (JAK1/3 ; Bissonnette et al 2016) in Phase [ADDRESS_193159] confirmed the potential for 
both oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_166474] w ith JAK inhibitors ( Alves de Medeiros et al 
2016; Bissonnette et al 2016; Eyerich and Novak 2013; Levy et al 2015), none are 
currently approved by [CONTACT_1622]. However, further adding to proof of concept, topi[INVESTIGATOR_166475] (Corectim
®), a pan -JAK inhibitor, was recently approved in Japan for 
treatment of adult patients with AD ( Dhillon 2020).

1.1.5 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical development program for ATI-1777 inclu ded dermal penetration, 
pharmacokinetic ( PK), and toxicity studies following topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407], i.e., the 
intended route of administration. The intravenous PK of ATI -1777 was characterized by 
a mono- exponential pattern of elimination with a mean elimination  half-life of <1  hour. 
Consistent with its rapid clearance and short half-lives in vivo, metabolism of ATI-1777 
in vitro was rapid in liver microsomes from various nonclinical species and human ( half-
life for loss of parent compound was ≤30 minutes) and was rapid to moderate in 
hepatocytes from these same species (half -life for loss of parent compound ranged from 
13.5 to 54.6 minutes). Oral bioavailability of ATI -1777 was low. Oral dose escalation 
studies confirmed increased systemic exposure with increasin g dose, and generally 
higher exposure in female than male rats.  Importantly, systemic exposure to ATI-1777 
was negligible following topi[INVESTIGATOR_166479] 1/3 in human whole blood (~45 ng/mL). Details on the systemic (intravenous and oral) PK and absorption, distribution, and metabolism 
profile of ATI-1777 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB ). 
Seven -day and 28- day repeat -dose oral toxicity studies  in rat s demonstrated that 
ATI-1777 was well tolerated at levels up to 600 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day,

Protocol Version and Date : Version 4, 28-Jan-[ADDRESS_193162] level s (NOAEL s) were  considered to 
be equal to or greater than the maximum doses administered in each study. 
Following once daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_118180]-1777 for 28 or 29 days at doses up 
to 160 mg/day in male and female minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], no ATI-1777- related effects were noted . 
Thus, the NOAEL was considered to be 160 mg/day. This dose level corresponded to 
mean maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) and area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve ( AUC ) values of 3.77 ng/mL and 23.5 ng•h/mL, respectively, 
in males and 1.99 ng/mL and 10.7 ng•h/mL, respectively, in females on Day 28 of the dosing phase and dermal ATI-1777 concentrations of 9150 to [ZIP_CODE] ng/g in abraded 
skin biopsies and 13,100 to 99,800 ng/g in non-abraded skin biopsies at the completion of dosing.

1.[ADDRESS_193164] -in-human study is being conducted as a preliminary assessment  of the efficacy 
and the safety and tolerability of ATI-1777 in adult patients with moderate or severe AD and to examine the potential for ATI-1777 systemic exposure. The study seeks to 
demonstrate that efficacy can be achieved, using a tolerated topi[INVESTIGATOR_166480]-1777 without systemic levels that exceed the 50% inhibitory concentration ( IC
50) 
for inhibition of JAK 1/3 in human whole blood (i.e., ~45 ng/mL). 
The study is being conducted in the target population because of the potential for differences in absorption of ATI-1777 through the skin of patients with AD compared with that of healthy volunt eers. 
The 2% w/w concentration was chosen based on repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic 
studies in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], which showed a topi[INVESTIGATOR_166481] ≥160 mg/day. 
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
This is a first -in human study and there is no previous clinical experience with 
ATI-1777. More detailed information about the anticipated benefits and risks can be 
found in the IB.

    1.3.1 Potential Benefits  
It is anticipated that treatment with ATI -1777 will result in a clinically significant 
improvement in AD. T opi[INVESTIGATOR_166482] (JAK1/3 ; Bissonnette et al 
2016) and ruxolitinib ( JAK 1/2; Kim  et al 2020a ) in Phase [ADDRESS_193165] recently 
encouraging Phase 3 efficacy and safety data following topi[INVESTIGATOR_166483] ( Incyte Press Release 2020 ) in clinical trials in patients with AD provides 
proof of concept for this approach. 
1.3.[ADDRESS_193166] labels for JAK 
inhibitors approved in oral dose forms for indications other than AD. Tofacitinib, 
upadacitinib, and baricitinib are approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; 
tofacitinib is also approved for the treatm ent of psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis; 
and ruxolitinib  is approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. 
ATI-1777 is designed to be metabolically labile with limited systemic exposure  to 
minimize these systemic toxicities . There were n o ATI -1777- related dermal or systemic 
effects observed following repeated daily dermal applications to minipi[INVESTIGATOR_166484] 28 days, 
where little or no quantifiable systemic exposure was observed. Effects observed after repeated oral administration of ATI -1777 to rats , which achieved substantial and dose-
related sy stemic exposure to ATI -1777, were considered to represent a spectrum of  
clinical effects  known to be associated with oral JAK inhibitors. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections 
Serious infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other 
opportunistic pathogens have been reported with orally administered JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitors. Patient s with evidence of active, chronic,  or latent infections  or history of 
serious local skin infections or tuberculosis at the Screening Visit will be excluded from 
this study. Infections will be monitored during the study and will be reported as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Viral Reactivation  
Viral reactivation and herpes zoster have been observed in clinical studies with 
tofacitinib and upadacitinib. Patients who screen positive for HIV  (antibody), hepatitis B 
or C, patient s with h erpes zoster or cytomegalovirus infections that resolved less than 
2 months prior to the Screening Visit , and patient s with a history of frequent outbreaks 
(defined as 4 or more outbreaks a y ear) of herpes simplex virus will be excluded from 
this study. Viral infections and activations will be monitored during the study and will 
be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancies 
Malignancies were observed in clinical studies with baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib , 
and ruxolitinib. Patient s with a history of, or current or suspected systemic or cutaneous 
malignancy and/or lymphoproliferative disease within the 5 years prior to the study will

    be excluded from the study. Malignancies will be monitored during the study and will be 
reported as AE s. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombosis 
Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial 
thrombosis, some fatal, have occurred in patients treated with baricitinib and 
upadacitinib. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis will be monitored during the study 
and thromboses will be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytopenias 
Cytopenias (lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) have been 
reported after chr onic oral dosing with commercially available JAK1/JAK2 and 
pan-JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib, upadacitinib, and tofacitinib. Treatment with 
ATI-1777 should be avoided in patients with cytopenias. Patient s with laboratory values 
indicative of cytopenias will be excluded from the study. Cytopenias will be monitored 
during the study and reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver Enzyme Elevations  
Liver enzyme elevations were observed in patients receiving oral JAK1/JAK3 inhibitors. 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes AST or ALT ≥2 × the upper limit of normal 
[ULN] ) at the Screening Visit will be excluded from study participation. Routine 
monitoring of liver parameters will be conducted throughout the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lipid Parameters 
Treatment with JAK1/JAK3 inhibitors has been associated with increases in lipid 
parameters including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL -C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C). Lipid parameters will be 
evaluated throughout the study. 
1.3.3 Benefits and Risks Conclusion  
Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to patient s participating in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with ATI-1777 are justified by [CONTACT_166529] s with AD.

Protocol Version and Date : Version 4, 28-Jan-[ADDRESS_193167]-in-human, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, 
vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of 
ATI-1777 solution following twi ce-daily applications to target areas  of male and female 
patient s, aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, with moderate  or sever e AD. All AD lesions in 
protocol allowed areas should be treated. The study will be conducted at approximately 15 sites in the (US). 
The study will consist of a  Screening Period of up to 30 days, a  4-week  Treatment 
Period, and a 2- week  follow-up period. The maximum total duration of the study for 
patient s remaining in the study until their final follow-up assessment will be  73 days.  
A study schematic is provided in Figure 1 and a Schedule of Events is provided in 
Table
 1. 
4.1.1 Screening Period  
The investigator will obtain  a signed ICF from the patient  before any study procedures 
are performed. For further details regarding the informed consent process, see Section 
10.3. Patient s will undergo screening evaluations within  30 days of Day 1 to determine 
study eligibility  (see Section  5). All the results of the screening evaluations  should be 
available at the time that patient  eligibility is reconfirmed prior to dosing. 
The investigator will maintain a screening log to recor d details of all participants 
screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Certain procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). 
At the end of the Screening Period, participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will enter the Treatment Period.  
4.1.2 Treatment Period  
A total of approximately 50 patient s who meet all the entry criteria will be randomized 
on Day 1 via an interactive voice/ web response system  (IXRS) to ATI -1777 or vehicle 
treatment  in a 1:1 ratio . Patient s will be stratified  at randomization  by [CONTACT_166530] 
(moderate versus severe).  The study is randomized and double-blinded with regard to 
ATI-[ADDRESS_193168]. The investigator, site personnel, the sponsor, and their representatives involved in monitoring and conducting the study, and the patient s will be 
blinded to the study medication administered. See Section 7.3 for further details on the

    method of assigning patient s to the treatment groups, and Section 7.2 for details on 
access to the treatment codes in the event of emergency unblinding. 
During the T reatment Period, patient s will apply study drug (ATI-1777 topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 
2.0% w/w or vehicle) twice daily for [ADDRESS_193169] 24 hours after drug administration. 
During treatment, patient s will attend  weekly study visits. At the study visits, AE 
collection, physical examinations, clinical disease assessment s (EASI, IGA, BSA, and 
PP-NRS), vital sign assessments, PK evaluations, and clinical laboratory evaluations 
will be performed as detailed in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). Patients will complete 
a daily diary recording their dose administration and PP-NRS itch score during the study. 
For all study participants, blood samples will be collected for PK analysis according to 
the sparse sampling approach described in Section  6.4. 
Participants who discontinue study medication earlier than Day [ADDRESS_193170] an Early 
Termination (ET) Visit at the time of study medication discontinuation and will return for a PTFU  Visit, 2 weeks (± 3 days) after the Day 28/ ET Visit  (see Table 1). 
4.1.3 Follow-up Period 
Participants will return 2 weeks  (± 3 days) after the  Day 2 8/ET Visit for a PTFU  Visit 
(see Table 1). 
4.1.[ADDRESS_193171] 4 to 8 patients will c ontinue in the study according to the Schedule of Events in

    4.2 Unscheduled Visits  
If a patient experiences an AE at any time during the study, they m ay attend an 
unscheduled visit in consultation with the investigator for evaluation and possible 
treatmen t of the event. Assessments may be collected at the discretion of the 
investigator. In the event of a concern with an AE /SAE , an unscheduled visit can be 
conducted and the following assessments may be performed as needed: vital signs , 
ECG, physical examination, laboratory assessments , PK samples, EASI, IGA, BSA, PP -
NRS, and photography. If it is determined during an unscheduled visit that a patient will 
discontinue the study, all assessments for Day 28/ET  (see Table 1) should be completed . 
4.3 Discussion of Study Design  
The efficacy parameters being evaluated (EASI, BSA, IGA, and PP- NRS ) are widely 
used and well -recognized  indicators of the disease state of AD.  A randomized, 
double-blind, vehicle- controlled  design is being employed to mitigate bias in the 
collection and analysis of efficacy data. 
Although this is a first -in-human study, the study is being conducted in the target 
population because of the potential for differences in absorption of ATI-[ADDRESS_193172] only minimal or no  systemic exposure. 
The 2% w/w concentration was chosen based on nonclinical toxicity and PK studies in 
repeat -dose rat and minipig models, which showed a NOAEL  of 300 mg/kg/day. 
4.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
4.4.1 Individual Patient Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A patient will stop treatment with investigational agent if one or combination of the following occurs during the study: 
• An infection which meets the criteria as a study medication- related SAE  
• A deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary e mbolism  
• Lymphoma 
• Hy’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
Treatment with study medication should be temporarily interrupted in the event of 
severe AEs considered related to study medication, or in the event of one or more of the 
abnormal laboratory values in Table 5.

transparent reporting of screen failure patient s, to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  
5.3.1 Retestin g During Screening  
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in the screening procedures (Table 1) may be repeated during the Screening Period in consultation with the 
sponsor’s medical monitor. Retesting will be allowed when the significance of a laboratory result is unclear and the retest will help interpretation and decision making for entry to the study. Retesting will not be undertaken when the laboratory results clearly indicate clinically significant disease that could impact study interpretation or the safety of a study subject during participation. 
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by [CONTACT_166531] i nclusion will

o 3×ULN with total bilirubin >2 ×ULN or symptoms of hepatocellular injury 
[fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%)]. 
• Any patient  who develops any of the following ECG findings during the active 
treatment phase will be instructed to stop study medication and will be withdrawn from the study:  
o Clinically significant rhythm disturbance other than sinus rhythm or ectopic 
supraventricul ar rhythm (ectopic atrial rhythm).  
o Clinically significant conduction disturbance including PR >240 msec, pre-excitation (delta wave and PR <120  msec), second degree or higher 
atrioventricular  block .  
o New finding of QRS >120  ms (if not present at the Screening Visit. For example, 
patient s with Right Bundle Branch Block at screening would not need to be 
withdrawn from the study if their subsequent ECGs remained unchanged).

new medical issue of concern . 
In addition, patient s should discontinue study medication if any of the following occurs:  
1. The patient  withdraws his/her consent to participate in the study. 
2. The patient  develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued 
participation in the study. 
3. The patient  is noncompliant with study procedures or medication, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574].

    If a patient is prematurely discontinued from study medication, the patient  may remain 
in the stu dy. T he patient  should complete the assessments outlined for each study visit ; 
see Table 1. The patient  should also attend the PTFU Visit.  
Every effort will be made to ensure that patient s who prematurely discontinue study 
medication  complete the study. 
Patient s who discontinue study medication prematurely will no t be replaced.  
Patient s are permitted to temporarily discontinue and restart study medication .  
5.4.2 Premature Discontinuation from the Study  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A patient  has the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason, without any reprisal. 
At the time of premature study discontinuation, the investigator should make every 
effort to ensure the patient completes the assessments indicated at the Day 28/ET Visit  
and completes the PTFU Visit approximately 14 days after the ET Visit; see Table 1. 
The only exception to this requirement is when consent is withdrawn for all study procedures or the participant loses the ability to consent freely (e.g., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If a patient  withdr aws consent to participat e in the study, the study monitor/sponsor will 
be informed immediately. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient  should 
remain under the supervision of the investigator until satisfactory health has returned. 
If the patient  withdraws consent for disclosure of further information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any collected data before such a withdrawal of consent. If a 
patient  withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
Although a patient  is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely 
from a study, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), 
while fully respecting the patient 's rights. 
Patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study cannot subsequently rejoin the 
study.

    6 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Refer to Table 1 for the schedule of assessments.  
6.1 Demographics and Other Screening Assessments  
Safety assessments that are also part of the screening assessments are described in 
Section 6.3. 
6.1.1 Medical History  
Medical history, including any ongoing illnesses, will be recorded in the eCRF, with the start date and stop date (if applicable) of the illness/condition. Medical history wi ll be 
collected at the Screening Visit and updated, if necessary,  on Day [ADDRESS_193185] 
administration of study medication . 
6.1.2 Demographics 
Demographic data, including year of birth/age, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded in the e CRF.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_193186]  
An interferon  gamma release assay/QuantiFERON Tuberculosis Gold T est for 
active/latent tuberculosis will be performed at the Screening Visit . The test will be 
provided by [CONTACT_2237]. 
Patient s who demonstrate evidence of latent tuberculos is infection (positive 
QuantiFERON Tuberculosis Gold Test) will only be allowed to participate in the study 
if there is documented evidence of a completed adequate treatment course for latent tuberculosis and if active tuberculosis is excluded per the inve stigator’s judgment.  
In case of indeterminate results, the test may be repeated once. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_193187] a 
nasopharyngeal (preferred) or oropharyngeal swab collected prior to the first dose of study medication to test for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The sample will be sent to  the study’s central lab for analysis by [CONTACT_166534] ‘Detected’ or ‘Not detected’ for SARS -CoV-2 
viral particles. If central laboratory testing cannot be performed at the time of Day 1 (i.e., lab supplies are not yet available) and the study site is able to perform equivalent 
testing locally, they may choose to do so, as long as the test results are available in the patient’s research chart for sponsor review. Patients should not initiate study medication

 Confidential   
    treatment in the absence of central laboratory or locally equivalent testing being 
performed.  
Patients will be  allowed to dose with study medication in the interval between sample 
collection at Day 1 and result reporting as long as there is no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489]-19 infection or recent signi ficant exposure (close contact [<6 feet] for ≥15 
minutes) of the patient to an individual with a confirmed, active infection. 
If the patient’s results are positive for SARS -CoV-2 following sample collection at 
Day 1, the patient will be notified immediately upon receipt of the results and treatment 
with study medication will be permanently discontinued. The patient will be advised to begin self-isolation and self-monitoring procedures according to any applicable local, state, and/or federal health recommendations. Referral to an appropriate health care provider for management of the patient’s COVID-19 diagnosis should also be made. The patient should be seen for the PTFU  Visit (see Table 1) only at such time that the 
investigator assesses the risk for incidental transmission from viral shedding to be minimized. The patient’s COVID -19 diagnosis will be reported as medical history 
unless the patient’s clinical course progresses such that criterion for SAE  reporting is 
met ( see Section  8.3), in which case, all applicable safety reporting procedures will be 
followed by [CONTACT_779]. 
Sites will also have the option to perform an unscheduled test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
at any time du ring the treatment phase of the study should a patient’s clinical 
presentation necessitate it in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The same notification and referral procedures, as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, should be followed by [CONTACT_779]. However, it is expected that any COVID-19 diagnosis made from a sample collected after the initiation of study be reported as an AE  per the requirements of 
Section 8 of this protocol. 
6.1.5 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment  
Patient s’ skin type will be classified according to Fitzpatrick skin type at the Screening 
Visit as follows: 
• Type I: Pale white skin, blue/green eyes, blond/red hair.  Always sunburns, does 
not tan. 
• Type II : Fair skin, blue eyes. Burns easily, tans poorly. 
• Type III : Darker white skin. Tans after initial burn . 
• Type IV : Light brown skin. Burns minimally, tans easily . 
• Type V: Brown skin. Rarely burns, tans darkly easily. 
• Type VI: Dark brown or black skin. Never burns, always tans darkly. 
6.1.6 Lesion Photography 
Photographs of representative lesions will be taken at each study visit. Sites will be required to submit the patient’s baseline photographs to Canfield Scientific’s database.

 Confidential   
    Canfield Scientific will supply all investigational sites with study -specific camera 
equipment to photograph each patient ’s identified target AD treatment areas  (up to 2 
target locations) . Sites will be supplied with color stickers to identify each target area. 
Details regarding the use of the equipment and how to upload the photographs to the 
Canfield database will be supplied to the sites in the Photography M anual.  
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI  (Hanif in et al  2001; Rullo  et al 2008 ) assesses the extent and  severity of AD. 
This study will employ a modified EASI that excludes evaluation of the head (neck, 
scalp, face), palms of hands, soles of feet, groin, and genitalia. The modified EASI will 
evaluate AD in each of 3 body regions (trunk [excluding groin and genitalia], upper 
extremities [excluding palms of hands], and lower extremities [excluding soles of feet] ). 
The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of AD and the extent affected. If possible, the same individual should conduct the extent and severity evaluations at each visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent  
Each respective body region will be given a score between [ADDRESS_193188] ing to Table 2. Precise measurements are 
not required. 
Table 2 Extent of Atopic Dermatitis  in Each Body Region 
% Involvement  0% 1% to 9%  10-29% 30-49% 50-69% 70-89% 90-100%  
Region Score  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
For each respective body region, the severity of each of 4 signs ( erythema, 
edema/papulation, excoriation, lichenification) will be graded by [CONTACT_166535] a 0- to  3-point scale ( [0] none, [1] mild, [2] moderate, [3] severe)  
in AD- affected areas.  Half scores are allowed. The average severity across AD -affected 
areas in each body region will be used as the score for that region. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Score Calculation 
The investigator or qualified designee will enter the extent and severity  values into the 
eCRF. The f inal EASI score will then be calculated by [CONTACT_166536] 3.

Final EASI score is the sum of the 3 region scores :   
EASI = Eczema Area and Severity Index  
6.2.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment  
The IGA is the investigator’s assessment of the overall  appearance of the lesions  at a 
particular point in time. At every study visit, the investigator will assess the IGA using 
the scale in  Table [ADDRESS_193189] describes the overall appearance of 
the lesions. It is not necessary that all characteristics under Morphological Description 
be present.  In indeterminate cases, please use extent to differentiate between scores.  
For example:  
• Patient with marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked papulation, and/or marked lichenification that is limited in extent,  will be  considered “3 – Moderate”.  
The i nvestigator or qualified designee will enter the score into the eCRF. Whenever 
possible, the same individual should conduct the evaluation at each visit. 
Table 4 IGA Scoring  
Score  Morphological Description  
0 - Clear  No inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis (no erythema, no 
induration/papulation, no lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Post -inflammatory 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_22758]/or hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_22765].  
[ADDRESS_193190] clear  Barely perceptible erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and/or 
minimal lichenification. No oozing or crusting.  
2 - Mild  Slight but definite erythema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]), slight but definite induration/papulation, and/or slight but definite lichenification. No oozing or crusting.  
3 - Mode rate Clearly perceptible erythema (dull red), clearly perceptible induration/papulation, 
and/or clearly perceptible lichenification. Oozing and crusting may be present.  
4 - Severe  Marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or 
marked lichenification. Disease is widespread in extent. Oozing or crusting may 
be present.

    6.2.3 Body Surface Area  
The total percentage of the patient ’s AD-affected  BSA  will be estimated by [CONTACT_166537], which estimates that the area of a 
patient ’s full handprint (fingers and thumbs together) constitutes 1% of the ir total BSA .  
The BSA should be calculated for the EASI score using Regional Percentage Estimates as described in the study training video. 
Whenever possible, t he same evaluator  should perform the estimation at each study visit.  
If new areas of AD develop while the patient is on the study, these new areas will not be 
assessed.  
6.2.4 Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale  
The P P-NRS  (Yosipovitch et al 2019 ) is a single patient‐reported item designed to 
measure peak pruritus, or ‘worst’ itch, over the previous 24 hours based on the following 
question: ‘On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no itch” and 10 being “worst itch 
imaginable ,” how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 
24 hours?’. 
Prior to study medication application on Day 1, the stud y coordinator should show the 
PP-NRS scale to the patient, explain the scale and ask the patient to indicate which 
integer best describes the worst pruritus the subject experienced for their AD over the previous [ADDRESS_193191] in their diary each morning before 
applying study medication during the T reatment Period. 
The patient will report the diary rating to site staff at each visit, who will enter it into the 
patient’s source documents and eCRF.  
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be followed, recorded, and reported in line with the procedures described in 
Section 8. 
6.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
All labo ratory samples will be processed and shipped to the central laboratory, as 
described in the Laboratory Manual. The central laboratory will analyze the samples or send them to reference laboratory(ies) for analysis, as indicated in the manual. Refer to the central Laboratory Manual for the maximum total volume of blood to be collected 
per patient  throughout the study.

    Non-fasting blood and urine samples will be collected at the times indicated in  Table 1. 
On dosing day(s) sampling for the analysis of clinical laboratory parameters will be 
performed before the administration of study medication. 
The following parameters will be assessed:  
Hemato logy:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell ( RBC) count, RBC morphology, 
platelets, total WBC count, differential WBC count, lymphocyte count, and ANC  
Biochemistry:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, amylase, AST, blood urea nitrogen, 
bicarbonate, calciu m, chloride, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine, phosphorus, 
gamma glutamyltransferase  (GGT), glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) , lipase, 
LDL -C, HDL -C, potassium, sodium, total and direct bilirubin , TC, and triglycerides 
(TG)  
Urinalysis:  pH, specific gravity, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, blood, and protein 
Screening serology tests will be performed to assess HIV  (antibody), hepatitis C  
(antibody), hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis B core antigen antibody. For 
hepatitis B, the following tests will be done at the Screening Visit  and patient s with a 
positive result for either hepat itis B surface antigen and or hepatitis B core antigen 
antibody will be excluded from the study. 
Serum (β -human chorionic gonadotrophin) pregn ancy test ing will be performed at the 
Screening Visit , and urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the other study visits in 
the Treatment Period.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details regarding the collection, processing, and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_166490].  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. Whenever possible, the underlying cause for clinically relevant la boratory value 
should be recorded as an AE, rather than the laboratory value itself. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that  are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by [CONTACT_166538] ’s condition. 
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during the patient ’s participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_193192] dose of study 
medication  should be repeated until the values return to normal, or baseline, or are no 
longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982]. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by [CONTACT_093], then the etiology should be identified,  and the sponsor notified.

    [IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug-induced Liver Injury 
Hy’s Law cases have the following 3 components:  
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 
≥3-fold elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the placebo  
2. Among study patients showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also shows elevation of 
serum total bilirubin to >2×ULN or INR >1.5, without initial findings of cholestasis 
(elevated ALP)  
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
aminotransferase and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; evidence for biliary obstruction; acute alcoholic hepatitis (recent drinking and AST >2×ALT are supportive); recent history of severe hypotension or congestive heart failure; other underlying viral disease; pre-existing or acute liver disease; or another drug (including non-prescription products such as herbal supplements) capable of causing the observed injury  
During the study, the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient m eets 
potential drug-induced liver injury criteria at any point during the study.  
In the event that a patient shows laboratory results of:  
• AST or ALT: >5×ULN persisting for 2 weeks after study medication interruption or 
second occurrence of  >5×ULN  
• ≥ 3×ULN and (total bilirubin ≥ 2×ULN or INR >1.5)  
• ≥ 3×ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
Please refer to Appendix 4 for further information.

excluded from the study (if at the Screening Visit) or discontinued from the study ( if at 
subsequent study visits). The serum pregnancy tests will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237]; urine pregnancy tests will be analyzed locally. 
Male patient s will be required to inform the investigator if their partner becomes 
pregnant during the study.  The investigator should inform the sponsor within [ADDRESS_193195] pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to 
the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. Any pregnant patient  
or pregnant partner of a male patient and the fetus will be closely followed up 
throughout the duration of the pregnancy to determine the outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality). The investigator will ask the patient  to provide informed consent to record information 
on the health of the baby. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be required for no longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective terminatio n of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs. 
6.3.4 12-lead Electrocardiogram 
Triplic ate 12 -lead ECG s will be obtained as outlined in Table 1 using an ECG machine 
that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals.  At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG 
tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes  apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 4 minutes . 
The ECG tracing should include the date and time of the assessment and the signature [CONTACT_166566]; the tracing will be archived at the study site.

preclude examination of any of the other body systems as clinically indicated. Every effort should be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the examination for each participant at all visits throughout the study. Documentation of who performed the examination is to be recorded  in the patient source documentation.

Breaking of the blind is only allowed in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study medication is essential for the clinical management of the patient. The 
investigator must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_456]’s medical monitor prior to breaking the blind and must contact [CONTACT_86622] 1 business day after the event, 
without revealing to the sponsor (or designee ) the results of the code break, except to the 
ProPharma Group safety team . Patient s whose treatment assignments are unblinded will 
not receive any further study medication. 
Emergency unblinding will be organized through the IXRS. The investigator must record the date of unblinding and the reason. All breaks of the blind must be adequately documented in the patient’s source documentation.

7.4.1 Identification of Target Treatment Areas  
On Day 1 , the investigator will identify a target treatment area(s) that meets all inclusion 
criteria (e.g. , a diagnosis of AD based on the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka ( Hanifin and 
Rajka 1980; Appendix 3) , BSA between 3% and 20%, inclusive, and an I GA score of 3 
or 4). The target treatment area cann ot include the head (neck, scalp, face ), palms of 
hands, soles of feet, groin, or genitalia. The investigator will record the identified target 
treatment area(s) on the body map in the patient’s  source documents and give to the 
patient to take home for reference. Up to 2 target treatment areas will be photographed at each specified protocol time point ( see Table 1). Sites will use colored stickers to mark 
the treatment areas prior to the photographs being taken. 
Patient s will continue treatment of all target areas identified on Day 1, even if the 
lesion(s) have cleared. If new areas of AD develop while the patient  is on study, study 
medication may be applied to these areas . New areas should be treated at the first sign of 
disease and  continue until the Day 28 visit. New areas of treatment will be recorded in 
the source notes at the time the patient begins treating them with stud y medication.

medication and before the date o f last administration of study medication + 14 days. 
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . The event will be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such events include intensive treatment in an e mergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Definition of Terms  
Life-threatening: an AE is life -threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred , i.e., it does not include a reaction that, if it had occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death. For example, drug- induced hepatitis that 
resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening 
even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], or for procedures planned prior to the patient  
providing informed consent, or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an

 Confidential   
    AE (e .g., elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be 
considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that 
occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_85765] (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacity: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patien t’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
8.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction s 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  is defined as any AE  for which there is 
a reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the AE (where ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
medication  and the AE ), the AE is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed, and the AE  meets at least one of the criteria for 
seriousness ( see Section 8.1.2).  
8.1.4 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis abnormalities) that requir e medical or surgical intervention or lead to study 
medication  interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or 
SAE, as applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g., in ECGs, X-rays, or vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be 
recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections  8.1.1 and 8.1.2. Whenever possible, the underlying cause for clinically relevant 
laboratory value (e.g., anemia)  should be recorded as an AE, rather than the lab oratory  
value itself  (e.g., decreased hemoglobin). 
For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities, see Section  6.3.2.

• Thrombosis 
• Cytopenias

• Increased lipid parameter  AEs  (e.g., TC, LDL- C, HDL -C, TG)  
An AESI should be reported by [CONTACT_166550] . The documentation and processing of AESIs is further detailed in the investigator 
site file.  
8.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.2.1 Severity  
Sever ity grading for every AE is to be performed by [CONTACT_166551]/her 
best medical judgment as follows: 
• Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
• Moderate:  minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Severe:  medically significant; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living  
The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. The general term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a “severe”  headache). This is 
NOT the same as serious, which i s usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient ’s life or ability to function (see Section 8.1.2). A severe AE (classified as 
“severe” or “life-threatening”) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For 
example, a WBC count of 1000/mm
3 to less than 2000/mm3 is considered severe but 
may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.2.2 Causality  
Investigators are required to systematically assess the causal relationship between the AEs and SAEs and the exposure to the study medication using the following definitions: 
Related:  
• The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence to study medication administration, 
and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or other factors 
(e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). 
Sponsor Name : [CONTACT_118232], Inc.

 Confidential   
    • The AE fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence to study medication administration, 
and it is a known reaction to the drug under study or a related chemical group or is 
predicted by [CONTACT_25046]. 
Not Related:  
• The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from st udy medication 
administration, or it can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or 
other factors (e .g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant 
medications).  
A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
8.[ADDRESS_193216] study 
medication  application will be added to the patient’s medical history. Reporting of 
nonserious AEs will begin with the first application of study medication . Nonserious 
events that occur b etween receipt of informed consent and the first study medication 
application will be added to the patient’s medical history. Reporting of all AEs will 
continue through the PTFU V isit or [ADDRESS_193217] administration of study 
medication, whichever is later . 
Occurrence of AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_102] ; discovered as a 
result of general, nonleading verbal questioning by [CONTACT_5984]; or determined by [CONTACT_166552]. All AEs will be monitored and recorded in the eCRF throughout the entire study. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information (a description of the event, severity, time of occurrence [i ncluding whether the AE onset was before, 
during, or after the study medication appl ication ], duration, and any action, e.g., 
treatment /follow-up tests). The outcome of the event should be provided along with the 
investigator’s assessment of the relationship to the study medication. The investigator must also assess whether the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], 
laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE. Wherever possible, the investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documented as the AE.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the patient’s conclusion of study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including death, at any time after a patient  has been discharged from the study, and

    he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study medication or study 
participation, the investigator mu st promptly notify the sponsor. 
8.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs with an onset inside the reporting period (i.e., onset after provision of 
informed consent and up to the PTFU Visit or [ADDRESS_193218] application of study medication administration (for SAEs), whichever is later) and SAEs considered related to study medication that occur after this reporting pe riod (e .g., during poststudy follow-
up), the investigator must immediately (no later than 24  hours after becoming aware of 
the event) inform the ProPharma Group of the SAE utilizing the safety report form ( see 
SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENT CONTACT [CONTACT_7533]).  
The investigator is obliged to respond to any request for follow-up information (e.g., additional information, event outcome, final evaluation, or other records where needed) or to any question the sponsor (or designee) may hav e concerning the SAE within the 
same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_456] ( or designee ) and, as applicable, to allow 
the sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines as sociated with expedited reporting 
obligations for events of this nature. 
8.5 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow- up 
During the study (and after the End- of-Study Visit), all AEs and SAEs should be 
followed proactively by [CONTACT_166553]  a level acceptable to the investigator, until the event is otherwise explained, 
or until the patient  is lost to follow -up. At the time the patient ’s study participation ends, 
all ongoing AEs and SAEs should be evaluated for resolution. New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF  and the investigator will 
submit any updated SAE information to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 
8.6 Safety Reporting Oversight 
In accordance with ICH GCP  and 21 CFR312.32, the sponsor (or designee) will inform 
investigators of “findings that could affect adversely the safety of patients, impact the 
conduct of the trial, or alter the IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831].” 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify the FDA  about the safety of a study 
medication  under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with US  regulatory 
requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB, and 
investigators. To support compliance with these requirements, the investigator must provide requested information in a timely manner.

PK Population: All patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_193220] 1 plasma concentration value.  
9.3 Sample Size 
A total of approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in order to achieve 34 patients who complete the study. Data from 34 patient s is estimated to provide 95.6% power to detect 
a statistically significant difference  between the treatment groups in th e primary 
endpoint (percent change from baseline in EASI scores). This power calculation is based upon a 1- sided treatment contrast within a 1-way ANOVA model and assumes group 
means of 65% and 20% for ATI-1777 and vehicle, respectively. The group means we re

    based upon slightly more conservative estimates than were observed in a Phase 2 study 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_166457] ( Kim et al 2 020b). The variance for the percent change from 
baseline in EASI was assumed to be 38.3%. This variance assumption was based upon data observed in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166467]-502 (ATI -502- AD-201).  
9.4 Statistical Methods  
9.4.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is  the percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 4 . 
9.4.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints are: 
• Percent change from baseline in EASI score at each study visit  
• Proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 to 1 combined with an 
improvement of 2 or more points from baseline within 4 weeks of the start of treatment  
• Proportions of patients who achieve EASI -50, EASI-75, and EASI-90 within 4 
weeks of the start of treatment  
• Change from baseline in IGA score at each study visit 
• Change from baseline in BSA at each study visit 
• Change from baseline in PP- NRS score over time  
9.4.3 Pharmacokinetic Endpoint 
The PK endpoint is the concentration of ATI -1777 in plasma samples obtained using a 
sparse sampling approach. 
9.4.4 Safety Endpoints 
The safety endpoints are: 
• Incidence of TEAEs and SAE s 
• Laboratory values 
• Vital signs  
• Physical exami nation results 
• 12-lead ECG  results

    The primary efficacy analysis will be the treatment comparison between ATI -1777 and 
vehicle for the percent change from baseline in EASI scores at Week 4  based on the 
FAS. This treatment comparison will be made within the context of a Mixed Model 
Repeated Measures analysis where the EASI scores over time are treated as repeated 
measures within a given patient . Treatment group, time (study visit), and treatment by 
[CONTACT_166554] s, baseline EASI score and/or 
baseline s everity of AD will be included as a continuous covariate and patient  ID will 
enter the model as a random effect. Treatment group model-based means and model-based differences in treatment groups will be provided along with corresponding 90% confidence inte rvals and  1-sided  p-values.  
Treatment comparisons between ATI -1777 and vehicle for each of the continuous 
efficacy endpoints that are conducted over time (change in IGA, BSA, and PP- NRS) 
will be analyzed using a similar model as described for the primary endpoint. Treatment comparisons will be made for each post-baseline scheduled visit utilizing an appropriate analysis window scheme.  
Treatment group comparisons for categorical efficacy endpoints (IGA Response, 
EASI -50, EASI -75, and EASI -90) that are conducted over time will employ a logistic 
regression model fit at each scheduled visit separately, where appropriate. The logistic regression model will include treatment group as a factor and the baseline value and/or baseline severity of A D as a covariate. Model -based point estimates for the treatment 
proportions will be provided as well as model-based differences and corresponding 90% confidence intervals and 1-sided p- values.  
9.4.6 Analysis of Safety 
The FAS will be used for the analysis of saf ety data (AEs, clinical laboratory, vital 
signs, physical examination results, and ECGs ). 
AEs will be coded with  MedDRA . TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset dates on or 
after the date of first administration of study medication through the end of the study, or 
that exist prior to the first dose and worsen with dosing. TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_166555]. Patient s with multiple AEs 
will be counted only once within each preferred term and system organ class. Key patient  information for patient s with an AE with an outcome of death, patients with 
SAEs, and patient s with an AE leading to discontinuation of study medic ation  will be 
listed.  
Laboratory data (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) will be converted to Système International units for reporting and processing purposes. Absolute values and changes from baseline will be presented descriptively. Laboratory data outside study- specific reference ranges will be listed.  
Vital signs and ECG parameters will be presented descriptively.

and EASI-90), missing data will be treated as a non -response. Specific details regarding 
the imputation of missing data and intercurrent events will be described further  in the 
SAP.  
Patients  who prematurely discontinue the study will be evaluated based on the data 
colle cted at each visit attended. Data collected during the ET V isit will be used as an 
end-of-study assessment for these patient s. If the ET V isit was performed >[ADDRESS_193223] dose was administered, then the previous visit will be used as the end-of- study

    APPENDIX 4 - POSSIBLE HY’S LAW LIVER CHEMISTRY  
ACTION AND FOLL OW-UP ASSESSMENTS  
 
Suggested Actions and Follow -up Assessments1  
Actions  Follow -up Assessments  
• Immediately discontinue study medication.  
• Report the event to the sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours.  
• Complete a n SAE data collection tool if the 
event also met the criteria for an SAE .2 
• Perform liver chemistry follow -up 
assessments.  
• Monitor the participant until liver chemistry test abnormalities resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline (see MONITORING  below ). 
• Do n ot restart/rechallenge participant with 
study treatment unless allowed per  the 
protocol and sponsor approval is granted . 
• If restart/rechallenge is either not allowed per  
the protocol or not granted , permanently 
discontinue study treatment. The participant 
may continue in the study for any protocol -
specified follow -up assessments. 
 MONITORING:  
If ALT ≥3×ULN  AND bilirubin ≥2×ULN  or 
INR >1.5:  
• Repeat liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) and perform liver event follow -up assessments within 24 
hours.  
• Monitor participant twice weekly until liver chemistry test abnormalities resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline.  
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is 
recommended.  
 
If ALT ≥3×ULN  AND bilirubin < 2×ULN  and 
INR ≤1.5:  
• Repeat liver chemistry tests (include ALT, 
AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) and 
perform liver chemistry follow -up 
assessments within 24 to 72 hours .  
• Monitor participants weekly until liver 
chemistry abnormalities resolve, stabilize, or 
return to baseline.  • Viral hepatitis serology
3 
• Obtain INR and recheck with each liver 
chemistry assessment until the transaminases values show downward trend  
• Obtain b lood sample for ATI- 1777 drug 
concentration
4 
• Serum CPK  and lactate dehydrogenase  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2×ULN 
• Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia  
• Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of liver injury, or 
hypersensitivity, on the AE eCRF  
• Record use of concomitant medications (including acetaminophen, herbal remedies, and other over -the-counter medications) on 
the concomitant medications eCRF  
 
If ALT ≥3×ULN  AND bilirubin  ≥2× ULN or 
INR >1.5:  
• Anti- nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle 
antibody, Type 1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies, and quantitative total immunoglobulin G or gamma globulins.  
• Serum acetaminophen adduct high performance liquid chromatography assay (quant ifies potential acetaminophen 
contribution to liver injury in participants with definite or likely acetaminophen use in the preceding week  [James et al 2019 ]).

phosphokinase; eCRF  = electronic cas e report form; INR = international normalized ratio ; SAE = serious 
adverse event; ULN = upper limit of normal  
1. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, discontinue study treatment if ALT  ≥3×ULN  and bilirubin 
≥2×ULN. Additionally, if serum bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record the 
absence/presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick which is indicative of direct bilirubin 
elevations suggesting liver injury.  
2. All events of ALT ≥3×ULN and bilirubin ≥2×ULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT ≥3×ULN  and 
INR >1.5 may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’) and must be reported as an SAE 
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) . The INR measurement is not required and 
the state d threshold value will not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants.  
3. Hepatitis A immunoglobulin M  antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody; 
hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ; cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M antibody; Epstein -Barr viral capsid 
antigen immunoglobulin M antibody (or , if unavailable, heterophile antibody or monospot testing); 
and hepatitis E immunoglobulin M antibody.  
4. Drug concentration sample may not be required for participants known to be receiving placebo or 
non-comparator treatments. Record the date/time of the blood sample draw and the date/time of the 
last dose of study treatment prior to the blood sample draw in the eCRF. If the date or time of the last 
dose is unclear, provide the participant’s best approximation. If the date/time of the last dose cannot be approximated, do not obtain a blood sample. Instructions for sample handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_166512].

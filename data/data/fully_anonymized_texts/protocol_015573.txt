Purpose:  To determine the effectiveness  of the use of probiotics  in patients  with a diagnosis  of 
complicated  appendicitis on antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD).  
 
Background:  
Appendicitis is the most common urgent surgical procedure performed on children.  Approximately  
one third of the population end up having complicated appendicitis with evidence of peritoneal  
contamination and infection or abscess  requiring  the use of IV antibiotics  and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836].  
Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea (AAD) is a common complication seen in both outpatient and inpatient  
settings in approximately a third of all patients treated with antibiotics (Mantegazza, et al., 2018). In 
particular, pediatric patients experience ADD 11- 62% of the time and can up upwards to 80% in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313779] (Mantegazza, et al., 2018) . Current literature defines AAD  as three or more 
liquid  stools  per day. The causes  of AAD  are often related  to the use of multiple  antibiotics,  prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313780].  Antibiotics often disturb the normal enteric microbiome in  
the gut and allow for an increased growth of pathogens (Hojsak, 2017).  AAD can occur as late as six  
to eight weeks  after antibiotic exposure.  
 
Probiotics are defined as live microbial organisms that when administered in sufficient amounts, can 
provide a protective benefit to the host (Hojsak, 2017).  Use of probiotics in a pediatric population  
exposed to antibiotics and gastrointestinal surgery such as an appendectomy may provide a protective effect and prevent ADD (Alper, Zangwill, LaRue & Manheimer, 2017; Hayes & Vargas,  
2016).  In a meta- analysis  of randomized  controlled  trials  in pediatrics,  literature found  that treatment  
with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) reduced in risk of ADD from 23% to  9.6% (RR, 0.48; 95%  
CI, 0.26 to 0.89) (Szajewska & Kolodziej, 2015). Studies indicate it is suggested to administer LGG  
simultaneously with the initiation of antibiotic therapy, before the modification of gut microbiota and  
overgrowth of pathogens (Szajewska & Kolodziej, 2015).  
 
Lactobac illus rhanmosus GG(LGG®)(Culturelle) is an over the counter dietary supplement that can 
help to restore the balance in the gut by [CONTACT_313783]. As such, this dietary supplement is not reviewed and app roved by [CONTACT_1622]. This  
study does not intend to investigate route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor  
that significantly  increases  the risk (or decreases  the acceptability  of the risk) associated  with the use 
of the dietary  supplem ent. 
 
At Children’s  Medical  Center,  we see over 1000 cases  of appendicitis  a year with approximately  1/3 of 
those patients  being  complicated  appendicitis.  Our current  treatment  at Children’s  Medical  Center  for 
Version  2.0 
Page  3 of 6 December 1 5, 202 0  complicated appendicitis follows two pathways: 1) drainage and deferred appendectomy  
approximately  6 to 8 weeks  later or 2) immediate appendectomy.  All children are typi[INVESTIGATOR_313781] 3 to 5 days,  receive a course  of IV antibiotics  while  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313782]. There has been an increase in the number of patients  
receiving  prescribed  probiotics  after surgery.  
 
We propose  to perform  a randomized  controlled  trial where one group of patients  receive probiotic  
therapy and  another  group of patients  does  not. 
 
We hypothesize patients  given probiotics  after a diagnosis  of complicated  appendicitis  with immediate 
appendectomy who receive antibiotic treatment during their inpatient stay will  decrease the overall  
length of  stay (LOS) by  25% vs the LOS in those patients  who do not receive probiotics.  
 
3. Concise Summary  of Project:  
Upon IRB approval, patients admitted to  the pediatric surgery service with complicated appendicitis  
who undergo an immediate appendectomy will be approached about participation in the study. Once 
written  consent  has been obtained,  patients  will be randomized  into one of two potential  study  groups. 
Those randomized to the treatment group will be given probiotic therapy until discharge, while those randomized to the placebo group will be given a placebo until discharge. Data will be collected from  
the Electronic Health Record (EHR) at Children’s M edical Center will include MRN, standard  
demographics, length of stay, presence or absence of diarrhea, ambulation/activity level, abdominal  
pain, stool counts, surgical history, medications, emergency department visits and readmission rates.  
Data will be stored in a CMC/UTSW secured RedCap with access only granted to study team  
members.  
 
4. Study  Procedures:  
 
Design.  Prospective  Randomized  Controlled  Trial 
 
Sample.  
Data will be obtained  from  the electronic  health record  (EHR)  from  a convenience sample of patients  
in a single- center pediatric inpatient surgery unit with a diagnosis of complicated appendicitis that  
undergoes an immediate appendectomy.  
 
Patients  will be randomized  into two study  groups  using  randomization and utilizing  a sealed  envelope 
randomization plan. [ADDRESS_386279] sized document marked “probiotic  
treatment” and [ADDRESS_386280] sized document marked “placebo”. 240 envelopes will be thoroughly shuffled then labeled s equentially from 1- 240 in pen. Envelopes will be 
placed in a plastic container in numerical order ready for use. One group of 120 patients will be given probiotic therapy until discharge and the other group of 120 patients will be given a placebo until  
discharge 
 
Methods:  
After  the appendectomy,  patients  who meet  the inclusion  criteria  and none of the exclusion  criteria  will 
be approached by [CONTACT_313784]. Patients and families will be 
approached after their surgery  on the inpatient floor. A member of the research team will provide 
families information about the study in their preferred language (English/Spanish). A  consent  will be 
signed and  scanned into to the patient’s  medical  record.  
 
Those who are in agreeance w ill be consented for the study following all IRB procedures.  
Randomization will be used  to allocate patients  into treatment  and control  group.  The treatment  group 
includes [ADDRESS_386281] of care for complicated appendicitis patients includes: ceftriax one 
RTA 50mg/kg  dose  every  24 hours  x 7 days  and metronidazole RTA 30mg/kg  dose  every  24 hours  x7 
days.  In patients  with a sensitivity  to ceftriaxone,  metronidazole RTA 30mg/kg  dose  every  24 hours  x7 
days  and ciprofloxacin  10-15 mg/kg every 8 hours x 7 days will be administered.  
Treating  medical  team  and patients/family  will be blinded  to whether  patient  is on probiotic  or placebo.  
Data will be collected  as stated  in section titled, “Concise Summary  of Project.”  
5. Criteria  for Inclusion  of Subjects:  
• Patients  with a post-operative diagnosis  of complicated  appendicitis  who undergo  an 
immediate appendectomy.  
• Patients  between the ages  of 4 and 18 years  of age. 
 
6. Criteria  for Exclusion  of Subjects:  
• Patients  diagnosed  with a complicated  appendicitis  with deferred  appendectomy  or non- 
perforated appendicitis  
• Patients  that have a history  of being  immunosuppressed,  on immunosuppression therapy,  or 
long-term steroid  therapy within the last month.  
• Patients  that have central  line access.  
• Patients  under  4 years  of age. 
• Patients  that are developmentally  delayed  and cannot  ambulate at baseline.  
• Patients  with significant  past medical  history.  
• Patients  that are in Child  Protective  Services  custody.  
• Patients  that are incarcerated.  
• Patients  that are pregnant.  
• Patients  that speak  languages  other  than English  and Spanish.

7. Sources of Research  Material:  
Version  2.0 
Page  5 of 6 December 1 5, 202 0  All participants will be patients under the care of the General Surgery Department. Information from  
the Children’s Medical Center EHR will be reviewed. Data on outcomes such as length of stay,  
presence or absence of diarrhea, ambul ation/activity level, abdominal pain, surgical history,  
medications,  emergency  department  visits,  readmission rates  and stool  counts  will be extracted  from  
medical  records.  Standard  demographic data  will also  be obtained.  
 
8. Recruitment  Methods  and Consenting  Process:  
After confirmed complicated appendicitis diagnosis, patients and families will be approached by [CONTACT_313785].  If families  agree to participate,  written  consent  will be obtained,  
and the patient  will be  randomized to  a study group.  
 
9. Potential  Risks:  
Inadvertent  disclosure  of personal  medical  information.  Special  precautions  are mentioned  below  in 
the paragraph Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality . 
 
There are potential  risks  for patients  taking  probiotics.  There have been reported  accounts  of sepsis  in 
immunosuppressed patients receiving probiotics. Our study will exclude patients with a history of  
being  immunosuppressed,  on immunosuppression therapy,  or long-term steroid  therapy  within  the last 
month.  
 
There is a potential  risk of psychological  stress.  Some  of the questions  we will ask may make the 
patient/legal  guardians  feel uncomfortable.  
 
10. Subject  Safety  and Data Monitoring:  
All data will be stored  on a password  protected  computer  approved by [CONTACT_313786].  Access  to 
study data will be  restricted  to authorized  study personnel only.  
 
All data will be stored  on a password  protected  computer  in a RedCap  system  approved by [CONTACT_313787].  Access to  study  data will  be restricted  to authorized study  personnel  only.  
 
The Principal Investigators and faculty sponsor will review all patient outcomes on a monthly basis.  
All adverse events,  expected  and unexpected  will be reviewed  within  24 hours  by [CONTACT_313788].  
 
11. Procedures to Maintain  Confidentiality:  
All patient information and case report forms will be kept in a locked office with limited access. All  
computer files will be password protected, encrypted and stored on a secure server. Access will be 
limited to study team members only. Data will be collected and stored in a secured CMC server in RedCap.  The case report includes a unique subject number. The data will be collected, analyzed,  
and archived following strict confidentiality guidelines. The Investigator will consider all information,  
results,  discoveries,  records  accumulated,  records  acquired,  or deductions  in the course  of the study  
as confident ial; other than that information to  be disclosed by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
12. Potential  Benefits:  
There may be benefit to those patients who receive a probiotic during their course of treatment in a 
reduction of the incidence of AAD.  Future patients  may benefit  if the protocol  proven  to be effective in 
decreasing the incidence of AAD.  
 
13. Sample size calculation  
Based  on the patient  population  in Children’s  Medical  Center  Dallas,  the mean and standard  deviation 
of LOS is 114 and 75.6 hours, respectively. The LOS in the probiotic group is expected to be 75% of  
the control group. With [ADDRESS_386282] 83% of power to detect statistically  
significant difference in LOS between the probiotic group and control  group.  
Version  2.[ADDRESS_386283] from the treatment, regression analysis will be used to model log - 
transformed LOS. The independent variable will be treatment type and prognostic factors. The 
statistical  analyses  were performed  with SAS 9.4.

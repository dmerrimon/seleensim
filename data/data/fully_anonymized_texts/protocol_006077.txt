ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 1 PRÉCIS  
Objective:  Von Hippel -Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder in 
which multiple benign and malignant neoplasms and cysts of specific histopathologies develop in 
the kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] c ord, eye, inner ea r, epi[INVESTIGATOR_511511]. The disease affects about 7,000 individuals in the [LOCATION_002]. Retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_511512] (RCH) are the most common and often the earliest manifestation of VHL disease 
and may lead to significant vision loss. In some  such eyes, inexorable progression of RCH leads 
to blindness and phthisis bulbi despi[INVESTIGATOR_301586].  Levels of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), a potent mediator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability, have been shown to 
be elevated i n multiple cell types deficient in the VHL protein (pVHL).  
Platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF), which has an important role in stabilization of immature 
new vessels during angiogenesis, is upregulated in pVHL -defective cell lines and expressed in 
other pVHL -defective tumors. Anti -VEGF therapy alone had no beneficial effect on ocular VHL 
disease in two previous phase [ADDRESS_661557], in participants w ith severe 
ocular VHL disease.  
Study Population:  Three participants with severe ocular VHL  disease  will receive the 
combination investigationa l treatment in one eye and will be followed for 104 weeks.  
Design:  In this phase I/II, single -center, prospective, open label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, 
single group trial, one eye of eligible participants will be treated with investigational products , 
E10030, a PDGF -B antagonist , and ranibizumab, a  VEGF -A antagonist. Participants will receive 
combination investigational treatment consisting of intravitreal injections of E10030 (1.5 mg in 
0.05 mL) and ranibizumab (0.5 mg in 0.05 mL) every four weeks fr om baseline through  
Week  16 (totaling five treatments)  and then every eight weeks through Week  48 (totaling nine 
treatments from baseline) . All participants will be followed for 104 weeks.  
Outcome Measures:  The primary outcome for the study will be safety  of the combination 
investigational treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_511554]  (AE)  reported through 
Week  52. Secondary outcomes will include  tabulation of AEs  at Week  104, and the following

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 2 measures in the study eye at Week  52 and 104:  the proportion of participants experiencing 
reduct ion in size of at least one RCH  in the absence of other ablative treatment (assessed by [CONTACT_511555] [ FA]); the proportion of participants experiencing 
moderate vision loss  (defined  as a loss of  ≥ 15 letters from baseline on Electronic Visual Acuity 
[EVA]  testing) ; mean change in visual acuity ; change in size of RCH (measured by [CONTACT_511556]) ; change in exudation (measured by [CONTACT_511557] , optical coherence 
tomography [OCT ] and FA) ; change in epi[INVESTIGATOR_511513] , fibrosis  or retinal traction (assessed 
by [CONTACT_511558]) ; proportion of participants undergoing ablative treatment of 
RCH or ocular surgery ; proportion of participants with successful  ablative treatment of RCH ; and 
the proportion of participants with appearance of one or more new RCH .

line mutations  in the VHL tumor  suppressor gene at chromosome 3p25- 26. 
Incidence is approximately one in 40,000 to one in 54,000 live births, with prevalence of approximately 7,000 affected individuals in the [LOCATION_002].
1 
The two proteins encoded by [CONTACT_511559], designated together as pVHL, play a key role in the cellular response to varying levels of oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, pVHL serves as the 
substrate -binding subunit of an ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the alpha subunit of the 
transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) for prote asomal degradation through 
polyubiquitylation.
2,3,[ADDRESS_661559]; for exampl e, it exerts effects on the primary cilium of the cell and on the 
extracellular matrix.
5 Both HIF -dependent and HIF -independe nt effects may contribute to the 
tumor suppressor activity of pVHL in various cell types.  
1.2 Ocular VHL Disease  
Retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_511512] (RCH) are the most common and often the earliest manifestation of VHL and may lead to significant vision loss.
1 Arising within the neurosensory retina and 
composed of endothelial cells, pericytes  and foamy stromal cells, RCH are benign lesions 
classified by [CONTACT_511560] (juxtapapi[INVESTIGATOR_511514]) and by [CONTACT_511561] 
(endophytic, ex ophytic  or sessile).6 Though RCH can remain stable for years or even rarely 
spontaneously regress, the majority enlarge. Small RCH appear as  a subtle red or grayish lesion  of 
the neurosensory retina; early juxtapapi[INVESTIGATOR_511515].  
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 With growth, many RCH develop one or more dilated and tortuous feeding arterioles and draining 
venules, though juxtapapi[INVESTIGATOR_511516]. RCH demonstrate a var iable amount of vascular 
leakage and exudation, manifesting as intraretinal edema, lipid deposition, exudative retinal detachment  or hemorrhage. Though early leakage is usually confined to the retina in proximity to 
the RCH, the macula can become affected with resulting decrease in vision. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_511517]. Fibrovascular proliferation, similar in some 
respects to the retinal neovascularization that occurs in ischemic retinopathies, can appear in the 
presence or absence of RCH. Vision loss can result from intraretinal and subretinal exudation and 
lipid deposition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_511518], or intraocular hemorrhage.  
The goal of treatment for RCH is ablation of the lesion, resulting in ces sation of exudation, 
hemorrhage  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_511513].
6 Choice of ablative treatment depends on the location and 
size of the lesions.  Small (<  1.5 mm in diameter) peripheral RCH are read ily treated with thermal 
laser photocoagulation. Larger (1.5 – 3.0 mm in diameter) peripheral RCH can be treated with 
laser photocoagulation, but often respond more readily to trans -scleral cryotherapy . Cryotherapy 
causes more inflammation and post -treatme nt exudation than laser photocoagulation, and this can 
lead to retinal detachment and epi[INVESTIGATOR_511519].  Still larger lesions (>  3.0 mm) are 
more difficult to treat, especially if associated with significant e xudation, hemorrhage  or fibrosi s. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_511520]. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has also been used for refractory tumors, both juxtapapi[INVESTIGATOR_511521], with mixed results. In some reported cases, PDT may  help stabilize tumor size and 
exudation.
7,8,[ADDRESS_661560] to ablative therapy in order to address 
vision- threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_511513], t ractional or rh egmatogenous retinal detachment,  or 
vitreous hemorrhage.1 RCH arising in proximity to the optic nerve head and/or macula represent a 
particularl y problematic subset of lesions  because of the risk of iatrogenic vision loss from present 
ablative modalities.10 RCH refractory to one or more sessions of laser photocoagulation and/or 
cryotherapy are also problematic, particularly when large in size or in the setting of substantial regions of retinal vascular incompetence with or without exudative and/or tractional retinal 
detachment . Even small and medium -sized RCH can be hazardous to treat with laser and 
cryotherapy in the setting of  multiple tumors; evolving hyaloid or epi[INVESTIGATOR_511522]; or chorioretinal scarring from previous ablative attempts.

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 1.3 Vascular Endothelial Grow th Factor (VEGF) in VHL  Disease  
The highly vascular nature of tumors in VHL disease suggest that  VEGF, a HIF -inducible factor 
and potent mediator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability, might be important in the evolution 
of both the benign and malignant lesions found in this disease. Renal carcinoma cell lines defective 
for pVHL manifest increase d production of VEGF mRNA and protein, and show a corresponding 
decrease when pVHL function is restored.[ADDRESS_661561] ablative treatment. Dahr et al. evaluated use of intravitreal injections of pegaptanib 
sodium (3 mg) in five patients with VH L manifesting juxtapapi[INVESTIGATOR_511523].[ADDRESS_661562] six injections, and two of five patients  completed the course of 
treatment and one year of follow -up. These two patients experienced a decrease in RCH -associated 
exudation, but no change in size of the tumors. The other three patients  demonstrated progression 
of ocular disease and did not complete the course of treatment.  
Wong et al. ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  studied use of intravitreal ranibizumab in five patients with RCH not 
amenable or responsive to standard treatments.21 Ranibizumab (0.5 mg), a humanized monoclonal 
antibody fragment binding all VEGF -A isoforms, was given every four weeks for six months, with 
additional treatment considered through 12 months. Participants received a mean of 10 injections over an average of 47 weeks. Visual acuity decreased by [CONTACT_269615] (±  20) letters and there was no  
consistent  improvement in RCH exudation or tumor size. No SAEs  were reported. The only related 
AE consisted of transient eyelid edema and erythema immediately following an injection.  
ER-VHL  November 7, [ADDRESS_661563], administered intravitreally at doses sufficient to produce measurable 
biologic effects in other ocular diseases, has produced regression of VHL -associated RCH. 
Regression of pathologic neovascularization in other retinal diseases, such as neovascula r  
age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, is often 
incomplete in the setting of VEGF antagonism. Experimental models suggest that an important 
factor limiting regression of neovascularization in response to VEGF antagonists and other  
anti-vascular treatments may be the maturity of new vessels.22,23,[ADDRESS_661564] P DGF receptor -β (PDGFR -β) positive mural 
cells.
27,28,29 PDGF -B – PDGFR -β signaling leads to mature capi[INVESTIGATOR_511524], 
which maintain an intimate supportive role with associated endothelial cells. Tissue -specific 
knock- out of PDGF -B and PDGFR -β shows reduction in pericyte populations, particularly in the 
central nervous system.30,31 The retinal microvasculature shows a higher pericyte density than any 
other capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996], and an endothelium -specific PDGF -B mouse knock- out model has 
demonstrated capi[INVESTIGATOR_511525] 50 percent of normal. Neutralizing PDGFR -β antibodies disrupt normal capi[INVESTIGATOR_511526].30,32 
pVHL has been shown to reduce expression of PDGF -B messenger RNA via a specificity  
protein 1 (Sp1) -mediated pathway, and PDGF expression is upregulated by [CONTACT_241680].33,[ADDRESS_661565] also been evaluated in pathologic ocular neovascularization. Jo et al. studied the effects of inhibiting PDGF -B,  
VEGF -A or both in murine models for corneal neovascularization and choroidal 
neovascularization.
41 PDGF -B antagonism, achieved wit h a monoclonal antibody (APB -5) against 
murine PDGFR -β, did not show appreciable effects on neovascularization in either model when 
used alone. VEGF -A inhibition, achieved using pegaptanib, resulted in a reduced area of new 
blood vessels in both models. But , combination treatment using both antagonists showed a 
significantly greater reduction in new blood vessel area in both models compared to VEGF 
inhibition alone. 
1.[ADDRESS_661566] E10030 is presently under study in two  phase 3 clinical trials  
(designated as OPH1002 and OPH1003 in the Ophthotech Corp.  Investigator Brochure , v5.0, 
February 29 , 2016).  
The active moiety of E10030 is an aptamer, a novel class of oligonucleo tide-based therapeutic 
agents. Specifically, E10030 is a pegylated aptamer containing 32 monomeric units (32- mer) 
arranged as a linear sequence of three oligonucleotide segments connected by [CONTACT_105]- nucleotide 
hexaethylene glycol spacers . E10030 binds to PDGF -B with high specificity and affinity and 
inhibits the functions of PDGF -B both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, E10030 binds selectively 
to PDGF -BB and  to PDGF -AB heterodimers and, with reduced affinity, to the  
PDGF -AA homodimer .  
Vitreous humor concentrations of E10030 have been shown to decline in an apparent first order process with elimination half -lives of approximately three days in rabbits and two days in dogs. 
Following an IV bolus dose, E10030 was eliminated from plasma in an apparent first -order process 
with an elimination half -life of approximately three  hours in ra ts, 30 to 50 minutes in rabbits  and 
16 minutes in dogs. The E10030 volume of distribution was approximately equal to the plasma volume of the animal .  
There were no significant ocular or systemic safety issues identified during the E10030 nonclinical 
toxicology program. Chronic intravitreal studies in dogs (nine months) and rabbits (six months)  
have been completed, and no ocular or other effects of E10030 were  observed at the highest dose 
levels tested, which were 1.5 and 3.0 mg/eye, respectively. These dose levels were the maximum 
that could be administered based on limitations of E10030 solution viscosity and intravitreal 
injection volumes for each species. W hen adjusted for the relative differences in vitreous volume 
across species (i.e., between the animal species and humans), these no -effect levels are equivalent 
to human doses of 4.5 mg/eye (for both species). There was also no indication of any adverse 
interaction with an anti- VEGF agent (i.e., pegaptanib sodium or ranibizumab) when  
co-administered in the intravitreal studies.  
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 A phase 1, dose -escalating, uncontrolled, multiple -dose, multicenter clinical study (OPH1000) was 
completed  in 0patients with subf oveal neovascular lesions secondary  to age -related macular 
degeneration .47 Subjects were enrolled in a dose escalation scheme to three monthly intravitreal 
injec tions of E10030 (0.03, 0.3, 1.5 or 3.0 mg/eye) in combination with ranibizumab 0.5 mg.  
Twenty -two subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study.  
One additional subject who did not meet criteria was discontinued shortly after entry into the study, 
and therefore a  total of 23 patients we re included in the safety databas e for the study.  
A progressive improvement of visual acuity and a decrease in macular thickness were noted at all time points. Visual acuity results showed 8  (36%), 10 (45%) and 13 (59%) subjects  
gaining ≥  15 letters at Week s 4, 8 and 12, respectively. Analysis of FA by [CONTACT_511562] a mean decrease in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) area of 86% at Week  12 
compared to baseline.  
There was no eviden ce of drug -related AE s and no dose limiting toxicities were id entified. 
Twenty -one patients  (91%) experienced at least one AE and  18 patients (78%) experienced at least 
one ocular AE in the study eye. Almost all study eye AEs were considered to be related to the 
injection procedure. No study eye AEs were assessed to be related to E10030 or ranibizumab 
administration. The most frequently occurring study eye AEs were foreign body sensation in eyes 
(six patients, 26%), conjunctival hemorrhage ( five patients, 22%), e ye irritation ( four patients, 
17%)  and punctate keratiti s (three patients, 13%). Other ocular AEs reported by [CONTACT_511563] (trace), conjunctival edema  and myodesopsia (floaters)  
(each reported by [CONTACT_511564], 9%). The majorit y of AEs were mild in severity.  There was only 
one SAE  (atrial fibrillation) reported by a patient  in the 0.3 mg dose group; the event was unrelated 
to study  drugs or injection procedure.  
Recently, a phase 2b, randomized, prospective, double -masked, sham -controlled trial using 
combination investigation al treatment with E10030 and ranibizumab (OPH1001) has been 
completed in patients with subfoveal neovascular lesions secondary to AMD. Patients  received six 
monthly intravitreous injections of E10030 given in combination with ranibizumab. In this 
multicenter study, 449 patients were random ly assigned  in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following dose 
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 groups:  E10030 0.3 mg/eye + ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye, E10030 1.5 mg/eye + ranibizumab  
0.5 mg/eye  or E10030 sham + r anibizumab 0.5 mg/eye.  
E10030 (1.5 mg) combination investigational treatment resu lted in superior visual outcome 
compared to ranibizumab alone at the Week  24 time  point. The combination of E10030 (1.5 mg) 
and ranibizumab (0.5 mg) met the pre -specified, alp ha protected primary endpoint of superiority 
in mean visual acuity gain compared to ranibizumab alone (10.6 ETDRS letters at Week  24, 
compared to 6.5 letters, p=0.019). Fluorescein angiography and OCT studies confirmed marked 
disease modification (neovascu lar regression).  
Combination investigational tr eatment was well tolerated. The most common ocular AE s were,  as 
expected in intravitreal studies, related to the intravitreal preparation and injection procedure and 
not drug- related, e.g., conjunctival hemorr hage, punctate keratitis  and eye pain. There were no 
events of endophthalmitis, reti nal detachment, retinal tear or iatrogenic traumatic cataract after a 
total of 4431 intravitreal injections (1776 administrations of E10030 and 2655 administrations of 
ranibizumab). As expected, the mean Intraocular pressure  (IOP) increased after each intravitreal 
injection consistent with the volume effect. However, mean IOP in all arms returned to pre -

 and Ranibizumab 
This is a phase I /II study designed t o evaluate the safety and possible efficacy  of combination 
intravitreal investigational treatment using E10030 and ranibizumab for s evere ocular VHL 
disease. The prognosis for eyes with ocular VHL disease not amenable or refractory to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511527], and the morbidities of any intervention, such as ablation of RCH in proximity to 
the optic nerve or macula, vitreoretinal surgery, cryotherapy  or ocular radiation, are substantial.  
In such eyes, inexorable progression of disease leads to blindness and phthisis  bulbi . Serial 
ranibizumab injections alone do not lead to RCH regression or any consistent decrease in tumor 
exudation, but have shown a reasonable safety profile in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].
21 There is a reasonable 
scientific rationale for the potential efficacy of combined VEGF and PDGF blockade in treatment 
of RCH, based on knowledge of the molecular biology of pVHL -defective cells and present 
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 understanding of angiogenesis in the setting of neoplasia. The investigational agent E10030 has 
not been studied in eyes with ocular VHL, but has shown a reasonable safety profile alone and in 
combination with ranibizumab or pega ptanib sodium in pre -clinica l studies; furthermore, no 
significant safety concerns were apparent in phase I and phase II studies  evaluating combination 
investigational treatment with E10030 and ranibizumab for NVAMD . 
Based on preliminary evidenc e for safety and efficacy in people with exudative AMD, and 
supportive evidence from animal studies, the 1.5 mg dose of E10030 has been selected for use in 
this phase 1/[ADDRESS_661567] a diagnosis of VHL disease . In accordance with established

4.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
This is a  phase I/II, single -center, prospective, open label, non randomized, uncontrolled, single 
group trial investigating the safety and potential efficacy of combined treatment of severe ocular 
VHL disease wi th serial intravitreal injections of E10030 and ranibizumab.  
4.[ADDRESS_661570] of the participants for this study can be recruited from the current patient population with ocular VHL disease at the National Eye Institute (NEI) and other institutes within N IH, including 
the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) and the National Cancer 
Institute ( NCI). The study may also rely on referrals from outside physicians at Kaiser Permanente, 
the su pport group of the VHL Alliance  and other nati onal clinical sites. If any recruitment materials 
are used, IRB -approval will be obtained prior to distribution. It is anticipated that all participants 
will be recruited within 12 months  of activation . 
4.2 Screening  
Consent will be obtained be fore any study p rocedures are done, including any screening 
procedures that may be done under this current protocol. 
All potential participants will undergo a screening visit in  the NEI ophthalmology clinic to 
determine whether they meet the eligibility criteria. Potentia l participants will be screened under 
the NEI screening protocol (08- EI-0102) , NEI natural history protocols  such as [ADDRESS_661571] an active sign ed consent for one of the above -mentioned protocols on file  in order to allow  
for screening  examination . Under these protocols, potential participants may  undergo a 
medical/ophthalmic  history, concomitant medication assessment, vital sign testing, physical 
examination, ophthalmic examination, visual acuity testing, color fundus photography, OCT , FA 
and laboratory testing  to determine eligibility . Screening data may be us ed as baseline data if 
performed  within one month (31 days)  of the baseline visit.  At any time during the screening 
process, the participant may enroll  in this current protocol  by [CONTACT_12142]’s consent form 
and may complete any remaining screening  and baseline procedures  under this protocol , with final 
determination of eligibility.  Laboratory testing will include a complete blood count (CBC), 
hemoglobin A1C  and acute care, hepatic and mineral panels , and may be done within one month 
(31 days) of the baseline visit.  Women of childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition) 
will have a pregnancy test to assess eligibility  and must have a negative test within [ADDRESS_661572] . If BCVA, concomitant medicat ion assessment and vital 
sign testing were assessed  on an earlier date under another protocol , these will be repeated as 
baseline examinations  on the day  of enrollment. All other screening procedures will not be 
repeated. These screening/b aseline examinations are  outlined in Appendix 2. Combination 
investigational treatment with E10030 and ranibizumab injections cannot  occur until the 
participant has reviewed and signed this protocol ’s consent form.

with severe ocular VHL disease. A single study eye  in each participant  will receive combination 
treatment consisting of intravitreal injections of E10030 (1.5 mg in 0.05 mL) and ranibizum ab  
(0.5 mg in 0.05 mL) (given as separate injections during the same procedure , meaning that 
participants will receive two intravitreal injections per  visit, see A ppendix 3) every four weeks 
from baseline through Week  16 (totaling five  treatments) and the n every eight weeks through 
Week  48 (totaling nine  treatments from baseline). The primary endpoint will be assessed by

at Week s 60, 72, [ADDRESS_661574] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511532], for clinical improvement  starting  at Week  16 (as in a case where clinical improvement 
makes an eye more amenable to ablativ e or surgical treatment) , and without restriction starting at 
Week 40  (in anticipation of unavailability of investigational product after Week 48) .  
Any participants who discontinue combination investigational treatment will be asked to return for 
all stud y visits and will be included in the analyses at the end of the study . 
4.4 Study Procedures  
The study will require a minimum of 14 visits (baseline and Week s 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 52, 
60, 72, 84 and 104). All visits must be conducted within a window of  ± 7 days from the target day  
through Week  52 and ±  [ADDRESS_661575] 12 months. Prior to treatment at each 
visit, the participant will undergo an AE  assessment, concomitant medi cation review, vital sign 
check  and ophthalmic evaluation. 
Over the course of the study, participants will undergo the following ocular and systemic 
evaluations as outlined in the study flowsheet (see Appendix 2).

4.5.1 Reporting of Expected Events  
It is anticipated that participants in this study will occasionally miss or fail to complete an assessment, procedure , or study visit. These omissions will be considered expected events and not 
protocol deviations provided they are infrequent and do not include data needed to assess safety or the primary study outcome. If such an event is identified, the P I will submit a report to the IRB 
within two weeks using PTMS.  
Cumulative proportions of these missed events in the study population will be presented to the 
IRB annually. In addition, these rates will be calculated and provided to the NEI SAE Review 
Comm ittee regularly. The following are considered deviations:  
• An individual misses more than 15% of the required study assessments/procedures,  
• An individual misses more than 15% of the required study visits,  
• An individual completes more than 15% of the requir ed study visits outside of the visit 
window,

• Collectively, participants missed more than 15% of the required study visits, or  
• Collectively, participants complete more than  15% of the required visits outside the visit 
window.  
If total number of items (study visits or study assessments/procedures) expected is less than 16, 
two or more missed is reportable. If the total number expected is greater than 16, then if more than 
15% are missed it is reportable. Missed items previously reported are not included in the 
subsequent tallies of missed items, but will be mentioned in future deviation reports. Once a 
deviation is identified, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a report to the IRB within two weeks using PTMS.

4.6.7 Concomitant Medicati ons or Treatments  
Any potential participant likely to need systemic treatment with an agent having significant  
anti-VEGF or anti -PDGF activity within 12 months of enrollment should not be entered in the 
study (see Section 3.2.2, Exclusion Criteria). However, once participants are enrolled in the study, 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_275528]- ocular conditions are allowed without restriction. In the event that 
a participant requires systemic treatment with either anti- VEGF therapy or anti -PDGF therapy, 
interruption or discontinuation of combination investigational treatment will be considered and 
discussed with other treating physicians.  
Standard care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_511533],  including laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, 
photodynamic the rapy, surgery, ocular radiation and any medication use associated with these 
treatments (such as use of systemic corticosteroids to minimize exudation from RCH undergoing 
ablative treatment) w ill be considered for significant clinical worsening at any time during the 
study , for clinical improvement at any time starting at Week  16 (as in a case where clinical 
improvement makes an eye more amenable to ablative or surgical treatment ), and without 
restriction starting at Week 40 (in anticipation of unavailability of investigational product after Week 48) . 
Significant clinical worsening is defined as ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, assessed by [CONTACT_511567] /or clinical imaging with OCT, F A and fundus photography, as  applicable,

6.0 RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The anticipated discomforts and inconveniences of this protocol are t hose associated with  the 
investigational products, intravitreal injections , the examination procedures  and the time required 
for the participant to spend at the clinic.  
6.1 Examination Risks  
Possible risks  and discomforts associated with ocular examinations include:  
1. Dilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can cause an allergic reaction, or if contaminated, can cause an infection, but neither of these problems is very likely to 
occur. Dilating drops can also cause a sudden increase of pressure (acute glaucoma) in 
eyes that are already predisposed to develop this condition. There is little risk of 
glaucoma being triggered in this way, but if it is, treatment is available.  
The participant’s intraocular pressure will be obtained at each ophthalmic examination to determine whether there is an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_69361].  
ER-VHL  November 7, [ADDRESS_661583] lens. A corneal abrasion of this sort may be 
painful, but it will heal quickly with no lasting eff ects. 
4. The fluorescein dye used in fluorescein angiography can make a participant’s skin turn yellow for several hours. This yellow color is transient and usually disappears in one 
day. Because the dye undergoes renal excretion, the participant’s urine will  turn dark 
orange for up to [ADDRESS_661584] an allergic reaction to the dye. Treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_214582], but may require intravenous antihi stamine 
administration if the symptoms are severe. Very rarely (less than one in one million people), a participant experiences anaphylaxis. This would be treated immediately by 
[CONTACT_214622], if necessary, intubation.  
5. OCT is a non- invasive test used to document and analyze retinal pathology and has no 
known medical risks.  
Possible risks and discomforts associated with non- ocular examinations include:  
1. Blood draws can cause discomfort and bleeding/bruising at the site of venous puncture. 
There is a remote risk of fainting or local infection. If any of these conditions arise, 
they will be treated.  
2. The medical/ophthalmic history, physical examination, vital sign testing  and pregnancy 
testing entail no medical risk.  
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 6.2 Potential Risks of E10030  
The following safety data for intravitreal use of E10030 are  drawn from the attached Investigator 
Brochure  (v5.0, February  29, 2016) , furnished by [CONTACT_511570]. Based on animal studies, 
injection -related risks appear to be limited to the risks of any intravitreal injection.  
Specifically, vitreous hemorrhage , retinal detachment, cataract, lens  capsule pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], fibrosis  
and retinal dysplasia  were observed in some animals in multiple injection studies.  
Post-injection ocular inflammation may also be a risk of E10030 injection, although this reaction 
appears to be species -specific and has not been noted in human clinical trials. 
In beagle dogs, a single intravitreal injection of test article was associated with trace to 1+ cell 
transiently in some e yes in the 0.3 mg/eye, 1.0 mg/eye and 2.0 mg/eye dose groups . 
On pathologic examination of these eyes, the minimal inflammation noted microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_511537]. These findings were not associated  
with major changes in retinal function, as assessed by [CONTACT_185025] ( ERG ).  
No inflammatory reaction was noted in single dose testing of Dutch belted rabbits. 
Repeat injection studies were done in Dutch belted rabbits. The animals received bilateral 
injections every two weeks for six weeks and experienced no drug -related adverse effects.   
Several rabbits in the study and control groups sustained i njection -related effects, including retinal 
detachment, cataract, lens  capsule pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], fibrosis  and retinal dysplasia.  
Repeat E10030 injection studies were also done in beagle dogs . Like the animals in the single 
injection studies, intermittent vitreous cells  (trace to 2+; suggestion of dose dependence)  were  
detected. This was especially common in the group that was injected da ily. Two animals al so had 
anterior chamber cells. One dog that received E10030 at the 0.3 mg dose level developed marked 
ocular inflammation that was severe and persistent. Injection -related effects i ncluded vitreous 
hemorrhage in six eyes, of which four were in the control group. Three other eyes had retinal folds. 
One of the se three was in the control group. ERG and histopathology studies revealed no  
E10030- related toxicity.  
New Zealand white rabbits that received multiple E10030/ranibizumab combined injections 
exhibited a species -specific ocular inflammatory reaction. C linical signs of ocular inflammation 
included vitreous opacities, debris  and infiltrating cells, fibrin  and debris on the lens capsule. 
ER-VHL  November 7, [ADDRESS_661585] dose level of 
E10030 alone.  No similar inflammation was seen in an identical study in beagle dogs. 
The maximum serum concentration of E10030 in the high intravitreal dose group (1.5 mg) was  
41 ng/mL. In rat studies, IV dosing (0.1, 1, 10 or 100 mg of E10030/kg/day IV over 14 or 90 days) 
has been associated with significant perturbations of hematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters, especially in the high -dose groups. Rats were found to have decreased leukocyte, 
hemoglobin, platelet  and reticulocyte counts after IV administration. Prothrombin time and 
activated partial thromboplastin time were significantly increa sed at times during the study. 
Globulin levels were decreased by [CONTACT_2054], and there was a corresponding increa se in 
albumin/globulin ratios. In the high- dose groups, serum cholesterol, ALT, total prot ein and AST, 
ALP, triglycerides  and total bilirubin concentrations wer e all significantly decreased.  
Reductions in serum concentrations ranged from approximately 30 to 70%. Serum calcium was 
sligh tly but signif icantly reduced. Glucose and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were 
significantly increased, by [CONTACT_45848] 55 and 75%, respectively.  Increased liver weights and 
decreased spleen weights were also observed, and the significance of these findings is unclear . 
In the 14 -day study, histopathology findings in the high- dose animals consisted of minimal to 
marked infiltration of histiocytes (macrophages) in multiple organs including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes  and kidneys. In the 90- day study, histopathology findings in the high- dose animals 
consisted of cellular vacuolation in numerous tissues, including li ver, spleen  and lymph nodes.  
A dose response was evident, with increased severity and frequency of findings occurring in the  
high-dose gr oup versus the mid- dose group. These histopathologic findings may reflect stages in 
the drug clearance process.  
No drug -specific adverse effects of E10030 have been identified in limited human use . The only 
serious AE in the phase 1 clinical tria l of E10030 was new onset atrial fibrillation reported by a 
patient  in the 0.3 mg dose group. The event was  assessed as unrelated to study drugs or injection 
procedure. In the phase 1 clinical trial of E10030 and ranibizumab for choroidal neovascularization 
in age -related macular degeneration (n=23)  (OPH1000) , AEs were almost exclusively mild and 
related to the injection procedure. The most frequently occurring (≥  3 subjects ) AEs were all events 
that occurred in the study eye, including foreign body sensati on in the eye, conjunctival 
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 hemorrhage, eye irritation  and punctate keratitis. The only other ocular AEs reported in the study 
eye of more than one patient were conjunctival edema, anterior chamber cells (trace) and 
myodesopsi a (floaters) (each reported in  two patients, 9%). In a phase 2b randomized, prospective, 
double -masked, controlled trial of 449 patients  with subfoveal neovascular lesions secondary to 
AMD (OPH1001) , combination investigational treatme nt with E10030 and ranibizumab was well 
tolerated . Patients  received six monthly intravitreous injections of E10030  given in combination 
with ranibizumab. In this  randomized, sham -controlled, multicenter study, 449 patients were 
randomly assigned  in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following dose groups:  E10030 0.3 mg /eye + ranibizumab 
0.5 mg/eye, E10030 1.5 mg/eye + ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye  or E10030  sham + ranibizumab  
0.5 mg/eye.  
The most  common ocular AEs  were, as expected in intravitreal studies, related to the intravitreal 
preparation and injection procedure and not d rug-related, e.g., conjunctival hemorrhage, punctate 
keratitis  and eye pain. There were no eve nts of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, retinal tear or 
iatrogenic traumatic  cataract after a total of 4 ,431 intravitreal injections (1 ,776 administrations  of 
E10030 and 2,655 administrations of ranibizumab). As expected, the mean IOP increased after 
each intravitreal injection consistent with the volume effect. However, mean IOP in al l arms 
returned to pre -injection level at the next visit, including at the  end of  the study. The systemic 
safety profile of E10030 /ranibizumab was similar to that of ranibizumab alone . In the phase 2b 
trial above (OPH1001), the incidence of SAEs wa s similar among treatment arms.  
The percentage of subjects with at least one syste mic SAE was 8.7% in the group getting E10030 
0.3 mg + ranibizumab 0.5 mg; 5.9% in the group getting E10030 1.5 mg + ranibizumab 0.5 mg; 
and 7.4% in the group getting sham + ranibizumab 0.[ADDRESS_661586] meaningful 
data comes from a dose -escalating,  multiple -dose phase 1 study involving 23 participants with 
exudative AMD involving three  monthly injections of E10030 (0.03, 0.3, 1.5 and 3.0 mg) plus 
ranibizumab (0.5 mg). In this study, plasma levels of E10030 were measured at days 0, 1, 3 and  
7 and at week 4 and 8. E10030 was detectable in all participants receiv ing 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg doses. 
The mean maximum plasma concentration was calculated to be 15.9 ng/mL for those receiving 1.5 mg and 34.4 ng/mL  for those receiving 3.[ADDRESS_661587], vitreous hemorrh age and intraocular infection, particularly endophthalmitis.  
Present cumulative experience in completed and ongoing human trials described in the Ophthotech 
Corp. Investigator Brochure involves use of E10030 in combination with an anti -VEGF agent 
(ranibizumab, bevacizumab or aflibercept) in approxim ately [ADDRESS_661588] been reported in 225 participants, including four suspected unexpected s erious adverse 
reactions : one case of uveitis in the OPH1001 trial; one case of cerebral hemorrhage in the 
OPH1002 trial; one case of re tinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_511538] 1003 trial; and one case of 
left facial numbness with negative neurologic work -up, resolving within a day, in the OPH 1004 
trial, none of which has been considered to be likely to be related to E10030 administration  by [CONTACT_429]. Only one other case of uveitis (not designated a suspected unexpected SAE  by 
[CONTACT_431]) has been reported across existing studies to date. 
No evidence was observed for a toxic or pharmacokinet ic interaction between E10030 and the 
anti-VEGF agent  ranibizumab when the combinations were administered by [CONTACT_511571]. Although no systematic studies of interactions have bee n conducted with other 
drugs to date, no interactions of E10030 with other drugs are antici pated. E10030 is metabolized 
by [CONTACT_511572]; therefore, cytochrome P450-  mediated drug 
interactions are unlikely.  
To date, no specific studies have been conducted to assess  the effects of E10030 on the 
reproductive ability of adult animals or developmental parameters of fetuses or pups; therefore, 
E10030 must not be used during pregnancy or lacta tion. All women of childbearing potential must 
use two  forms of effective contraception.  
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 6.3 Potential Risks of Ranibizumab  
Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) is made by [CONTACT_8229], Inc. and approved by [CONTACT_511573]-related macular degeneration, macular edema 
secondary to retinal vein occlusio n, diabetic macular edema (DME)  and diabetic reti nopathy in 
people with DME. Ranibizumab may cause allergic reactions although, to date, none have been 
reported. Several thousand patients  have been treated with ranibizumab for different therapeutic 
indications in clinical trials. Serious AEs possibly or probably attributed to intravitreal injection of 
ranibizumab include severe uveitis, endophthalmitis, retinal tears, retinal detachment, vitreous 
hemorrhage, lens damage  and central retinal vein occlusion. Non -serious  AEs possibly or probably 
attributed to  intravitreal injection of ranibizumab include anterior chamber and vitreal 
inflammation, mild transient increases in IOP, posterior vitreal detachment, retinal hemorrhage, 
injection site pain, subconjunctival hemorrhage and transient decrease in visual ac uity.  
Other ocular non- serious events included a foreign body sensation in the eye after intravitreal 
injection, conjunctivitis, dry eye and pruritus. Some of these ocular side effects may cause 
decreased vision and a possibility of causing blindness. Although there was a low rate of arterial 
thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials, there is a potential risk 
of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke,  
nonfatal myocardial infar ction  or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause).  
The safety of ranibizumab in pregnant or lactating women has not been tested.  
6.4 Potential Risks of Any Intravitreal Injection  
Potential risks of any injection are related to the mechanics of manip ulating the eye.  
Potential risks associated with intravitreal injection itself are similar to those associated with the 
injection of other approved drugs delivered via the same route and include endophthalmitis, retinal 
tear, retinal detachment, lens  trauma, intraocular hemorrhage  and elevated intraocular pressure. 
Such risks can lead to irreversible vision loss or blindness. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_511574] a standardized injection procedure. Appendix 3 describes the injection procedure that 
will be used . 
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 7.0 PARTICIPANT SAFETY MONITORING  
Participants will be assessed  for AEs during all study visits by [CONTACT_30967]. At each 
visit, the participant will be asked about any new ocular or systemic symptoms including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214584]/changed medications . Participants will be instr ucted to contact a study 
investigator at any time if they experience any problems .  
Participants will be monitored at each visit for injection -related complications such as 
endophthalmitis, retinal tear/detachment, intraocular hemorrhage, cataract and glaucoma and for 
any prog ression of ocular VHL disease. They will also be monitored at each visit for intraocular 
inflammation (as assessed by [CONTACT_511575]), 
which was noted in some pre -clinical models using d oses of E10030 higher than the human 
equivalent dose planned for this study.  
7.1 Treatment of Endophthalmitis, Retinal Tear/Detachment, Intraocular Hemorrhage, 
 Cataract  and Glaucoma  
The decision to treat a participant for endophthalmitis, suspected endophthal mitis, retinal 
tear/detachment, i ntraocular hemorrhage, cataract  or glaucoma will be guided by [CONTACT_511576] . Clinical management is also at the discretion of the investigator and 
should follow current standard practice patterns . A decision regarding whether discontinuation of 
combination investigational treatment is warranted will be made by [CONTACT_511577].  
7.[ADDRESS_661589] or withdrawal may include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
• Visual acuity loss of ≥  30 letters from baseline;  
• Investigator determination that it is not in the best medical interest of the participant to 
continue participation;  
• Findings in the course of the trial that may affect willingness to participate; 
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 • Inability to keep study visits or to comply with study requirements;  
• Participant requires ocular surgery which cannot safely be postponed until the end of the 
study;  
• Pregnancy;  
• An adverse reaction to the study treatment or a serious complicati on associated with or 
aggravated by [CONTACT_511578] s; 
• Cardiovascular event or stroke; or  
• Other safety concerns . 
Discontinuation of the combination investigational treatment  does not necessitate study 
withdrawal . Whenever  possible, investigators will ask study participants discontinuing 
combination investigational treatment  to continue to return for study visits. 
7.3 Pregnancy Monitoring 
If an investigator  becomes aware that a female study participant has become pregnant durin g the 
study, no further intravitreal injections of combination investigational treatment will be 
administered. The investigator and participant will determine whether to continue any remaining 
study visits or to exit the study .  
If an investigator  becomes aware that a male study participant has impregnated his partner during 
the study, the investigator will remind the participant of the potential risks to the unborn fetus.  
In either case of reported pregnancy, participant (or partner) will be referred to t he NIH OB/GYN 
consultation service for evaluation and counseling. The investigator must follow the participant 
(or partner) until the pregnancy outcome.  
8.0 OUTCOME MEASURES  
8.1 Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome for the study will be safety of the combination investigational treatment , 
assessed by [CONTACT_511579]  52.

whether E10030 or ranibizumab is excreted in human milk. Given the known and unknown effects 
on pregnancy outcomes, two forms of contraception will be required for female participants of 
childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition). In addition, female participants of childbearing potential will undergo pregnancy tests throughout the study.  
10.1.3 Justification for Exclusion of Individuals without Consent Capacity  
Vulnerable subjects who lack consent capacity or are cognitively impaired are excluded from this 
study because they are frequently unable to cooperate with evaluat ion and testing in the manner

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 11.0 BENEFITS  
Participants may benefit directly from this study if combined E10030 and ranibizumab treatment 
causes regression of RCH and preserves visual acuity. The study will also lead to generalizable 
knowledge that will enhance our understanding of using E10030 and ranibizumab as treatment for 
patients with RCH associated with VHL.  
12.0 SUMMARY /CLASSIFICATION OF RISK 
Risk is classified as more than minimal risk. The risks will be minimized with careful monitoring and are reasonable given that the participants are experiencing or are at risk of experiencing visual 
loss due to VHL disease.  
13.[ADDRESS_661593] completed the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH) Human Subject’s Protection Unit (HSPU) “Elements of Successful Informed Consent” training.  All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension 
of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study. The participants must have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent form, which must be signed prior to enrollment.  
The participants will have an opport unity to carefully review the consent and ask questions 
regarding this study prior to signing, and they will be informed that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time w ithout prejudice to themselves.  
If the participant requires the consent to be in lar ger font in order to read it well, this will be 
provided. If participants are visually impaired to the point of being unable to read the consent, they 
can take the consent back with them to read it over with a family member or with the use of 
magnifying de vices. If the participant chooses, the investigator can also read the consent verbatim 
to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  
An investigator present during the  consent process will document the consent process in the 
participant’s me dical record. A copy of the signed informed consent form will be provided to the 
participant to take home.

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 13.1 Unanticipated Enrollment of N on-English Speaking Participants  
If a non- English speaking participant is eligible for enrollment, the participant will be provided 
with the Clinical Center (CC) Short Written Consent Form for Non -English Speaking Research 
Subjects in the participant’s native language and a verbal explanation of the purpose, procedures 
and risks of the study. The IRB -approved English consent form will serve as basis for the verbal 
explanation of the study. The investigator will obtain an interpreter unless the investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s language. Preferably, the interpreter will be someone who is not 
related to t he participant (i.e., not a family member). Interpreters provided by [CONTACT_511585]. The interpreters will interpret the IRB -approved English consent form and 
facilitate discussion between the participant and investigator.  
The IRB -approved English consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_83194] 
a witness to the oral presentation. The CC Short Written Consent Form will be signed by [CONTACT_25955] a witness who observed the presentation of information. The interpreter may sign 
the consent documents as the witness and, in this case, will note “Interpreter” with his/her 
signature. If not also serving as the witness, the interpreter will be separately identified on the short 
form in the space provided. A copy of both signed forms (the long form serving as the script and 
the short form) will be provided to the participant. The short form process, including the use of an interpreter, will be documented in the medical record in accordance with NIH policy.  
All instanc es of use of the CC Short Written Consent Form will be reported to the IRB at the time 
of annual review. If the CC Short Written Consent Form is used three times or more for the same 
language within an IRB approval period, this will be reported to the IRB immediately.  
Interpreters will also be present for other protocol procedures as necessary.

real-time data checks and reports t hroughout the course of a study  to ensure the accuracy of 
information. This system is a secure and confidential data management system that stores data and 
provides quality assurance and reporting. Emmes  has developed a number of rout ine reports 
specifically designed for monitors (e.g., listings of SAEs , etc.).  
Additionally, Emmes  has developed summary reports of discrepancies, as well as reports of the 
exceptions databases, which include requests and reasons for exceptions. The result s of the reports 
are communicated back to site staff, and , along with protocol compliance issues, to the DSMC   
(if applicable) .  
Following the monitoring plan for this study, Emmes  will perform monitoring activities, including 
on-site audits, review of dat abase entries and the resolution of study issues. In addition to 
monitoring, Emmes  performs various detailed automated and manual data quality checks.

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 APPENDIX 1: DETERMINING CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL  
A female participant who is considered non- childbearing due to a medical condition  
(i.e., participant has  previously undergone a hysterectomy) does not need a pregnancy test, 
Follicle -stimulating Hormone (FSH) test or contraception.  
If a female participant is considered non -childbearing due to menopause, it must be in accordance 
with the CNS IRB/NIH Ob -Gyn gu idance on the definition of menopause. 
This guidance defines menopause as:  
• Women over age [ADDRESS_661604] or contraception.  
• Women between [ADDRESS_661605]. If their FSH level is ≥ 20 mIU/mL, they will be considered menopausal and do not 
need pregnancy testing or contraception. If their FSH level is < 20 mIU/mL, they will need 
pregnancy testing and contr aception as required by [CONTACT_760]. 
• Women between [ADDRESS_661606]. If they are not pregnant and their FSH level is  
≥ 20 mIU/mL, they will be considered menopausal and will not require contraception or 
additional pregnancy testing. If their FSH test is < 20 mIU/mL, they will need pregnancy testing and contraception as required by [CONTACT_760].

Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 Appendix  3: Injection Procedures for All Participant s 
The following procedures will be implemented to minimize the risk of potential AEs  associated 
with serial intravitreal injections (e.g., endophthalmitis). Aseptic technique will be observed by 
[CONTACT_511592] a ssembly, anesthetic preparation  and investigational 
product administration. In addition to the proce dures outlined below, specific institutional policies 
associated with the safety of intravitreal injections will be observed . Included in these safety 
procedures are use of a mask and sterile gloves by [CONTACT_511593]. 
• The technician or nurse assembles the supplies and prepares a sterile field .  
• The investigator physician and/or nurse prepare the investigational  product in sterile 
fashion as described in Section 4.6, with loading  of ranibizumab and E10030 in separate, 
sterile, labeled syringes, with appropriate needles for injection affixed, on the sterile field . 
• The technician or nurse instills 1 drop of 0.5% te tracaine or proparacaine  solution into the 
study eye. This is repeated one or two more times.  
• The technician or nurse instills 5% povidone iodine ophthalmic solution in the study eye. 
Anesthesia can be supplemented with additional drops of 0.5% tetracaine  or proparacaine  
if the participant is uncomfortable.  If additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_511551], then  
2-3 additional drops of 5% povidone iodine ophthalmic solution is instilled in the study 
eye. 
• The technician or nurse disinfects the periocular skin and eyelid of the study eye in 
preparation for injection. The technician or nurse cleanses the eyelid, lashes and periorbital 
skin with 10% povidone iodine swabs, starting with the eyelid and lashes and continuing with the surrounding periocular skin.  
• The investigator physician may opt to supplement the topi[INVESTIGATOR_511552] 1% or 2% , in order to maximize 
comfort.  Lidocaine 1% or 2% m ay be injected before or after the lid and periorbital 
preparation with povidone iodine and the insertion of the lid speculum described below, but only after pre -treatment with tetracaine or proparacaine and 5% povidone  iodine on the 
ocular surface. A ster ile cotton swab or sterile cotton pledget soaked in tetracaine or 
proparacaine may be used to supplement topi[INVESTIGATOR_511553]. Administration of lidocaine 1% or 2% consists of injecting between 0.1 and 
1.0 mL to raise a su bconjunctival bleb in the quadrant of the study eye planned for 
injection, using a 30 gauge 0.5 inch needle, with care taken to maintain the needle as tangential to the globe as possible. 
• The investigator physician gloves and inserts an eye speculum into t he study eye.  
ER-VHL  November 7, 2018  
 
Version  7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 • The investigator physician saturates a sterile cotton -tipped applicator with 0.5% 
proparacaine or tetracaine drops  and holds the swab against the planned intravitreal 
injection site for 20 to 40 seconds. Analgesia may be supplemented with 3.5% lidocaine 
gel at investigator discretion . If lidocaine gel is used, any additional 5% povidone iodine 
solution (see below) should be applied prior to gel application, and residual gel should be irrigated from the eye surface before the end of the proc edure.  
• The investigator physician uses a caliper to mark the planned injection site, usually 3.5 to 
4 mm from the limbus.  
• The investigator physician appl ies another drop of 5% povidone iodine solution to the 
planned injection site. 
• The investigator physic ian injects 50  µL of r anibizumab using a 30- gauge 0.5 -inch needle 
into the vitreous cavity and then remove s the needle.  
• The investigator physician applies another drop of 5% povidone iodine solution to the injection site.  
• The investigator physician injects  50 µL of E10030 with a 27- gauge needle into the 
vitreous cavity and then remove s the needle.  
• Sterile saline drops may be used in between steps above to keep the cornea lubricated as 
warranted, but should not be used immediately after application of povidone iodine solution.  
• The investigator physician removes the speculum. 
• The investigator physician performs pain assessment, visual testing (hand -motion testing)  
and assessment of retinal perfusion (by [CONTACT_66366]) immediately after injections.  
Any severe  pain, absence of hand- motion vision, or absence of perfusion of the retinal 
arterioles immediately following injection should prompt standard care assessment and intervention. Intraocular pressure should be measured and documented in such a 
circumstance, and should be treated with appropriate standard care options including 
medical management and/or surgical paracentesis when warranted.  
• Intraocular pressure is measured by [CONTACT_511594] -Pen within  [ADDRESS_661610] of 
care measures.  A participant may be discharged from clinic when intraocular pressure 
measures ≤ 24 mmHg.

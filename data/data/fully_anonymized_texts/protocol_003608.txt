PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR’S STATEMENT  
This statement is to certify that I have received the above -referenced investigational plan, which has been 
approved for initiation at my investigational site by [CONTACT_811999] 
____________.  As Principal Investigator, I will ensure that all pers onnel who have been delegated 
responsibilities for this study will be trained on the investigational plan and associated responsibilities prior 
to study participation.  I agree to conduct this clinical study in compliance with the investigational plan and 
applicable requirements of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Parts, 50, 54, 56, 812 and 45 CFR

  [INVESTIGATOR_811995]:  CONTINUED  ACCESS  PROTOCOL  
A Prospective, Multicenter, Single -Arm, Observational Study of the Safety and 
Clinical Performance of RES (Regenerative Epi[INVESTIGATOR_811996]) Prepared with 
the ReCell® Device Combined with Meshed Skin Graft in the Treatment of Acute 
Burn Injuries  
Purpose:  This Continued Access Protocol has been written to allow ongoing treatment of 
subjects at selected investigational sites while the marketing application for the 
ReCell® Autologous Cell Harvesting Device is under  FDA review.  
Data collected within this study will augment safety and effectiveness  results from 
previous Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) studies  using the  ReCell® 
device,  increasing the available clinical evidence for the application of RES 
(Regenerative Epi[INVESTIGATOR_811996]) prepared from the ReCel l® device as an  
adjunct to meshed grafts in subjects with acute thermal burn injuries requiring 
skin grafting for closure.   
Design:   This is a p rospective, multicenter, single -arm observational study. Patients 5 years 
or older with a total body surface area (TBSA) thermal burn injury between 5 and 
50% (inclusive) who require autografting will be considered for pa rticipation in 
this study. The regenerative e pi[INVESTIGATOR_811997] (RES) prepared using the 
ReCell® device  will be applied over skin grafts meshed more widely than 
conventional autografting . RES may also be applied to donor areas.  Healing, scar 
outcomes , pain  and treatment -related adverse events will be evaluated at follow -
up visits . Data concern ing the clinical performance and safety of the ReCell 
device will be collected.   
Follow -up visits will be performed at 1, 2,  4, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_1124444] -treatment 
using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale  (POSAS) questionnaire .  
Treatment -related and serious adverse events will be captured throughout the 
study . 
At all visits, the study treatment area and RES -treated donor area will be 
documente d photographically . 
Safety 
Outcomes:  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_812000] -related and serious adverse 
events.  
Clinical  
Performance  
Outcomes:  Healing  
Treatment and RES-treated  donor area closure will be evaluated via direct 
visualization. Complete wound  closure is defined as skin re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_811998], confirmed at two consecutive study visits at least [ADDRESS_1124445] visualization by [CONTACT_093] .   
  
  Scar 
Scar outcomes will be measured using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment 
Scale  (POSAS) questionnaire which includes a component for both investigator 
and patient scar assessment.  
Treatment -area Pain  
Measured via a numeric scale (1 -10) and then as a component of the POSAS  
beginning at Week 12.  
Enrollment  Up to 60 patients  may be enrolled at up to 15 investigational sites in the United 
States.  
Statistical 
Consideration  A sample size of 60 subjects will allow for continued access of the ReCell  device 
during PMA preparation and FDA review.  Additionally, a sample size of 60 
subjects will allow for the detection of an adverse event  with true probability of 
occurrence among RES -treated subjects of ≥5% with 95% probability , allowing 
for additional characterization of safety profile of the ReCell device .  
Analyses of treatment area closure will be performed for the As Treated ( AT) and 
Per Protocol ( PP) populations.  Data will b e summarized  using counts and  
percentages  for healed/not healed , and an exact (Clopper -Pearson) two -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the true  proportion will be presented . 
The AT population includes all those enrolled into the study and treated with RES.  
The AT population will be the primary analysis population for the healing, 
POSAS and pain assessments . 
The PP population includes all AT  subjects who have no major protocol 
deviations . The PP population will serve as the secondary analysis population for 
the healing, POSAS and pain assessments.  
For evaluation of healing, scars, and pain, i t is anticipated that there will be 
minimal missing data. No imputation of missing data is planned.

 2. OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Study  Design  
 This is a multicenter, open -label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus re -irradiation among 
recurrent glioblastoma patients enrolle d to two parallel, non- comparative treatment arms 
including patients who are bevacizumab naïve (Arm A, n=30) and patients who are 
bevacizumab -resistant  (Arm B, n=30) . The toxicity of the study regimen for each cohort has not 
been formally evaluated among r ecurrent glioblastoma patients; thus a safety lead -in is included 
for e ach cohort (Section 6.1) and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab for each cohort independently.  
 Participant s will be evaluated every [ADDRESS_533492] year and every 9 weeks thereafter . Modified Response Assessment in 
Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria
1 will be used as the primary effic acy endpoint of response 
rate. RANO will be adapted as described in Section 12.0 due to the tumor response patterns seen 
with pembrolizuma b treatment (e.g., tumor flare);  these criteria will be used for treatment 
decisions  by [CONTACT_30107] . Adverse events will  be monitored throughout the trial and graded in 
severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Treatment with study therapy will continue for a 
maximum of 24 months of treatment  (up to 35 possible administrations) of pembrolizuma b, or 
until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator’s decision to withdraw the participant , 
participant  withdraws consent, pregnancy of the particip ant, noncompliance with trial treatment 
or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons. After the end of treatment, each participant  
will be followed for [ADDRESS_533493].   The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the anti- tumor activity of pembrolizumab when 
administered with re -irradiation versus the appropriate historical controls as measured by [CONTACT_422499] (ORR) and overall survival at 12 months among participant s with 
bevacizumab -naïve recurrent glioblastoma  and at 6 months for those with bevacizumab -resistant , 
recurr ent glioblastoma. S econdary objectives include safety and tolerability, progression- free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and ORR duration.  
 
This study will be conducted in conformance with Good Cl inical Practices.  
 
Specific procedures to be perfor med during the tria l, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Study Calendar Section 11.0.

 2.2 Primary Objective  
 
2.2.1 Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the comb ination of pembrolizumab and re -RT in 
bevacizumab naïve patients (Cohor t A) and bevacizumab resistant patients (Cohort B) as 
measured by [CONTACT_422500]- Oncology ( RANO, for both 
cohorts) and OS at 12 months (cohort A) and OS at 6 months (Cohort B).  
 
Hypothesis: Administration of pembrol izumab with re -irradiation will result in a clinically 
meaningful benefit compared to the appropriate historical controls as measured by [CONTACT_422501] s with recurrent glioblastoma.  
 2.3 Secondar y Objectives  
 
2.3.1 Objective:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the  therapy used in each cohort.  
2.3.2 Objective:  To estimate duration of response in each cohort per RANO criteria.  
2.3.3 Objective:  To estimate median PFS and PFS at [ADDRESS_533494] ive: To estimate median OS in each cohort.  
 Hypothes is: Intravenous adm inistration of pembrolizumab with re -irradiation will result in a 
clinically meaningful benefit compared to historical controls as measured by [CONTACT_16625], OS and ORR duration among participant s with bevacizumab -naïve and bevacizumab -refractory,  recurrent 
glioblas toma.  
 2.4 Exploratory Objectives  
 
2.4.1 Objective: To evaluate whether archival tumor expression of PD -L1, tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes features, or T cell inflamed gene expression profile are  associated with 
outcome.  
2.4.2 Objective: To evaluat e Neurologic  Assessment  in Neuro- Oncology (N ANO) in each 
cohort  
2.4.3 Objective: To evaluate the change of Patient Reported Outcome scores from baseline to 
post-baseline time -points using the EORTC QLQ -C30. 
2.4.4 Objecti ve: To estimate ORR per iRANO  
  3. BACKGROUND 
 3.1 Study Di sease (s) 
 
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain neoplasm in adults, remains incurable. Approximately 13,000 new cases of GBM are diagnosed in the US each year with an estimated global incidenc e of 3.5/100,[ADDRESS_533495] of care therapy 
which includes surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide remains poor with a media n 
survival of 14.6 months and a five year survival r ate of under 10%.[ADDRESS_533496] vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF),  is FDA -approved for recurrent GBM, a recent phase 3  study 
demonstrated  that it improves progression- free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS).5 
Furthermore, outcome following bevacizumab progression is dismal with a median OS of only 4 months.

 3.2 Pembrolizumab  
 
Refer to the pembrolizu mab Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information on pembrolizumab.  
 
3.2.1 Background  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high speci ficity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting 
its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 
(PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity a nd potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD -1.  Pembrolizumab has an ac ceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  Keytruda
® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications becau se of its mechanism of action to bind the PD -[ADDRESS_533497] immune surveillance function in controll ing outgrowth of ne oplastic 
transformations has been known for decades .7  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tis sue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies.   In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+  effector 
T-cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long- term 
survival in solid malignancies, suc h as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hep atocellular 
carcino ma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma.  Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can 
be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma .
8,[ADDRESS_533498] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of a ctivated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an immunoglobu lin (Ig) 
superfamily member related to cluster of di fferentiation 28 ( CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -
associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor 
signaling upon engagement  of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).
10,11 
 The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved.
12  PD-1 and its family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig- variable –type (IgV -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of sign aling molecules.   The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 conta ins 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif.   Following 
T-cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch m otif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase  (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signa ling cascade.11,[ADDRESS_533499] from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13015].14,15  PD -L1 has been shown to be upregulated by a number of aggressive 
cancers including glioblastoma16,17 and its expression has been associated with a poorer outcome 
among glioblastoma patients.17 As a consequ ence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma.

for recurrent GBM patients
18-21 including those who are bevacizumab- refractory22,23 and the 
safety of re -irradiation wi th concurrent bevacizumab for recurrent GBM patients  has been 
previousl y established.24 Nonetheless, the primary goal of incorporating reirradiation in this 
study is to exploit the ability of radiation therapy to augment immune responses.25 Radiati on 
therapy can enhance anti -tumor immune responses by [CONTACT_422502]: 1) 
increasing exposure of tumor antigens through immunogenic cell death and; 2)  generating 
immuno -adjuvant effects  through induction of a wide array of immuno- activatin g modulators .  
The dose and fractionation of radiotherapy can affect the degree and type of cell death in a 
tissue -specific manner26 and immunogenic cell death from radiotherapy lea ds to enhanced 
efficiency of transfer of antigens fr om dendritic cells to T -cells, which in turn are capable of 
activating tumor -specific T cells resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy.[ADDRESS_533501]- of-care 
guidelines utilizing intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3- dimensional conformal 
radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or proto n beam radiation therapy at a dose of 3.5 Gy/fraction times 
10 fractions (5 days a week for 2 weeks) . Daily image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is 
required including non- volumetric (Orthogonal or near -orthogonal 2D imaging that is integrated 
with the rad iation delivery device) and volumetric (diagnostic CT, cone beam CT with MV or 
kV x -ray beam, MRI -linac or Tomotherapy technology) systems. Although a variety of dosing 
schedules of re -irradiation have been utilized for recurrent glioblastoma patients, the  largest 
series have utilized a targeted cumulative dose of [ADDRESS_533502] been well tolerated with adverse events typi[INVESTIGATOR_422449], including fatigue, alopecia and nausea, as well as 
negligible rates of serious late events such as CNS toxicity or radiation necrosis. For example, 
among 147 patients with recurrent high -grade glioma reported by [CONTACT_422503] a 
median of 3.5 Gy/fraction times [ADDRESS_533503] developed a serious (grade 3) late

 3.4 Study Rationale  
 3.4.1 Rationale for Trial and Selected Population  
Inhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD -1) signaling, such as pem brolizumab, have achieved 
dramatic benefit across a spectrum of cancers, although only a subset of patients respond.
47 
Preliminary results of initial clinical trials evaluating pembrolizumab for recurrent GBM 
demonstrate similar findings. Among 26 patients treated with single ag ent pembrolizumab, there 
was one partial response (4%), while 44% of patients remained progression- free for at least six 
months and the median OS was 14 months.48  Results of a recently reported randomized phase 
III study of nivolumab, another PD -1 blocking antibody, confirmed a low rate of therapeutic 
benefit among recurrent glioblastoma patients.49 Specifically, the ORR for patients treated with 
nivolumab was only 8%, although the durability of radiographic respons e was encouraging at 
11.4 months. One reason for the low rate of therapeutic benefit observed to date is that GBM is a “cold” tumor, characterized by a relatively low rate of mutational load and an overall low level of immune cell infiltrate.
50-[ADDRESS_533505] of re -irradiation (re -RT), as a strategy to increase immune cell infiltration 
into the tumor microenvironment and thereby [CONTACT_422504] a “hot” t umor microenvironment, when 
combined with pembrolizumab for recurrent GBM patients.   The rationale for adding re -irradiation in the current proposal is based on several factors. First, 
preclinical data in several solid tumor types demonstrates enhanced activity when RT is 
combined with either PD -[ADDRESS_533506] benefit observed 
among a subset of recurrent GBM patient s.18,19,38 Fourth, local radiation therapy can generate  
abscopal responses at distant tumor sites among oncology patients34,58 suggesting that such 
responses be yond the targeted radiation field could provide benefit for diffusely infiltrative 
tumors such as GB M.

 In addition, a highly encouraging rate  of durable radiographic response  has been observed 
anecdotally among recurrent GBM patients treate d with PD -1 blockade and re- RT. Specifically, 
a recent retrospective series at Columbia University included 20 consecutive patients with 
recurrent high- grade glioma (18 GBM) who were treated with re -RT and anti -PD-[ADDRESS_533507] patients were heavily pre -treated including a  median number of 2 (range, 1- 4) prior salvage 
treatments while 55% h ad progressed on prior bevacizumab. Eight patients received 
pembrolizumab (2 mg/Kg q3w) and 12 patients received nivolumab (3 mg/Kg or 240 mg q2w). 
The median re- RT dose was 35 Gy (12 Gy to 35 Gy). There were 7 confirmed partial responses 
(35% ORR), including 4/9 bevacizumab naïve (44%) and 3/11 bevacizumab failure patients (27%).  The median duration of response was 5 months (2.2 to 10+ months), median PFS w as 4 
months and median OS was 10 months. There were neither obvious cases of cerebral edema related to treatment nor any new unexpected adverse events. Fifteen patients (75%) had stable or 
reduced dexamethasone dosing, while five patients (25%) required a mild increase of corticosteroid dosing (2 -4 mg).   
 Our proposed study is therefore designed to prosp ectively evaluate the role of re- RT when added 
to pembrolizumab PD-1 blockade for recurrent GBM patients.   3.4.2 Justification for Pembrolizumab Dose 
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).  Based on 
the totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor  type.  
As outlined below, this dose is justified by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demons trating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in be nefit-risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and 
• Pharmacology da ta showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically- based PK 
[PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W 
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 partic ipants were enrolled 
with melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings 
(treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 e nriched, and all -comers) and different treatment 
settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy).  Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, 
KN001  Cohort F2 and KN006).  These studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response 
relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5- to 7.5- fold difference in 
exposure.  The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed- dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest 
doses studied.  Subsequently, flat dose-exposure- response relationships were also observed in 
other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_533508], PK data in KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W.  Second, a 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533509] tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of  tumor 
penetration and PD -1 expression.  This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg 
Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. 
 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body 
weight a nd other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed- dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight based dosing, with conside rable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  Supported 
by [CONTACT_131877], and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing 
complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for 
evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.  
 
3.4.3 Rationale for E fficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
pembrolizumab when administered with re -irradi ation compared to historical controls among 
participant s with bevacizumab- naïve  (cohort A) and bevacizuma b-refractory (cohort B)  recurrent 
glioblastoma. Overall radiographic response (ORR) and overall survival at 12 months (cohort A) and overall survival at 6 m onths ( cohort B)  will be the primary endpoint s, and ORR duration, as 
well as median OS and PFS (medi an and at 6 months) will be secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Response per modified RANO criteria

3.4.[ADDRESS_533510] received pembrolizumab with re -irradiation, including 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and events of clinical interest (ECIs).  
 Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_193439], Version 4.0. The 
attribution to drug, time -of-onset, duration of the event, its resolution, and any concomitant 
medications administered will be recorded. AEs will be analyzed including but not limited to all 
AEs, SAEs, and fatal AEs. Furthermore, specific immune -related adverse events (irAEs) will be 
collected and designated as immune- related events of clinical interest (ECIs) as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].

 o  Postmenopausal female  
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause.  
• A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirm ation with two FSH measurements in the 
postmenopausal range is required.  
 Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non- hormonal highly effective contraception 
methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
 4.1.14 Women of child- bearing potential (WOCBP ; see definition above ), must agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consiste ntly and correctly as described below  
during study treatment and for 120 days after study discontinuation.

b. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  b 
c. Intrauterine device (IUD)  
d. Bilateral tubal occlusion  
e. Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contracep tion method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should 
be used.  
f. Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the stud y and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
participant.

 6. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
This is a multicenter, open -label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab with re -irradiation among 
recurrent glioblastoma patient s enrolled to two parallel non- comparative treatment arms 
including patients who are bevacizumab naïve (Cohort A) and those who have progressed on one 
prior bevacizumab regimen (Cohort B). The combinatorial regimens assessed for each cohort have not been f ormally evaluated for toxicity, thus a n initial safety lead -in will be performed to 
define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab when administered with re -irradiation (Cohort A) and when administered with 
re-irradiation and bevacizumab  (Cohort B)  as detailed below. Of note, the adverse event profiles 
of pembrolizumab, radiation therapy and bevacizumab are in general non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], thus the 
agents are expected to be well tolerated when co -administered. The dose of pembrolizumab 
administered during the safety lead- in will not exceed the established phase II dose of 
pembrolizumab when administered as monotherapy. The safety lead- in also incorporates a de -
escalati on of  pembrolizumab dosing if unexpected dose -limiting  toxicity is observed and follows 
standard 3+3 phase I guidelines. No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_422453]'s malignancy.  
Reported adverse events and  potential risks are described in Section [ADDRESS_533539] 3+3 design to determine the RP2D/MTD of 
pembrolizumab for each cohort .  Pembrolizumab will initially be administered at 200 mg (flat 
dosing) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks, which is the RP2D established for monotherapy 
administration. The dose of pembrolizumab administered during the safety lead -in will not 
exceed 200 mg IV ev ery 3 weeks. Bevacizumab will be administered at 15 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_533540] 6 patients for each cohort will be considered as safety lead -in and 
observed in groups of 3 for DLTs for an evaluation period of 42 days  (see DLT definitions  in 
Section 6 .1.1) as follows  for each cohort :  
 
• If at Dose Level 0, ≤[ADDRESS_533541] 3 patients develop DLT, 3 more patients will be 
enrolled  to Dose Level 0 . 
• If at Dose Level 0, >[ADDRESS_533542] 3 patients or >[ADDRESS_533543] 6 patients develop DLT, 
cohort enrollment will be stopped immediately, and re -started from the beginning with 
3+3 patients enrolled at a pembrolizumab dosing interval of 4 weeks ( Dose Level - 1). 
• If at Dose Level - 1, >[ADDRESS_533544] 3 patients or >1 of 6 patients develop DLT, cohort 
enrollment will be stopped immediately, and re -started from the beginning with 3+3 
patients enrolled at a pembrolizumab dosing interval of 6 weeks ( Dose Level - 2). 
• If at Dose level - 2, >[ADDRESS_533545] 6 patients develops DLT, the safety lead- in will be 
discont inued. In this case, the phase II  portion of this study to the two independent 
cohorts will not be conducted.  
NOTE: P atients will need to be assessed on or after their actual Day 42 on treatment for the DLT 
assessment to be considered comprehensive.  
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) will be determined by [CONTACT_422509] 42 days of treatment as defined below  in Section 5.1.1.  
Any necessary dose de -escalations will be made by [CONTACT_422510] (Table 3):

6.1.1 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
 
A DLT is defined as any grade ≥ [ADDRESS_533546] 42 days of study therapy; the DLT period does not necessarily need 
to include labs and other evaluations taken during cycle 3 restaging). Events that are considered 
unlikely related to pembrolizumab, but at least probably related to bevacizumab will not be considered a DLT.   
The following except ions will not be classified as DLT : 
• Grade 3 Immune -related adverse events ( irAEs  – see definition below)  that downgrade to 
Grade ≤ 2 within 5 days, or to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline within 14 days after onset of the 
event, whereby [CONTACT_218427], including systemic corticosteroids, is permitted. 
• Grade 3 asymptomatic endocrinopathy, managed with or without  systemic corticosteroid 
therapy and/or hormone replacement therapy. 
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g., inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc).  
• Grade 2 pneumonitis, neurological event, or uveitis that downgrades to Grade ≤ 1 within 3 days, whereby [CONTACT_422511]. 
• Liver transaminase elevation ≤ [ADDRESS_533547].  
• Total bilirubin ≤ [ADDRESS_533548].  
• Any pre -existing lab abnormality that deteriora tes to Grade 3/4, but where the increment 
of deterioration is considered not clinically significant by [CONTACT_10670], overall study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_38107]. 
DLT will also include grade 2 immune -related adverse events that occur during the DLT per iod 
defined above that require interruption of pembrolizumab and do not improve to grade ≤ 1 with appropriate supportive care and symptomatic treatment with 14 days.  Immune- related adverse events (irAEs) are defined as AEs of immune nature (i.e., inflamma tory) 
in the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  In the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
26 
 While rules for adjudicating DLTs are specified above, an AE of Grade < 3 (except if listed as 
exempt above), may also be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the Sponsor and the overall study Principal Investigator, based on the established  safety profile of pembrolizumab. 
 Patients who experience DLT will be discontinued from study therapy and will enter the post -
study follow-up phase of the study (see Section 6.9-6.12).  
 Adverse events that meet DLT criteria but occur outside the DLT window will be classified as unacceptable AEs  and study treatment will be discontinued per Section 6.8  
 6.2 Phase II Treatment Regimen  
 
The dose of pembrolizumab to be administered in this trial for all patients (cohort A and cohort 
B) is 200 mg (flat dosing) every three weeks intravenously because this is the FDA  approved 
dosing schedule for melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma and microsatellite instability -
high cancers (see pembrolizumab package insert).  Re- irradiation will be administered to patients 
on cohort A and cohort B to achieve [ADDRESS_533549] previously progressed on bevacizumab will continue bevacizumab – or biosimilar - at a dose of 
15 mg/kg intravenously every three  week s. 
 
Eligible , beva cizumab -naive patients will enroll to  receive pembrolizumab plus re -irradiation 
(Cohort A; n=30) . Eligible patients who have progressed on one prior bevacizumab regimen will 
enroll to receive pembrolizumab plus re -irradiation plus bevaciz umab (or biosimilar)  
continuation (Cohort B; n=30) . The outcome of each treatment arm will be assessed separately 
relative to appropriate historical controls.  
 
Each treatment cycle for both cohorts will be 3 weeks ( 21 days).  
 
The therapeutic agents to be used in this trial are outlined b elow in Table 3.

 6.3 Allocation of accrual to two parallel non -comparative treatment arms  
 
Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be enroll ed to the appropriate treatment cohort of the 
study at the time of registration in  the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore  
directly by [CONTACT_422512] ( for DF/HCC patients) or by [CONTACT_422513] ( for 
External Sites); see Section 5 . The outcome for each treatment arm will be assessed separately 
relative to app ropriate historical controls.  
 
6.3.1 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigators and participant s will know the 
treatment administered.  
 6.3.2 Stratification  
Participants on this trial will be stratified to either Cohort A or Cohort B  based on previous 
treatment with bevacizumab . 
 6.4 Patient Evaluability and Replacement  
 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on both the intent -to-treat (ITT) and the per -
protocol ( PP) populations. Patients who receive at least one  dose of pembrolizumab and at least 
baseline and one post -baseline disease assessment will be included in the ITT population. 
Patients who receive at least 75% of the planned study re -irradiation therapy doses for each 
cohort  and at least one dose of pembr olizumab , as well as respective disease assessments, 
without major protocol violations, are considered fully evaluable and will be included in the PP population.  6.5 Agent Administration  
 
Trial treatment should be administered after all  procedures/assessments  have been completed as 
detailed on the Study Calendar ( Section 11.0).  
 Order of Administration:  
• For cohort B participants : On days when participants receive both pembrolizumab and 
bevacizumab  (or biosimi lar), pembrolizumab will be administered first (see section 6.4.1 
for more information) .  
• For all participants: When radiation is received on the same day as another study agent, it 
does not matter whether radiation is given before or after  the other study agent(s).  
 
Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days befor e or after  the scheduled day  of each cycle 
due to administrative reasons. All study treatments are anticipated to be administered on an 
outpatient basis; however, inpatient administration is  permitted.  
 6.5.[ADDRESS_533552] ion of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 3.4.2 – 
Background and Rationale.  
 
The dose amount required to prepare the pembrolizumab infusion solution will be 200 mg (flat dosing) for patients enrolled to both cohorts of this study. Pembr olizumab will start within  1 
week of the start of re- irradiation and will then be administered at a dose frequency of every 3 
weeks (+/ -3 days) , on Day  1 of each 21- day treatment cycle. Pembrolizumab will be 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
28 
 administer ed as a 30 minute IV infusion.  S ites should make every effort to target infusion timing 
to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from 
site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and + 10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 
minutes: - 5 min/+10 min).  
 
For cohort B participants receiving pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (or biosimilar) , 
pembrolizumab will be administered first, and bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  will begin no sooner 
than [ADDRESS_533553] cycle of therapy. Thereafter 
bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  may begin upon completion of pembrolizumab.  
 The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.  Pembrolizumab will be provided to patients enrolled on this study by [CONTACT_57005].

guidelines utilizing intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3- dimensional conformal 
radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or proton beam radiation therapy at a dose of 3.5 Gy/fraction times 
10 fractions (5 days a week for 2 weeks). Daily image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is 
required including non- volumetric (orthogonal or near -orthogonal 2D imaging that is integrated 
with the radiation delivery device) and volumetric (diagnostic CT, cone beam CT with MV or 
kV X- ray beam, MRI -linac or tomotherapy technology) systems.   Please refer to Appendix H for 
Recommended Radiation Therapy Guidelines (to be provided to radiation oncologist).  Participants are permitted to receive re -irradiation on study as described in this section (and 
Appendix H ) at the following locations:  
a. the Radiation Oncology Department of the participating institution; 
b. an IRB -approved satellite site of the participating institution;  
c. any NRG Oncology-approved site; 
d. or at another location, with prior documented approval from the study’s Overall PI . 
 
Re-irradiation will ideally start on Day 1 of pembrolizumab/bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  Cycle 
1, but can start +/- 7 days from C1D1.  6.5.3 Bevacizumab  (or biosimilar)*
 Administration  
* DFCI recently released a guideline re: the use of commercial biosimilars in cl inical trials, 
which states : “for standard of care treatment using biologic products in a clinical trial that are not 
paid for by [CONTACT_422514]’s insurance, the biosimilar products dictated by [CONTACT_102]’s insurance would be used.”  Therefore, on this study, sponsor will allow the use of a bevacizumab biosimilar .  
 
For cohort B participants receiving pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (or biosimila r), 
bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  will be dosed at 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (+/ - 3 days) , 
on D ay 1 of each 21- day treatment cycle.  Doses of bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  must be at leas t 
10 days apart. The baseline weight of the participant will be used to calculate the bevacizumab (or biosimilar)
 dose unless ther e is a ≥ 10% change during the course of the study.  Alternatively, 
institutional standard practice for weight -based dose re -calculations can be utilized for 
bevacizumab  (or biosimilar)  dosing, provided site gets Overall PI’s documented approval to do 
so prospectively.  The  rationale for the selection of bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  dosing used in

 this study is provided in the bevacizumab package insert. Bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  will begin 
with the first pembrolizumab dose. The bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  infusion will begin no 
sooner than [ADDRESS_533555] cycle of therapy. Thereafter 
bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  may begin upon completion of pembrolizum ab whenever both 
infusions fall on the same day. Bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  should be stored, prepared and 
administered in accordance with each site’s institutional standards. 
 
6.6 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
 
6.6.1 Initiation of Pembrolizumab and Re -irradiation (Cycle 1, day 1)  
Initiation of pembrolizumab and re -irradiation (plus bevac izumab - or biosimilar  - for Cohort B 
participants) will commence for patients meeting clinical and laboratory eligib ility criteria 
defined in Section 4. Results of assessments performed during eligibility screening (within 14 
days of initiation of study t herapy) will be sufficient to start study therapy and will not need to be 
repeated prior to Cycle 1, day 1. 
 6.6.2 Subseque nt Cycles  
PEMBROLIZUMAB: Pembrolizumab dosing will continue every 3 wee ks (+/- 3 days)  unless 
criteria for dose interruption (Section 7.2) or study therapy discontinuation criteria (Section 6.7) 
are met. In the event of a dose delay, dosing will be resumed  when criteria to resume treatment 
(Section 7.2)  are met.  
BEVACIZUMAB  (OR BIOSIMILAR ): For cohort B participants, bevacizumab (or biosimila r)
 
will continue every 3 weeks (+/ - 3 days)  unless criteria for dose delay (Section 7.4) or study 
discontinuation criteria ( Section 6.7) are met. In the event of a dose delay, dosing will be 
resumed when criteria to resume treatment ( Section 7.4) are met.  
IN THE EVENT OF A DOSE DELAY ON COHORT B:  
In the event that both study drugs are held, dosing with either drug will resume  when criteria to 
resume t reatment  with that drug are met  (Sectio n 7.2 for pembrolizumab and Section 7.4 for 
bevacizumab  – or biosimila r).  
NOTE: In the event that only one study drug is held, treatment with that drug will not be 
provided mid- cycle; that cycle’s dose will be skipped and treatment with that drug will res ume 
on D ay 1 of the subsequent cycle, provided criteria to restart t reatment is met at that time .  
6.7 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion c riteria  (Sections 4.2 &  
6.6.2)  are not allowed during the ongoing trial except as outlined b elow.  If there is a clinical 
indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination m ay be required.  The treating investigator 
should discuss any questi ons regarding this with the sponsor and the overall study PI [INVESTIGATOR_28677].  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the treating 
physician .  However, the  decision to continue the participant  on trial therapy or vaccination 
schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, Sponsor  & Overall stu dy PI [INVESTIGATOR_28677], and the participan t.

 6.7.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers neces sary for a participan t’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
inclu ding all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, 
and date may also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medicatio ns received within [ADDRESS_533556] dose of trial treatment sho uld be recorded for SAE s and 
ECIs as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
6.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Participant s are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_47416]: 
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy not specified in this protocol  
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the firs t dose of study treatme nt and while 
participating in the study.  Examples of live vaccines in clude, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, 
and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccine s for injection are gen erally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal infl uenza vaccines (eg, 
FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical intere st of suspected immunologic etiology or for the treatment of 
cerebral edema or supportive post -operative management.  The use of physiologic 
replacement doses of corticosteroids for conditions such as adrenal insufficiency and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]/hypothalamic dysfunct ion are allowed . 
Participants who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for a part icipant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the Inves tigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].   
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing study.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study therapy or vaccination may be required.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vacci nation rests with the 
investigator and/or the participant's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
participant on study treatment requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor and the participant.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_165838] P ost-Treatment Follow -up Phase.

 6.7.3 General Supportive Care Guidelines  
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the manageme nt of AEs with 
potentia l immunologic etiology are outlined in Section 6.6.4 along with the pe mbrolizumab dose 
modi fication guidelines in Section 7.2.  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of 
oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of cor ticosteroids.  Note that several courses of 
steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  
For each disorder, attemp ts should be made to rule  out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral i nfection, which might require additional supportive care.  The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the Investigator determines the events to be re lated to 
pembrolizumab.  
 Participant s should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_110525]:  
• Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggress ively, and consideration 
should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice.  Participant s should be strongly 
encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
• Infectio n: Participant s with a documented infectious complication should receive oral or 
IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_313227] a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional prac tice. 
• Immune -related ad verse events: Please see Section 6.6.4 below regarding diagnosis and 
management of adverse experiences of a potential immunologic etiology.   
 
6.7.4 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Participant s should receive appropriate supportive care measur es as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_422515].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below  and in Section 7.2.  Where appropriate, these 
guidelines include the use of oral or IV  treatment with cortico steroids as well as additional anti-
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note 
that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each  disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes 
such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the I nvestigator 
determines th e events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
 
Note: If after the evaluati on, the event is determined not to be related, the Investigator does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below  and Section 7.2).   
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. Additional guidance for organ specific immune -
related adverse events includes:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroid s. When symptoms improve to Grade 
1 or less, steroid taper should be s tarted and continued over no less than 4 weeks.

Participant s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pai n, blood or mucus in st ool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritone al signs and ileus).  In symptomatic participant s, infectious 
etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, endoscopic 
evaluation s hould be considered.  
o All participant s who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to dr ink liberal quantities 
of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, c onsider GI consultation and 
endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_422516].   
o When symptoms im prove to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continue d 
over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia  
For Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥  Grade 3 
hyper glycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Gr ade 3 -4 
hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
o Evaluate participant s wit h serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated 
hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypophysitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with corticosteroids. W hen symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less,

 [IP_ADDRESS] Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor participant s for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
o Grade 2 hypert hyroidism events (and Grade 2- 4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as 
initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement  therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
 o Grade 3 -4 hypert hyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be  started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be requi red as 
the steroid dose is tapered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic:  
o For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to baseline values (consider weekly). 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal failure or nephritis:  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with sys temic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Infusion Reactions :  
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and gener ally resolve 
completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.

Due to the immunologic nature of  anti-PD-1 therapy  administration, cer ebral edema could 
theoretically result as a consequence of anti -PD-1 therapy  administration due to immune 
infiltration of the brain. In addition, re -irradiation is expected to elicit cerebral edema.60 
Symptoms related to cerebral edema may include headache or neurologic deficit that is either 
new or worsened. Participants w ith any signs or symptoms of cerebral edema in the investigator's 
judgement should be treated as clinically appropriate including initiation or increased systemic 
corticosteroid dosing, treatment with an osmotic diuretic or surgical decompression. Subseque nt 
pembrolizumab dosing should be immediately interrupted if significant clinical symptoms 
attrib utable to cerebral edema in the investigator's judgement develop. Treatment with additional 
pembrolizumab doses may only be re -initiated if clinically signific ant symptoms attributable to 
cerebral edema have stabilized or significantly resolved in the investigator's judgement. 
Participants who develop gr 4 cerebral edema (CTCAE v.4) attributable to pembrolizumab 
administration in the investigator's judgement sh ould not receive further pembrolizumab doses. 
Of note, gr 4 cerebral edema ( CTCAE v.4) is defined as life -threatening or requiring urgent 
intervention. For  this study, urgent intervention refers to interventions such as intensive care 
(ICU) admission, intubation for hyperventilation, administration of hypertonic or hyperosmotic agents and surgical deco mpression.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity  
Anti-PD-1 therapy can rarely cause adverse events involving the peripheral and central nervous 
system  including, but not limited to: neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, aseptic meningitis, 
paraneoplastic syndromes and encephalitis.
[ADDRESS_533558] 1 month. Based on l imited data from clinical studies in 
patients whose CNS immune -related adverse reactions could not be controlled with 
corticosteroid use, administration of ot her systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. 
Resume pembrolizumab  when the CNS immune -mediat ed adverse reaction remains at Grade  1 
or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue pembrolizumab for any Grade  ≥ 
3 CNS immune -mediated adv erse reaction and for any life -threatening immune -mediated 
adverse reaction .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension  
For gr ade ≥ 2, consider initiation of anti -hypertensive therapy per institutional guidelines. 
 
6.7.5 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diet 
Participant s should maintain  a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomit ing. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception  
Pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  
Refer to Section 4.1.14 for approved methods of contraception for female participants who are 
WOCP (defined in Section 4.1.13), and refer to Section 4.1.15 for  approved methods of 
contraception for male participants .

Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533559] azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition.)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Use in Pregnancy  
If a participant inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the participant will be immediately d iscontinued from study treatment.  The site will contact [CONTACT_422517]’s status until the pregnancy has been 
completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_006] within 2 working day s if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (eg, death, abortion, congenital 
anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The 
study Investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outc ome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to [COMPANY_006].  If a male participant impregnate s his female partner, the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious a dverse reactions in the nursing 
infant, participant s who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
6.8 Duration of Therapy and Criteria  for Taking Participants Off Protocol  Treatment  
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of  disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), study treatment may 
continue up to c ompletion  of 35 pembrolizumab treatments (approximately 2 years) , or until one 
of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease pr ogression (see modified RANO criteria and confirmation of disease 
progression criteria in Sections 12.2 and 12.5)  
• Unacceptable adverse event( s) 
• Recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_11922]/or sponsor, place s the participant at unnecessary 
risk from continued administration of study tre atment.  
• General or  specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
• Any progression or recurrence of any malignancy, or any occurrence of another malignan cy that requires active treatment  
• The participant  has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• Participan t decides to withdraw from the protocol t herapy 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent. 
• The participant  is lost to follow -up 
• Termination of the trial by [CONTACT_1758]’s sponsor.

 6.16 Criteria for Early Trial Term ination 
 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this  or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to participants  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriat e adjustments to participant treatment can be made.  
 
 7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated below.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) 
version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website

7.1 Dose Selection/Modification: General Information  
 7.1.[ADDRESS_533568] weekly until 
resolution; if the adverse event does not resolve  within 4 weeks, the interval for testing may be 
reduced after consultation and written approval by [CONTACT_318595] (or  his 
designee).  
 7.1.3 For Cohort A participants:  
[IP_ADDRESS] In the event of a treatment delay due to a toxicity, the cycle count should be interrupted until the criteria to resume treatment with pembrolizumab are met . 
7.1.4 For Cohort B participants:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study drugs are either held together or separately, depending on the reason for the hold. 
[IP_ADDRESS] If only one study drug is held, then the cycle count continues.  If both study drugs are held, then cycle count should be interrupted until the criteria to 
resume treatment are met .  
NOTE: In the event that only one study drug is held, treatment with that drug will not be 
provided mid- cycle; that cycle’s dos e will be skipped and treatment with that drug will 
resume on Day 1 of the subsequent cycle, provided criteria to restart treatment is met at that time . 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533569] of the patient -  the investigator wants to hold study agent(s) 
after an adverse event in a manner not outlined in Section 7, this is permissible fo llowing 
discussion and agreement with the overall Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_187860] A. Reardon or 
designee.  
 
7.1.6 For holds due to related toxicities, if the participant does not meet criter ia to resume 
treatment within 12 weeks of the date of the toxicity (unl ess otherwise specified in the protocol), 
the participant must permanently discontinue the relevant study agent. However, if the 
participant is benefiting from the study, the investigat or may contact [CONTACT_28859], [CONTACT_187860] A. Reardon or designee to determine if the participant can remain on 
study.  7.1.7 For al l holds for reasons other than treatment- related toxicities  
1. Ideally, participants will be placed back on study t herapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption (a 6 week hold);  
2. However, the hold may be extended to [ADDRESS_533570] receive appr oval from 
the overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422456] t o extend the hold 
and continue to treat the participant on study.     
 7.1.8 A participant in Cohort B  is only conside red to be off -treatment if s/he has 
discontinued both pembrolizumab and bevacizumab  (or biosimilar) .  If the participant is 
discontinued from  p embrolizumab but continues treatment with bevacizumab  - or biosimilar
 (or 
if the participant is discontinued from treatment with  bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  but continues 
pembrolizuma b), s/he will continue to be monitored per the regular study schedule.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_533571] possibly related to pembrolizumab are 
summarized in Table 5 (immune -related events) and Table 6 . If adverse events occur that require 
holding pembrolizumab, the dose wi ll remain the same once treatment resumes. Patients who 
require pembroliz umab  hold or discontinuation are permitted to continue to receive study 
treatment with bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  alone. 
Pembrolizumab will be withheld for drug- related Grade 4 hemat ologic toxicities, non-
hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 including laborat ory abnormalities despi[INVESTIGATOR_422457], and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table 6 
below.

41 
 NOTE: Subjects who experience a recurren ce of the same severe or life- threatening event 
at the same grade or greater wi th re- challenge of pembrolizumab should be discontinued 
from treatment with Pembrolilzumab.  
 
Immune -related AEs associated with pembrolizumab : AEs associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These immune -related AEs (irAEs ) may occur 
shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. Therefore, earl y reco gnition and initiation 
of treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study data, most 
irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure 
adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests 
such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroid s. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with 
pembroli zumab are provided below  in Table 5.  
 
  Page 42  General irAE I nstructions:  
1. Severe and life- threatenin g irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_422518]. Other immunosuppressive treatment should begin if the 
irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].  
2. Study intervention must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve  or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10 mg/day within [ADDRESS_533572]  study 
intervention  treatment.  
3. The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_533573] 4 weeks.  
4. If study intervention has been withheld, study intervention  may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤  Grade  1 after corticosteroid taper.

Pembrolizumab ma y be interrupted for situati ons other than treatment -related AEs such as 
medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. For all holds for 
reasons other than treatment -related tox icities: 
1. Ideally, participants will be placed b ack on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption (a 6 week hold);  
2. However, the hold may be extended to [ADDRESS_533598] receive approval from the overall Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422459].     
The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record  
 
 7.3 Re-Irradiation Dose Modification/Interruption /Discontinuation  
 
There will be no dose modifications for re -irradiation dosing. Any toxicity assoc iated or pos sibly 
associated with re -irradiation  treatment should be managed according to standard medical 
practice. Participants who develop significant (grade ≥ 3) toxicity related to re -irradiation should 
be managed with maximal medical therapy and may be considered for dose interruption if inadequately respons ive to maximal medical thera py. Every effort should be made to resume re -
irradiation as soon as possible.  
For any participant  requir ing interruption of re -irradiation for > 1 week : Sites must contact [CONTACT_118736] [INVESTIGATOR_422460] s whether it is in the patient’s best interest to resum e re-irradiation therapy or

There are no reductions in the bevacizumab (or b iosimilar)  dose. Guidelines for bevacizumab (or 
biosimilar)  dose management due to adverse events considered at least possibly related to 
bevacizumab (or biosimilar)  are summarized i n Table 7 . If adverse events occur tha t require

 8.2 Definitions  
 8.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533600] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse even t can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related  to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is tempora lly associ ated with the use of the 
[COMPANY_006] ’s product, is also an adverse event.  
 Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_121254] a physiologically appropriate time. 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.   8.2.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that :  
• Results in deat h 
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the perso n was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires  or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considere d SAEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopar dize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the bel ow criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are re portable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as 
SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, the following events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892]: 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
54 
 • Is a new cancer (th at is not a condition of the study); 
• Is associated with an o verdose. 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events in this trial are  
• Lymphopenia (grades 2-4) 
• Progression of the cancer under study 
• A visit to the emergency room or an other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_422461] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] > 24 hours  (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening 
event)  
• And hospi[INVESTIGATOR_422462]: 
o routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with a ny 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
o seizure, if felt related to patient’s underlying disease  
o routine health assessment for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy) 
o elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -exist ing condition that did not worsen 
o scheduled debulking surgery  
o treatment of patient’s underlying disease (e.g. admission after patient is removed 
from active study treatment for craniotomy) 
o emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the ser ious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
o respi[INVESTIGATOR_422463] 
o another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical interve ntion (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver r espi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
 
8.3 Evaluating Adverse Events 
 All adverse events will be evaluated and assessed by a qualified Investigator (physician, when necessary per local  institutional policy) for determinations of: 
1. Gradea, per NC I Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.[ADDRESS_533601] each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. 
2. Seriousnessa as defined i n Section 8.2.2, regardless of CTCAE grade  
3. Attributiona to each of the aspects of study treatment: Pembrolizumab, Re -Irradiation (when 
applicable), and bevacizumab (or biosimilar , when applicableb.  Attributio n of AEs must be 
classified based on the follo wing definitions: 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study agent/ treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study agent/ treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study agent/ treatme nt. 
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to  the study agent/ treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study agent/ treatment.  
4. Expectednessa with each of the aspects of study treatment: Pembrolizumab, Re -Irrad iation 
(when applicable), and bevacizumab (or biosimilar) , when applicable .  Adverse events can be 
'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'

If yes, did the AE 
resol ve or improve?  If yes  … Then this is a positive dechallenge  
If no  … Then this is a negative dechallenge  
• Rechallenge d, e: Was the subject re-exposed to the study drug/treatment? 
If yes, did the AE 
recur or worsen?  If yes  … Then this is a positive rechallenge  
If no  … Then this is a negative rechallenge  
 
7. Whether event meets definition of an Event  of Clinical Interest ( ECI) ; see section [IP_ADDRESS] of 
the protocol for definition.  
NOTE : For events that are secondary to an event  deem ed expected with a study agent/modality (e.g. 
rectal pain as a result of diarrhea), please record as “possibly related to” and “expected with” the 
agent/modality. 
Footnotes for Evaluating Advers e Events  
a. These assessments should be recorded by [CONTACT_422522], and maintained in either the 
patient’s research chart or medical record for review by [CONTACT_422523].  
b. For Cohort B ( in which multiple agents are  administered as part of a combination regimen) , the inve stigator 
may attribute each adv erse event causality to the combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination.  
In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regime n (i.e., to all agents in the 
regimen). However, causalit y attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], there 
is sufficient data to support full attribution of the adverse experience to the single agent.  
c. This criterion is  not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or perma nent disability; or (2) the AE 
resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_422464]  
d. This criterion is not applicable if the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability  
e. If a rechallenge is p lanned for an AE which was serious and which may have been caused by [CONTACT_378159]/treatmen t, or if reexposure to the drug/treatment poses additional potential significant risk to the 
subject, then the rechallenge MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE by [CONTACT_52488] , as per dose 
modification guidelines in the protocol.  
 
8.3.1 Evaluating Adverse Events for [COMPANY_006]  
See Table 8 below for [COMPANY_006] clarifications re: Evaluating Adverse Events.  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event  which 
changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_77990]/worksheets.  
 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for  seriousness. 
  Page 56  Table 8. [COMPANY_006]  Clarifications re: Evaluating Adverse Events 
 
A qualified  investigator (physician, when necessary per local institutional policy) , will evaluate all adverse events as to : 
 
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid s ymptoms; clinical or diagnostic  observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediatel y life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_422465]; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade [ADDRESS_533602] that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediat e risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This  does not include an 
adverse ev ent that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption o f one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an exist ing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measur e for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a n elective procedure to treat a  pre-existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre- existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a [COMPANY_006] product and is documented in 
the patient’s medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (althoug h not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sp onsor within 24 hours and to Me rck within 2 
working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose i s considered a serious adverse event for collection purpo ses. An 
overdose that is not as sociated with an adverse event is considered a non- serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_533603] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previ ously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_533604] to be discontinued?  
Relatio nship to 
[COMPANY_006] Product   Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provi ded by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated ini tials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between th e test drug and the adverse event 
based upo n the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more like ly the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that th e subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect , or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials wit h investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental 
factors

8.4.1 Assessing  and Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of pembrolizumab in this clinical trial or 
within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or i ntentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
 Adverse events may also occur in screened participant s during any pre -allocation baseline period 
as a result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, pl acebo treatment or a procedure.  
 All AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomizat ion must be reported by [CONTACT_422524], or is the result of a protocol -specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a procedur e.  
• All AEs from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_533606] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
• All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_533607] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
• All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, from the time of treatment allocation/randomization thr ough [ADDRESS_533608] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
• Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified above must be reported immediately by [CONTACT_422525]- related.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE or other reportable safety events in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at 
any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be re asonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly notify [COMPANY_006].  8.4.2 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or great er (≥5 times the indicated dose ).  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of  pembrolizumab . In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab  should be discontinued 
and the participa nt should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  App ropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.

Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD -
1receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro 
data,  pembrol izumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking act ivity for PD -1.  
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is being advanced for clinical 
development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  Additional detailed information on pembrolizumab is available in the Investigator’ s Brochure. 
 The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropriate records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution and usage of investigational product in accordance with the protocol and any ap plicable laws and regulations. 
 
9.1.1 Description  
Pembrolizumab is a humanized anti -PD-1 mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilizing 
S228P sequence alteration in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region.  Pembrolizumab binds to 
human PD -1 and blocks the i nteraction between PD -1 and its ligands. The theoretical molecular 
weight of the polypeptide is 146,288 Da and its theoretical pI [CONTACT_832] 7.5.  Pembrolizumab exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at dose levels of clinical relevance (1 -10 mg/kg). It exhibits low 
clearance and limited volume of distribution that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_422473]. Mean estimated t1/2 values are 14.1- 21.6 days. Additional information on pembrolizumab

Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
68 9.2 Bevacizumab * 
 
* DFCI recently released a guideline re: the use of commercial biosimilars in clinical trials, 
which states : “for standard of care treatment using biologic produc ts in a clinical trial that are not 
paid for by [CONTACT_422514]’s insurance, the biosimilar 
products dictated by [CONTACT_102]’s insurance would be used.”  Therefore, on this study, sponsor 
will allow the use of a bevacizumab biosimilar .  
 
Bevacizumab  (NSC # 704865) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all 
biologically active isoforms of human VEGF (or VEGF -A) with high affinity (kd = 1.1 nM). The 
antibody consists of a human IgG1 frame work and the antigen- binding complementarity -
determining regions from the murine anti -VEGF MAb A.[IP_ADDRESS] -18. Bevacizumab is 
commercially available and FDA approved for participants with recurrent glioblastoma. For further details and molecule characterizatio n, see the bevacizumab FDA labeling information 
available at:  
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search. DrugDetails
 
The pharmacokinetic profile of bevacizumab was assessed us ing an assay that measures total 
serum bevacizumab concentrations (i.e., the assay did not distinguish between free bevacizumab and bevacizumab bound to VEGF ligand). Based on a populat ion pharmacokinetic analysis of 
491 participants who received 1 to 20 mg/kg of bevacizumab weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks, the estimated half -life of bevacizumab was approximately 20 days (r ange 11−50 days). 
The predicted time to reach steady stat e was 100 days. The accumulation ratio following a dose 
of 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab every 2 weeks was 2.8.  
The clearance of bevacizumab varied by [CONTACT_18694], gender, and tumor burden. After correctin g for body weight, males had a higher bevacizumab clearan ce (0.262 L/day vs. 0.207 
L/day) and a larger Vc (3.25 L vs. 2.66 L) than females. Participants with higher tumor burden (at or above median value of tumor surface area) had a higher bevacizumab clearance (0.249 L/day vs. 0.199 L/day) than participants with tumor burdens below the median.  9.2.1 Form  
Bevacizumab is a clear to sligh tly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, sterile liquid concentrate 
for solution for intravenous (IV) infusion. Vials contain bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and ste rile water for injection (SWFI), USP. Vials contain no preservative and 
are suitable for single use only.  
This agent is commercially obtained and is manufactured by [CONTACT_8229].  
 
9.2.2 Storage and Stabil ity 
According to guidelines specified in the package inse rt. 
 9.2.3 Preparation  
According to guidelines specified in the package inse rt. 
 9.2.4 Administration

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422480].  
ff. Survival: Date of death and reason should be collected for overall survi val purposes, when ap plicable.  
gg. Although an explanation must be documented and filed in patient’s research chart, the following scenarios will 
not be considered protocol violations  if the circumstances are beyond the study team’s ability to control:  
• Patient is unable to be weighed by [CONTACT_422540], and weight is not needed at that visit for bev 
dose calculation.  
• Missed EOT or 30 -day-follow -up labs or assessments if decision to come off active study treatment is 
made when patient is not on site  
• Urinalysis is not per formed at a given timepoint because patient is PHYSICALLY UNABLE to provide a 
sample  
• Blood sample is collected but hemolyzes prior to analysis  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533639] 
 
Tumor r esponse will be assessed by [CONTACT_9268] (or CT, if MRI contraindica ted) every [ADDRESS_533640] year, and then every 9 weeks (Day [ADDRESS_533641] cycle)  
thereafter.  Scans should be performed within 7 days prior to the cycle start (and ideally within 3 
days prior).  Adjustments to this -7 day window  are allowable per the treating physician’s 
discretion; however, restaging scans MUST BE performed and reviewed before the subsequent cycle’s dose may be initiated.
  Modified RANO criteria1  will be  utilized as outlined below . 
Clinicians may repeat response assessment more frequently as clinically indicated.  
NOTE : In the event that a study patient has a treatment -delay, the imaging interval will be 
maintained at every 6 weeks (every 9 weeks after 1 year on treatment)  rather than adjusted to 
align with updated timing of odd cycle restaging. 
Local radiologic  assessment of tumor measurements will be used during the study for clinical 
management and investigator -assessed disease progression. Cases of susp ected radiologic dise ase 
progression will be confirmed by [CONTACT_47486] (or CT, as applicable) performed approximat ely [ADDRESS_533642] Definitions  
 
12.1.1 Evaluable for toxicity: All participants who r eceive at least one dose of study treatment 
will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
12.1.2 Evaluable for objective response : Only those participants who have measurable disease 
present at baseline (obtained within 14 days of cycle 1, day 1) scan and have received at least one dose of therapy will be considered evaluab le for response. These participants will 
have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease prog ression or die prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)  
12.1.3 Measurab le disease: Bi-dimensionally, contrast -enhancing, measurable lesions with clearly 
defined margins by [CONTACT_28842], with a minimal diameter of [ADDRESS_533643] two to be followed before a participant is entered on study.  The remaining lesions will be considered non- measurable for the purpose of objective response determination.  
Unless progression is observed, objective response can only be determined when all measurable and non- measurable lesions are assessed.  
12.1.4 Non-measurable evaluable disease : Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with 
margins not clearly defined, lesions with maximal diameter < 1cm.  
 12.2 Response/Progression Categories  
 
Investigator- assessed tumor response will be based upon RANO /iRANO criteria. Radiologic  
response will be assessed by [CONTACT_422541]- treatment MRI scans. 
Radiologic progression will be determined by [CONTACT_422542]. Tab le 13 describes the radiologic and 
clinical criteria that will be used for determining tumor response.

Increase in corticosteroids alone will not be taken into account in determining progression in the

Of note, patients who require increased corticosteroids within two weeks of MRI assessment (relative to the dose taken at the time of the prior assessment) cannot be classified as CR, PR or SD and should be classified as non- evaluable at that time point. Conversely, patie nts who decrease 
corticosteroids within two weeks of MRI assessment (relative to the dose taken at the time of the prior assessment) cannot be classified as PD and should be classified as non- evaluable.  
 12.[ADDRESS_533645] response re corded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression (taking as  reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements  recorded since 
the treatment started). If a response recorded at one scheduled MRI does not  persist at the next 
regular scheduled MRI, the response will still be recorded based on the  prior scan, but will be 
designated as a non -sustained response. If the response is sustained,  i.e. still present on the 
subsequent MRI  at least four weeks later , it will be recorded as a sustained response, lasting until 
the time of tumor progression. Participants without measurable disease may only achieve  SD or PD 
as their best “response.”  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533646] scans (i.e. pseudoprogression). In addition, the response patterns seen with immunotherap eutics may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_358554], and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. For these reasons, the immune -related response 
criteria (irRC) have endorsed continuation of study therapy beyond initial radiographic evidence of 
progression for clinically stable patients undergoing immune based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
[ADDRESS_533647] RANO may not provide an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as  pembrolizumab. 
 
Therefore, the following adaptations of the RANO criteria, as reflected in the Immunologic Response Ass essment in Neuro -Oncology (iRANO) criteria
66 will be used to assess response for 
patients treated on this study ( Table 1 5): 
• Potential P seudoprogression: If radio logic imaging shows initial PD, participant s who are 
not experiencing significant clinical decline, may be allowed to continue study treatment for up to three months. Patients who have radiographic evidence of further progression after up to three months, or who decline significantly at any time, will be classified as progressive  
with the date of disease progression back- dated to the first date that the participant  met 
criteria for progression and such participant s will be discontinued from study therapy. 
Although the kinetics of pseudoprogression due to immune checkpoint blockade  among 
glioblastoma patients is currently unknown, three months is a reasonable estimate based on: 1) the peak time for XRT/daily temozolomide -related pseudoprogression is usually w ithin 
three months of completion for glioblastoma patients
64,65 and; 2) three months is also the 
most co mmon timeframe for pseudoprogression observed among patients with advanced 
melanoma or other solid tumors treated with PD -1/PD- L1immune checkpoint blockade to 
date.67-69  
 
Among patients on this study with initial radiographic PD, tumor  assessment should be 
repeated regularly in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment as described below while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. If repeat imaging shows a stabilization or reduction in the tumor burden compa red to the initial scan 
demonstrating PD, treatment may be continued / resumed. If repeat imaging after up to three months confirms progressive disease, then the date of disease progression will be the first date the participant  met criteria for progressio n and participant s will be discontinued from 
study therapy. Participant s who have confirmed disease progression will  discontinue study 
medication and enter the follow up/survival phase of the study. In determining whether or 
not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, investigators should consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions.

Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533648] initial evidence of radiographic PD, it is at the discretion of the treating 
physician whether to continue a participant  on study treatment for up to three months pending 
confirmation of PD on follow -up imaging. This clinical judgment decision should be based on the 
participant ’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, and 
laboratory data. Participa nts may receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if 
they are not experiencing significant clinical decline and if:  
• The participant is believed to demonstrate clinical benefit from the study regimen as 
determined by [CONTACT_1963];  
• The participant  is adequately tolerating study therapy.

 The Neurologic Assessment in Neuro- Oncology (NANO) scale (Appendix D ) was developed by [CONTACT_422545], multidisciplin ary committee of neuro -oncology experts to objectively assess 
neurologic function of neuro- oncology patients.
70 In this trial, the NANO scale will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_422546] -level at baseline (prior to ignition of study 
treatment) as well as at each clinic visit that includes an MRI evaluation as  a method to characterize 
relevant changes in neurologic function. Of note, the NANO scale will not be used in this study to define clinical progression because the scale has not been adequately validated to date.

83 14. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
 
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. If, after the study 
has begun, changes are made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods 
related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E -9). 
Changes to exploratory or other non-confi rmatory analyses made after the protocol has been 
finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for the study. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. N o separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the primary, se condary and e xploratory 
endpoints will be issued for this study.  14.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
 This section contains a summary of the statistical analyses for this trial. This trial includ es 
allocation of accrual to two experimental treatment arms in cluding patie nts who are bevacizumab 
naïve (Cohort A) and  those who have progressed on one prior bevacizumab regimen (Cohort B). 
The outcome of each treatment arm will be assessed separately rel ative to appropriate historical 
controls. Enrollment will cont inue until ta rget accrual for each arm is achieved. The two 
experimental arms will not be compared to each other and are independently designed as phase II studies for preliminary assessment of efficacy in comparison to historical control rates. Both arms 
have independent decision rules. Full detail is in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) ( Section 14.2).  
 14.1.1 Efficacy Analysis 
The primary and key secondary endpoints, primary analysis population, an d statistical methods that 
will be employed for the efficacy a nalyses are d iscussed in detail in the following sections .  
 The primary hypothesis of efficacy will be evaluated independently in each cohort. 
 14.1.2 Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be graded acc ording to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCA E) version 4.0. All patients who receive any amount of  Pembrolizumab will be evaluable for 
toxicity. The All -Patients -as-Treated population will be employed for safety analyses. Immune 
related adverse experiences are prespecified as Events of Clinical Interest (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 14.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 14.2.1 Responsibility for Analyses/In- House Blinding  
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the  
biostatistics department of the Dana -Farber/Harvard Comprehensive Cancer Center.  
 This trial is being conducted as an open- label study, i.e., participant s, investigators, and sponsor 
personnel will be aware of participant  treatment assignments after each participant  is enrolled and 
treatment is assigned.  
 14.2.2 Hypotheses /Estimation  
Objectives and hypotheses of the study are stated in Section 2  (2.2 – 2.4). 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
84 14.2.3 Power and Sample Size 
Participants will enroll to one of two treatment arms in  order to estimate the anti- tumo r activity as 
well as safety of  pembrolizumab plus re -irradiation among bevacizumab -naive  (Cohort A) as well 
as bevacizumab -refractory  (Cohort B) patients . Up to [ADDRESS_533654] 12 months (OS12). The null hypothesis 
relating to uninteresting levels of activity was determined from historical data. Fogh et al. reported 
on 147 patients treated with re -RT for recurrent high -grade astr ocytoma and f ound an objective 
response rate (ORR) of < 10% and median survival of 11 months.19  The null hypothesis is 
specified  for each endpoint independently.   the null  probability of a participant experiencing a 
tumor response – ORR – is set at ≤ 10% and the null probability of a patient being alive at 12 
months – OS12 is set at ≤ 45%. Clinically significant differences constitute an increase in ORR to 
30% and/or an increase in OS12 to 70%. For the ORR endpoint, e nrollment of 30 participants wil l 
provide 84% power  at 0.[ADDRESS_533655] the null in favor of the alternative. For the 
OS12 endpoint, 30 patients will provide 84% power at 0.[ADDRESS_533656] the null in 
favor of the alternative . If ≥[ADDRESS_533657] responses and/or ≥ [ADDRESS_533658] 6 months (OS6). The null hypothesis relating to uninteresting levels of  activity wa s 
determined from historical data. Reardon et al. reported on [ADDRESS_533659] bevacizumab 
progression and found no objective responses and median survival of 4 months.
6  The CABARET 
study which compared continuing bevacizumab to cessation of therapy following disease 
progression on bevacizumab also showed no objective responses and  median survival of 3.4 
months.  The null hypothesis  is specified for each endpoint independently. T he null probability of a 
participant  experiencing a tumor response – ORR – is set at ≤ 4% and the null probability of a 
participant  being alive at 6 months –  OS6 – is set at ≤ 25%. Clinically significant differences  
constitute an increase in  ORR to 20% and/or an increase in OS6 to 50%. For the ORR endpoint, 
enrollment of 30 participant s will provide 87% power  at 0.[ADDRESS_533660] the null in 
favor of the alternative. For the OS6 endpoint, 30 patients will provide 89% power at 0.[ADDRESS_533661] the null in favor of the alternative.  If ≥[ADDRESS_533662] a 
response  and/or ≥12 Cohort B participan ts are alive at 6 months, this regimen will be deemed 
worthy of further study. 
 
14.2.4 Analysis Endpoints  
Efficacy and safety endpoints that will be evaluated for within-  and/or between- treatment 
differences are li sted below, followed by [CONTACT_422548] . 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
85 [IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints  
Efficacy endpoints that will be evaluated for are listed below, followed by [CONTACT_180650]. 
 
Objective r esponse rate, defined as the proportion of participant s in the analysis population who 
achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RANO criteria1 is a primary 
endpoint for each cohort. Overall survival at  [ADDRESS_533663] 6 months following initiation of study therapy is also a primary efficacy endpoint for cohort B. Response for the primary analysis will be determined by [CONTACT_422549] , and a confirmation assessment 
is required per RANO.
1  All patients in Cohort A will be followed for a minimum of 12 months and 
all patients in Cohort B will be fol lowed for a minimum of 6 months . 
 For this trial where the objective response rate is the primary co -endpoint, all responses determined 
by [CONTACT_422543](s) independent of the study at its  
completion.  Simultaneou s review of the participants’  files including corticosteroids usage and 
neurological status in conjunction with radiological images is the best approach.  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: (1) PFS-[ADDRESS_533664] six months following initiation of 
study therapy.; (2) progression- free survival (PFS), defined as the time from allocation to the first 
documented disease progression according to RANO or deat h due  to any cause, whichever occurs 
first; (3) overall survival (OS) , and (4) duration of response . 
 
Additional supportive analyses duration of response will be conducted using RANO criteria, in which a confirmation assessment of disease response  must be obtai ned at least 4 weeks after the 
initial disease assessment response . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints  
Safety & Tolerability of the therapy used in each cohort = a secondary objective of this study. The 
primary safety endpoints are AEs graded using CTCAE (Version 4.0)  criteria. Safety will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_422550] s who have received  
Pembrolizumab , including serious adverse events (SAEs), other Reportable Adverse Events, and 
events of clinical interest (ECIs  – Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]).  Immune relat ed adverse experiences (irAEs, as 
defined in Section 7 .2) are prespecified as events of interest. Other safety endpoints include 
laboratory safety assessments, KPS status, vital signs and physical examinations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoin ts 
• Objective: To evaluate whether archival tumor expression of PD -L1, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
features, or T cell inflamed gene expression profile are associated with outcome.  
• Objective : To evaluate Neurologic  Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (NANO) in  each  cohort  
• Objective : To evaluate the change of Patient Reported Outcome scores from baseline to post -baseline 
time-points using the EORTC QLQ -C30.  
• Objective : To estimate ORR per iRANO  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
86 14.2.5 Analysis Population  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Analysis Populations  
The Full Analysis Set ( FAS) population will serve as the primary population for the analysis of 
efficacy data in this study. The FAS population consists of all participant s within each cohort who 
have received at least one dose of study pembrolizumab treatment and have comp leted  at least 75% 
of the planned re -irradiation therapy.  
 
Two supportive analyses of the primary and selected secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
conducted. The first supportive analysis will be conducted in the FAS -[ADDRESS_533665] baseline scan OR discontinue 
the trial due to progressive disease/drug related AE. The second analysis will be conducted using the intention to treat (ITT) population, defined as all registered  participants. 
 
Participant s will be included in the cohort to which they are allocated  for the analysis of efficacy 
data.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis Populations  
The All Patients as Treated (APaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. T he AP aT population consists of all allocated participant s who received at least one dose of 
study pembrolizumab treatment.  
 
At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained after  at least one dose of study 
pembrolizumab treatment is required for inclu sion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To 
assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.  
 
Details on the approach to handling missing data for safety analyses are provided in Section 14.2.6 Statistical Methods.  14.2.6 Statis tical Methods  
Nominal p –values may be computed for efficacy analyses as a measure of strength of association between the endpoint and the treatment effect rather than formal tests of hypotheses. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be condu cted at the α=0.05 (2- sided) level.  All estimated 
rates will be reported with corresponding 95% CI.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy will be evaluated separately in each cohort.  Primarily , rates comparison will be conducted 
using exact m ethods. In addition, OS and PFS endpoint s will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier 
(KM) method and curves and median estimates with corresponding 95% CI will be provided as 
appropriate. Participant s without efficacy evaluation data or without survival data  will be censored 
at Day 1.  The final efficacy analysis will be conducted whenever all patients achieved the required 
follow -up time in th eir respective cohort. This analysis is expected to take place at study closure: 
around [ADDRESS_533666] patient ha s been consented. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_28757] (AEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs. Safety summaries will be reported for  
both cohorts. 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
87 Immune related adverse experiences (irAEs, as defined in Section 7.2) are prespecified as events of 
interest. These events will be summarized in separate tables from other AEs by [CONTACT_28758], percentage, and 95%  CI. Any AE of unknown etiology associated with  
pembrolizumab exposure will be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (irECI). Other ECIs listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will also 
be sum mariz ed in the same manner as irAEs.  
 Adverse experiences (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) and predefined limits of change in laboratory, and vital sign parameters that are not pre -specified as events of interest will be 
summarized with  desc riptive statistics (counts, percentage, mean, standard deviation, etc.).  
 Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory, and vital signs parameters that are not pre- specified as events of interest will be summarized using descriptive  statistics (mean, 
standard deviation, etc.) for baseline, on- treatment, and change from baseline values.  
 
14.2.7 Summary of Baseline Characteristics, Demographics, and Immunocorrelative 
Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics w ill be assessed using tables and/or graphs for each cohort  separately . No 
statistical hypothesis tests will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage of participant s screened, allocated to treatment arm , the primary reasons for scree ning failure, and the 
primary reason for discontinuation will be displayed. Demographic variables (e.g., age, gender), baseline characteristics, primary and secondary diagnoses, and prior and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_422483].  
  14.2.8 Interim Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Efficacy (Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422484])   
Given that re -irradiation is considered standard treatment for patients with glioblastoma, and all 
participants will be treated  with re-irradi ation, there is no planned interim analysis for unexpected 
efficacy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Toxicity (Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422485])  
The primary focus of toxicity monitoring will be the toxicity profile of participants treated with 
pembroliz umab. For study purposes, the occurrence of toxicity attributable to pembrolizumab t hat 
requires discontinuation of  pembrolizumab therapy as defined in Section 7 .2 is defined as 
unacceptable. Unacceptable toxicity rates of 20% or less are considered desirable. Sequential 
boundaries will be used to monitor the unacceptable toxicity rate for each cohort. Accrual to that cohort will be halted if excessive numbers of unacceptable toxicities are seen at any time during the 
course of study therapy for a given par ticipant; that is, if the number of toxicities is equal to or 
exceeds bn out of n patients with full follow -up (see below table). This is a Pocock- type stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422486] 0.05 when the rate of unaccept able toxicity is equal to 0.2.

14.2.9 Compliance (Medication Adherence)  
A day within the study will be considered an ‘ On-Therapy ’ day if the participant receives the study 
medication infusion. The ‘N umber of Days Should be on Therapy’ is the tota l num ber of days from 
the first day of study medication to the date of the last dose of study medication. For each participant , compliance rate will then be calculated using the following formula: 
 Compliance Rate = (Actual n umber of therapy days/planned number of therapy days) x 100 
 Summary statistics will be provided on percent compliance by [CONTACT_422551].  14.2.10 Extent of Exposure 
Extent of Exposure for a participant  is defined as number of cycles in which the participant  receives 
the study medication infusion. Summary statistics will be provided on Extent of Exposure for APaT population.  14.2.11 Accrual Targets

89 15. PUBLICATION PLAN 
 
This trial is intended for publication, even if terminated prematurely. Publication may include any or all of the following: posting of a synopsis online, abstract and/or presentation at a scientific 
conference, or publication of a full manuscript. The Sponsor will work with the authors to submit a 
manuscript describing trial results within [ADDRESS_533667] 
participant 's las t vis it for the primary outcome, [ADDRESS_533668] marketing (dispensed, administered, delivered or promoted), whichever is later.  
 These timelines may be extended for products that are not yet marketed, if  additional time is needed 
for analysis, to protect intellectual property, or to comply with confidentiality agreements with other parties. Authors of the primary results manuscript will be provided the complete results from 
the Clinical Study Report, part icipa nt to the confidentiality agreement. When a manuscript is 
submitted to a biomedical journal, the Sponsor's policy is to also include the protocol and statistical 
analysis plan to facilitate the peer and editorial review of the manuscript. If the manus cript is 
subsequently accepted for publication, the Sponsor will allow the journal, if it so desires, to post on its website the key sections of the protocol that are relevant to evaluating the trial, specifically those sections describing the trial object ives and hypotheses, the participant  inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, the trial design and procedures, the efficacy and safety measures, the statistical analysis plan, and any amendments relating to those sections. The Sponsor reserves the right to redact  
proprietary information.  
 
For multicenter trials, subsequent to the multicenter publication (or after public disclosure of the results online at www.clinicaltrials.gov if a multicenter manuscript is not planned), an investigator and his/her colleagues may  publish their data independently. In most cases, publication of 
individual trial site data does not add value to complete multicenter results, due to statistical concerns. In rare cases, publication of single trial site data prior to the main paper may  be of value. 
Limitations of single trial site observations in a multicenter trial should always be described in such a manuscript.  
 Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysi s and  interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it 
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published. Authors must meet conditions 1, [ADDRESS_533669] also been made to all three of the preceding authorship criteria. Although publication planning may begin before conducting the trial, final decisions on authorship and the  order of authors’ names will be made 
based on participation and actual contributions to the trial and writing, as discussed above. The first author is responsible for defending the integrity of the data, method(s) of data analysis and the scientific conte nt of the manuscript. 
 The Sponsor must have the opportunity to review all proposed abstracts, manuscripts or presentations regarding this trial 45 days prior to submission for publication/presentation. Any information identified by [CONTACT_422552]; this 
confidentiality does not include efficacy and safety results. Sponsor review can be expedited to meet publication timelines.

Scoring assessment is based on direct observation and testing performed during clinical 
evaluation and is not based on historical info rmation or reported symptoms. Please check 1 
answer per domain.  Please check “Not assessed” if testing for that domain is not done. 
Please check “Not evaluable” if a given domain cannot be scored accurately due to pre-existing conditions, co- morbid events and/or concurrent medications.

  • Walking is ideally assessed by a t least 10 steps  
• Test each limb separately  
• Recommend assess proximal (above knee or 
elbow) and distal (below knee or elbow) major 
muscle  groups  
• Score should reflect worst performing area  
• Patients with baseline level 3 function in one major 
muscle group/li mb can be scored based on 
assessment of other major muscle groups/limb  
• Non-evaluable if strength is compromised  
• Trunk/lower extremities  assessed by [CONTACT_422554]  
• Particularly important for  patients with brainstem 
and cerebellar tumors  
• Score based on best  response of at least 3 
attempts  
• Recommend evaluating major body areas 
separately (face, limbs and trunk)  
• Score sh ould reflect worst pe rforming area  
• Sensory modality includes but not limi ted to light

102 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring P lan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for conducting a DF/HCC Multi -Center research 
protocol. The DF/HCC DSMP serve s as a reference for any sites external t o DF/HCC that 
are participating in a  DF/HCC clinical trial.   
 
1.1 Purpose  
 
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana -Farber/Harv ard Cancer Center Multi -
Center protocol will comply with Federal Regulations, Health Insurance  Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and applicable DF/HCC Standard Operating 
Procedures.        
 
1.2 Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  Definitions  
 
DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol :  A research protocol in which one  or more outside  
institutions are collaborating with Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where  a DF/HCC 
investiga tor is the sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana- Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) 
Network Clinical Trial Affiliates.  
 Lead Institution:  One of the  Dana- Farber/Har vard Cancer Center consortium members 
(Dana -Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Bo ston Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BCH), Brigham 
and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH)) responsible for the coordi nation, development, 
submission, and approval of a protocol as well as its subsequent amendments  per the 
DFCI IRB and applicable regulatory guidelines (CTEP, Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) etc.).  The Lead Inst itution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_345892]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead Institution also typi[INVESTIGATOR_143001]/HCC Multi -Center Protocol.   
 DF/HCC Sponsor:  The  person sponsoring the submitted Multi -Center protocol.  Within 
DF/HCC, this person is the Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422495], manag ement and conduct of the protocol at all research locations. In applicable 
protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with any regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA, etc.).  The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol 
and is resp onsible for the conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all Participati ng 
Institutions. In most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor is the same person as the DF/HCC Overall Pri ncipal Investigator; however, both roles can be filled by [CONTACT_57945].  
 Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC  
consortium that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC Inve stigator.  The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor 
as having the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.     
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277

 The following section will clarif y DF/HCC Requirements and further detail the expectations 
for participating in a DF/HCC Multi- Center protocol.  
 
3.1 Protocol Distribution  
 
The Coordinating Center wi ll distribute the final DFCI IRB approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to all  Participating Institutions.    
 
3.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures  
 
The Participating Institutions  will receive notification of protocol revisions and closures 
from  the Coordinating Center.  It is the individual Participating Institution’s responsibility 
to notify its IRB of these revisions. 
• Non life -threatening revisions:  Participating Institutions will receive written 
notification of protocol revisions regarding non life -threatening events from the 
Coordinating Center. Non- life-threatening protocol revisions must be IRB 
approved and implemented within 90 days from receipt of the notification. 
• Revision s for life -threatening causes:  Participating Institutions will rec eive 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533677] for approval.  
• Protocol closures and temporary holds:  Participating Institutions will receive 
notification of protocol closures and temporary holds from the Coordinating Center. Closures and holds wi ll be effective immediately.  In addition, the 
Coordinating Center  will update the Participating Institutions on an ongoing basis 
about protocol accrual data so that they will be aware of imminent protocol 
closures.  
 
3.3 Informed Consent Requirements  
 
The DF/H CC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for  the 
informed consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form must follow the consent template as closely as possible  and should adhere to specifications 
outlined in the DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for Investigator -Sponsored  Multi- Center Trials .  This document will be provided separately to 
each Participating Institution  upon request . 
 
Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and HIPAA authorization, if a separate document, to the Coordinating Center for review and approval prior to submission to t heir local IRB. The approved consent form must also be 
submitted to the Coordinating Center afte r approval by [CONTACT_422555] . 
 
The Princip al Investigator (PI) at each Participating Institution will identify the physician 
members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for therapeutic protoc ols. Participating institutions must follow the DF/HCC requirement  
that for all interventional drug, biologic, or device research, only attending physicians 
obtain initial informed consent and any re-consent that requires a full revised consent 
form . 
 
3.[ADDRESS_533678] be on file with the Coordinating Center:  
• Initial a pproval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB  
• Copy of the Informed Consent Form (s) approved by [CONTACT_57949]’s IRB  
• Participating Institution’s IRB  approval for all amendments  
• Annual approval letters by [CONTACT_422556]’s IRB  
 
3.5 IRB Re -Approval  
 
Verification of IRB re -approval from the Participating Institutions is required in order to 
continue research activities.  There is no grace peri od for continuing approvals. 
 
The Coordinating Center will not register participants if a re -approval letter is not received  
from the Participating Institution on or before the anniversary of the previous approval date.   
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533679] ( HIPAA). Any 
information, related to the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected 
Health Information (PHI). HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be 
used or disclosed.  
 
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the 
course of a study, the study participant must sign an authorization statement .  This 
authorization s tatement may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  
The Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent template, with information regarding authorization for the disclosure of protected health 
informat ion.  
 The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must be collected .  DF/HCC has chosen to use authorizations , signed by [CONTACT_163917], rather than limited data sets with data use agreeme nts. 
 3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confidentiality  
 All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant -specific reports (i.e. Pathology 
Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating Center  
should be de -identified. It is recommended that  the assigned DF/HCC protocol case 
number (as described below)  be used for all participant specific documents . Participant 
initials may be in cluded or retained for cross verification of identification. 
 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Regis tration Policy 
Eligible participants will be entered on study centrally at the DFCI Coordinating Center  
(by a Coordinating Center specialist, if participant is at a non -DF/HCC site) . Registration 
must occur prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the 
protocol before treatment begins will be c onsidered ineligible and registration will be 
denied.  
A qualified member of the study team w ill confirm eligibility criteria and complete 
the protocol -specific eligibility checklist.   
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the P rincipal 
Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
participant’s protocol status must be changed.  A Coordinating Center specialist  should be 
notified of cancellations - or any status changes  - as soon as possible.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533680] be done:  
• Obtain  written informed consent from the participant prior to the performance of any 
study related procedures or assessments.  
• Complete the protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment 
documented in the participant’s medical/research r ecord.  
o To be eligible for registration to the study, the participant must meet each 
inclusion and exclusion criteria listed on the eligibility checklist.  
Reminder : Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for the 
treatment study. Registration to both treatment and ancillary studies will not be completed 
if eligibility requirements are not met for all studies.  
 
3.7.1 Participant Registrati on and Randomization at a non- DF/HCC Site  
 
To register a participant at any non -DF/HCC site, the subsequent procedure is to be 
followed: 
 
1. The participating site’s data manager/coordinator/r esearch nurse should contact a 
DFCI Neuro -Oncology Coordinating Center team member  via telephone or email to: 
• Notify regarding the pending registration 
• Confirm the methods of sending documents and communication for 
registration  
• Communicate desired timeline  of the registration (i.e. the next day, etc. ).  
 
Multi- Center DFCI  Neuro -Oncology Designee contact [CONTACT_3031]: 
 E-mail:  [EMAIL_8086]    
Phone:  [PHONE_8767] 
   
2. The data manager/coord inator/research nurse should then send the following 
documents to the Coordinating Center specialist: 
• Completed DF/HCC study specific Eligibility Screening Work sheet  
• Copy of protocol required test results (e.g. coagulation studies, hematology panel, serum pregnancy test, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis --  all as 
applicable per protocol) 
• Copy of the pathology and surgical reports 
• List of current concomitant medications (obtained within the protocol -
specified screening window) including sign/date by [INVESTIGATOR_41886]/othe r clinician and 
documentation of when reviewed/confirmed with patient  
• Copy of signed informed consent form 
• Copy of signed HIPAA authorization form (if separate  from the informed 
consent document) 
• Copy of clinic note(s) and other medical records that document consenting process, screening and eligibility, if available*** 
 
Documents will be transmitted via one of the following methods: 
• Scanned and emailed to: [EMAIL_8086]
 or direct 
email  of Coordinating Center specialist 
• Faxed to: [PHONE_8766]  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
109 *** The Coordinating Center Specialists would like to review and monitor participant 
eligibility, informed consent, screening and baseline assessments on all participants.  Providing a complete set  of source documents prior to registration may delay 
registration.  Participating Institutions will work with the Coordinating Center Specialists to determine w hat documents may feasibly be available for review prior to 
enrollment, and these documents are to be provided for pre -enrollment review.  A 
complete set of documen ts will be provided to the Coordinating Center after registration; 
the timeline will be dete rmined by [CONTACT_422557]’s experience with the trial  and prior monitoring findings.  If there are persistent 
issues with  eligibility at a site or with a study overall, the Coordinating Center may 
require that all  source documentation relevant to participant eligibility be provided prior 
to proceeding with participant registration.  
3. After having received all transferred docu mentation, the Designee (Coordinating 
Center specialist) will review the documents to verify  eligibility, and notify the 
participating site of the result.  
4. To complete the registration proc ess, the Designee (Multi-Center Coordinating Center 
specialist) will follow DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Participant  
Research Titled Participant Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) and register 
the participant centrally  on the protoc ol, and subsequently inform the participating 
site of the successful  registration via Fax or email, to include: 
• Participant case number  
• Applicable Dose Treatment level and treatment arm assignment 
5. The Designee (Multi-Center Coordinating Center specialist) will follow -up to confirm 
registration.  
 Treatment may not begin without confirmation from the Coordinating Center that the participant has been registered.  
 
3.7.[ADDRESS_533681] be centrally registered with the Multi- Center Coordinating Center and 
the DF/HCC CTMS before  the initiation of  treatment  or other protocol -specific 
interventions .  Treatment and other protocol -specific interventions  may not be initiated 
until the Participating Institution receives confirmation of the participant’s registration 
from the Coordinating Center. Therapy must be initiated per protocol guidelines.  The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI IRB must be notified of any violations to this policy. 
 3.7.3 Eligibility Exceptions  
 
No exceptions to the eligibility requirements for  a protocol without DFCI IRB approval  
will be permitted . All Participating Institutions are required to fully comply with this 
requirement.  The process for requ esting an eligibility exception is defined below. 
 
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
 
At the time of r egistration, DFCI Multi- Center Coordinating Center requires the foll owing 
identifiers for all participant s: initials, date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity.  Once 
eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique protocol case number . Participating Institutions should submit all de -
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
110 identified subsequent communication and documents to the Coordinating Center, using 
this case number to identify the participant .  
 
3.9 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations 
 
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review and approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent im mediate hazards to the 
participant. DF/HCC requires all departures f rom the defined procedures set forth in the 
IRB approved protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB.  For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to des cribe departures  from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requir ements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_422496]. 
  
3.9.1 Definitions  
 
Protocol Devia tion: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB -
approved protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.  
 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol devia tion that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.  
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
   
Protocol Violation : Any protocol departure that was not prospectively approved by [CONTACT_57951].   
 
3.9.2  Reporting Procedures  
 
DF/HCC Sponsor:  is responsible  for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, deviations and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Protocol  deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI 
IRB. The Participating Institution must s ubmit the deviation request to the Coordinating 
Center who will then  submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB 
approval the deviation is submi tted to the Participating Institution IRB, per institutional 
policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be 
forwarded to the  Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_533682] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.  The 
Coordinating Center will provide training for the requirements for the reporting of violations.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
111 Protocol violat ions occurring at a Participating Institution will be submitted to that site’s 
own IRB per the IRB’s reporting policy.  Whether or not a violation needs to be report ed 
to the local IRB, notification to the Coordinating Center of any violation should occur in a 
timely manner.  If a report is made to the Participating Institution’s IRB, the report and determination should also be forwarded to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.  
 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sp onsor for 
review. Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines.  
 
3.10 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
 The study teams at all participatin g institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, 
rights and well -being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that 
occur during the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants.   All particip ants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated therapy 
will be evaluated for safety.   The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and 
hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adver se events reported by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study will 
be evaluated according to the NCI criteria specified in the protocol. Life -threatening 
toxicities must be reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating 
Center.  
 
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol. 
 
3.10.1 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol se ction  7.      
 Participating Institutions must report the S AEs to the  DF/HCC Sponsor , Overall PI,  and 
the Coordinating Center following the DFCI IR B Adverse Event Reporting Policy
.  
 The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of  all Participating Institution 
Adverse Event reports and be responsible for communicating to all  participating 
investigators, any observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Requirements.  Participating Institutions  will review  and submit  to their  IRB according to their 
institutional policies and procedures. 
 
3.10.2 Guidelines for Processing IND Sa fety Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety Reports and ensure that all IND Safety Reports are distributed to the Participating Institutions.  Participating Institutions will 
review  and submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures . 
    
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
112 3.11 Data Management  
 
DF/HCC CTRIO  develops case report forms (eCRFs) for use with the protocol.  These 
forms are designed to collect d ata for the study. DF/HCC CTRIO  provides a web based 
training for all eCRF users.  
   
3.11.1 Data Forms Review  
 
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. If study 
forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitt ing institution will 
receive a written or electronic query from the DF/HCC Office of Data Qualit y, 
Coordinating Center, or designee.  
 Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within 14 calendar days.    Responses may be returned on the written query or on an amended paper case report form, or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the case of a written  query for data submitted on a paper case report form, the query must be 
attached to the specific data being re -submitted in response.   
 If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the  Participating Institution will periodically 
receive a Missing Form R eport from the Coordinating Center noting the missing forms.  
 4.0 REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATION AL DRUG  
 
The ordering of Pembrolizumab  for this trial is described below: 
Pembrolizumab  (Investi gational : for all patients ): Participating Institutions will order th eir 
own supply of Pembrolizumab directly from [COMPANY_006] using the Drug Supply Request Form  
(App endix G  to this protocol) .  Please allow for 3 weeks for drug to arrive after the order is 
submi tted.  The Participating Institution will ensure that the pharmacy will be able to 
receive and store the agent according to state and federal guidelines. The lo cal IRB should 
be kept informed of who will supply the agent (i.e., [COMPANY_006] pharmaceuticals Inc.) so that any regulatory responsibilities can be met in a timely fashio n.   
 5.0 MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL  
 
Monitoring and oversight of a clinical trial are federally mandated for all IND held trials. This quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance and data accuracy and the protect ion of the rights and welfare of participants. 
The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the  ODQ,  provides quality control oversight for 
the protocol. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_533683] to on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_5081].   The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure  that 
Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. Monitoring will occur before the clinical phase of the 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
113 protocol begins, continue during protocol performance and through study c ompletion. 
Additional monitoring practices may include but are not limited to; source verif ication, 
review and analysis of the following: eligibility requirements of all participants , in formed 
consent procedures, adverse events and all associated document ation, study drug 
administration/treatment, regulatory files, protocol departures , pharmacy records, response 
assessments, and data management.  
 
Remote monitoring of participant eligibil ity, the initial informed consent process, and  
screening evaluation c ompletion will occur via a two -stage process.  
• Prior to registering each participant, a Coor dinating Center Specialist will review 
the source documentation provided in the enrollment packe t to confirm, (a) that 
based on all objective measurements (lab tests ; pathology report) that the 
prospective participant is eligible, (b) that the objective me asurements were 
performed per protocol within the appropriate protocol -defined windows, (c) that  
the prospective participant does not have concomitant medication tha t precludes 
eligibility, and, if documentation is provided, (d) that the consenting process  was 
adequate/adequately documented, (e) that the participant met criteria for eligibility.  
Furthermore, using the Eligibility Screening Worksheet, the Specialist w ill verify 
that the investigator has indicated that s/he  has reviewed and confirmed as 
“eligible” the prospective participant  
• A Coordinating Center Specialist will review the second set o f participant -specific 
source documents provided by [CONTACT_422558] (a) all screening and baseline assessments were completed per protocol, including AE assessment, and 
documented appropriately, (b) that all eligibility criteria were met and ap propriately 
documented, and, if not previously reviewed, (c) that the  consenting process was 
adequate/adequately documented.  The timeline for this review will be based on the experience with the study team, and the study team’s experience with the protocol.       
Interim monitoring visits  will occur on the following schedule:  
• Once a site has registered a participant, up until all participants (and planned 
partic ipants) have discontinued taking study agent (may be in follow -up), interim 
monitoring visits wi ll occur at least twice per year  (either on -site or virtula) .  The 
first interim monitoring visit will occur approximately two months after the 
registration of the site’s first participant.  
• Once a site is closed to accrual and all participants have discon tinued study agent, 
interim monitoring visits will occur virtually, a nd on- site as needed.   
 
On-Site Monitoring: On -site monitoring will occur on a regular bas is. Participating 
Institutions will be required to provide access to participants’ complete medical record and source documents for source documentation verification during the on- site visit. In 
addition, upon request from a monitor or auditor, Participati ng Institutions should provide 
access to regulatory documents, pharmacy records, local policies related to the conduct of research, and any other trial -related docum entation maintained by [CONTACT_16529]. If 
there are concerns for protocol complianc e, issues that impact participant  safety or the 
integrity of the study are found, or trends identified based on areas of need, additional monitoring visits may be sc heduled.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-2021 
114 Virtual Monitoring: The Coordinating Center will reasonably request source 
documentation from participating Institutions as needed to complete monitoring 
activities. Participa ting Institutions will be asked to forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_57912]’ 
medical record and source documents to the Coordinating Center to aid in source 
documentation verification.  
 Regular all -sites teleconferences  will be hosted on a monthly basis by [CONTACT_48876] (unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_52488]). During the teleconferences, sites 
should convey the following information: 
• Updates on participants: holds, dose reductions, significant events, how participant 
is doing, date of progression and date of death when available and if not already 
communicated to the Coordinating Center 
• Protocol status: which version is being used, and the status of any amendments 
• Any Reportable Adverse Events or Deviations/violations that have yet to be 
communicated to the Coordinating Center  (informing the sponsor should not wait 
for the call, and the call does not supplant communicating the events via the 
regular email me thods of communication). 
• Review of prospective participants 
If sites are not able to have a repr esentative participant, they should email this 
information  to the Coordinating Center.  
 
During the teleconferences, the Coordinating Center may discuss any or all of  the 
following information: 
• Accrual/enrollment updates  
• Pending amendments 
• Safety reports circulated or to be circulated  
• ODQ- generated numbers and percentage of missing of missing forms, number of 
open queries with date of oldest open query, and, for participants on treatment, the 
date of their last study agent form 
• Review of new deviations, violations  
• Review of recently received expedited adverse events  
 
5.2 Monitor ing Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports to ensure protocol compliance. The DF/HCC Sponsor may increase the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions that are unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and local regulations.   
5.3 Accrual Monitoring  
 
Prior to extending a protocol t o an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish 
accrual requirements for each participatin g institution. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating institution by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting their accrual expectat ions may be subject to termination.  
 
Accrual expectations for Participating Institutions : As thi s is a Phase II trial, Study 
Sponsor is requesting that each participating site accrue at least 3 patients annually.

115 6.0 AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance  and involves  the systematic and independent 
examination of all trial related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated 
activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and 
analyzed, and accurately reported per the protocol, applicable Policies,  and the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR).  
 
6.1 DF/HCC Internal Audits  
  All Participating Institutions a re subject to audit by [CONTACT_143071]/HCC Office of Data Quality 
(ODQ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a pproximately 3- [ADDRESS_533684] pa rticipant safety or the integrity of the study are found, 
more particip ant records may be audited.  
 
6.2 Audit Notification  
 
It is the Participating Institution’s r esponsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
external audits or inspections  (e.g., FDA , EMA, NCI ) that involve this protocol. All 
institutions will forward a  copy of final audit and/or re -audit reports and corrective action 
plans (if applicable) to the Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the audit date.  
 
6.3 Audit Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sp onsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action plans , if 
applicable. The Coordinating Center, must forward any reports to the DF/HCC ODQ per 
DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. For unacceptable audits, the 
DF/HCC Audit Committee would forward the final audit report and corrective action pl an 
to the DFCI IRB as applicable.  
 
6.4 Participating Institution  Performance  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor  and the IRB of record are charged with considering the totality of 
an institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the DF/HCC Multi- Cent er protocol. 
 
Participating Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accru al, submission of 
timely  and accurate data, adherence to protocol requirements, and  compliance with state 
and federal regulations, may  be recommended for a six -month probation period. Such 
institutions must respond with a corrective action plan and must de monstrate during the 
probation period that deficiencies have been corrected, as evi denced by [CONTACT_57955]. Participating Institutions that fail to  demonstrate significant 
improvement will be considered by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor for revocat ion of participation.  
A DF/HCC Sponsor and/or the DFCI IRB may terminate a site’s p articipation if it is 
determined that a site is not fulfilling its responsibilities as described above.

119 APPENDIX H    Radiation Therapy Guidelines (To be provided to Radiation Oncologist)  
  
 You are receiving the below guidelines because you will be treating ______________________, a patient enrolled on a clinical trial.  Please ensure t hey are followed as closely as possible.  If 
there are any significant deviations f rom the below guidelines, please contact [CONTACT_102]’s 
protocol treatment team as soon as possible (prospectively, whenever possible).    Should you have any concerns or questions, please contact: ____________________  at _______________________ (email) or _______________________ (phone).  Thank you so much for being such a significant part of our patient’s quality care.    Patient will be administered fractionated radiotherapy according to established, standard-of- care 
guidelines utilizing intensity -modula ted radiation therapy (IMRT), 3- dimensional conformal 
radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or proton beam radiation therapy at a dose of 3.5 Gy/fra ction times 
10 fractions (5 days a w eek for 2 weeks).   Daily image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is 
required including non- volumetric (orthogonal or near -orthogonal 2D imaging that is integrated 
with the radiation delivery device) and volumetric (diagnos tic CT, cone beam CT with MV or 
kV X- ray beam, MRI -linac or tomotherapy technology) systems. 
  1.0 Dose Specifications  
Photons : Treatment shall consist of 35 Gy delivered in 10 fractions. Target coverage and 
homogeneity limits and deviations are listed in Tabl e I-1 based on guidance from the ongoing 
randomized, national, phase II RTOG 1205 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
 
Protons – Absorbed dose: Doses are expressed in units of RBE -weighted absorbed dose, DRBE. 
For protons, the RBE is taken to be 1.1. DRBE = 1.[ADDRESS_533686] of 35 Gy(RBE) delivered in 10 fractions. Target coverage and homogeneity limits and deviations are listed in Table I -1.

 2.0 Technical Factors [Equipment, energies]  
The 10 treatment fractions of 3.5 Gy each will be delivered on consecutive treatment days (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 5 fractions per week). Any FDA cleared external beam radiation delivery system may 
be used (including conventional linear accelerators, Cyberknife systems, tomotherapy, proton therapy, etc.). Imaging for treatment planning will be obtained with the patient in the same position and i mmobilization device as for treatment. All patients will be positioned via a 
combination of rigid immobilization and daily image guidance to ensure positioning accuracy of 3 mm or better, and of a magnitude that justifies the PTV margin applied (the partic ipating 
institutions must document the immobilization and localization methods applied).  
 3.0 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
An MRI and/or CT scanning obtained with the patient immobilized in the treatment pos ition is 
required for treatment plan ning with slice thickness no greater than 3mm. Immobilization must 
be rigid (e.g. t hermoplastic masks). For daily treatment, localization will include the steps of a) 
immobilization with the same device used for simulation, and b) daily image guidance (IGR T) 
using at a minimum non- volumetric (i.e. orthogonal pairs of radiographs aligned to DRRs as a 
computer- assisted process) or volumetric (i.e. cone beam CT with MV or kV x- ray beams or 
MRI Linac systems.   4.0 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
A GTV will be d efined as the residual, enhancing tumor (and non- enhancing tumor for Cohort B 
participants) with or without the most recent post -operative cavity on the most recent MRI 
images. The post -operative resection cavity will be  outlined if no residual enhancing tumor is 
noted. A CTV expansion of no more than [ADDRESS_533687] be reported when used. Otherwise, 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-277 
Protocol Version Date:  26-Jul-[ADDRESS_533688] be made within the treatment planning process to take into account of range uncertainties 
along the beam direction, following the established practice at the specific proton facility, which should be based on the recommendations contained in ICRU 78, para graph [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Treatment planning using multiple, non- coplanar beams or arc- based therapy is advised. IMRT 
based planning is allowed. In any case, the objective of treatment planning is to ensure sufficient dose conformity that the normal tissue constraints are met.  
 5.0 Critical Structures  
Normal tissues to be contoured will include the brain, brainstem, optic nerves and chi asm.  
Planning risk volume (PRV) expansions (minimum of 3 mm) should be utilized for optic nerves and chiasm. Special consideration should be given to avoid doses greater than the prescription dose within the scalp as well as limiting the exit dose through  the oral cavity and mucosa. The 
treatment parameters should be modified to optimize the conformity of the prescription isodose 
volume to the target volume while minimizing dose to critical structures. There are two scenarios 
for normal tissues limits: (1)  previous radiation to the local area including critical organs at risk 
and (2) no previous radiation to the local area or organs at risk. The limits for both scenarios are 
given in Table I-2, based on guidance from the ongoing randomized, national, phase II RTOG 
1205 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

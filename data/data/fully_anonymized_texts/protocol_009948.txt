PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Rationale  
Fabry disease is a rare X -linked lysosomal storage disease caused by [CONTACT_652531], resulting in reduced or absent levels of the lysosomal enzyme α- galactosidase 
A (α-Gal A).  Reduced enzyme activity results in accumulation of the natural substrate 
globotriaosylceramide (GL -3) in tissues, giving rise to the disease symptoms and 
ultimately premature death due to renal failure, cardiac disease, and stroke.  Current 
treatment for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which is administered 
by [CONTACT_652532].   
Migalastat hydrochloride (HCl) is an orally administered small molecule that has 
widespread tissue distribution and is being deve loped for the treatment of patients with 
Fabry disease.  Migalastat HCl is a pharmacological chaperone and as such stabilizes endogenous α-Gal A allowing it to be properly trafficked to the lysosome where it can degrade GL -3. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the long- term safety and explore the 
efficacy/pharmacodynamics of migalastat HCl administered 150 mg (equivalent to 123 
mg migalastat) every other day (QOD).  Subjects enrolled in this clinical protocol will 
have completed treatment in a previous study of migalastat HCl.   In Japan, subjects 
enrolled in this clinical protocol will have completed AT1001 -012.  
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective:  
To assess long -term safety of migalastat HCl in the treatment of subjects with Fabry 
disease who completed treatment in a previous study of migalastat HCl.  
Secondary Objective:  
To explore long- term efficacy/pharmacodynamics of migalastat HCl in subjects with 
Fabry disease who have completed treatment in a previous study of migala stat HCl.  
Study Design 
This is an open-label, non- comparative, long- term extension study for subjects with 
Fabry disease who have completed treatment in a previous trial of migalastat HCl given as monotherapy.  Subjects will enter this extension study imme diately upon completion 
of their final treatment visit in a previous migalastat HCl study.  The planned duration of 
the treatment will vary among subjects and will continue until the date of regulatory 
approval or marketing authorization and/or commercialization in  the participating 
subject’s country, or study termination by [CONTACT_1034] , Amicus Therapeutics  (Amicus) .  
There will be continuous monitoring of safety data and use of specific stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652517] . 
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be chartered to monitor and evaluate the safety of all subjects in this trial by [CONTACT_652533], 
evaluating risk/benefit where possible, identifying any clinically relevant trends through 
the study, and assessing whether it is safe for the study to continue.  Predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]

• Adverse events (AEs), possible s uicidality related AEs (PSRAEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs)  
• Withdrawal due to AEs 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate)

3. INTRODUCTION 
3.1. Background  
Fabry disease is a rare X -linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by [CONTACT_652534] ( GLA ) that encodes the lysosomal enzyme α- galactosidase A  (α-Gal A).  Mutations 
in GLA  lead to reduced enzyme activity as a result of lowered catalytic activity, improper 
folding, decreased enzyme stability and/or inefficient trafficking into the lysosome 
(Bishop and Desnick 1981; Lemansky 1987; von Scheidt, Eng et al. 1991; Aerts, Groener et al. 2008). 
The primary biological role of α- Gal A is to catalyze the first step in the degradation of 
neutral glycosphi ngolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], in particular globotriaosylceramide (GL -3, also known as 
Gb3).  Reduced enzyme activity results in the accumulation of GL-3 in cells and organs 
throughout the body (Desnick, Ioannou et al. 2001) leading to the life -threatening 
manifestations of Fabry disease, which include kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.  
Migalastat hydrochloride (HCl) is an orally administered, low molecular weight 
iminosugar, and an analog of the terminal galactose group that is cleaved from the 
substrate GL -3.  Migalastat HCl, which binds at the active site of α-Gal A, is a potent, 
reversible, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme.  The binding of migalastat to both mutant 
and wild-type forms of α- Gal A stabilizes the enzyme.  As a result, th e mutant enzyme 
quaternary structure is sufficiently improved for it to pass the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) quality control systems and can be properly trafficked to the lysosomes.  At this 
site, the low pH and high concentration of accumulated GL-3 in the lysosomes favor 
dissociation of migalastat from α-Gal A, freeing the enzyme to bind and break down GL-3. As such, migalastat acts as a “pharmacological chaperone” to α- Gal A.  
The only specific treatment for Fabry disease is intravenously (IV) administered enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).  No oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652519].  
3.2. Rationale  
Migalastat HCl has been studied in 27 patients with Fabry disease in four completed Phase 2 studies [ migalastat HCl Investigator’s Brochure] .  In these studies, as judged by 
[CONTACT_652535] α- Gal A  activity in different tissues and reduction in the 
pathological substrate (GL- 3), treatment with migalastat HCI was associated with 
pharmacodynamic evidence of efficacy.  Migalastat HCl therapy  resulted in increases in 
endogenous α- Gal A activity in WBC s, skin, and kidney tissue in the majority of 
subjects.  In those subjects with responsive  GLA  mutations as determined by [CONTACT_652536], GL -3 concentrations tended to decrease in urine and in kidney interstitial 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037].  The decrease in urine GL -3 concentration was greater after administration of 
150 mg migalastat HCl once every other day (QOD) than after either once daily or twice daily administration.  Migalastat HCl was well tolerated and there were no treatment 
related serious adverse events SAEs and no treatment limiting toxicities identified.  
After completing one of the four Phase [ADDRESS_876081] relative to 150 mg QOD.  To further 
investigate the efficacy and safety of migalastat HCl treatment, two pi [INVESTIGATOR_22735] P hase 3 
studies were initiated. 
The pi [INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies include AT1001- 011, a 24- month randomized double-blind 
placebo-
controlled (through month 6) study to eva luate the efficacy and s afety of  
migalastat H Cl in ER T-naïve male and  f emale patients w ith  amenable mutations , and 
AT1001-[ADDRESS_876082] de monstrated t hat migalastat HCl 
150 m g QO D i s a generally s af e and w ell-tolerated tr eatment for  Fab ry disease. Lon g 
term extension studies AT1001-041 and AT1001-042 (the current study) are ongoing at 
this time . 
S
ince Fabry di sease is a chronic condition, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_652520], 
and usually requiring lif e-time tr e atment, the  current study ( AT 1001-042 ) w as de signed 
to pr
ovide continued migalastat HCl treatment to those subjects who have completed 
treatment in a pr evious  migalastat study, a s well as to e nabl e collection  of longer te rm 
s
afety and  efficacy d ata. How ever, previous Phase [ADDRESS_876083] 
shown migalas tat H Cl to be primarily exc reted (77% of the dose) via the kidneys. 
Therefore, it is not  unexpected tha t migalastat H Cl would de monstrate increased s ystemic 
exposure with declining renal function. A Phase [ADDRESS_876084]
ed in non- Fabry patients w ith va rying s tages o f re nal impairment and  normal 
renal function  demonstrated s igni ficant accumulation  of plasma mig alastat in s ubjects 
with eG FR < 30 m L/min/1.73m2.  
Eleven s ubjects ha d > 2-fold increase in AU C relative to the mean ([ZIP_CODE] ng∙hr/mL) of 
normal renal function (> 90 mL/min/1.73m2) in study AT1001-015. Eight of the 11 
subjects had severe renal impairment (< 30 mL/min/1.73m2) with 2.9- to 6.7-fold 
increased area under t he concentration- time c ur ve (AUC ), and al l 8 had elevated (> 100 
ng/mL) trough concentrations of plasma migalastat from 238 to 582 ng/mL. Based on 
AT1001-015 results, an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in non-Fabry subjec ts i s 
associated with plasma migalastat accumulation.

the final visit of the previous study, followed by [CONTACT_652537] 6 months for each year 
of the study.  The duration of t he treatment will vary among subjects.  
Within each participating country, subjects will continue to receive treatment with 
migalastat HCl within this protocol until one of the following study conclusion conditions 
apply:  
1. Regulatory approval and/or commerc ialization of migalastat HCl in the local 
country or

3. The study is terminated by [CONTACT_652539], but not limited to 
safety issues or 
• If the sponsor decides to continue to provide  AT1001, it may occur via a 
separate open -label extension protocol, early access, or other program 
depending on local regulations. 
4. The subject is withdrawn or withdraws consent. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety conce
rns.  Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the Time and Events Tabl
e, are essential and required for study conduct.  
Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompanying Study Procedures Manual/Investigator Site File Notebook (SPM/ISFN).  The SPM/ISFN will provide the site personnel with administrative and 
detailed technical information that does not impact subject safety.  
5.2. Discussion of Design  
This is an open-label extension study intended to provide continued treatment with 
migalastat HCl for subjects with Fabry disease who completed treatment of a previous migalastat HCl monotherapy study as outlined in Section  5.1. 
The study will be used to assess the long- term safety and explore the 
efficacy/pharmacodyn amics of migalastat HCl in subjects with Fabry disease who 
completed migalastat HCl treatment in a previous study.

7.2. Dosage Schedule  
Blister packs contain either 1) alternating 150 mg migalastat HCl capsules  and inactive 
reminder capsules  or 2) 150 mg migalastat HCl capsules  only.  Subjects will take one 150 
mg capsule of migalastat HCl every  other day (QOD) at approximately the same time of 
day.  On alternate days when migalastat HCl is not administered, a reminder capsule will 
be provided which should be taken at approximately the same time of day or punch-out 
foil in the blister pack to keep track of QOD dosing regimen instead.  Subjects are 
required to fast (no food or beverages, except water) 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking migalastat HCl.  In order to ensure continuous treatment with migalastat HCl as 
subjects transition from the previous study; the first dose of study medication (either a 
reminder or active capsule, as appropriate to maintain the migalastat 150 QOD dosing 
regimen) should be taken within the window of the Baseline Visit. 
7.3. Packaging and Labeling  
Migalastat HCl will b e supplied by [CONTACT_652543].  The blister pack contains migalastat HCl capsules and may include non-
identical reminder capsules.  
The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regu latory 
requirements.  
Each blister pack will have a label that  will contain the drug name, strength, quantity, lot 
number, sponsor name, and applicable local law statements.  
7.4. Product Accountability  
In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the inves tigator, designated site staff, 
or head of the medical institution (where applicable) must document the amount of investigational product dispensed and/or administered to study subjects, the amount 
returned by [CONTACT_4866], and the amount received from and returned to Amicus  (or 
designee) , when applicable.  Product accountability records must be maintained 
throughout the course of the study. 
7.5. Supplies and Accountability  
Sites will be instructed to store the study medication at room/ordinary temperature (15 °C 
to 25°C / 59°F to 77°F) in a secure area, free from environmental extremes, and with 
  
  [ADDRESS_876096] be documented. 
If the reason for the interruption or discontinuation of the study medication is an AE, an 
abnormal assessment (e.g., ECG finding), or a laboratory test abnormality, this information will be recorded as an AE. 
If the subject is not compliant with the study medication administration, the investigator 
may need to evaluate whether the noncompliance should warrant subject withdrawal from the study.   
7.7. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652521]/experimental therapy is not allowed at any time during the study.  
Routine use of the following medications during this trial is prohibited: 
• Glyset (miglitol)  
• Zavesca (miglustat)  
• Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta)  
  
  20 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
• Replagal (agalsidase alfa)  
If the subject receives investigational therapy, or if routine use of prohibited medications 
is initiated, the subject must be prematurely discontinued from the trial and final 
assessments performed at the last treatment visit.  
Drug s that affect lysosomal pH (e.g., chloroquine) and drugs that result in accumulation 
of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_652522] (e.g., gentamicin, amiodarone) should be avoided due to the theoretical potential for interactions with migalastat.  If alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652523]. 
7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post-
study care of the subject’s medi cal condition whether or not Amicus is providing specific 
post stud y treatment.  
7.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose 
An overdose of migalastat HCl is defined as an ingestion of a dose greater than the prescribed dose of 150 mg migalastat HCl QOD.  There are no known antidotes and 
Amicus  does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose.  
The investigators will use clinical judgment in treating the symptoms of a suspected 
overdose.

Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
8.2. Safety  
8.2.1. Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments include the following:  
• Adverse events (AEs) , possible suicidality related adverse events (PSRAEs), 
and serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• Withdrawal due to AEs 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487],  and heart rate) 
and weight 
• Hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters  
• Echocardiography (ECHO) 
• Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]  
8.2.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652524]: 
• 30% increase in serum creatinine from Baseline (Visit 1) confirmed by [CONTACT_652545]  
• 25% decrease from Baseline in cardiac ejection fraction as determined by 
[CONTACT_6751]  
• Cerebrovascular  event with significant sequelae, including stroke 
• An eGFR value of < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 
8.2.3. Liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652525] (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical 
liver safety guidance). Phase 3 criteria will be used for this study . 
Phase III -IV liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 1 -5 are defined below and in Appendix 2. 
1. ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥ 3xULN 
and INR>1.5, if INR measured) 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, withdraw 
study drug if ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN.  Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available.  If testing is unavailable, record 
presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin 
elevations and suggesting liver inj ury. 
2. ALT ≥8xULN.  
3. ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN persists for ≥ 2 weeks. 
  
  25 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
4. ALT ≥3xULN if associated with symptoms (new or worsening) believed to be 
related to  hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain 
or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).  
5. ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for ≥ 2 weeks.  
When any of the liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 1 -5 is met, do the following: 
• Immediately withdraw investigational product.  
• Report the event to Amicus  within 24 hours of learning its occurrence.  
• Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also 
meets the criteria for an SAE. All events of ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin 
≥2xULN (>35% direct ) (or ALT ≥3xULN and INR >1.5, if INR measured); 
INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply 
to patients receiving anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported 
as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) .  
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, withdraw study drug 
if ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be 
performed if testing is available.  If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable 
urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver 
injury. 
• Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy CRFs if these tests are 
performed . 
• Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the s ubject until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below.  
• Withdraw the subject from the study  (unless further safety follow up is 
required) after completion of the liver chemistry monitoring as described 
below. 
• Do not re- challenge with investigational product.   
In addition, for criterion 1:  
• Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to the clinic within 24 
hours  for repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments (see 
below), and close monitoring. 
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended. 
• Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values. 
For criteria 2, 3, 4 and 5: 
• Make eve ry reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 -72 
hrs for repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up assessments (see 
below). 
  
  26 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
• Monitor subjects weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, st abilize or return to within baseline values; 
criterion 5 subjects should be monitored as frequently as possible. 
Subjects with ALT ≥5xULN and  <8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT x ≥3xULN, 
but <5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN without hepatitis symptoms or rash, and who can be 
monitored weekly for 4 weeks: 
• Notify the Quintiles  and Amicus medical monitor within [ADDRESS_876104] safety. 
• Can continue investigational product.  
• Must return weekly for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline.  
• If at any time these subjects meet the liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], 
proceed as described above. 
• If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xULN and bilirubin <2xULN, monitor subjects twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values.  
For criteria 1 -5, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments  
described below:  
• Viral hepatitis serology includ ing: 
− Hepatitis A IgM antibody; 
− Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); 
− Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA); 
− Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; 
− Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain 
heterophile antibody or monospot testing);  
− Hepatitis E IgM antibody  
• Blood sample for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis, obtained within [ADDRESS_876105] the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the 
date/time of the last dose of investigational product prior to blood sample draw on the CRF.  If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, provide the 
subject’s best approximation.  If the date/time of the last dose cannot be 
approximated or a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample.  Instructions for sample handling and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_23915]/ISFN.  
• Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2xULN . 
• Obtain complete blood count with diff erential to assess eosinophilia . 
  
  27 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
• Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain 
or tenderness, fever rash, or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report form.  
• Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over the counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the 
concomitant medications report form. 
• Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake case report form. 
The following are required for subjects with ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% 
direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries: 
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti- liver 
kidney microsomal antibodies. 
• Serum acetaminophen adduct assay (quantifies potential acetaminophen cont
ribution to liver injury, detectable by [CONTACT_483047] 1 week 
following acetaminophen use)( Jam
es, Letzig et al. 2009).   
• Only in those with underlying chronic hepatitis B at study entry (identified by [CONTACT_23977] B surface antigen):  quantitative hepatitis B DNA and hepatitis delta antibody.  
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver disease.  
8.2.4. Adverse Events  
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an AE  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, biologic (at any dose), or medical device, which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the treatment.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not considered related t o the medical product.  AEs may include the onset of new illness and the 
exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. 
The routine evolution of the disease condition under treatment according to the protocol 
will be evaluated as part of the disease symptoms assessments .  Changes in the disease 
condition may not qualify as AEs.  However, i f there is a clinically relevant worsening of 
a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment and the outcome fulfills the definition of an AE, it must be repo rted as directed in the protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a SAE  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
  
  28 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256357]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652526] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or out- patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the 
event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s abi lity to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) whic h may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12333].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
8.2.5. Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and SAEs  
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, v ital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition, are not  to be reported as AEs or SAEs. 
  
  29 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
8.2.6. Possible Suicidality Related Adverse Event(s) (PSRAE)  
The PSRAE eCRF form  should be completed (in addition to the AE or SAE pages, as 
appropriate) if there is an occurrence of an adverse event which, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is possibly related to suicidality.  This may include, but is not limited to, an 
event that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide.  The investigator will exercise his or 
her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly related to 
suicidality .  The investigator will record this information in the source document and the 
PSRAE eCRF.  The PSRAE form should be completed in its entirety as soon as the 
information is available and updated with any additional follow-up information received. 
If the a dverse event meets the definition of an SAE, the investigator must ensure that 
there are no discrepancies between the PSRAE and SAE forms.  Both forms (PSRAE and 
SAE) should be updated with any follow-up information. 
8.2.7. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a 
notification of pregnancy form.  To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be 
reported to Amicus within [ADDRESS_876106] be 
followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons 
must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_53236], mu st be promptly reported to Amicus. 
In addition, the investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female 
partners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study.  Pregnancy information must be reporte d to Amicus  as described above.  
8.2.8. Reporting of Overdose 
Any event associated wit h or observed in conjunction with a product overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional) is considered by [CONTACT_652546]. If a subject experiences an overdose (defined as higher than the dose of study 
medication prescr ibed in the protocol) during the course of the study (whether 
symptomatic or not), the sponsor must be informed within [ADDRESS_876107] be stored in a secure area under the 
specified storage conditions until it is determined whether the study medication and/or 
  
  [ADDRESS_876108]’s first dose of study medication in the current study and until the follow up contact [INVESTIGATOR_1660] [ADDRESS_876109].   
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs.  However, any SAEs assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol- mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy), will be recorded f rom the time 
a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow up contact.  All SAEs will be reported to Amicus  within [ADDRESS_876110] igator to Amicus  as described 
in the following table once the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol 
definition for that event.

The method of detecting, recording, evaluating, and follow-up of AEs and SAEs plus 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to Amicus  are provided in the 
SPM/ISFN.  Procedures for post-study AEs/SAEs are provided in the SPM/ISFN. 
Procedures for documenting, transmitting, and follow-up of medical device incidents 
along with the regulatory reporting requirements for medical devices are provided in the 
SPM/ISFN.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_652547].  
Amicu s has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Amicus  
will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) and investigators . 
Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Amicus  policy, and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safety i nformation (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from Amicus  will file it 
with the Investigator Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.2.12. Other Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are l isted in the Time and Events ( Table 1 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination 
All subjects will undergo a complete physical examination at Baseline (Visit 1) and each subsequent scheduled visit.  Any clinically significant abnormal observation, newly 
emerged or worsened after the start of the subject’s first dose of study medication in the 
current study, should be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs, Weight, and Height 
At all visits, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) measurement should be obtained 
using the same arm, and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_652527] , and body temperature will 
be assessed.  The measurements will be taken with the subject in sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_652528] a 5 -minute period.  The same position should be used at 
all visits.  
  
  33 
 
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Study AT1001-042 
 
Body weight will be recorded at all scheduled visits.  Height will be recorded at the 
Baseline (Visit 1) and at the Follow -up Visit.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. ECG  
A standard 12- lead E CG will be performed at every scheduled visit.  Subjects will rest for 
approximately [ADDRESS_876114] be recorded in the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
If any results from the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) demonstrate, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
a clinically significant abnormality that the subject has not previously experienced, then 
the subject should be asked to return as soon as possible but no later than 3 months of the 
Baseline Visit for an unscheduled visit so that repeat specimens can be obtained. 
The collection, processing and shipment of clinical laboratory samples will be fully 
described in the study laboratory manual.  The parameters measured in these samples are 
described below.  
The investigator (or his/her designee) will review each laboratory report from the central 
laboratory and assess any out of range lab results as “not clinically significant” (NCS) or 
“clinically significant” (CS).  Any results which are considered clinically significant 
should be confirmed in a repeat test at the investigator’s discretion.  The investigator 
should consider repeat testing of persist ent clinically significant results until the analyte

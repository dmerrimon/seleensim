Co-Use of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_416152] (COAPS)  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Co-use of  alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416153] . Given alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416154] μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328],1 coinciding consumption potentiates their  analgesic effects —producing severe r espir-
atory depression, sedation2-6 and heightened overdose risk.7,8 Co-use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416155]/safety hazards. Although limited information  is available within peer -re-
viewed literature,[ADDRESS_524457] demonstrated 24 -38% of those with alcohol use 
disorders also have an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ,10,[ADDRESS_524458] 30 day opi[INVESTIGATOR_416156] 68% .[ADDRESS_524459] study, we screened 344 phar-
macy patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_416157] 4 pharmacies  (71% consent rate) —22.4% reported current risk  
drinking.23 Our second study was a small- scale -clinical trial testing the Brief Intervention- Medication Therapy 
Management  (BI-MTM) intervention among pharmacy patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_416158] 2 community 
pharmacies (N=32; 74% consent rate). BI -MTM showed significant improvements for mitigating opi[INVESTIGATOR_416159]-
tion misuse, depression, and pain compared to control patients (Standard Medication Counseling [SMC]).24 In 
this study —19% of participants  reported current risk drinking  at enroll ment.[ADDRESS_524460],  recently com-
pleted study , screened  patients in 19 community pharmacies at point -of-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dispensing (94% consent  rate).25 
Of the  1,523 patients  screened—3 1% reported current risk drinking.26 Given these patterns of co -use of alcohol 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416160] —particularly in community pharmacy —we propose to adapt , manualize,  and test the 
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of an Alcohol -targeted Brief Intervention- Medication Therapy 
Management (ABI -MTM) intervention with community pharmacy patients. ABI -MTM will be a pharmacy -based 
medication management intervention27 combined with Screening, Brief  Intervention, and Referral to Treatment28-
31 delivered as 1  session at point -of-dispensing with a 7-day telephone- based booster session . ABI -MTM will 
target : (1) alcohol use elimination during  opi[INVESTIGATOR_416161] (2) non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_416162]  (in 
consultation with the prescriber) . This study will accomplish 3 Specific Aims (SA):  
SA1: Adapt/ manualiz e an Alcohol -targeted  Brief Intervention -Medication Therapy Management 
intervention . Rational e: BI-MTM  was developed to address opi[INVESTIGATOR_416163]-
ditions (e.g., pain, mental health);  yet, it was not designed for universal delivery to patients with active opi[INVESTIGATOR_416164]. Approach : We will utilize the ADAPT -ITT (Assessment, Decision, Ad-
ministration, Production, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_416165], Integration, Training, and Testing)32 framework to modify /manualize  
BI-MTM for delivery to community pharmacy patient s with co-use of alcohol (both risk level and non- risk level 
alcohol  use) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]  (i.e., an Alcohol -targeted Brief Intervention- Medication Therapy Manage-
ment or ABI-MTM).  Outcome: Completion of SA1 will result in a  manualized protocol for clinical trial evaluation .  
SA2: Test the Feasibility, Acceptability , and Preliminary Efficacy of ABI-MTM  for Community Phar-
macy Patients w ith Concomitant Alcohol and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_416166].  Rational e: The extent to which ABI-
MTM: is acceptable to patients , can be feasibly delivered in community pharmacy  settings , and can mitigate  co-
use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416167]. Approach : We will conduct a small- scale trial in 3 community 
pharmac ies and enroll  those with /without  risk drinking, with a stratified randomization to ABI-MTM  (1:1 ratio;  risk 
use n=10; non -risk use n=10 ) or standard medication counseling (SMC ; risk use n=10; non- risk use n=10). Out-
come 1: Feasibility will be established through delivery of both ABI -MTM  components to 85% of ABI -MTM  recip-
ients. Outcome 2: Acceptability  will be demonstrated thr ough qualitative interview s, patient satisfaction,33,34 and 
participant retention (85%) at study completion. Outcome  3: Intent -to-treat analyses will show g reater proportions 
of ABI -MTM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_416168]-use of  alcohol (risk and non-risk alcohol use) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416169] -Back  and urine toxicology .35-[ADDRESS_524461] : Accomplishing SA 2 
demonstrates  ABI-MTM  is positioned for a subsequent fully-powered multisite randomized trial .  
SA3: Identify  Pharmacy System /Practice- Level  Barriers and Facilitators  for Universal Alcohol 
Screening/Intervention  among Opi[INVESTIGATOR_416170]. Rationale:  The barriers/facilitators that may  promote/im-
pede adoption of u niversal alcohol screening/intervention at point of opi[INVESTIGATOR_416171]. 
Approach : Employing  the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)38,39 and Organizational 
Readiness t o Change Assessment (ORCA) ,40 we will develop a mixed methods assessment guide to interview

demonstrated co -use of alcohol  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416178], showing among patients filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539] —approximately 20-30% have  current high risk  drinking.24,25,[ADDRESS_524467] concomitant use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_416179], specifically citing  alcohol .4-6,51 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

cians Guide,[ADDRESS_524468] with alcohol , that these individuals  
abstain from alcohol or  consume amounts  of alcohol  less than maximum  daily/weekly  limits compared to the 
general population. However,  the Clinician’s Guide does not provide  actual suggested quantity limits . Taken 
collectively , these data underscore a marked  need for interventions to address  co-use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] —
particularly among community pharmacy patients —to prevent negative outcomes including overdose and use 
disorders . Thus , we seek  to develop and test an intervention that targets overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_416181] ( risk level 
use and non -risk level use) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] s for delivery  in community pharmac ies.

dress co-use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] . With prescribers reporting high levels of  burden and burnout 
from the myriad of clinical duties ,54 the well-documented multiple physical/behavioral health problems among 
patients with pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724],55-63 and the continued nationwide misuse of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (>9 
million individuals annually )64— collaborating with auxiliary health care professionals to support opi[INVESTIGATOR_416183]-
ing and patient management  is paramount .  As the last healthcare professional encountered before opi[INVESTIGATOR_416184]-
pensation, the pharmacist is critical in addressing risks of co -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . Moreover, while phar-
macists may benefit from training in psycho therapeutic or motivational approaches for  alcohol  treatment (as is 
provided in this project), they  have unmatched training in drug- drug interactions, medication safety, and coun-
seling in the safe/effective use of medications.65 This study leverages and expands upon this specialized training 
to prevent  a harmful medication interaction by [CONTACT_416309] a time critical interven-

INNOVATION 
The primary innovation of this proposed study is that it establishes  needed data for building a viable 
community pharmacy -based response to preventing opi[INVESTIGATOR_416190]-
gating co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] . To our knowledge,  a pharmacist -led intervention does not exist 
to specifically target co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] . This innovation precisely  aligns with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_416191]  (R34: 
PA-18-775): 
“Both NIDA and NIAAA are interested in research on prevention strategies to address … alcohol use  
simultaneous with marijuana, prescription drug and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and illicit substances …This FOA encour-
ages pi[INVESTIGATOR_416192]: Feasibility and pi[INVESTIGATOR_416193] (including 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_416194] ) for delivery in medical settings and the broader healthcare system  
(e.g., primary care, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, adolescent medicine, pain and rehabilitation 
settings, and emergency departments). ”  
 We include community pharmacy among these vital health care settings. In addition to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_416195]-
ment of addressing co -use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_416196] y, 
this study likewise brings a critical  innovation of adapting a research -based prevention intervention targeting  
possible future system -level implementation. This innovation is also a key focus  of PA-18-775:  
“An important emphasis of NIDA’s and NIAAA's prevention research programs is prevention services 
research, which includes questions pertaining to system - and organizational -level processes and mech-
anisms associated with … adaptation …[and]…  implementation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_416197]-
ventions in community, practice and service systems . In preparation for large- scale  prevention services 
and systems research projects, pi[INVESTIGATOR_416198]: empi[INVESTIGATOR_416199] …and implementation strategies …”  
 APPROACH Preliminary Studies  
Given the important potential to address  co-use of alcohol and  opi[INVESTIGATOR_416200], 
the currently proposed study builds  upon critical  preliminary  data our team has previously established.  These 
preliminary data support  this work  and answer 4  important questions  posed as possible barriers . Note to review-
ers: Please be aware that we will use two similar acronyms in this application:  (1) BI-MTM, which represents 
Brief Intervention Medication Therapy Management  and (2) ABI-MTM, which represents  Alcohol -targeted Brief 
Intervention- Medication Therapy Management intervention. BI- MTM will be discussed  in reference to our previ-
ously tested intervention that primarily targets misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. ABI -MTM refers to the intervention 
that will be brought forward in this study that specifically targets the co- use of alcohol and prescr iption opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539] .  
 Question 1:  An often questioned barrier to pharmacists engaging patients in behavioral health services is:  
“Do pharmacist s care about intervening with patients with risky opi[INVESTIGATOR_416201] ? We con-
ducted a web- based survey of  pharmacists in two states  about routinely screening and possibly intervening 
with patients engaged in opi[INVESTIGATOR_416202] , which  results  are reported in [ADDRESS_524471] (89.7%) wanted to help patients engaged in opi[INVESTIGATOR_416203] (81.1%) and resources (79.8%) to compe-
tently/effectively do so.72,73  
 Question 2:  Another questioned barrier  to pharmacist engagement of patients regarding behavioral health 
is: Is it feasible to identify patients at point -of-dispensing using opi[INVESTIGATOR_416204] ? Mentioned above, our team has conducted [ADDRESS_524472] been published in 8 peer re-
viewed papers ,23,24,74 -79 with a number under review. In these studies, we collectively  screened approximately 
Version 1.0; 11Mar2022 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_416151], PhD  
 
1,900 pharmacy patients  filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. Results showed approximately 20 -30% of these patients 
reported current risk or binge drinking.24,25,[ADDRESS_524473] -C 
(AUDIT -C) data from patients filling 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_416205] 4 community pharmacies , which showed 22.4% of 
344 participants reported current risk 
alcohol use.
23 Furthermore,  in study 2 
(our small -scale RCT testing the BI -
MTM intervention, detailed below in Questions 3 and 4) based on the AU-
DIT-C, 19% of 32 participants re-
ported current risk drinking at base-
line. Summarizing item level data across these two projects,  17.4% of participants report ed drinking ≥2- 3 
times per week; 25.8% of  participants reporting ≥3- [ADDRESS_524474] drinks on their typi[INVESTIGATOR_416206], and 17.2% 
reported  binge drinking ≥monthly. Altogether, these results demonstrate participants in these studies en-
gaged in regular, and often , risky drinking.   
In our third study   in Ohio and Indiana (recently completed) , 31% of 1,523 participants  filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_416207]-
ications in community pharmacy  reported current risk drinking on the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medi-
cation, and other Substance use (TAPS) Tool .
26 Examining specific survey items, Table 2 shows  87.1% 
reported use of alcohol in the past 3- months , and 6 7.7% of males and 50.2 % of females reported  binge use 
in the last 3- months . Roughly  8-9% of participants had others express concern about their drinking or  unsuc-
cessfully had tried to stop/cut down in the last 3-months .  
 Questions 3 and 4:  An additional suggested barrier  to pharmacist engagement of patients in behavioral 
health services  is: Can a  pharmacy -centered intervention be adapted to address behavioral health issues 
among pharmacy patients and be implemented in community pharmacies AND would such an intervention  
successfully impact  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related  risk behaviors ? Our research team held a 1- day session in which phar-
macy and addiction experts strategized the adaptation of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treat-ment (SBIRT) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_416208]-tients , which results were reported in a peer -reviewed article.
[ADDRESS_524475] deliver  SBIRT in conjunc-
tion with  the evidence -based practice of Medication Therapy Man-
agement  (MTM) , targeting medication adherence/misuse . The ex-
pert panel also suggested enriching the pharmacist delivered 
SBIRT/MTM intervention with  a Patient Navigation adjunctive inter-
vention to activate patients in self -management of health conditions 
that elevate risk for misuse—this  intervention was named: BI- MTM.  
We subsequently implemented the BI -MTM in a small -scale ran-
domized clinical trial (RCT, PI: [CONTACT_125427], NIDA: R21DA043735) that compared BI -MTM (n=15) to Standard Medication Counseling 
(SMC; n=17). We published our findings, which demonstrated feasibility with a 74% recruitment rate and >93% retention at the final assessment (3 -months).
[ADDRESS_524476] and patient navigation sessions. Study results 
at the final 3- month assessment showed preliminary BI -MTM efficacy for positive improvements in opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422], depression, and pain compared to SMC (all p<0.05) —with strong trends for reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_416209] ( p=0.05).24  
We acknowledge only this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_416210] -MTM has been completed—with strong preliminary data cited 
above. Nevertheless, t his current  application is the product of urgency in the field, documented by 3 clinical 
studies  from our research team ( also cited above) conducted in [ADDRESS_524477] premise of our research program in community 
pharmacy addressing opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724], our team has brought  forth this application as a strong candidate to 
address this serious risk behavior  of co -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] .  
 O verall , these preliminary studies show  pharmacists are interested in engaging patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_416211]-
lated- risk behaviors; patients with co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416212]

feasibility/ acceptability and examining preliminary efficacy for eliminating concomitant alcohol use during opi[INVESTIGATOR_74456] , and (3) identifying facilitators and barriers for large- scale research and practice implementation.

SA1: Adapt and manualize an Alcohol -targeted  Brief Intervention- Medication Therapy Management in-
tervention.   
Rationale.  While the BI -MTM intervention, as cited above,  has demonstrated promising outcomes  for 
mitigating opi[INVESTIGATOR_85582], depressi on, and pain; it was not speci ally tooled for targeting co -use of 
alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We will thus systematically adapt BI -MTM to eliminate  alcohol use during opi[INVESTIGATOR_416221]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_416222] -targeted Brief Intervention- Med-
ication Therapy Management intervention (ABI -MTM) , which will leverage  and expand upon the unique expertise 
of the community pharmacist  in preventing harmful medication interactions . To do so, we will employ the ADAPT -
ITT framework (Assessment, Decision, Administration, Production, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_416165], Integration, Training, and 
Testing) .32 ADAPT -ITT is a framework originally designed for adapting evidence- based HIV interventions. Given 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_416223] w ith the opi[INVESTIGATOR_416224]-use of alcohol , ADAPT -ITT is a highly appropriate framework to guide the modification of this intervention.

Completing materials review , the panel  and project investigators  will attend a full-day (6 hrs.) recorded web-
conference where:  (1) [CONTACT_297516] will present on critical aspects of human pharmacology of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_289349]; (2) [CONTACT_416333] (project PI)  will present on clinical characteristics of those who misuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_416228] -MTM intervention; and (3) [CONTACT_390373] will present on epi[INVESTIGATOR_416229] -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. The assessment phase of the meeting will also 
involve panel members  and project investigators  providing brief verbal summaries of their assigned reading 
materials to one another within the group.   
 Decision : Following the pres entation and summaries, the web- conference will involve [CONTACT_416333] facilitating 
a roundtable discussion, eliciting comments and dialog regarding needed intervention modification,  and com-
ponents  needed for inclusion. This portion will specifically plan how pharmacists  will facilitate referral for high 
needs patients (e.g., substance use or mental health disorders).  [CONTACT_416333] will also provide information 
from his previous work regarding warm handoff for high needs patients. A  rich literature shows warm -handoff 
is an evidence- based method for connecting individuals with substance use needs, including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], to 
treatment.84-88 
 Administration : [CONTACT_416333] will instruct the meeting participants to provide specific recommendations on 
how to incorporate the  identified components into the intervention that will result in an alcohol targeted inter-
vention for pharmacy patients with co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] .  
 Production: Concluding the web conference, [CONTACT_416333] will request handwritten notes and comments rec-
orded during the Decision phase. Once received, [CONTACT_416333] will incorporate the identified components into the intervention  materials/manual .  
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_416165] : The adapted intervention manual  will be circulated to the project coinvestigators and expert 
panel  for review and comment.  
 Integration: Comments and edits from the review will be returned to [CONTACT_416333] for finalization and incorpo-ration into the intervention materials/ manual.  
 Training: [CONTACT_416333] will work with [CONTACT_416341] er, coinvestigator, (given [CONTACT_416341] er’s expertise in train-
ing/education of pharmacists , see investigator section) to author  training/ instructions for  delivery of  the 
adapted intervention.  
 Testing: The alcohol adapted intervention will be included within the pi[INVESTIGATOR_416230], and co -use of alco-
hol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416231], 2, and [ADDRESS_524485] -delivery (see SA2).  
Product : Com pletion of SA1 will result in an adapted/ manualized protocol ready  for trial evaluation.  
SA2: Test the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Efficacy of ABI -MTM for Community Pharmacy 
Patients with Concomitant Alcohol and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_416166].  
SA2 Rationale. Possessing the manualized ABI -MTM intervention, it is paramount to assess ABI -MTM’s  
feasibility for delivery in community pharmacy; whether patients will find the intervention acceptable, and if it will produce a preliminary clinical effect resulting in elimination of  co-use of alcohol. Such a preparatory step is critical 
to demonstrate if  ABI-MTM is adequately prepared for subsequent testing within  a larger multi -site framework 
and possible eventual  system -wide implementation.  
SA2 design and participant identification. We will conduct a small- scale  single -blinded 2- group RCT 
(staff administering data collection will be blinded to intervention condition) within 3  Kroger  community pharmacy 
locations in the greater Nashville area (2 in metro areas and 1 in a rural location; see Kroger letter of support) . 
The rationale for RCT implementation in this location was  based on its  high rate of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_416232] , high

prescribing rates,89 and high alcohol consumption compared to other states, which alcohol consumption results 
in the state’s  status among the top [ADDRESS_524486] a highly 
diverse patient population within local communities. Study pharmacists or technicians trained in the screening 
protocol will approach patients droppi[INVESTIGATOR_58448]/pi[INVESTIGATOR_416233] a brief confidential electronic tablet -based health screening (<5 minutes), with the opportunity 
of compensation up to $240 if they qualify and enroll in the study. In our small- scale study of BI -MTM , we suc-
cessfully engaged 81% of patients a t point of service who presented at the community pharmacies pi[INVESTIGATOR_416234] a study adverti sement and came to the pharmacy . 
Patients approached will be asked on a tablet to verify they are English speaking, ≥[ADDRESS_524487] where co -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416235], we will target 
delivery of the intervention to all patients with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_416236]—both those with risk and non -risk alcohol use. 
Risk drinking will be operationalized by a score of ≥4 or i n men and ≥3 or more in women using the valid/reliable 
the AUDIT -C.37,92 Screening will include administration of 5 questions: the [ADDRESS_524488] ques-
tion will be from the AUDIT -C, item 1: 
“How often do you have a drink contain-
ing alcohol?”  Responses of ≥2 -4 times 
per month indicate eligibility  for ABI-
MTM —given participants drinking pat-
terns will likely overlap with any opi[INVESTIGATOR_416237] . 
A response of ≤monthly  drinking will trig-
ger the second  question: “ When was your 
last drink?” Alcohol consumption ≥7 days 
ago indicates eligibility for ABI-MTM —
given that participants ’ regular drinking 
pattern could overlap with the current opi-
oid medication. Alcohol consumption of <[ADDRESS_524489] question:  “How many days of supply and numbers of refills do you have of your current 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]? We will use this question instead of relying on the Kroger medication record given the patient 
may have prescriptions outside of Kroger. Reponses of ≥7 days  current  supply indicate eligibility for ABI-MTM  
given that patients’  regular drinking patterns in  the month and their medication supply will likely overlap.   
SA2 inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Patients eligible  for ABI -MTM aged ≥18 will be offered the opportunity  
to learn about the study. Patients will be excluded if they: (1) are pregnant (given potential complications asso-
ciated with pre -natal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]93-97 and/or alcohol use98), (2) cannot provide collateral contact [CONTACT_19297] ≥2 
persons (to ensure consistent contact/follow up), (3) do not have a reliable landline or mobile phone to be con-tacted by [CONTACT_464], (4) are filling only buprenorphine (given some formulations are not indicated for pain), (5) 
plan to leave the area for an extended period of time in the next 3-months , or (6) have experienced  a psychotic 
and/or manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_280593] 30 days (before consent, patients will be asked to screen for psychosis [psy-
chosis subscale from the reliable/valid Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale
99] and mania [from the relia-
ble/valid Altman Self -Rating Mania Scale100]). We will not exclude patients with severe substance use problems 
given ABI-MTM will possess  the capacity to refer  and follow up on patient engagement in substance use treat-
ment.  Patients excluded will be given educational information about co-use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] , 
and research assistants will aid them to seek additional care if desired. Patients not interested or not co -use 
positive will be rescreened on subsequent visits. Patients positive for co -use, who are interested/eligible , will b e 
asked to provide written informed consent to participate.

SA2 recruitment feasibility, randomization , sample size, and justification.  It is important to note, i n 
order to enroll an equal number of participants engaged in risk  drinking (n=20) and non-risk drinking (n=20), we 
will sample those with risk and non-risk drinking at a ratio of 1:1. Noted above, our previous research has shown 
that approximately 20- 30% of pharmacy patients filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_416238]. To 
ensure risk and non-risk drinking status is not strongly collinear with enrollment time, enrollment during the study 
for the larger sample size group may  be periodically/ temporarily held until 
the smaller sample size group achieves an equal sample size,  which 
would occur  if the larger group has a sample size of more than 2 greater 
than the smaller sample size group.  Once the 1:1 enrollment is met, full 
enrollment will proceed , with this process repeating until recruitment 
ends . Randomization will be stratified to ensure equal distribution of 
those with risk and non- risk drinking into treatment and control groups.  
Randomization will be generated via SAS PROC PLAN , with limit ed runs 
of 4 to condition assignment.  
 Sample size will not be based on a power estimate. Rather, our 
sample size is based on our experience of how many patients can be 
screened and consented within the study timeframe.101 Using consort 
chart data from our BI- MTM small scale  study,102 we present Table 3 that 
demonstrates our estimates of how many patients we anticipate needing 
to approach/screen to meet our recruitment target  within our study time-
line. Based on these data, we will need to approach 338 patients during the study recruitment phase. Of these, 
we anticipate 81% will be interested/available for screening, of whom approximately 50 % will meet eligibility 
criteria (most patients will be ineligible because they will not have co -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] ). 
From among the eligible patients  who are positive for co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], we anticipate 
27 will be positive for risk drinking, and 110 will be positive for non -risk drinking. We anticipate consenting 74%  
of those interested in participation and eligible —including consideration of our procedure mentioned above of 
1:1 recruitment of individuals with risk /non- risk use—which will result in our final  population to be randomized: 
N=40 (ABI-MTM : risk use n= 10; non- risk use n=10; SMC : risk use n=10; non -risk use n=10) . Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_416310].  
In terms  of needed time to recruit our targeted patient population, based on our  data from our recently 
completed research study (mentioned above) at [ADDRESS_524490] to approach 9 patients  for recruitment monthly at each of our pharmacy loca-
tions.23,25,102 With this rate  and based on our procedure mentioned above of 1:1 recruitment of individuals with 
risk/non- risk alcohol  use, study recruitment will require approximately 13-months  to complete . We have chosen 
to focus recruitment at a limited number of sites (N=3)  during feasibility/acceptability/preliminary efficacy testing  
to ensure  internal validity of our procedures, limiting possible site variation, and limiting multisite challenges. 
During screening, we will capture sex, insurance status, and age for all eligible patients to assess basic demo-
graphic differences among those who participate versus  those that do not.  
While definitive estimation and hypothesis testing are not the aim of this study, the target sample size will 
allow estimation of odds ratios via 95% confidence intervals comparing outcome rates in the intervention and 
control arms, while accounting for within site clustering, with lower bounds differing from the odds ratio estimate by a factor of 1/3 to 1/[ADDRESS_524491] Medication Counseling (SMC)  will be  
the treatment as usual condition in this study and was chosen/developed following Gold et al.’s guide for select-
ing control conditions in behavioral intervention studies.
[ADDRESS_524492] component, all SMC participants will 
receive a single 5- 10 minute medication information/counseling session delivered by a Kroger  pharmacist, other 
than the study pharmacist, that possesses a similar level of education and professional licensing. The content of 
this session follows federal and state pharmacy requirements104,105 requiring pharmacists to: (1) offer counseling, 
(2) document counseling was offered, (3) offer a counseling process for patients not present (not applicable to this study given all patients must screen in person), and (4) discuss generic substitution.
104,106 Following this 
session, in the second SMC component, participants will be emailed/ mailed  (according to  participant preference)  
safety information about co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Pharmacists delivering SMC will be provided information 
quarterly to remind of practice standards for SMC service delivery by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Hohmeir . SMC is specifically yoked in 
duration with A BI-MTM, totaling 2 participant contacts to control for attention bias in outcome assessment.  It is 
important to note all study participants will receive SMC given state and federal requirements.  
Alcohol  B rief Intervention -Medication Therapy Management ( ABI-MTM) will be the intervention condition 
adapted and prepared  for utilization in this study.  ABI-MTM sessions will be set by [CONTACT_416311].  The study pharmacist will possess a PharmD degree and be licensed. Study Table 3: Recruitment Projections  n a

pharmacist t raining will be led by [CONTACT_6283]. Cochran, Cernasev , and Hohmeier . Training entails: the pharmacist  pre-
reading/studying the protocol followed by 2-days of motivational interviewing training tailored to the protocol, 
including lecture, group discuss ion, and observed role- plays  (motivational interviewing training will provided in 
Nashville  by [CONTACT_416312] , PhD, MA; a Nashville -based Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers  [MINT] , 
trainer ; see letter of support ). Following in -person training, mock sessions are conducted/recorded and assessed 
using fidelity checklists. Drs. Cochran, Cernasev , Worley , and Hohmeier  will adapt and prepare fidelity checklists , 
including a protocol adherence checklist  and motivational interviewing scoring sheet , which will be modified from  
BI-MTM materi als employed in the small -scale study cited above.  The protocol adherence checklist  will be re-
viewed and scored by [CONTACT_6283]. Cochran, Cernasev , and Hohmeier , with t he study pharmacist  required to demon-
strate  ≥80% proficiency on the protocol  checklist to be permitted to interact with study participants  (80% being 
an acceptable level based on [CONTACT_416333]’s previous experience training staff in similar interventions ). For initial 
Motivational interviewing proficiency, [CONTACT_416342] will code training sessions using the Motivational Interviewing 
Treatment Integrity Code (MITI 4)107,108 and will ensure fair /basic competency on technical and relational global 
scores as well as complex reflections and ratio of reflections to questions.107,108 Ongoing session fidelity  will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_416313]  (all pharmacist sessions will be audio recorded to ensure delivery and 
for fidelity review ). With these recordings,  each month, investigators and staff will (including [CONTACT_416342]):  (1) 
review randomly select ed recorded sessions  using the protocol  checklist  and MITI 4 , (2) provid e verbal/written 
feedback, and (3) participat e in a group discussion.  
While details regarding the various components , specific language, and materials  of the intervention  and its 
manual  for delivery will be determined and produced as the primary  outcome  of SA1, the framework of the ABI -
MTM intervention (similar to BI -MTM) will be based in MTM  (i.e., medication therapy management) and SBIRT 
(i.e., screening brief intervention, and referral to treatment) . MTM is an evidence- based intervention delivered in 
community pharmacy involving a brief session where medications are reviewed,  and patients are assisted to 
resolve barriers to adherence.  MTM has been documented to improve medication adherence.27 While lack of 
payment has been cited as a possible barrier for many services in community pharmacy settings, MTM is reim-
bursable by [CONTACT_416314] .109 A core goal of MTM is to empower patients in 
active medication self -management.110,111 MTM in the current study will be  based on the American Pharmacists 
Association and National Association of Chain Drug Stores Foundation service model , which includes 5 core 
elements.112 A common duration for medication counseling in outpatient pharmacies  a single 30 -45 minute  ses-
sion;113 we anticipate ABI -MTM session duration to be simila r. Session 1 will be in -person; however, if in- person 
visits are not possible (e.g., COVID -19 restrictions), both sessions may occur telephonically.

 Element [ADDRESS_524495] take to improve 
medication self-management and their health.  
 Element 4  is the intervention and/ or referral. This is where the pharmacist would employ  SBIRT  to work with 
the participant to either choose (1) to eliminate alcohol use during opi[INVESTIGATOR_416240] (2) to facilitate commu-
nication with  the prescriber to select a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_416241] . SBIRT is an evidence- based 
practice for improving alcohol problems ,28-31 with demonstrated evidence from  pharmacists and other provid-
ers for medication adherence improvement114-118 and reductions in problematic prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].24,119-
121 It is highly important to note that in the current application context, SBIRT targeting elimination of co -use 
of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (i .e., alcohol use eliminatio n during opi[INVESTIGATOR_416242]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_416243])  is designed to prevent related sequelae, i.e., possible overdose risk and use disorders.  We do 
recognize,  however, some participants may not choose the  non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_416244]. These participants will be encouraged to reduce alcohol use.

SA2 assessment, follow up, and retention.  Participants will be assessed at baseline, 2- months, and 
3-months  post-randomization at the Kroger community pharmacy settings  or other appropriate locations. Partic-
ipants will be compensated $40 for the baseline assessment, $50 for the 2- month, and $75 for the 3-month —
with a $75 completion bonus for those completing all assessments. Research assistants will aid participants to 
complete self -administered portions of the questionnaires as necessary to prevent missing data and ensure 
accurate/completed assessments. Research assistants will also be trained to administer urine toxicology as-
sessments to participants. Efforts to ensure  continued participant contact [CONTACT_416315] 2 collateral contacts as well as sending letters and cards, electronic messages, and making phone

show greater proportions of ABI -MTM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_416247]- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416159]-
tions compared to SMC.35,36 Our primary assessments will include:  
 Timeline Follow Back  (TLFB) assesses quantity/frequency of alcohol  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_96185] , which is a 
measure that is reliable and is content, criterion, and construct valid.35,36 Also note, w e will capture  any illicit 
drug use with the TLFB .  
 14 panel drug urinalysis  will be collected in private restrooms of the pharmacies or other appropriate loca-
tions, which will capture  opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, methadone, cannabis, cocaine, PCP, amphetamine, MDMA, 
methamphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], buprenorphine, tricyclic antidepressants, and propoxy-
phene. Participants are considered co -use free  if self -report and urine assessments coincide.  
In addition to our primary outcome measures, we  will also capture concomitant conditions as covariates 
at each time point . Each of these conditions are well known correlates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_416248], substance use, and 
health behavior change:

SA2 preliminary efficacy analysis plan. This aim compares the preliminary  efficacy of the intervention 
(ABI-MTM vs. SMC) on the primary binary co-use outcome ( i.e., co-use vs . no co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539]). Mentioned above, successful elimination of co -use can be in the form of (1) participants eliminating 
their alcohol consumption while they are receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], which will be measured by [CONTACT_75236] , OR (2) 
by [CONTACT_416324]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_416257] (not altering their alcohol consumption)  by 
[CONTACT_416325] , which  will be  measured by [CONTACT_416326]-
ment of urine toxicology and TLFB .  
We will first provide descriptive summaries of each variable measured at baseline, 2- , and 3 -months 
overall , by [CONTACT_66443]/non-risk alcohol use, as well as by [CONTACT_65237] (note that all included participants are 
positive for co-use at baseline). Within an intent -to-treat framework, w e will fit 3 -level generalized linear mixed 
models (GLMM) to relate repeated assessments across time of the primary outcome measured (i.e. elimination 
of co- use) to the intervention . Additional analyses within the 3- level GLMM  framework will also be conducted to 
assess the overall impact of the intervention on reducing percent days alcohol use among patients  during the 
prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_416258]. A ll analyses will be adjusted for  covariates likely to be associated with the 
outcome. Specifically, thi s will include baseline measures such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], mental health, substance use, 
pain/physical function, social services utilization, and readiness to change in addition to  and demographic co-
variates including (but not be limited to) age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and rural/urban living.
[ADDRESS_524503] risk/non-risk alcohol use as an effect modifier to determine 
whether the intervention has a differential impact on individuals with distinct levels of drinking; we recognize, 
however, the sample study sample size may limit the power of the analysis t o detect changes at a probability  of 
<0.05 . Thus, it is important to note our above discussed analysis focus on 95% confidence intervals comparing 
outcome rates in the intervention and control arms  in order to detect subtle trends in relation to intervention 
efficacy . Model parameters, including treatment effects at each follow -up, will be estimated using restricted max-
imum likelihood.[ADDRESS_524504] estimates remain consistent and approxi-
mately unbiased if missing data follow a missing -at-random pattern (MAR; data values are independent of the 
missingness mechanism conditional on the observed data161), the most general data -centric missing data as-
sumption.   
As biological sex is an important factor among individuals with pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/alcohol  use,162,163 we will

characterize if sex subgroups might benefit more from the intervention. As discussed above with reference to 
the risk /non- risk alcohol use as an effect modifier analyses, sex subgroup analyses will likewise focus on 95% 
confidence intervals comparing outcome rates in the intervention and control arms  in order to detect subtle trends 
in relation to intervention efficacy .

SA3: Identify Pharmacy System/Practice -Level Barriers and Facilitators for Universal Alcohol Screen-
ing/Intervention among Patients with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_373663].   
SA3 rationale.  We have discussed above a number of barriers to pharmacists engaging patients regard-
ing behavioral health. While o ur previous research has worked to address these barriers, t he process of applying  
evidence- based services into real w orld health care settings is a paramount aspect of evidence- based imple-
mentation science and involves rigorous planning, monitoring, and evaluation165-[ADDRESS_524506] for implement-
ing universal alcohol screening/intervention for those using opi[INVESTIGATOR_416259] a subsequent  large- scale 
multi- site efficacy trial as well as eventual  integration into system -level commercial pharmacy chain workflow . 
Likewise, this step will also identify facilitato rs to scaling alcohol screening/intervention for those who use opi[INVESTIGATOR_416260] a large- scale multisite trial and pharmacy system wide. To establish this information , we will 
employ tools from the Consolidated Framework for  Implementation Research (CFIR)[ADDRESS_524507] -
implementation outcome analyses.169-171 The CFIR has been employed within a variety  of clinical and adminis-
trative  areas, including healthcare delivery and processes redesign, quality improvement, health promotion, and 
disease management as well as  in clinical areas  including mental health, obesity, and high blood pressure.168  
SA3 design and participant identification.  We will implement  cross -sectional one- time mixed methods 
key informant interview s to capture data that will inform our understanding of pharmacy system/practice- level 
barriers and facilitators for universal alcohol screening/intervention among patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. In-
terview participants will be identified through a purposi ve/snowball sampling approach. Relying on both on [CONTACT_416343] er (project coinvestigator) and [CONTACT_416344]’s  (project consultant) professional networks at the 
Kroger corporate and Nashville regional levels , our team will reach out and offer interview participation to indi-
viduals in each category of key informant (technicians, pharmacists, and corporate leaders). [CONTACT_416345] is the  
national  Manager of Clinical Program Development with the Kroger Health Corporate office who has been a  
close collaborator with [CONTACT_416333] over the past [ADDRESS_524508] (CTN -0093; 
see letter of support). Identified interviewees will be contact[CONTACT_238871]/or by [CONTACT_756].  Interview s will take 
place in a location and time that is convenient and selected by [CONTACT_3038]. The interviews will be conducted 
by a research assistant trained in qualitative interviewing and are anticipated to last up to [ADDRESS_524509] from the participant suggestions of other individuals who 
would represent the specific perspective of pharmacy corporate leaders, pharmacists, and technicians. Com-pleting the interview, participants will b e provided with a $[ADDRESS_524510] step in our mixed 
methods  assessment will involve  the quantitative data collection.  We will administer , via a web-based survey 
platform , the internally consistent reliable and factorially valid Organizational Readiness t o Change Assessment 
(ORCA) .

For the in-person portion of the interview, we will administer open- ended questions drawn and adapted 
from the CFIR interview guide for qualitative research.  Items will be selected by [CONTACT_416330]-
tion with [CONTACT_416345].  Items from the constructs  set forth in Table 4 will be employed39 and include Intervention 
Characteristics , Inner Setting, Characteristics of Individuals, and Process . Our team has previously employed 
CFIR constructs along with the CFIR interview guide to develop an open -ended survey schedule for administra-
tion to health care professionals regarding substance use care within health care settings,172,173 which interview 
results were used for system -level and community -wide intervention/  implementation planning. Also mentioned 
above, [CONTACT_217584] is an expert in implementation science and has more than 20 years of experience in this area.  
Sample size.  We will recruit pharmacy technicians (N= 20), pharmacists (N=20), and corporate leaders 
(N=20 ) to complete the SA3 interview .41,[ADDRESS_524511] and Guba’s framework174 
will be used to address and meet criteria for quality and rigor in this study  and involve credibility, de-
pendability, confirmability, and transferability .
[ADDRESS_524512] ANOVA tests to examine dif-
ferences between interviewed 
groups (pharmacy technicians, pharmacists, and corporate lead-
ers). For the qualitative data, s imilar 
to SA2 , the research team will follow 
methods  recommended by [CONTACT_416331]-
ations between categories and ex-
tract and conceptualize themes.

The researchers will independently review the interview data and code inductively and deductively. C odes will 
be clustered based on their similarities into categories. The research team will meet multiple times to discuss the emergent themes.

Timeline. Based on our previous work in conducting clinical research  with similar populations in commu-
nity pharmacy settings, we estimate this study will require  3 years to complete (Table 5) . Year 1 quarters  (Q) 1-
3 will involve receiving IRB approval and hiring/training staff. During the same time, we will undertake and com-plete all activities related to SA1, intervention adaptation and protocol development. Year 1 Q 2- 3 will involve 
finalizing the assessment battery for SA2; Q3 will also involve the initiation of activities related to the small -scale

trial, including patient recruitment, inter-
vention delivery, outcome assessments and data safety monitoring board meet-ings (DSMB), which will conclude in 
Year [ADDRESS_524513] for response and/or reso-
lution . First, c ritics may suggest that 
providing an intervention to those with 
non-risky alcohol use who are also tak-
ing opi[INVESTIGATOR_416261]-
ative consequences. It is important to recall , as reviewed/cited  above, there is no empi[INVESTIGATOR_416262]-
ports this perspective— rather all-peer reviewed human and animal, governmental, packaging inserts , and pro-
fessional lit erature available clearly state that any co- use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_416263]. Therefore, this study will specifically recruit on a 1:1 ratio those with non -risk as well as 
those with risk y alcohol  use and examine outcomes for both subgroups by [CONTACT_53272].  
Second, some critics may also assert that given the BI -MTM intervention already has been developed 
and tested in a small -scale clinical trial, that advancing ABI-MTM is unnecessary and BI -MTM should be sufficient  
for co -use of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] . Our team deliberated over  this question extensively. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_416264]-
cation misuse is a composite set of behaviors including, for instance, using more medication than prescribed, using to get high or to cope with problems, and doctor shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Misuse also is frequently accompanied by a  
variety of concomitant conditions (i.e., mental health, illicit substance use) that together require a resource in-
tense and comprehensive intervention. Our goal with the ABI- MTM intervention is to integrate a very brief and 
targeted intervention focusing only on the  highly  specific outcome of co- use elimination ( i.e., [1] eliminating al-
cohol use during opi[INVESTIGATOR_416265] [2] substituting a non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_416266]). Thus, ABI -MTM will be very 
different in practice than the BI -MTM —requiring specific adaptation efforts and preliminary testing.  
Third, we do not anticipate a change in our ability to recruit participants  in SA2  (i.e., pharmacy patients ); 
however,  there is a chance recruitment could slow at some point in the study. Given the hundreds of Kroger 
stores in Tennessee (and thousands across the US) and our close collaboration with corporate and local leaders 
on this project, should participant  recruitment become a challenge, we have the ability to open up recruitment in 
other stores and/or  create Kroger medication system hard stops in the store workflow that would require patients 
to be screened before leaving the stores. Based on our experience, these are highly effective tools that can be 
used to improve site performance. In the same vein, based on our close collaboration with corporate and local 
leaders, we are confident that should our sampling approach for SA3 (i.e., staff /leadership key informant inter-
views ) prove to not meet our targets, our local and corporate partners will help assist us to identify additional 
possible participants who would be available and potentially interested with speaking with us.  
 CONCLUSION  
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_416267] . While some im-
provements have been observed for reductions in prescribing in recent years ; high rates of misuse, subsequent 
OUD, and overdose persist. Among the most high- risk behaviors for those taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_416268]- use 
with alcohol. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has clearly stated: “… there is no safe level of 
alcohol use for people using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].”
52 Previous research, including that of our team, shows that a significant 
portion of those regularly using opi[INVESTIGATOR_416160] —particularly filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_416269] —are 
involved in the co -use of alcohol. This study proposes to leverage pharmacists’ special training in medication 
interactions and safety; adapt a previously developed intervention for opi[INVESTIGATOR_85582];  test its accept-
ability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy; and identify barriers /facilitators to large- scale research  and system -
level implementation. Results will inform a subsequent powered multisite trial examining the impact  of the ABI -
MTM intervention on reducing co- use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_416270].  Aim Activity Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4

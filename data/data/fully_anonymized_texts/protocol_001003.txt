  The Articulated Oral Airway as an Aid to Mask Ventilation, a Prospective Interventional, Non -

I.3 Short Title (optional):    AOA Testing  
  
I.4 Provide a short summary of the purpose and procedures of the study proposed in this IRB application.  
• DO NOT include information on studies not proposed in this application.  
• Use LAY terminology only. This must be easily understandable by [CONTACT_82915].  
• DO NOT cut and paste technical abstracts from funding applications that may not be 
understood by a general audience.  
•   The Articulated Oral Airway (AOA) is a new, FDA Class 1 (exempt from pre -market notification), 
device which assists in ai rway management, specifically mask ventilation. The AOA is currently being 
developed by [CONTACT_82916] (UIRF Case# 2014 -018) in conjunction with 
the Primary Investigator. The device has gone through two phases of human analog (m annequin) testing, 
with another round scheduled. After the third round of mannequin testing, bio -compatible (safe for oral 
use) prototypes will be made in a ISO 9001:[ADDRESS_90394] these bio -
compatible prototypes in health y human volunteers to assess real -world function.  
Patients who are predicted to be difficult to breath for after going to sleep (and meet inclusion criteria/do 
not meet exclusion criteria) will be offered enrollment in the study. Those that enroll will hav e their 
airway maintained with two different designs of oral airway (soft plastic oral stents) to see if one works 
as well as the other. To determine this we will be looking at how big a breath is achieved with a set 
pressure via the ventilator through eac h device. We will also be examining the devices after removal, 
and seeing the patients in the recovery room, to evaluate for any difference in oral or throat trauma. As 
patients will be anesthetized and breathed for regardless of their enrollment status, t heir day will be no 
different aside from speaking with a study team member prior to surgery and again in the recovery room.  
  
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")  
  1) Does the AOA facilitate mask ventilation (as measured by [CONTACT_82917][INVESTIGATOR_82891] -tidal CO2 waveforms) as well as a Guedel oral airway in patients with risk factors for difficult 
mask ventilation  
2) Is the AOA non -traumatic as an ticipated to the human airway  
  
I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.  
(do not  indicate "see protocol")  
  Brief explanation: The Articulated Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel device in the field of Airway 
Management which actively facilitates both mask ventilation (breathing for an anesthetized patient 
without a breathing tube) and fiberoptic intubation (placement of a breathing tube using a flexible 
camera). No device currently on the market has this dual functionality. In conjunction with the 
University of Iowa Research Foundation (UIRF Case# 2014 -018) the AOA received US Patent 
8,794,[ADDRESS_90395] of 2014.  
Detailed explanation: A primary goal of all anesthetics is the establishment of a patent airway. The most 
commonly performed airway management technique is mask ventilation; using a mask over a patient’s 
nose and mouth to breath for them. This technique is ma de significantly more difficult by [CONTACT_82918], the most common of which is a large tongue related to obesity. The AOA not only 
creates a conduit for delivering oxygen and anesthetic agents, but also actively displaces the tongue to 
optimiz e the space available for ventilation.  
In addition, the AOA can act as a conduit for flexible fiberoptic intubation – a technique of utilizing a 
flexible guide to navigate airway anatomy and allow placement of a breathing tube (“endotracheal tube,” 
or ETT)  with minimal manipulation of a patient’s neck and airway. A significant disadvantage of 
fiberoptic technique is that, for an image to be seen, an “airspace” (a space void of visual obstruction) 
must be created. If the tip of the fiberoptic scope is touchi ng the patient’s airway or any foreign objects 
in the patient’s airway, the result would be analogous to leaving the lens cap on a camera and the 
necessary anatomy would not be seen.  
To address these anatomical and technical difficulties, inventors of medi cal devices have attempted to 
design instruments which both 1) displace airway anatomy to create the needed “airspace” and 2) act as 
a conduit through which an ETT threaded over a flexible fiberoptic scope can be passed. Multiple 
devices attempt to facilit ate fiberoptic intubation via specially designed oral airways. US. Pat. 
No.4,338,930 (Williams Oral Airway) is an oral airway with a cross -sectional shape which allows the 
passage of an ETT -sheathed fiberoptic scope and has a distal end which is open along  its anterior surface 
to facilitate this passage. Two important disadvantages of this design are that 1) the static conformation 
of the distal end does not allow active displacement of airway obstructions and 2) once the ETT is 
passed via the device, the p roximal end of the tube must be disassembled to allow device removal, 
carrying significant risk of inadvertent repositioning of the tube. The first above disadvantage was 
addressed by [CONTACT_82919] (US. Pat. No. 5,443,063) who designed an intubating oral airwa y with a 
proximal end similar in function to that of Williams, but added a distal inflatable cuff to displace 
oropharyngeal obstructions. While addressing the first -listed disadvantage, the design of US. Pat. No. 
5,443,063 does not address the second. US. Pat. No. 4,553,540 is a device with hinged/articulated upper 
and lower segments which act together to displace oropharyngeal obstructions but, like US. Pat. No. 
5,443,063, does not permit the passage of an ETT via the device. US. Pat. No. 5,024,[ADDRESS_90396] oropharyngeal obstructions. Patent Application WO/ 2008/ [ADDRESS_90397] which can be removed after intubatio n utilizing a two -component system which can couple and 
uncouple around an endotracheal tube using magnets. However, similar to US. Pat. No. 5,024,218, 
Patent Application WO/2008/[ADDRESS_90398] allows for both 
significant displacement of oropharyngeal obstruction and for device removal without manipulation of 
the ETT. The AOA promises to address both of these concerns.

will be described both verbally by [CONTACT_82926]. After questions are answered, the opportunity to consent will be given. If at 
any point the patient declines discussion of, or enrollment in, the stud y, the patient will 
no longer be eligible for the study and will be removed from the list of potential subjects. 
To avoid the possibility of coercion or undue influence during the consent process, the 
study team will make it clear that participation is com pletely voluntary and that patients 
will receive the same standard of care whether or not they opt to enroll. If, after 
discussion, patients are unsure whether they wish to enroll they will be encouraged to 
decline participation. In addition, if at any poi nt after the time of consent the patient no 
longer wishes to be involved in the study, they will immediately be excluded from 
involvement without question.  
  
VII.D.37  Does the study include  any form of deception (e.g., providing participants with false 
information, misleading information, or withholding information about certain study 
procedures)?  
Examples:  
• Procedure includes a cover story that provides a plausible but inaccurate 
account of the purposes of the research.  
• Participants will be provided with false information regarding the particular 
behaviors of interest in the research.  
• Procedures include a confederate pretending to be another participant in the 
study.  
• Participants will be told that the research includes completion of a particular 
task, when in fact, that task will not be administered.  
• Study is designed to introduce a new procedure (or task) that participants are 
not initially told about.  
• If yes, a waiver of informed consent must be requested under question IV.3.  
•   No 
 
VII.E. Project Description (E)  
 
VII.E.1  Will subjects be randomized?    Yes 
  
VII.E.1.a  Will any subjects be blinded to which study arm they have been assigned?    No 
  
VII.E.2  Describe randomization scheme/assignment including ratio such as 1:1, 2:[ADDRESS_90445]. There 
are two reasons for the randomization: 1) As we are evaluating for blood o n the airway 
upon its removal, the order of placement is important as we can only evaluate the first -
placed device (we won't know if blood on the second -placed device if from that device or 
left over from the first device. 2) Without randomization, the CRN A would not be blinded 
as they would know which device they are using first and second which could introduce 
bias. 
  
VII.E.3  Will any questionnaires, surveys, or written assessments be used to obtain data directly 
from subjects in this study?    No 
  
VII.E.[ADDRESS_90446] involve creating any audiotapes, videotapes, or photographs?    Yes 
  
VII.E.6  Provide a detailed description in sequential order of the study procedures  following the 
consent process  - DO NOT cut and paste from the Consent Document.  
 
Describe study populations separately if they will be participating in different 
procedures - include CONTROL population if applicable.  
 
DESCRIBE:  
• What subjects will be asked to do/what happens in the study (in sequential 
order)  
• The time  period over which procedures will occur  
• The time commitment for the subject for individual visits/procedures  
• Long -term followup and how it occurs  
•   A. Staff anesthesiologist will perform an airway exam and note the following  
- Age 
- BMI  
- Presence or absence of beard  
- Patient dentition  
- History of snoring  
- Any formal diagnosis of sleep apnea and CPAP/BiPap use and settings  
- Mallampati grade (I -IV) 
- Mouth opening (in cm)  
- Neck extension (full, limited or none)  
- Retrognathia (none, mil d, significant)  
- Any apparent nasal or oral anatomic abnormalities  
 
 
B. Operating room preparation (performed by [CONTACT_82927]):  
-A tongue depressor, AOA, and 100mm Guedel oral airway will be available, but out of 
sight of th e clinical providers  
-A 28Fr nasopharyngeal airway and water -soluble lubricant will be set on the anesthesia 
machine next to the laryngoscopy equipment  
-The anesthesia circuit facemask will be opacified by [CONTACT_82928] (as 
per pediatric  routine)  
-A pump for delivery of propofol infusion will be available  
-The anesthesia ventilator will be pre -programmed to Pressure Control mode at 15cm 
H2O with a rate of 10 breaths/minute and an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:expi[INVESTIGATOR_82905] 1:[ADDRESS_90447] data from the anesthetic monitor  
 
C. Induction/Airway Management. On arrival to the operating room:  
1) Apply standard ASA monitors  
2) Apply Entropy monitor (measures depth of anesthesia via evaluation of brain EEG) 
and quanti tative Train of Four (TOF, routine intraoperative monitor which measures 
level of paralysis via evaluation of the response to electrical stimulus)monitors  
3) Pre -oxygenate until end tidal O2 is >90% or for >3 minutes  
4) Research assistant will open the ran domization envelope but not disclose the 
randomized device order to the clinical team  
5) IV Induction: 1 -2mg midazolam, 50 -100mcg fentanyl, 60 -100mg lidocaine and 1 -
2mg/kg propofol.  
6) Maintenance of anesthesia: 100mcg/kg/min propofol started at time of in duction.  
7) Once lid reflex is lost, obtain a baseline quantitative train -of-four (TOF) and 
administer rocuronium 1mg/kg of real body weight  
8) One -handed mask ventilation (MV), without an oral airway, is initiated by [CONTACT_82929] (CRNA) . If one -handed MV without an oral airway is 
insufficient to return any EtCO2, a “two -handed jaw -thrust” technique, without an oral 
airway, is utilized until paralysis/anesthetic depth measures are met. If two -handed 
technique is insufficient, the 28Fr nas opharyngeal airway is placed and two -handed 
technique restarted. If two -handed MV with a 28Fr nasopharyngeal airway does not 
return any EtCO2, proceed to step #10.  
9) Once the quantitative TOF is <20% and Entropy reading is 40 -60[3], proceed to step 
10 
- If, after 90 seconds, the TOF is not <20%, continue to MV until the TOF is <20%  
- If, after 90 seconds, the Entropy reading is not 40 -60, increase propofol by 
50mcg/kg/min every minute and continue MV until reading is 40 -60 
10) The CRNA (who is performing M V) is asked to turn away so as to be blinded to oral 
airway placement order  
11) The RN research assistant or study medical student (both formally trained, with 
documentation, in oral airway placement) will place the device randomized to be first 
using the below methods and then cover the patients nose and mouth with the opacified 
anesthesia mask  
- Guedel oral airway: Insert with concavity facing upward then turn 180 degrees as 
advancing the proximal bevel to the level of the teeth  
- AOA: In the “closed” con formation, insert with concavity facing upward then turn 180 
degrees as advancing the proximal bevel to the level of the teeth. Once at the level of the 
teeth, bring proximal ends together to lock in the fully ‘open’ conformation  
l2) The CRNA will turn bac k to the patient and secure the anesthesia mask utilizing “[ADDRESS_90448]” technique.  
13) The ventilator is turned on and the following data is recorded, via video of the 
anesthetic monitor, for breaths # 6 -10: 
-Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_82906]  
-Expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] t idal volumes  
-EtCO2 waveform  
Note (a): If EtCO2 is not achieved after [ADDRESS_90449] device, proceed immediately 
to step #14  
Note (b): No video or images will be taken of the patient or patient identifiers, just the 
anesthesia monitor and the device randomized to be placed first  
14) The CRNA will then turn away from the patient and the RN research assistant or 
study medical student will remove the oral airway, noting the presence of any blood on 
the device (first device only)  
15) Steps 10 -13 will be r epeated for the device randomized to be placed second, then the 
anesthetic will proceed at the discretion of the providers  
Note: If EtCO2 is not achieved after [ADDRESS_90450] -operative:  
15-45 minutes after "Anesthesia Stop" time, the research assistant or study medical 
student will:  
- Perform an oropharyngeal exam for signs of trauma  
- Ask the patient to grade their degree of “sore throat” (subjectively, fro m 0-10) 
 
E. Data Review:  
-The video taken during step [ADDRESS_90451]  
-The blinded primary investigator ([CONTACT_82940]) will transcribe clinical data (expi[INVESTIGATOR_82907]2 waveforms) from the above video  
  
VII.E.[ADDRESS_90452] to follow -up?   No - followup is not required in this study  
  
VII.E.9  Will subjects be provided any compensation for participating in this study?    No 
 
VIII. Risks  
 
VIII.1  What are the risks to subjects including  
- emotional or psychological  
- financial  
- legal or social  
- physical?  
  - Emotional or psychological: None foreseen  
- Financial: None forseen  
- Legal or social: None forseen  
- Physical: Potential for risks associated with routine airway management with an oral 
airway (difficult or failed airway management/oropharyngeal trauma). Potential for risks 
associated with placement of two oral airways instead of just one or none.  
  
VIII.[ADDRESS_90453] you done to minimize the risks?  
• If applicable t o this study ALSO include:  
o How you (members of your research team at Iowa) will monitor the 
safety of individual subjects.  
o Include a description of the availability of medical or psychological 
resources that subjects might require as a consequence of 
participating in this research and how referral will occur if necessary 
(e.g. availability of emergency medical care, psychologi cal 
counseling, etc.)  
o   Pre-procedure: The Articulated Oral Airway is made of bio -compatible material in a ISO 
9001:2008 Certified molding facility. The AOA has been tested in manakin models, 
including pressure testing by [CONTACT_82930] E ngineering program.  
Intraoperative: Per protocol, if difficulty in airway management is encountered, the study 
is abandoned and emergency airway management protocols (ASA Difficult Airway 
Algorithm) followed.  
Post-operative: An interim safety review will b e performed after [ADDRESS_90454] an individual or committee review combined data 
from all subjects on a periodic basis (such as summary or aggregate safety and/or 
efficacy data)?    Yes 
  
VIII.4  Describe the plan to review combined data from all subjects, such as summary or 
aggregate safety and/or efficacy data. Include the following:  
• Describe what data will be summarized and reviewed  
• Describe how frequently data will be reviewed.  
•   After the first 20 patients (and any time earlier if concerns are raised by [CONTACT_17881]/clinical staff caring f or the patients), a unbiased faculty anesthesiologist ([CONTACT_82941], as per below) will review intraoperative tidal volumes (marker for 
adequate ventilation), incidence of blood on first -placed device, and post -anesthesia care 
unit (PACU) data on po st-operative pharyngeal trauma.  
  
VIII.5  Will overall safety monitoring be performed by [CONTACT_29569](s)/committee at The 
University of Iowa.  (NOTE: If this study involves more than minimal risk, in most 
cases these should be individuals who are not members of the study research team.)?    Yes 
  
VIII.[ADDRESS_90455] names:  
  [CONTACT_82942], MD, PhD, Professor of Anesthesiology, Department of 
Anesthesiology, UIHC.  
  
VIII.7  Will overall safety monitoring be performed by [CONTACT_82931] (such as a study Data Safety Monitoring Board)?    No 
 
IX. Benefits  
 
IX.[ADDRESS_90456] (do not include compensation or 
hypothesized results)?    None  
  
IX.[ADDRESS_90457]?  
  Difficult and failed mask ventilation are a significant risk after induction of anesthesia. 
As risk factors for difficult and failed mask ventilation (such as obesity and age >55) are 
increasing in the population as a whole, methods for optimizing mask ven tilation are 
becoming even more crucial. There are no oral airways currently available which 
actively displace oropharyngeal obstructions, as the AOA does. The potential benefits of 
the AOA relate to better caring for patients who are at risk for difficult  mask ventilation. 
The AOA also has the additional functionality of facilitating flexible scope (fiberoptic) 
intubation, though that functionality is not being tested as part of this protocol.  
 
X. Privacy & Confidentiality  
 
X.[ADDRESS_90458] the  privacy  interests of the subjects?  
  All communication with subjects will be done in a private room with the doors closed. 
Information that can not be obtained from the medical record will be asked in person. 
There will be no pi[INVESTIGATOR_82908]. Only 
information related to the study will be collected  
and only the minimum amount of personal/private information needed to answer the 
study questions will be collected.

XI. Data Analysis  
 
XI.[ADDRESS_90460] if the difference in expi[INVESTIGATOR_82909] 1ml/kg.  
  
XI.2 Provide the rationale or power analysis to support the number of subjects proposed to 
complete this study.  
  We will assume that the AOA is non -inferior to the GDA if the difference in expi[INVESTIGATOR_82910] 1ml/kg. With a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_90461] 90% power to reject the null hypothesis that expi[INVESTIGATOR_82911] a GDA and AOA are not equivalent (> 1ml/kg difference in expi[INVESTIGATOR_82912]) (SD of difference is 2.5ml -kg). To allow for [ADDRESS_90462] >95% power to test the hypothesis that the expi[INVESTIGATOR_82913] 1.5ml/kg greater than with the GDA (SD of difference : 
2.5ml/kg).

NCT Number:  
NCT # [ADDRESS_1155214] a shorter time to 
extubation than patients receiving sufentanil bolus dosing even with similar total doses 
of sufentanil.  
Objectives  
Primary Outcome: Ti me the subject becomes extubat ed from stop data collection time 
point within the EMR.  
 
Secondary Outcome: Plasma S ufentanil concentrations , Sufentanil pharmacokinetics,  
[ADDRESS_1155215] the benefit of sufentanil infusion 
over bolus dosing to reduce time to extubation and reduced length of ICU stay.  
 Interventions and Duration:  
Intervention period: intra -operative sufentanil infusion vs inter mittent bolus dosing the 
intervention will stop at the stop data collection time point within the operating room.  
 Post Intervention: Multiple  lab draw s at various time points to assess sufentanil 
concentrations and pharmacokinetics , we will follow pain s cores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_832145] [ADDRESS_1155216] intervention, we will follow the patient until discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_832146]. No further follow up after discharge. We anticipate a 24 -48 hour ICU length of stay and a 5- 7 day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
  
Sample Size and Population  
Adults between ages 19 and 80 with reasonable cardiac and pulmonary function 
presenting for routine cardiac surgery including coronary artery by[CONTACT_832149] “fast track extubation”. Based on estimates for time to extubation for our study population on sufentanil bolus dosing where we have an average time to extubation of 190.5 minutes (SD = 99 min) and assuming 80% power and statistical significance alpha level of 0.05, our power analysis suggests that we would

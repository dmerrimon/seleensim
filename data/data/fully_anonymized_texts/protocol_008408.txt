1.0 OBJECTIVES:
To assess the feasibility  of using intravenous ICG to characterize the vascular  perfusion of 
ovaries during  gynecologic surgery. 
2.0 BACKGROUND:
2.[ADDRESS_31385]. Indocyanine green (ICG)  is a Food  and Drug  (FDA)-approved 
tricarbocyanine dye that is fluorescent under near-infrared (NIR) light.  Excitation of ICG occurs 
between 750 and 800 nm.  Its chemical formula is C43H47N2NaO 6S2 (Han,  Kankala,  Wang, & 
Chen, 2018).  ICG solutions for injection often contain sodium  iodide.  ICG is water soluble and 
when introduced intravenously, it is bound by [CONTACT_32148], namely  albumin. The 
intravascular half-life of ICG is 3-4 minutes with rapid hepatic clearance  (Cherrick, Stein,  Leevy, 
& Davidson, 1960).  Clearance of ICG follows first-order kinetics  and is eliminated  exponentially 
in the first 10-20 minutes after administration. Trace amounts of ICG can remain  in the system 
for more than an hour.  ICG  has no known metabolites .(Alander et al., 2012)  The  LD50 (lethal 
dose) of ICG is 50 – 80 mg/kg which is significantly greater than standard doses of less than 2 
mg/kg (KARL STORZ Endoscopy - America, 2016). Rapid clearance  of the dye allows it to be 
given over multiple injections, as needed,  during a single procedure.  After intravenous injection 
ICG is visible in organs within 1-[ADDRESS_31386] (KARL STORZ  Endoscopy - America, 2016). 
2.2 Clinical uses
Since the 1950s, ICG has been  approved in the [LOCATION_002] for intravenous administration. 
Early uses for ICG included measurement  of hepatic  function,  cardiac  output  and retinal 
angiography (Rahimtoola & Swan, 1965;  Yannuzzi, 2011).  Today, ICG has been applied  across 
several surgical specialties to improve intraoperative assessment and to reduce  unnecessary  
tissue trauma. These uses are off-label but are a part of a growing  body of literature that 
suggests ICG can be useful in assessments of tissue and organ perfusion.  Selective sentinel 
lymph node resection is based on the observation  that dye injected into tumor or tumor-adjacent  
tissues is taken up into the lymphatic system.  The first lymph  nodes to undergo dye uptake  are 
known as sentinel lymph nodes and are representative of other lymph  nodes within  the same 
lymphatic chain.  A dye negative SLN is proxy for a tumor free lymph node, making radical 
lymphadenectomy unnecessary and reducing complications from such  dissections.  This SLN 
concept has been employed  in surgical  oncology for many disciplines including  breast,  cervical  
and endometrial cancer. 
Another major surgical application is intraoperative  angiography to evaluate  for preserved or 
recovered vascular perfusion (Arichi et al., 2014; Ferroni, Sentell,  & Abaza, 2018).  ICG 
fluorescence angiography  has also been employed  in colorectal surgery  to identify  anastomotic  
insufficiency, or poor perfusion of anastomoses  after bowel resection.  In PI[INVESTIGATOR_32143], a 
prospective, multicenter  clinical trial in colorectal surgery, fluorescence angiography using ICG 
was successful in 99% of cases and changed surgical plans in 8% (Jafari  et al., 2015). In 
hepatobiliary surgery, ICG facilitates the identification of biliary  anatomy and of tumor as it 
accumulates within the lesion (Baiocchi, Diana,  & Boni, 2018). In plastic surgery,  ICG has been

HRP-593 / v061820used to assess vascular anastomoses and tissue perfusion (de Vita & Buccheri, 2018). 
Neurosurgical uses of ICG have  centered around the identification  of vascular  pathology 
(Reinhart, Huntington,  Blair, Heniford, & Augenstein, 2016).
Gynecologic uses of ICG extend beyond tumor localization for cancer. Excisional  endometriosis 
surgery may be technically  challenging  and the use of functional imaging can facilitate 
assessment of tissue perfusion after removal of lesions  on the bowel or ovary (Bar-Shavit, 
Jaillet, Chauvet, Canis, & Bourdel,  2018) .  De  Neef et all used ICG intraoperatively to identify 
rectovaginal deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)  (De Neef et al., 2018). They  reported  a series 
of 6 patients undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis  in which  0.25 mg/kg ICG was injected 
intravenously at the time of skin incision.  Rectovaginal DIE was then targeted  using surgical 
NIR imaging equipment.  Rectovaginal  DIE, and superficial endometriotic  lesions  on the 
peritoneum were identified in every case.   No intra- or postoperative complications were 
reported.  The clinical utility of ICG during bowel resection for endometriosis has also been 
suggested, allowing  real-time visualization of bowel perfusion and aid in the selection of location  
of bowel transection (Seracchioli, Raimondo, Arena,  Zanello, & Mabrouk, 2018).
 
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility  of intravenous  ICG administration to 
facilitate assessments of ovarian vascular perfusion. Historically, assessment of ovarian 
perfusion has been performed visually or via ultrasound with Doppler evaluation. In a study  of 
infertile patients, ovarian perfusion  was assessed using transvaginal  ultrasound with Doppler 
(Kupesic & Kurjak, 1997) .  A resistance index (RI) was calculated based on vascular flow with 
differential results based on phase  of the menstrual cycle or presence of ovarian pathology. In 
patients with ovarian  endometriomas,  evidence  of ovarian interstitial microvascular injury has 
been demonstrated similarly by [CONTACT_32149] (Qiu et al., 2012).  The  use 
of ICG to evaluate ovarian  perfusion  specifically has not been reported.  The use of ICG for 
intraoperative perfusion assessment of the ovary could provide  more  information about the 
health of the ovary and inform the surgical  approach to ovarian pathology.  
2.[ADDRESS_31387] been reported  include allergic  reactions that 
range from urticarial (hives)  to anaphylaxis.  Because  of the sodium iodide presence in ICG 
contraindications include patients with a history of allergy to iodides due to the risk of 
anaphylaxis (Storz).  
2.5 Drug interactions
Listed drug interactions  include preparations  containing sodium bisulfite which reduce the 
absorption peak of ICG (KARL STORZ Endosscopy - America,  2016)

HRP-593 / v06182010.2 Research coordinator will review consent form with potential  participant leaving ample time 
for participants to review, comprehend and ask any questions about the consent form or the 
study. Consent will be reviewed in person when possible or reviewed in telehealth pre-op 
appointment using  eConsenting process  on REDCap. 
11.0 WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS
Patients can be taken off the study treatment  and/or study at any time at their own request, or 
they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral  or 
administrative reasons.  The reason(s)  for discontinuation will be documented and may include: 
11.1 Patient voluntarily  withdraws from the study (follow-up permitted); 
11.2 Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow-up); 
11.3 Patient is unable  to comply with protocol requirements; 
11.4 Patient experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;  
11.5 Treating physician will judge continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s  best 
interest; 
11.[ADDRESS_31392] undergoing the surgical  procedure  
and/or surgical  case is cancelled, the subject may be considered lost to follow up.
12.0 RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS
12.1 All patients  will be closely monitored  by [CONTACT_32152]. ICG is 
considered a safe, well-studied medication. 
12.2 Adverse  Events  
Rare adverse events  include  allergic reactions that range from urticarial (hives)  to anaphylaxis.  
Because of the sodium iodide presence  in ICG contraindications include patients with a history 
of allergy to iodides due to the risk of anaphylaxis  (KARL STORZ Endoscopy  – America, 2016).  
Because the patients will be under  general anesthesia as is standard protocol for laparoscopy, 
the surgical and anesthesia teams will be able to easily manage any adverse reactions. 
12.3 Drug interactions
Listed drug interactions  include preparations  containing sodium bisulfite which reduce the 
absorption peak of ICG (KARL STORZ Endoscopy - America,  2016)
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; Hyoscyamine; Phenobarbital; Scopolamine: (Moderate) Phenobarbital may 
increase the clearance indocyanine green. The half-life of indocyanine green was lower in 
patients taking  the drugs  concomitantly compared to patients  with normal  and abnormal  liver 
function taking  no concomitant medications.  The mechanism of interaction is unclear; those 
proposed in the medical literature include increased  indocyanine  green uptake by [CONTACT_32153], 
enhanced binding by [CONTACT_32154], or more rapid excretion into bile.

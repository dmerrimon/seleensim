  8 2  INTRODUCTION  2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   SAH due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is a life threatening medical emergency with a mortality of 25-40%.  In survivors of the initial bleeding, endothelial injury and blood in the subarachnoid space induce an intense inflammatory response, leading to vessel wall thickening and caliber reduction over the first 10-14 days following the bleed. This inflammatory process may cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).   DCI is the clinical result of a complex neurovascular inflammatory response characterized by [CONTACT_61166], impaired blood vessel autoregulation, direct inflammatory injury, thrombosis, and cerebral edema. The ultimate result is decreased cerebral blood flow and altered neurovascular communications.  The inflammatory and ischemic injury associated with DCI may result in long-term cognitive dysfunction and functional disability in >50% of survivors.   In an effort to prevent and treat DCI, patients with SAH require intensive care unit monitoring of hemodynamics and neurologic function for 10-14 days after the primary hemorrhage. Monitoring of the tone of intracranial blood vessels is routinely carried out daily with transcranial Doppler flow velocities, and cerebral angiography when indicated.  Clinical deteriorations that are accompanied by [CONTACT_61167]/or intra-arterial vasodilators, with limited therapeutic effectiveness. The only recommended pharmacological therapy is the prophylactic administration of a 21-day course of the calcium channel blocker nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050].[1]] There are currently no other effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61149].  2.2 BACKGROUND   Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are arachidonic acid metabolites that are emerging as important regulators of cerebral blood flow and neuroinflammation after brain injury, including SAH.[2, 3] EETs are synthesized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 epoxygenases in response to cellular insults including ischemia. The beneficial properties of EETs, which have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, include: vasodilation, promotion of angiogenesis, reduced microvascular thrombosis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, decreased apoptosis, and decreased inflammation. All these processes are disturbed following SAH.  EETs have multiple sites of action: on the endothelium where they likely regulate inflammatory response, on vascular smooth muscle where they are involved in regulating vasomotor tone, and more broadly throughout the neurovascular units regulating neurovascular communication.  Multiple biomarkers have been identified that characterize neuroinflammation after SAH, and many have been associated with EETs signaling (Table 1). EETs are primarily metabolized to inactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by [CONTACT_61168] (sEH), which is expressed in cerebral endothelial and smooth muscle cells as well as astrocyte cell bodies and foot processes.[4]  Several polymorphisms in the gene responsible for sEH transcription, designated EPHX2, alter the structure and function of the enzyme.[5, 6] One variant conferring increased sEH activity and inactivation of EETs, known as K55R, has been linked to hypertension, ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease.[7-9] In patients with SAH, K55R genotype sEH is associated with 
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  9 increased mortality and incidence of stroke.[10] Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of sEH reduces infarct size after transient cerebral ischemia in animal models.[11]   Inhibition of sEH in humans has recently become feasible due to the availability of a drug under development by [CONTACT_35316], [COMPANY_004]2256294.  Pharmacokinetics and product metabolism In human and animal studies, the oral bioavailability of [COMPANY_004]2256294 was generally high, indicating good absorption, low plasma clearance and a half-life of 20-30 hours. Steady state was achieved within 6-8 days after daily repeat dosing in humans.[12] [COMPANY_004]2256294 has low to moderate protein binding, high passive permeability, and a moderate volume of distribution. Structural information on [COMPANY_004]2256294 metabolism in humans following both single and repeat oral doses in both healthy volunteers and obese smokers indicated [COMPANY_004]2256294 was the major drug related component in human plasma with biliary and urinary metabolites being formed by [CONTACT_61169] N-demethylation. Similar metabolites were detected in human and nonclinical hepatocytes.   In vitro data indicated limited potential for [COMPANY_004]2256294 to be a perpetrator of cytochrome P450 -mediated drug interactions. Population-based physiologically based pharmacokinetics model simulations, evaluating the risk of an interaction between [COMPANY_004]2256294 and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, predicted a moderate increase (3.2 fold) to the mean systemic exposure of [COMPANY_004]2256294 when administered together. Co-administration of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 has been recommended to be prohibited.    [COMPANY_004]2256294 inhibited the human breast cancer resistance protein and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 in vitro, suggesting the potential for drug interactions with statins that have their disposition modulated by [CONTACT_61170]. However, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic population based drug-drug interaction modelling simulation between [COMPANY_004]2256294 and sensitive substrates (including rosuvastatin) has predicted the clinical interaction risk to be negligible (<1.05 fold). Hence monitoring of adverse events is recommended with the concomitant use of [COMPANY_004]2256294 with statins.  Toxicology Administration of [COMPANY_004]2256294 was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in the rat and 1000 mg/kg/day in the monkey. A dose of 1000 mg/kg/day in the rat was generally less tolerated, with adverse clinical signs of reduced food consumption and body weight loss along with macroscopic and microscopic gastric and renal changes and urinalysis effects. In addition, increased liver weight and hepatocyte hypertrophy at 1000 mg/kg/day were noted in rats, along with associated thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy, effects which are often secondary to drug metabolizing enzyme induction in rats (systemic exposure was also reduced at Days 14 and 28 in rat as compared to Day 1). Minimal to mild atrophy of mammary glands was also seen in male rats at 1000 mg/kg/day. At >100 mg/kg/day in rats, there were increased serum cholesterol concentrations along with elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions. These were considered non-adverse. [COMPANY_004]2256294 was negative in a battery of genotoxicity assays.  In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies to date, assessment of male rat fertility in [ADDRESS_66064] article-related effects on male mating, fertility or male mediated fetal developmental toxicity after 2 and 11 weeks of dosing at up to 1000 mg/kg/day.  Human Studies

  10 The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of [COMPANY_004]2256294 has been evaluated in three Phase I studies: an ascending single and repeat dose study of [COMPANY_004]2256294 in healthy male volunteers and otherwise healthy adult male overweight and moderately obese smokers, a single dose study in healthy young and elderly subjects, and a repeat dose study in healthy volunteers. When administered with food (high fat meal), there was, on average, a 22% increase in AUC of [COMPANY_004]2256294 with similar maximum plasma concentration. The median time to peak concentration was delayed by [CONTACT_3450] 2 hours when [COMPANY_004]2256294 was administered with food (3.0 hrs versus 1.0 hr). These differences were not deemed to be clinically significant and [COMPANY_004]2256294 can be administered without any meal restrictions in future clinical studies.  [COMPANY_004]2256294 was eliminated mainly by [CONTACT_61171]. Renal elimination of unchanged parent represented <5% of the dose. In the single dose cohorts AE reporting was higher following [COMPANY_004]2256294 than placebo, but there was no evidence of increased reporting with increased dose.   Pharmacodynamics and Dose Finding The inhibitory effect of [COMPANY_004]2256294 on exogenous deuterium-labeled EETs was estimated in an ex vivo assay in healthy volunteers and otherwise healthy overweight to moderately obese smokers following single doses of 2-20mg, and following 14 days of once daily repeat dosing at 6mg and 18mg.[12]  The sEH activity was evaluated by [CONTACT_61172] 14,15 dDHET, corrected for non-sEH mediated hydrolysis and subsequently the % inhibition of sEH activity was defined.  >95% enzyme inhibition was observed for up to 48 hours following a single 10mg dose.  >98% enzyme inhibition was observed to be sustained for up to 48 hours following 14 days of daily administration.   2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.[ADDRESS_66065] frequently reported AEs were headache and nasopharyngitis. All AEs were considered to be of mild or moderate severity. There was one AE leading to withdrawal (presyncope) reported in heathy volunteers and one SAE in healthy adult male overweight and moderately obese smokers (nephrolithiasis) reported. Neither of these events were deemed likely to be related to the study drug.  Clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry and hematology parameters were infrequent and most were present at baseline. Following repeat dosing with [COMPANY_004]2256294, there was a statistically significant decrease in HDL compared to baseline. The ratio to placebo of change from baseline in HDL was not statistically significant, though there was a trend for a dose-dependent difference. There were no changes in vital signs of clinical importance. A clinically significant abnormality (nodal rhythm) was reported for one subject with presyncope.  
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  11 There were no fatal or non-fatal SAEs and no adverse event leading to the withdrawal. Treatment with [COMPANY_004]2256294 did not increase the room air pulmonary artery systolic pressure and did not augment the normal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictive response in healthy subjects. No clinically significant changes in any of the clinical laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and vital signs were observed.    [COMPANY_004]2256294 has been generally well tolerated in the clinic, although most studies with [COMPANY_004]2256294 have been of relatively short duration and the safety database is not extensive. Due to limited experience in human subjects, there is currently not enough information available about the relationship between administration of [COMPANY_004]2256294 and adverse events to assign causality. It is possible that there are other long-range risk associated with drug administration that have not been identified in previous trials.   No efficacy studies have been conducted to date. There is a potential that administration of the study drug will improve EETs signaling and reduce neuroinflammation and endothelial injury.  Patients in the treatment group may experience less vasoconstriction, fewer delayed ischemic complications after SAH, and improved neurologic outcomes.  This study will also involve sample collection from the blood and CSF.  Blood samples will be collected whenever possible from indwelling venous or arterial access. In the absence of an available access site, venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_61173].  CSF samples will be collected by [CONTACT_61174], which will have been placed as part of the patient’s routine medical care for SAH.  The EVD will be accessed in the same fashion as for routine, clinically-directed sampling, and wherever possible at the same time.  EVD access may very slightly increase the risk of introduction of bacteria and the development of ventriculitis.   2.3.2 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS   Based on previous phase 1 trials, the adverse event profile and pharmacologic interactions of [COMPANY_004]2256294 are minimal.[12]  There is a lack of detailed, long-term event tracking, and this will be the first study of [COMPANY_004]2256294 in a critically ill patient population, so it is possible that there will be unanticipated adverse events.  The drug exposure period will be relatively short, in line with previous phase [ADDRESS_66066] of care.  Our proposed study will not change the risks inherent to specimen sampling. Blood and CSF samples will be obtained at the same time (whenever feasible) and in the same fashion as routine and standard of care samples are obtained.  Study participation will not influence the clinical care of patients other than as defined in Section 11 within the Schedule of Activities. The potential benefit of reduced neuroinflammation and improved outcome in patients with an otherwise highly morbid, high mortality disease process outweighs these potential risks. Future patients with SAH may be benefited by [CONTACT_61175].    3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  12 • Primary Objective: Determine the safety of administration of [COMPANY_004]2256294 in patients with aneurysmal SAH.   Frequencies of AEs and SAEs: We will compare AEs and SAEs between the drug and placebo groups.  We will also compare daily safety labs (serum sodium, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, hematocrit, peripheral white blood cell count) between the groups. Specific to this patient population, we will also specifically screen for disease related events including seizure, new onset cardiomyopathy, NSTEMI/STEMI, hyponatremia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61150], mechanical ventilation, and thromboembolic events. We will describe the severity of headache (on a daily scale of 0-10.  Justification: Prior phase [ADDRESS_66067] common adverse event was headache. We will assess safety in this critically ill patient population with special focus on common sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage.    • Secondary Objective: Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of administration of [COMPANY_004]2256294 in patients with aneurysmal SAH.   To evaluate the effect of enzymatic inhibition on circulating EETs levels, we will measure day 7 and day 10 serum EET/DHET ratios. EETs levels will be measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy.  To evaluate the possible effect of enzymatic inhibition on CSF EETs levels we will measure day 7 and day 10 CSF EET/DHET ratios, and compare the drug and placebo groups. We will also measure other lipid metabolic substrates of sEH at days 7 and day 10, specifically serum epoxyoctadecenoic acid (EPOME) and dihydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid (DPOME), to assess sEH enzyme activity.   To evaluate more downstream effects on measures of endothelial injury and neuroinflammation, we will measure multiple biomarkers in the blood and CSF at day 7 and day 10 (Table 1). The biomarkers chosen are surrogate endpoints representing pathways of the inflammatory cascade associated with clinical endpoints in SAH.  Justification: EETs are degraded to inactive by[CONTACT_61176].  sEH activity has previously been measured after exposure to the study drug, and found to reach steady state level of >95% drug inhibition at [ADDRESS_66068] chosen to measure the EET/DHET ratio due to the normal fluctuations of EETs levels in the post-bleed period after SAH.  The drug will be deemed effective if we measure higher EET/DHET ratio in the treatment group compared to placebo, i.e. higher EETs suggests decreased metabolism by [CONTACT_61177]. It is possible that serum EET/DHET ratio will not be measurably increased. EETs have a very short serum half-life (minutes), and the most plausible site of action is at the neurovascular unit.  
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  13 To more precisely estimate sEH enzyme activity in plasma, we will also measure the metabolism of more stable lipid substrates of sEH: EPOME, and the metabolic by[CONTACT_61178]. Serum EPOME and DPOME levels have previously been used to measure the hydrolase activity of sEH.[13]  We will also determine whether there are CNS effects of the drug, either via direct measurement of increased EET/DHET ratio in the CSF, or via downstream effects on the inflammatory profile in the CSF and on the markers of endothelial dysfunction. This is particularly important because in healthy subjects and animals, the drug does not cross the blood brain barrier. It is possible that EETs have a localized action on the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle, without crossing the blood brain barrier. sEH inhibition may exert anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects at this site without changing measurable CSF EETs levels. If this is the case, we expect to detect differences in CSF inflammatory markers.  We anticipate a possible effect of the study drug in CSF for the following reasons: 1) There is breakdown of the blood brain barrier following SAH and both lipid and non-lipid soluble molecules may be able cross the neurovascular unit due to increased permeability; and 2) Endothelial-derived cytokines and mediators may be transported across compartments, including blood, perivascular space, and CSF.  It will be important to confirm the site of action of the study drug is only at the endothelium level or if its effects on the central nervous system  We will collect biomarkers at multiple time points because eicosanoid levels, endothelial dysfunction, and the inflammatory response vary significantly over the natural course of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  We may control for significant variations at baseline when interpreting the results.  • Tertiary Objective:  Provide preliminary estimates of clinically relevant endpoints to inform the design of a larger trial.  We will collect clinical measurements on outcomes throughout the treatment course, at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61151] 90-day follow-up. To assess DCI directly, we will measure daily middle cerebral artery (MCA) transcranial Doppler flow velocities and the degree of angiographic vasospasm.  We will also measure acute changes in neurologic exam, the need for therapeutic interventions for DCI, and new stroke on imaging at discharge.   We will also measure more objective surrogate outcomes at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5514] 90-day follow-up including: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], discharge disposition, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE).  Justification: This study is not powered to detect an effect of drug administration on these endpoints, but these data will provide information for sample size calculations in larger subsequent studies.  [ADDRESS_66069] of [COMPANY_004]2256294 on EETs metabolism, because EETs levels vary over the natural course of recover after SAH, and a placebo group is needed for comparison.  Randomization and double blinding additionally limit the influence of potential confounders and selection bias.   4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  [COMPANY_004]2256294 exposures are approximately dose proportional over the range of 6 mg to 20 mg.

The CareEverywhere electronic medical record network and obituary screening will be used to identify deaths.  6 STUDY INTERVENTION  6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINISTRATION  6.1.[ADDRESS_66073] dose of drug or placebo will be administered after informed consent, randomization and collection of baseline laboratory samples.  Subsequent doses will be administered daily for a total treatment course of 10 days. Subjects who are able to swallow will receive the capsule formulation orally.  Subjects not able to swallow will receive the contents of the capsule suspended in normal saline, administered via orogastric or nasogastric enteral access by [CONTACT_10327]. Missed doses will be administered as soon as feasible. No restriction to food intake is necessary.  6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY  6.2.[ADDRESS_66074] gelatin, containing a white powder. Matched placebo capsules which are also opaque Swedish orange containing white powder will be administered to the placebo group. The capsules are packaged into white, opaque, high density polyethylene bottles with child-resistant closures. The label for the clinician administering the drug will identify the medication as the “Study Drug”.  The label will contain the study number, subject number, quantity of product, and directions for use.  6.2.[ADDRESS_66075] STORAGE AND STABILITY  The capsule will be stored at room temperature, and the drug is stable up to 30oC.  6.2.4 PREPARATION  Capsule packaging will be labeled as described above and dispensed from the OHSU investigational pharmacy to the OHSU NSICU on a daily basis.  At the time of administration, the bedside nurse will administer the capsule formulation orally in patients able to swallow.  If patients are unable to swallow, the bedside nurse will open the capsule and suspend the contents in 10mL of 0.9% normal saline, and administered immediately after suspension via orogastric or nasogastric tube.  6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  Participants who meet all eligibility criteria and consented for study participation will be randomized by [CONTACT_61180]. A randomization list will be generated by [CONTACT_61181]. The randomization procedure will require confirmation of the eligibility criteria to ensure that the integrity of the randomization is maintained. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms based on an unrestricted or “fair-coin” randomization procedure. 
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.[ADDRESS_66076] (EMR), which will be used as source documentation, and administration verified daily.  Missed doses and reason will be recorded on a study log. The drug accountability record will be maintained by [CONTACT_36971].    6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  Relevant concomitant medications prescribed during the study drug administration period will be recorded from the EMR in the following classes: vasopressors, antihypertensives, hyperosmolar therapy, nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], insulin, statins and antibiotics.  7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  Discontinuation from drug or placebo administration does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. All patients are expected to complete the treatment course unless they experience an SAE that is thought to be related to the study drug, die, are discharged early, or withdraw early from the study.  7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study if any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced. 7.[ADDRESS_66077] participant for follow-up: • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, [ADDRESS_66078] with PCP. We will also screen obituaries and check the EMR for potential deaths.  • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.  8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  8.1 SCREENING, CONSENT, AND RANDOMIZATION  Screening: Research coordinators will survey the NSICU census on a daily basis to determine which patients are potentially eligible for enrollment. Patients who have cerebral angiography demonstrating ruptured intracranial aneurysm who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached to provide informed consent. For women of childbearing potential, baseline urine pregnancy test will be performed at admission as part of the standard of care. If not already performed as part of standard medical care, liver function tests will be sent to determine subjects’ baseline liver function.  Consent: We have developed a written consent to be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_61182]. The recruitment process may take place in-person or by [CONTACT_648]. A phone script is attached with this submission. Either the PI, coinvestigators or research staff will explain the objectives, risks and benefits of the study to the patient. We will allow adequate time to answer questions and address concerns.   Some patients will not be able to provide informed consent due to incapacity. Legally authorized surrogate decision makers will be approached to provide consent in these scenarios. There will be no financial compensation or incentive provided to study participants. Study candidates must sign the informed consent form before any study-specific tests or procedures are performed.  Enrollment/randomization: Eligible patients are defined as participants meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusions and who have provided a written informed consent. Participants must be screened, consented, and enrolled in the study within [ADDRESS_66079] or patient/surrogate interview. • Patient Demographics: Ethnographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, height, BMI), level of education, and detailed contact [CONTACT_61183]-up

We will also collect details about history of preexisting medical comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score, screening for tobacco use, and targeted questions about neurologic history. A baseline EKG will be performed as part of the standard of care, and reviewed for evidence of conduction abnormalities or acute myocardial ischemia. • Admission medications: Selected classes of medications administered from the time of ICU admission to randomization will be recorded. We will also record selected classes of home medications the patient may have been taking prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  8.[ADDRESS_66080] dose of study drug will be administered immediately after randomization.  Subsequent doses will be administered daily in the morning for a total of 10 days. The preferred route of administration is orally, but patients with SAH are often neurologically compromised and unable to safely swallow.  A suspended formulation will be administered via the orogastric or nasogastric route for patients deemed unsafe to swallow.  8.4 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  8.4.1 DAILY ASSESSMENTS  Daily assessments will be performed beginning on the randomization day (day=1), and on subsequent study days that subjects receive study drug (days 2-10). The randomization day will be defined as the time from randomization to the next 6:59 AM. All subsequent study days will be defined as a 24-hour window between 7:00AM and 6:[ADDRESS_66081] as part of patients’ routine intensive care unit treatment and monitoring, or by [CONTACT_61184].

The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61154]. The 90-day follow-up assessment will be obtained from phone interview with the patient or their surrogate. We will collect the following information:  • At Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3849]:  o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], in days o New stroke on imaging: We will review the last head CT or other brain imaging to detect the presence of a new area of cerebral infarction. We will define a cerebral infarction identified on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61155] 24–48 hours after aneurysm occlusion, and not attributable to other causes such as surgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_61156]. Hypodensities resulting from extraventricular drains or residual intraparencyhmal hematomas will not be considered new strokes. o Discharge disposition: We will record the disposition from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61157]: home, home with services, rehab, LTAC, SNF, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], death o Modified Rankin Scale: We will determine and record the mRS score from where 0 – no symptoms, 1 – no significant disability, able to carry out all usual activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_61158], 2 – slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities, 3 – moderate disability, requires some help, but able to walk unassisted, 4 – moderately severe disability, unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted, 5 – severe disability, requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent, 6 – deceased. • At 90-day follow up o Modified Rankin Scale o Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE): At [ADDRESS_66088] the GOSE on a scale of 1-8 where 1 – deceased, 2 – vegetative state, 3 – low severe disability, 4 – upper severe disability, 5 – low moderate disability, 6 –upper moderate disability, 7 – low good recovery, 8 – upper good recovery.   8.6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  8.6.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  23 8.6.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)   An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   8.6.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.   • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.   [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.   • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  OR  • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be 
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.[ADDRESS_66089] be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. • Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. • Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). • Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_61159] (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention or reported in the investigator brochure 8.6.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP  The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study drug (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.[ADDRESS_66090] randomization or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever comes sooner.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  8.6.[ADDRESS_66091] process for reporting include: seizure, need for intervention to manage DCI, new onset cardiomyopathy, hypotension, hypertension, NSTEMI/STEMI, hyponatremia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61150], respi[INVESTIGATOR_61160], therapeutic antimicrobial use and indication, thromboembolic events, and disease related death.  8.6.[ADDRESS_66092] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the independent safety monitor and to the IRB  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable.   The investigators will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and GlaxoSmithKline of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.   8.6.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS   Participants who experience adverse events will be followed until resolution, and will be referred for consultation as needed.  8.7 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  8.7.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  26 The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.   8.7.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:    • UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 72 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  • Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 7 days the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  • All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.  8.7.3 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS   Participants who experience adverse events related to unanticipated problems will be followed until resolution, and will be referred for consultation as needed.  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   9.1 STATISTICAL ENDPOINTS

The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol: Informed consent form and complete variable list.  [IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be IRB-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study-specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693]. 10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_61188] <study participants, investigator, funding agency, the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor and regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and 
SUSHI Trial  Version 3.0 Protocol SUSHI-1 29 November 2018 
  30 will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.   Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants • Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable • Determination that the primary endpoint has been met • Determination of futility  Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and/or Food and Drug Administration (FDA).]   10.1.[ADDRESS_66096] by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.   All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_10414]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, or sponsor requirements.  10.1.[ADDRESS_66097] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]   [IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES   Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.    Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.   Clinical data (including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical laboratory data will be entered into the case report forms, consisting of an electronic data capture system APOM OCEAN, a [ADDRESS_66098] protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  [IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION   Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_66099] approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least [ADDRESS_66100] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  10.1.7 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].   These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  • 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  • 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  • 5.[ADDRESS_66101] (IRB) per their policies. The investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.   10.1.[ADDRESS_66102].

Assessments  Efficacy : Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], SwCl,  CFQ -R, documentation of events related to health outcomes 
(e.g., PEx), height, and weight  
Safety : AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical 
examinations, and ophthalmologic examinations (for subjects <18  years of age on the date 
of informed consent)  
PK: VX-121, TEZ, D -IVA, ELX, IVA, and relevant metabolite plasma  concentrations  
Exploratory:  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), Cystic 
Fibrosis Impact Questionnaire (CF -IQ), DNA sample (optional),  inflammatory mediators,  
blood biomarker sample, RNA sample (optional), and sputum samples  
  
Statistical 
Analyses  The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through 
Week 24  (estimated by [CONTACT_577228] 16 and 24) . The primary null hypothesis to be 
tested is that the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 throug h Week 24 for 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA is inferior by >3  percentage points compared to ELX/TEZ/IVA. The 
null hypothesis will be tested at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025.  
Assuming a within -group SD of 8 and 10% drop -out rate at Week 24 and a treatment 
differ ence of 0 between VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1176178] more than 90% power to test 
the primary hypothesis for the primary endpoint, based on a [ADDRESS_1176179] at a 
significance level of 0.025.  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted with clinic spi[INVESTIGATOR_846144] a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, and 
Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, continuous 
baseline SwCl, and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates . An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model  the within -subject errors.  

Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 6 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference 
through Week 24. The primary null hypothesis will be rejected and non -inferiority 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI is ≥ -3.0. 
  
DMC Reviews  A data monitoring committee ( DMC) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined 
in the DMC Charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. CF affects more than 80,000  individuals worldwide 
(approximately 31,000 in the US and 49,000  in the EU).1-4  
CF is caused by [CONTACT_155412]/or function of the CFTR protein du e to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene.[ADDRESS_1176202] common disease -causing mutation is F508del : approximately 85.3% of people with CF 
in the US and 80.6% in Europe have at least one F508del  allele.1, [ADDRESS_1176203] a cure. CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) represent 
a major advancement in the t reatment of CF because they are systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_577205].7, [ADDRESS_1176204] 
established the therapeutic value of specific regimens developed by [CONTACT_139383]. These treatment 
regimens include ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco™), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA dual 
combi nation therapy (Orkambi™), tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA dual combination therapy 
(Symdeko™, Symkevi™), and elexacaftor (ELX)/TEZ/IVA triple combination (TC) therapy 
(Trikafta™, Kaftrio™).  
Deutivacaftor (D -IVA, VX-561) is a CFTR potentiator and is a deuterated iso tope of IVA with a 
specific pattern of 9  substituted deuteriums. In vitro data indicate similar potency of D -IVA in 
human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells relative to IVA. Nonclinical and clinical data 
demonstrate a similar safety profile relative to IVA, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data support once 
daily (qd) dosing (refer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA Investigator’s Brochure).  
VX-[ADDRESS_1176205] of TEZ. The CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by 
[CONTACT_94273]-121 alone or in combination with TEZ (VX -121/TEZ) was potentiated by [CONTACT_577230] 
D-IVA. In HBE cells derived from people homozygous for F508del  (F/F-HBE) and people 
heterozygous for F508del  and a minimal function (MF) CFTR  mutation (F/MF -HBE cells) and 
studied in vitro, the TC of VX -121, TEZ, and IVA (VX -121/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride 
transport more than the dual combinations of VX -121/TEZ or VX -121/IVA under most 
conditions (refer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA Investigator’s Brochure).  
5.2 Study Rationale  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA in CF subjects who are 
heterozygous for F508del  and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) (refer to Appendix A for a 
non-exhaustive list of MF mutations). While ELX/TEZ/IVA is approved in certain regions for 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 24 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  subjects with F/MF genotypes, there remains a need for more highly effective CFTR modulators 
that ca n restore CFTR function (e.g.,  CFTR -mediated chloride transport) toward levels seen in 
carriers (who do not develop CF) in as many patients with CF as possible. The potential for 
benefit in these patients is supported by [CONTACT_155414] F/MF subjects; in 
addition, VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA is generally safe and well tolerated (refer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA 
Investigator’s Brochure).

Study visits and assessments to be conducted are shown in Table  3-1 and Table  3-2. All visits 
will occur within the windows specified.  
9.1.1  Screening  
Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1.  
The Screening Period (Day  -56 through Day  -29) will occur within [ADDRESS_1176211] dose 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period.  
Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subject s meet the eligibility criteria. The 
investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if 
applicable, from each subject before any study procedure takes place.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening asse ssments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening 
window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening  
Subjects ma y be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be 
repeated, except for:  
• CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal 
range as determined by [CONTACT_846153])  
• Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3  months of the date of informed consent, 
for subjects <18  years of age  on the date of informed consent ) 
If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening 
assessment has been initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extension of Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2  weeks for the following 
reasons:  
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] )

Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run -in Period will not be 
randomized or  participate in the Treatment Period (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
9.1.3  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table  3-2.  
The Treatment Period will be randomized, double -blind, and ELX/TEZ/IVA -controlled. It will 
last approximately 52  weeks (Day  1 through Week  52). Study drug administration  details are 
provided in Section  9.6. 
Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and 
may occur on eith er Day [ADDRESS_1176213] stable C F disease (as judged by [CONTACT_1275]) and have remained on a stable CF treatment regimen during the Run -in Period.

whichever is earlier (Section  9.9) 
If subjects  are lost to follow -up (Section  9.1.6 ), the date of completion of study participation  will 
be defined as the date of the last contact.  
The end of stu dy is defined in Section  13.2.9 . 
9.1.8  Use of Remote Measures in Extenuating Circumstances  
Study visits should be performed in the clinic as specified in Section 3, Table  3-1, and Table  3-2, 
if at all possible. However, under extenuating circumstances, specific alternative measures may 
be implemented (e.g., if a subject is unable to travel to the study site due to safety concerns 
and/or local restrictions related to COVID -19 or other emerging events) in order to ensure the 
safety of subjects, site investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP 
and minimizing impact to the i ntegrity of the study. The decision whether to conduct study visits 
remotely or in clinic will be at the discretion of the investigator; if the investigator determines 
that study visits will be conducted remotely, the medical monitor should be notified. Th e 
Screening Visit, Day -[ADDRESS_1176221] be performed in clinic.  
The following remote measures may be implemented. Additional details can be found in the 
Study Reference Manual.  
• Consent or reconsen t may be obtained remotely in writing (or verbally, with follow -up 
written confirmation), as allowed by [CONTACT_427].  
• Study drug may be shipped directly from the site to the subject, as applicable and as allowed 
by [CONTACT_427].  
• Study visits (ex cept for those noted above) may be conducted as in -home visits by [CONTACT_134323].  
• Study assessments to evaluate safety and efficacy may be performed or overseen by [CONTACT_577232] -home visits.  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 32 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.1.9  Data Monitoring Committee  
Safety an d tolerability data will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee (DMC) to ensure 
the safety of the subjects. Procedural details of the DMC’s structure and function, frequency of 
meetings, and data planned for review will be in the DMC charter. The DMC c harter will be 
finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA group or the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_139373] (<18  versus ≥18  years of 
age), ppFEV 1 determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 clinic assessment; <70 versus ≥70), 
SwCl determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 assessment; <30 versus ≥30 mmol/L), and 
prior CFTR modulator use (yes v ersus no). If the Day -14 ppFEV 1 and/or SwCl values are not 
valid or not available, the most recent available clinic -assessed ppFEV 1 and/or SwCl value will 
be used for stratification.  
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subject s to treatment. The 
randomization code list will be produced by [CONTACT_155418] a qualified randomization 
vendor.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy and safety of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA therapy in F/MF 
subjects. 
A randomized, double -blind, ELX/TEZ/IVA -controlled study design was selected to ascertain 
the effects of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA while avoiding observer bias. ELX/TEZ/IVA is considered 
an appropriate active control since it is an approved standard of care f or treatment of patients 
with at least one F508del  allele in some regions.  
A 4-week Run -in Period was incorporated into this study  to establish a reliable on -treatment 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison during the Treatment Period.  
A 52 -week treatment duration was selected to characterize the safety and efficacy of 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA compared to ELX/TEZ/IVA. The primary endpoint is absolute change 
from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24. B ased on prior experience with CFTR modulators, 
24 weeks is adequate  to compare the efficacy of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA versus ELX/TEZ/IVA on 
the endpoints being evaluated.  
9.3.2  Study Population  
This study will enroll F/MF subjects to evaluate the treatment effect in subjects with a single 
F508del  allele and a second allele that eithe r results in no translated CFTR protein or that is 
non-responsive to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA based on in vitro testing. As described in 
Section  9.3.3 , F/MF subjects are expected to respond to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA based on results 
from a Phase 2 study conducted in F/MF subjects.  
Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rationale for treating patients earlier in life. 
Experience with CFTR modulato rs in adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18  years of age, including 
with ELX/TEZ/IVA, suggests that the exposures and safety profile of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA will 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 33 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  be similar in adolescents and adults, which supports evaluation of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA in 
adolescents in the  present study.  
9.3.3  Study Drug Dose  
ELX/TEZ/IVA  
ELX/TEZ/IVA will be administered as ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, 
which is the approved dosing regimen for Trikafta (Kaftrio) in subjects 12 years of age and 
older.  
VX-121 
The VX -121 dose of 20 mg  qd was selected for Phase 3 based on an assessment of the  benefit -
risk profile from the Phase 2 Study VX18 -121-101 (Study 121 -101) Part 1 and the relative 
bioavailability (BA) of VX -121 Form A compared to Form D in Study VX19 -121-003 
(Study  121-003).  
Study 121 -101 evaluated a range of VX -121 (Form A) doses (5 mg qd, 10 mg  qd, and 20 mg  qd) 
in TC with TEZ 100 mg  qd/D -IVA 150 mg  qd for 4 weeks in F/MF subjects. Treatment with 
VX-121 10 mg  qd in TC with TEZ/D -IVA resulted in clinically meaningful improvement s in 
ppFEV 1 and SwCl  compared to the placebo group, with minimal additional improvement at a 
higher dose of VX -121 20 mg in TC with TEZ/D -IVA. VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA was generally safe 
and well tolerated in all dose groups, and no differences in the safety profile of 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA were observed across the dose groups.   
In addition to the Phase 2 efficacy study, Study 121 -003 evaluated the relative BA of a fixed -
dose combination (FDC) of VX -121 (Form D) 20 mg/TEZ 100 mg/D -IVA 150 mg compared to 
separate ta blets of VX -121 (Form A), TEZ, and D -IVA at the same dose. Results showed that 
VX-121 Form D had ~55% lower  Cmax and ~50% lower AUC compared to VX -121 Form 
A. Therefore, a  dose of VX -121 20  mg qd Form D was selected for Phase 3 to achieve similar 
exposures  as the VX -121 10 mg (Form A) dose.   
TEZ  
Based on results from Studies VX17 -121-001 and 121 -101, exposures of TEZ and its metabolites 
at the approved dose of TEZ 100 mg qd in combination with VX -121/IVA or VX -121/D -IVA 
were similar to historical exposures . The dose of TEZ to be evaluated in Phase 3 will be 100 mg 
qd, which is part of the approved dosing regimens for Symdeko (Symkevi) and Trikafta 
(Kaftrio).  
D-IVA 
The D -IVA dose of 250 mg qd was selected for Phase 3 based on assessment of the benefit -risk 
profile from the Phase 2 Study VX18 -561-101 (Study 561 -101) as well as PK data and 
exposure -response modeling.  
A Phase 2 monotherapy dose -ranging study (Study 561 -101) was conducted that evaluated 
D-IVA at 25 mg qd, 50 mg qd, 150 mg qd, and 250 mg qd for 12  weeks in subjects with a gating 
mutation who were receiving stable IVA treatment. Treatment with D -IVA 250 mg qd resulted 
in similar ppFEV 1 and SwCl values as the IVA 150 mg q12h group, with greater improvements 
in SwCl compared to the D -IVA 150 mg qd gro up. Treatment with D -IVA 150  mg qd and 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 34 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  250 mg qd was safe and well tolerated, and D -IVA exposures seen at 250 mg qd are consistent 
with prior IVA clinical experience.  
9.3.4  Rationale for Study Assessments  
The efficacy endpoints being evaluated (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], SwCl,  CFQ -R, PEx, and anthropometric 
measurements) are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant 
to the study of individuals with CF. On the Day -14 and Day 1 Visits, spi[INVESTIGATOR_577209] a mobile device to estab lish baseline values on the mobile device. SwCl was 
evaluated in the registration study of IVA (Kalydeco), TEZ/IVA combination therapy (Symdeko, 
Symkevi), and ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta, Kaftrio). Spi[INVESTIGATOR_155385] -R assessments were 
evaluated in the registrat ion studies of IVA (Kalydeco), LUM/IVA combination therapy 
(Orkambi), TEZ/IVA combination therapy (Symdeko, Symkevi), and ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta, 
Kaftrio).  
All safety and PK assessments are standard measurements for clinical studies in drug 
development. Hem oglobin A1c (HbA1c) is included to assess pancreatic endocrine function.  
Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chronic bacterial infection of the airways, and the 
inflammatory response all play a role in causing lung damage in CF. Therefore, assessment of 
inflammatory mediators and other biomarkers is included.  
The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is included as an additional 
endpoint, and is a widely used generic measure of satisfaction with medication and has been 
demonstrated  to be a valid and reliable measure of satisfaction in patients with CF.14 The 
domains of the TSQM measure effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. 
Because treatment satisfaction is not measured with the other health -related quality -of-life 
measures in this study, the TSQM is included as a study assessment. CF -IQ is also includ ed as an 
additional endpoint to assess life impacts of CF and complement the CFQ -R and TSQM. Patient 
Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) are 
included to assess a subject’s perceived severity/change of disease .

• Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28  days before the 
Run-in/Day -[ADDRESS_1176226] 
28 days before the Run -in/Day -28. Subjects may remain on Vertex CFTR modulators 
(investigational or approved) during the Screening Period and may transition directly to the 
Run-in/Day  -28 without a washout ( Table  9-2). Subjects should not initiate long -term 
treatment with new medication from 28  days before the Run -in/Day -28 through completion 
of study participation . Guidelines for stabl e treatment regimens for CF are as follows:  
o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period should 
be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day  in 
the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic.  
o Subjects who alternate between [ADDRESS_1176227] dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period should be synchronized a s closely as possible 
(e.g., not more than ±  3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled 
antibiotics.  
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10  mg/day chronically. 
Subjects cannot receive prednisone or prednisolon e at doses >60 mg qd for longer than a 
5-day period.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • TEZ/IVA is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1, and ELX and M23 -ELX are potential inhibitors 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Administration of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA or ELX/TEZ/IVA may 
increase systemic exposure of substrates  of OATP1B1/1B3, which may increase or prolong 
their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions; therefore, caution and appropriate monitoring 
should be used when coadministration of study drugs with medicinal products that are 
substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, suc h as statins, glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide, is 
required.  
• IVA and D -IVA are weak inhibitors of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Administration of IVA or 
D-IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of 
P-gp, whic h may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin 
or other substrates of P -gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus,

• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless o f whether transaminase levels have improved  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to 
baseline.  
If an alternative,  reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminases  return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the  
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study 
drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 
4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation interruption  threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_155421] 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Access to Spi[INVESTIGATOR_155395] : 
During the conduct of the study, th e Vertex study team will not have access to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_577211] [ADDRESS_1176247] results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the 
Screening Visit and Day -14 values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not 
be informed of study -related spi[INVESTIGATOR_577212] (i.e.,  clinical study report [CSR] finalization), r egardless of whether the subject has 
prematurely discontinued treatment.  
10.7.[ADDRESS_1176248]’s treatment by [CONTACT_14450]’s study treatment is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators w ill use their best judgment as to 
whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_577233]. 
If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_846154]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding.  
Contact [CONTACT_14452] (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_1176249]’s study file. 
Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with  Vertex, the CRO, or any site 
personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the investigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, 
according to the regulatory definitions or c riteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to 
Vertex GPS or designee, per Section  13.1.[ADDRESS_1176250] and disease character istics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, 
and weight . 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during 
screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disq ualifying 
medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will 
include a complete review of systems, medical and surgical histories, and any allergies.  
Height and weight will be measured with shoes off . Height will be collected at screening for all 
subjects. Following screening,  height will be collected only for subjects ≤21  years of age on the 
date of informed consent.  
11.2 Pharmacokinetics  
11.2.1  Blood Sampling  
Blood samples will be collected to determine plasma co ncentrations of VX -121, TEZ, D -IVA, 
ELX, IVA, and relevant metabolites. These samples may also be used for further evaluation of 
the bioanalytical method, or for exploratory analyses that provide information on the metabolic 
pathways used by [CONTACT_846155].  
For PK sampling at the Week  8 Visit, a ll subjects <[ADDRESS_1176251] 1  postdose sample taken at 4  hours after the morning clinic dose.  
Approximately  40 subjects ≥[ADDRESS_1176252] a total of 
4 postdose samples taken at 4, 5, 6, and 7  hours after the morning clinic dose. All other subjects 
≥[ADDRESS_1176253] 1 postdose sample taken at 2 hours 
after the morning clinic dose.  Vertex will manage the allocation of the 40  subjects providing 
more intensive PK sampling across study sites. If study drug is not administered at the Week 8 
visit (i.e., due to study drug interruption or permanent discontinuation), a single PK blood samp le 
will be collected at the visit.  
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing. 
Acceptable windows for sampling times are shown in Table  11-1. Samples collected outside of 
these acceptable windows will be considered protocol deviations. The exact time of the sample 
collection will be noted.

From 2 up to ≤7 hours after study drug dosing  ± [ADDRESS_1176254] operating procedures. A description  of the assay and validation data will be 
provided in separate reports.  
11.3 Pharmacodynamics  
While SwCl is a pharmacodynamic measure of CFTR function, it is also a measure of efficacy 
and is discussed in Section 11.5.2 . 
11.4 Exploratory Assessments  
These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes. Detailed procedures for the collection 
of blood samples and additional procedures for processing and handling samples for 
pharmacogenomics analysis will be provided in a separate document.  
11.4.1  Pharmac ogenomics  
An optional single  blood sample (DNA Sample) will be collected for potential exploratory 
evaluation of associations between DNA markers with PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), treatment 
response, AEs, and health and disease, especially CF, for subjects w ho choose to participate in 
this assessment (if permitted by [CONTACT_427]).  
11.4.2  Inflammatory Mediators  
Blood samples (inflammatory mediator samples) will be collected at the time points noted in 
Table  3-2 and tested to assess markers related to inflammation. These may include, but are not 
limited to, C -reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin G (IgG), white blood cell (WBC, 
leukocyte) count, and interleuk in-8 (IL -8). Specific instructions for the collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment of inflammatory mediator samples will be provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.  
11.4.3  Other Blood Biomarkers  
Additional blood samples for plasma and serum will be collected and banked for potential future 
exploratory evaluation of other blood biomarkers (e.g., proteins, peptides, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], metabolites, 
etc.) in relation to PK, PD,  treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF.  
Optional blood samples (RNA Sample ) may be collected (if permitted by [CONTACT_427]) for 
potential exploratory evaluation of associations between RNA markers with PK, PD, treatment 
response, and AEs.  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 45 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  11.4.4  Microbiology and Other Sputum Biomarkers  
Sputum samples will be collected at the time  points noted in Table  3-2 from subjects who can 
produce a sample spontaneously. Each sample will be processed and frozen for potential 
exploratory evaluation of microbiology analysis and sputum biomarkers (which may include, but 
are not limited to, qualitative and quantitative bacterial and viral assessments including genomic 
analyses, analysis of immune cells, inflammatory markers, proteins, peptide s, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and 
endogenous metabolites) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs,  and various disease 
manifestations of CF . 
Specific instructions for the collection, processing, aliquoting, storage, and shipment of sputum 
samples will be provided in t he Laboratory Manual.   
11.4.5  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication  
The TSQM is a widely used generic measure of satisfaction with medication. The domains of the 
TSQM measure effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. Because  
treatment satisfaction is not measured with the other health -related quality -of-life measures in 
this study, the TSQM will be included as an assessment for this purpose. Translations of the 
TSQM will be provided for participating centers with non -English -speaking populations.  
All subjects should be instructed to complete the TSQM questionnaire on the Day  -28 Visit 
based on their experience of their current medication regimen over the prior 2 to 3  weeks. O nly 
subjects <18  years of age on the date of inform ed consent will complete the TSQM at subsequent 
visits;  these subjects should be instructed to complete the TSQM based on their experience of the 
study drug over the prior [ADDRESS_1176255].  
11.4.6  Other Questionnaires  
The CF -IQ is a 23 -item measure of  patient -reported life impacts of CF across 5 domains: control 
and burden of CF treatment, physical activity, social activity, emotional, and work/school 
limitations.  The CF -IQ measures each concept using a 5 - or 7-point verbal rating scale and 
specifies a  7-day recall period for retrospective questions. The CF -IQ was developed to 
characterize the patients’ experience of living with CF and to measure the impact of CF and CF 
treatment on patients’ lives. The CF -IQ is designed to complement existing, more sym ptom -
focused, CF -specific patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures like the CFQ -R. Translations of 
the CF -IQ will be provided for participating centers with non -English -speaking populations .  
For purposes of validating CF -IQ, PGIS and PGIC will be performed  per Table  3-[ADDRESS_1176256]’s perceived severity/change of disease. Details regarding CF -IQ validation will 
be provided in a separate document.

nose, and throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed 
when medically indi cated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs 
will be reported as AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: head, neck, and 
thyroid; EENT; cardiovascular system; respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; skin ; and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_577219] (as applicable). The subject will be instructed 
to rest for at least [ADDRESS_1176268]. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, 
pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing (Section  9.6.1 ). 
11.6.[ADDRESS_1176269] 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The subject will b e instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_577220] (as applicable).  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_846156]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 51 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either  of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the r epeat measurement. If study sites cannot 
evaluate QTcF they should discuss alternatives with the medical monitor.  
11.6.6  Ophthalmologic  Examination  
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <[ADDRESS_1176270] and will 
include:  
• measurement of best -corrected distan ce visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically -dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an 
examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted w ithin 3  months before the 
date of informed consent.  
In addition to the screening ophthalmologic examination, subjects who are <[ADDRESS_1176271] a single ophthalmologic examination within 4 weeks prior t o completion of study 
participation (Section 9.1.7 ), except for those subjects who have withdrawn consent or assent 
(Table  3-2). This examination should be completed within [ADDRESS_1176272] prematurely discontinues study drug, in which case this examination shou ld 
occur by [CONTACT_22950] -up Visit (or ETT  Visit for subjects who do not complete a Safety 
Follow -up Visit), as described in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_1176273] battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured 
mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of 
VX-121, ELX, TEZ, and IVA have not shown terato genicity in rats and rabbits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below:  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contracepti on. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the Screening Visit through [ADDRESS_1176274] dose of study drug.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). For cases of presumed complete bilateral 
absence of the vas deferens of a male subject, infertility must be documented by [CONTACT_577235]20 -121-102, Version  3.[ADDRESS_1176275] dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period (e.g., examination of 
a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_577236]).  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consec utive months and a serum FSH level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy  
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do  not have 
a documented bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy) will be considered to be of 
childbearing potential.  
• Exclusive same sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived , study participation 
requires a com mitment from the subject that at least [ADDRESS_1176276] dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IV A in the Run -in Period (unless otherwise noted), and until [ADDRESS_1176277] dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed 
according to local regulations and/or requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception are 
listed in Table  11-3.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Additional notes : 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite sex.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm during the period starting from the first dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period until [ADDRESS_1176281] dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential should not plan to become pregnant during the 
study or within [ADDRESS_1176282] dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period or sperm from another source . 
• Male subject s whose female partner becomes pregnant through well -documented in vitro 
fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug), or is otherwise already pregnant before the male subject’s first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
in the Run -in Period , must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this 
scenario, the male subject and his female partner must commit to using a male condom (to 
ensure there is no exposure of the fetus to study drug) from signing consent throu gh [ADDRESS_1176283] dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects should not breast -feed a child from signing consent through [ADDRESS_1176284] dose of study drug.  
• Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed wi th the 
Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee  on an individual basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_1176285], becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s know ledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.  
A subject (or their partner, if relevant) who becomes pregnant while on study will be followed 
until the end of the pregnancy, and the inf ant will be followed for 1  year after birth, provided 
informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow -up 
activities. Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Approximately 400  subjects  will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA 
group or the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Information regarding the powering of the primary and 
selected key secondary efficacy endpoint is presented below.  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 54 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Power for Primary Analysis of Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24. 
The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from 
baseline through Week 24 for VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA is inferior by >3  percentage points compared 
to ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
The non -inferiority margin represents a clinically acceptable loss of effectiveness as outlined in 
regulatory guidances. Furthermore, a statistical approach using the Rothmann method 
recommends that the non-inferiority margin preserve at least 50% of the treatment effect of the 
active control (ELX/TEZ/IVA) compared to placebo, where the treatment effect is estimated by 
[CONTACT_56838] 95% CI.21, 22 In the overall population eligible for this study, the lower 
bound of the 95% CI of the treatment effect is approximately 12 percentage points for ppFE V1. 
The selected non -inferiority margin of 3 percentage points is consistent with this statistical 
method and the non -inferiority margin for ppFEV 1 used in clinical studies evaluating 
symptomatic CF treatments.23, 24 
The null hypothesis will be tested at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025.  
Assuming a within -group SD of 8 and 10% drop -out rate at Week 24 and a treatment difference 
of 0 between VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1176286] more than 90% power to test the primary hypothesis 
for the primary endpoint, based on a [ADDRESS_1176287] at a significance level of 0.025.  
Power for Analysis of Selected Key Secondary Efficacy Endpo int 
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in SwCl  from baseline through 
Week  24. Assuming a within -group SD of 14 mmol/L and a 10% dropout rate at Week 24, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1176288] more than 90% power to detect a 
difference between the treatment groups of -5 mmol/L for the absolute change in SwCl  from 
baseline through Week 24, based on a [ADDRESS_1176289] at a significance level of 0.05.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined : All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), Safety Set, 
and Per -protocol Set (PPS).  
The All Subjects Set  will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least [ADDRESS_1176290] dat a listings and disposition 
summary tables, unless otherwise specified.  
The FAS  will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR  allele mutation(s) 
and received at least [ADDRESS_1176291] 1 dose 
of study drug during the Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 55 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received, unless 
otherwise specified.   
The PPS will be a subset of FAS after excluding subjects with certain important protocol 
deviations and other situations; details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyse s for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the 
study.  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline unless otherwi se specified, will be defined as the most recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For SwCl, baseline will be defined as the average of the 
Day -[ADDRESS_1176292] -baseline value – baseline value.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period for the Run -in Period  will be from the first dose date 
of study drug in the Run -in Period to (1) the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period 
for subjects who complete the Run -in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or 
(2) [ADDRESS_1176293] dose  date of study drug in the Run -in Period or to the completion of 
study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.7 ), whichever occurs first, for  subjects who do 
not continue to the Treatment Period (e.g., subjects who do not meet the conditions to enter the 
Treatment Period).  
The TE Period for the Treatment Period  will include the time from the first dose date of study 
drug in the Treatment Perio d to [ADDRESS_1176294] disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant 
medications, exposu re, compliance, and important protocol deviations will be summarized. 
Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy analyses described in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise 
specified. Only the prin cipal features of the efficacy analysis will be presented in this section. 
Additional details will be included in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24  
(estimated by [CONTACT_577228] 16 and 24) . The primary analysis will be conducted with clinic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_577221] a mixed -effects model for repeated measures 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 56 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  (MMRM) with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4 , Week 8, Week 16, 
and Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, continuous 
baseline SwCl, and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 ye ars of age) as covariates. The model will 
be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F 
test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. An unstructured 
covariance structure will b e used to model the within -subject errors. If the model estimation does 
not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on 
the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; 
therefore, no imputation of missing data will be performed.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference through 
Week 24. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided. The primary null 
hypothesis will be re jected and non -inferiority demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI is 
≥-3.0. The estimated within group change from baseline and the treatment difference at each 
post-baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model.  
The primary null hy pothesis of non -inferiority described above will be tested based on  the FAS.  
If the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than 0, then superiority for the primary endpoint is 
demonstrated and the 2 -sided P value for superiority will be calculated.  
Sensitiv ity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP.  
Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses (as appropriate) will also be described in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Analysis of Key Secondary Variables  
• Absolute change from bas eline in SwCl through Week 24: The analysis of this variable will 
be based on an MMRM similar to the analysis of the primary endpoint above, with absolute 
change from baseline in SwCl at Day 15, Week 4, Week 16, and Week 24 as the dependent 
variable. The p rimary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment 
difference through Week 24. The LS mean estimate with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a [ADDRESS_1176295] -baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided.  
• Proportion of subjects with SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24 (pooled with data from 
Study VX20 -121-103): The response corresponding to SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24 
based on po oling data from FAS of this study and from Study VX20 -121-103 (which has a 
similar study design and will evaluate CF subjects with other genotypes) will be analyzed. 
Details of this analysis will be described in the SAP.  
• Proportion of subjects with SwCl <3 0 mmol/L through Week 24 (pooled with data from 
Study VX20 -121-103): The response corresponding to SwCl <30 mmol/L through Week 24 
based on data pooled from the FAS of this study and from Study VX20 -121-103 will be 
analyzed. Details of this analysis will b e specified in the SAP.  
Analysis of Other Secondary Variables  
The other secondary variables include: number of PEx through Week 52, absolute change from 
baseline in CFQ -R RD score through Week 24, absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 57 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  through Week  52, absolute change from baseline in SwCl through Week 52, proportion of 
subjects with SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24, and proportion of subjects with SwCl 
<30 mmol/L through Week 24. The analysis details for these variables will be described  in the 
SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity Adjustment  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error at an alpha of 
0.05. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1176296] be statistically signi ficant, and all 
previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must be statistically significant at the 0.05 level 
2-sided (1 -sided 0.025 level for the primary endpoint).  Additional details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Other Endpoints  
The analysi s details of other endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be based on the data from the TE period for the Treatment Period for all 
subjects in the corresponding Safety Set for the Treatment Period, unless otherwise  specified.  
The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability assessments:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and  urinalysis as 
applicable)  
• Standard 12 -lead ECGs  
• Vital signs  
• Pulse oximetry  
• Ophthalmological examinations  
Only descriptive analysis of safety will be performed and no statistical testing will be performed. 
The safety data during the Run -in Period will only  be presented in listings, unless otherwise 
specified. Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
LFT elevations, creatine kinase  elevations, rash, cataracts, hypoglycemia, and neuropsychiatric 
events will be designated as AEs of special interest.  
12.4 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be performed.  
12.5 Data Monitoring Committee Analysis  
The DMC (Section 9.1.9 ) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined in the DMC 
Charter.  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 58 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  12.6 Clinical Pharmacology Analysis  
12.6.1  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK analysis of VX -121, TEZ, and D -IVA may be performed using nonlinear mixed -effects 
modeling and/or standard noncompartmental analysis, as data allow. Metabol ites, including 
M1-TEZ, may be included in the analyses as supported by [CONTACT_33653]. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize PK parameter values for all analytes.  
A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the clinical pharmac ology 
analysis plan (CPAP).  
12.6.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
PD assessments to be included in PK/PD analyses may include SwCl, ppFEV 1, as well as other 
endpoints such as CFQ -R RD score.  
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analysis. The Bayesian 
estimates of individual PK parameters from the final population PK model will be used to 
simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX -121, TEZ, D -IVA, or metabolite 
plasma concentrations will be used in the potential  pharmacological response models to describe 
changes in each endpoint from baseline. Fixed - and random -effect parameter estimates and the 
associated asymptotic SEs will be estimated.  
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Advers e Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed  to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the a bsence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 59 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnorm al, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Gr ade [ADDRESS_1176297]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study 
participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7 . 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the case report 
form (CRF) and source document. AEs for subjects who are screene d but not subsequently 
enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution  (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Pro gram, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2021 ). When considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject,  the investigator will 
consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those 
in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE 
will be determined according to the definitio ns in Table  13-1.

money, etc.  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathin g, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_1176298] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mec hanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative et iology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_1176299] to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE bega n and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Sections 9.7 and 9.8 for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to followup)  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant  laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs durin g participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 62 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important m edical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency r oom or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731295], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g. , social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/even t outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting and Documenta tion of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_168800] 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the 
completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to 
Vertex GPS within 24  hours of identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent  and assent (where applicable) through  the 
completion of study participation , the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well 
as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to 
report follow -up inform ation as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: [EMAIL_3373]  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -[PHONE_11313]  
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact [CONTACT_756]: +1 -[PHONE_11314]  
SAEs that occur after the completion of study participation and are considered related to study 
drug(s)  will be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_577237](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study 
drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be 
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.0 Page 63 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is 
required to follow the event to reso lution and report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters

allow for the use of the information derived from the clinical study, the investigator has the 
obligation to provide Vertex with complete test re sults and all data developed in the study.  
13.7 Publications and Clinical Study Report  
13.7.1  Publication of Study Results  
Vertex is committed to reporting the design and results of all clinical studies in a complete, 
accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely manner, consistent with Good Publication Practices 
(GPP3).25  
Publication Planning : Vertex staff along with the lead PIs, the steering committee, and/or the 
publication committee will work together to develop a publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship of publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria26: 
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; and  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.  
Protocol VX20 -121-102, Version  3.[ADDRESS_1176310]  meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. All persons designated as authors should qualify 
for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Contributions such as medical writing, 
enrollment of subjects, acquisition of funding, collection of data, or gene ral supervision of the 
research group, alone, do not justify authorship.  
Contributors : Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship will not be listed as authors, but their 
contribution will be acknowledged and specified either as a group (e.g., “study investigators”) or 
individually (e.g., “served as scientific advisor”).  
Publication Review : As required by a separate clinical study agreement, Vertex must have the 
opportunity to review all publications, including any manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide 
presentations, and book chapters regarding this study before submission to congresses or journals 
for consideration.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  APPENDIX A: EXAMPLES  OF ELIGIBLE MF MUTA TIONS  
“MF” mutations are a subset of minimal function mutations that are non -responsive to TEZ, 
IVA, or TEZ/IVA. A mutation is considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the 
following 2  criteria:  
(1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic  sequence predicts the complete 
absence of CFTR protein), or  
(2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA  
Inclusion of MF Mutations Based on In Vitro Testing  
Mutations that were considered to be MF mutations based on in vit ro testing met the following 
criteria in in vitro experiments:  
• baseline chloride transport that was <10% of wildtype CFTR  
• an increase in chloride transport of <10% over baseline following the addition of TEZ, 
IVA, or TEZ/IVA in the assay  
Eligible MF Mutati ons 
The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by [CONTACT_13247] -cleared 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_252859] (e.g., sequencing); however, this list does not include every 
eligible mutation, and investigators should contact [CONTACT_274039] r regarding other

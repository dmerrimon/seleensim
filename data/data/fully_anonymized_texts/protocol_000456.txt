Title:
XEN-45 Gel Stent Versus Trabeculectomy in Glaucoma: Gold-standard Pathway Study (GPS)
Study Product:
XEN-45 Gel Stent (XEN)
Study Centers:
Approximately 25 to 40 sites in the [LOCATION_002]
Phase:
Postmarketing
Objective:
To compare the effectiveness and safety of XEN to trabeculectomy in subjects with glaucoma refractory 
to topi[INVESTIGATOR_148504] (IOP) not at target on 1 or more topi[INVESTIGATOR_146934].
Study Design:
Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, prospective, open-label
Number of Subjects: 
Eyes of approximately 285 subjects ([ADDRESS_170620]) will be randomized to have approximately 
256 study eyes complete the study.
Treatment:
XEN or Trabeculectomy
Study Duration:12 months per participating study eye
Study Methodology:
This study will include subjects with glaucoma poorly  controlled on topi[INVESTIGATOR_148505] a subconjunctival drainage procedure. Subjects will be screened for enrollment and eligible candidates 
will be approached to ascertain interest in study participation. Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, resulting in approximately 190 eyes being implan ted with XEN and approximately 95 eyes receiving
trabeculectomy. A randomized study design was chosen because it prevents selection bias in treatment 
assignments and produces comparable groups.

WHO World Health Organization
Allergan [ADDRESS_170625] common types of glaucoma are 
primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). 
Asia accounts for a disproportionate number of  PACG cases, whereas the prevalence of 
POAG is more evenly distri buted throughout the world ( Quigley 1996 ).
The goal in the treatment of glaucoma is to prevent further loss of functional vision 
during the remainder of a patient’s life and to avoid an a dverse impact on the patient’s 
quality of life ( AAO Glaucoma PPP Panel 2015 ).
There are many known risk factors for glau coma including age, ethnicity, and family 
history. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the onl y modifiable risk factor that is currently 
available to arrest visual field loss and re duction of IOP has been shown to reduce the 
risk of glaucomatous visual field loss in many landmark trials.
The prevention of glaucomatous loss of vision is mainly achieved by [CONTACT_148523] a threshold that is deemed to be  safe for the ganglion cells given the current 
amount of damage in the optic nerve head (ie, target IOP).There are many approaches to lower IOP including pharmacotherapy (topi[INVESTIGATOR_148507]), laser therapy, and surgery. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_148508], especially in early disease along with selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT).Most patients require multiple medications to lower IOP to target ( AAO Glaucoma PPP
Panel 2015 ).
Traditional incisional glaucoma surgery resu lts in robust IOP lowering; however, the 
accompanying side effects often preclude use earlier in the treatment paradigm. Trabeculectomy is the gold standard and cu rrently the most commonly used drainage 
procedure, but complications are a major problem. Early and late complications include bleb leak, excessive drainage, flat anterior chamber, filtration failure, clinical hypotony, symptomatic blebs, bleb encapsulation, f iltration failure, hyphema , choroidal effusion, 
suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and bleb infection ( Gedde et al. 2007 ). Complications 
associated with drainage surgeries can have  serious consequences and require careful 
management to prevent further problems. Th e bleb is currently the cornerstone of 
trabeculectomy drainage surgery, but the trabeculectomy bleb is also fragile and 
susceptible to scarring ( Azuara-Blanco and Katz 1998 ). Another subconjunctival 
surgical approach includes the Ex-PRESS
®miniature glaucoma implant (Alcon 
Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX), which is a biocompatible, nonvalved stainless steel 
tube. The Ex-PRESS is currently implanted using a procedure like standard trabeculectomy, and includes creation of a scle ra flap and a conjunc tival filtration bleb, 
but no peripheral iridectomy is requi red when implanting the Ex-PRESS ( Moisseiev et 
al. 2015).
Allergan [ADDRESS_170626] an important role in glaucoma 
management, offering the ability to achieve IOP lowering independent of patients’ 
compliance in appropriate candidates. Tube shunts are being increasingly used in the 
surgical management of glaucoma. The Ahmed glaucoma valve and the Baerveldt 
implant represent the most commonly used tube shunts. The Ahmed valve has a valve 
mechanism to prevent postoperative hypotony and shallow anterior chambers, whereasthe Baerveldt implants provide a greater su rface area in the end plate for aqueous 
reabsorption, providing better IOP control and a reduced need for glaucoma medication 
over the long term ( Gedde et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2016 ). All the above procedures,
performed using an ab-externo approach, achieve lowering of IOP via drainage of 
aqueous from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space ( Gedde et al. 2012).
However, each of these procedures is associated with a lengthy and variable recuperation and prolonged time to visual recovery. In some instances, there is associated loss of best corrected visual acui ty (BCVA) and significant risk of short- and 
long-term complications, including hypotony, choroidal effusion, cataract, and flat or 
shallow anterior chamber, as well as valve-re lated complications, such as tube blockage, 
erosion, and endothelial cell loss ( Gedde et al. 2012, Shaarawy et al. 2004, Rulli et al.
2013, Vijaya et al. 2011 ).
An alternative option to the more invasive traditional surgeries described above, in the 
form of microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) devices, are now available that have
an improved safety profile and recovery compared with trabeculectomy and tube shunts(Saheb and Ahmed 2012 ). There are several devices fitting the definition of MIGS
including XEN-45 Gel Stent (XEN); they can be categorized by [CONTACT_148524], ie, they may improve outflow by [CONTACT_148525] ( Caprioli et al. 2015 ). Unlike canal-based and 
supraciliary MIGS devices, XEN facilitates subconjunctival drainage like the gold-standard surgical option trabeculectomy to provide robust IOP lowering from a medicated baseline ( Vera et al. 2018, Mansouri et al. 2018, Hengerer et al. 2017 ).
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_148509]-angle glaucoma. Although the standard practice is  to prescribe a second IOP-lowering 
medication when the first drug has lowered a patient’s IOP, but not to an optimal level, the efficacy seen with monotherapy may not  translate into similar efficacy when a 
medication is used adjunctively. Additionally, the side effects of multiple medications need to be considered fo r patient quality of life ( Fechtner and Singh 2001 ). 
To quantify the IOP reduction after surgery in clinical trials versus topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering medications, a consistent definition of the ba seline, or reference IOP is necessary. For 
practical purposes, the highest challenge for a trial is the maximal tolerated medical therapy (MTMT) of IOP-lowering medications because that level would be considered the best that those drugs can achieve ( Shaarawy et al. 2004) . To determine the MTMT 
for glaucoma and the amount of medication an  eye can tolerate, patients may need to 
endure severe adverse effects before advancin g to surgery. In contrast, in clinical 
practice, the goal is optimal medical therapy, in which the practitioner uses the least amount of medicine to achieve the desired goal with the least adverse effects. In 
Allergan [ADDRESS_170627] medicati on is added, it is unlikely that additional 
agents will improve the outcome ( Fechtner and Singh 2001).
6.2 XEN Gel Stent
6.2.1 Device Description
A MIGS drainage device implanted via an ab-interno approach that facilitates drainage 
of aqueous from the anterior chamber to th e subconjunctival space (XEN-45; Allergan, 
Irvine, CA) has recently been approved in  the [LOCATION_002] for use in the surgical 
management of glaucoma. This device, whic h can be used as a standalone procedure, 
offers the potential to achieve IOP lowering that is comparable to trabeculectomy, butwith less tissue manipulation ( Schlenker et al. 2017, Reitsamer 2016 ).
The device, which is implanted using a handhe ld disposable injector, is constructed 
from porcine-derived gelatin that is formed into a tube and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, thus allowing it to expa nd and remain flexible when hydrated. The 
expansion of the tube’s outer diameter, when in contact [CONTACT_148526], also aids in retention 
of the gel stent in its inte nded location after surgical imp lantation, which helps minimize 
many of the issues associated with other materials, such as migration, erosion, andcorneal endothelial damage ( Aref and Varma 2012 ). The gel stent was designed using 
principles established by [CONTACT_148527]–Poiseu ille equation, whereby [CONTACT_148528] e length of the tube, and decreases to the 
fourth power of the diameter of the tube  lumen. In sum, a longer and thinner tube 
provides greater resistance than a shorter and wider tube ( Sheybani et al. 2015 ).
The XEN Gel Stent, XEN-45, or XEN Ge l Implant (XEN) is indicated for the 
management of refractory glaucomas, incl uding cases in which previous surgical 
treatment has failed, cases of POAG, and ca ses of pseudoexfolia tive or pi[INVESTIGATOR_148510].
6.2.[ADDRESS_170628] shown XEN is effective at reducing IO P with fewer complications as compared 
with those published for trabeculectomy studies ( Schlenker et al. 2017, Mansouri et al. 
2018, Hengerer et al. 2017, DeGregorio et al. 2018, Grover et al. 2017) .

CONFIDENTIAL8.2 Discussion of Study Design
8.2.1 Study Design
Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, resulting in approxima tely [ADDRESS_170631] in study participation. 
Subjects can be enrolled into one of the following groups:
Group 1: XEN implanted (XEN group)Group 2: Trabeculectomy (Trab group).All inclusion/exclusion criteria, effectiveness endpoints, success rate determinations,
and follow-up examinations will be identical for both groups.
At baseline, subjects with glaucoma not at target IOP when using at least [ADDRESS_170632] is determined to be eligible for participation in the study and is enrolled, the physician may stop the previously prescrib ed medications 1 to 4 weeks before surgery 
and begin preoperative medications (eg, ster oids, antibiotics, artificial tears, oral 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors [CAIs]) to prepare the ocular surface before surgery. The 
detection and treatment of co morbid conditions, particular ly diseases of the ocular 
surface disease (dry eye) and blepharitis, can help reduce eye inflammation ( Baudouin 
2012). Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_148513]-lowering medications and replacing them, if 
necessary, with oral acetazolamide prior to surgery may be considered along with use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_148514]-free lubricants to reduce ocular surface inflammation
and improve the likelihood of  successful implantation ( Vera et al. 2018 ). 
Subjects will undergo at least 1 preoperative visit (and more as needed), and then be 
scheduled for XEN gel stent implantation or trabeculectomy. Subjects will be examined 
postoperatively at the following timepoints: Day 1; Weeks 1 and 2; and Months 1,Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12.
8.2.2 Quality Management and Risk Evaluation
As noted in XEN’s Directions for Use the co mplications that may occur in conjunction 
with the use of XEN include, but are not limited to, the following: choroidal effusion, 
hyphema, hypotony, implant migration, imp lant exposure, wound leak, need for 
secondary surgical intervention and other known complications of intraocular surgery 
(eg, flat or shallow chamber, corneal edema, endophthalmitis).
Allergan 21 Mar 2019
CMO-US-EYE-0600 Version 2.0 Page 24 of 63
CONFIDENTIALThe risk profile for XEN has been establis hed based on the review of all applicable 
safety data. These complicati ons include adverse reaction to  implant material, infection, 
implant failure, device malfunction, hypotony, flat anterior chamber (central lens, 
corneal touch), endophthalmitis, and ocular inju ry (inadvertent perforation of the sclera, 
hyphema, inadvertent loss of vitreous, choroidal hemorrhage or effusion, bleeding, 
device wound dehiscence). Risks involved in the procedure include persistent 
inflammation, corneal complications, retinal  complications, chor oidal complications, 
visual acuity loss (loss of 2 Snellen lines or more), chronic pain, unplanned secondary 
surgical intervention, loss of eye, and infection.
XEN is currently contraindicated under the following circumstances or conditions: 
angle-closure glaucoma, previous glaucoma shunt/valve in the target quadrant, presence 
of conjunctival scarring, prio r conjunctival surgery or ot her conjunctival pathologies 
(eg, pterygium) in the target quadrant, active inflammation (eg, blepharitis, 
conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis), active iris neovascularization or neovascularization of the iris within 6 months of the surgical date, anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL),presence of intraocular silicone oil, vitr eous present in the anterior chamber. The 
exclusion criteria of this trial are in accord ance with the contrai ndications for the device 
(see Section 8.3.3).
The risks associated with the use of XEN are considered reasonable in comparison withthe anticipated benefits to subjects. XEN poses an acceptable level of risk for its 
intended use.
The risks associated with the gold-standard subconjunctival filtering procedure 
trabeculectomy have been well studied a nd include choroidal effusion, shallow/flat
anterior chamber, wound leak, hyphema, dyse sthesia, encapsulated bleb, and persistent 
corneal edema ( Gedde et al. 2007).

withdrawing from the study after receiving XEN or undergoing trabeculectomy will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who complete d the study. Subjects who discontinue before 
undergoing a study surgery will not be required to return for study follow-up visits.
Reasonable efforts will be made to contac t subjects who are lost to follow-up. These
efforts must be documente d in the subject’s file. 
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time, in case of SAEs, or if 
special circumstances concerning the study product or the company itself occur, making 
further treatment of subjects impossible. In  this event, the investigator(s) will be 
informed of the reason for study termination.
Allergan [ADDRESS_170637] and Procedures8.4.1.1 XEN
XEN is manufactured by [CONTACT_78562], Plc (Irela nd). XEN is composed of a gelatin derived 
from porcine dermis, formed into a tube, a nd cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. It is 
intended to be inserted in the angle and th rough the sclera, connecting the anterior 
chamber to the subconjunctival space. XEN is preloaded in the XEN Injector, a single-
use mechanical delivery system. XEN is pack aged with directions for use and the 
procedure to insert XEN should be carried out in  line with surgical training provided by 
[CONTACT_148529].
[IP_ADDRESS] Comparator – Trabeculectomy
Trabeculectomy will be performed in accordance with the standard of care at each 
investigative center with adjunctive antifibrotic therapy and including essential steps: conjunctival flap, scleral fl ap, and sclerostomy. Note: Peripheral iridectomy is not 
mandated and is left to the st andard practice of the surgeon.
8.4.2 Packaging and Labeling

Management) application. Th e randomization list will be generated by [CONTACT_456]’s 
independent Randomiza tion Services Group using a customized validated system 
composed of a series of SAS
®Macros (version 1.4). This list will be provided to the 
contract research organization’s (CRO’s ) independent randomization team, who will 
upload the list into the Medidata Rave RTSM application and validate it. Upon 
completion of a randomization electronic case repo rt form (eCRF), indicating that a
study eye meets all entry criteria, the data will be sent to the RTSM system for randomization. The RTSM system will then provide the surgery group assignment for 
the study eye and integrate it back into the randomization eCRF. The sponsor’s and 
CRO’s study team members, inves tigational site staff, and subjects will not have access 
to the randomization list.

general health perceptions and the global measures of interference with regular activity (Reilly et al. 1993 ).
Additionally, responses to the Postsurgi cal Question will be collected to better 
understand differences, if any, in postoperative recovery between the 2 procedures.
These measures can be found in Appendix 17 .
10.1.2 Safety Analysis
Safety analysis will be performed in  both the XEN population and the population 
randomized to trabeculectomy. The numbers and percentage of subjects reporting AEs 
will be tabulated regardless of causality. AEs, ADEs, and all safety measures will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_148536].
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Throughout the course of the study, all AE s will be monitored and reported on an AE 
eCRF, including seriousness, severity, action taken, and relationship to study treatment. 
If AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety of the study participants. Needling and 
laser suture lysis will be captured as procedures but will not be considered AEs.
All AEs and device deficiencies that occur be tween visits are to be recorded on the date 
of the next postoperative exa mination on the subject’s eCRF.

Adverse Event
An AE is defined in accordance with ISO [ADDRESS_170652] c linical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users or other persons , if related to the investigational medical 
device. This definition includes events relate d to the investigational medical device or 
comparator and events related to the pro cedures involved. Disease signs and symptoms 
that existed prior to the study treatment are not considered AEs unless the condition recurs after the participant has recovered from the pre-existing condition or the condition worsens in intensity or frequency during the study.

Adverse Device Effect (ADE)
An ADE is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “an adverse event related to the 
use of an investigational medical device.” This definition includes any AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instruc tions for use, deployment, implantation, 
installation, or operati on, or any malfunction of the inve stigational medical device as 
well as any event resulting from use error (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) or from intentional misuse of 
the investigational medical device.

Assessment of Severity
Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE. The severity assessment 
for a clinical AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]:
Allergan 21 Mar 2019
CMO-US-EYE-0600 Version 2.0 Page 38 of 63
CONFIDENTIALMild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort,
may require only minimal treatment and does not interfere with everyday 
activities.
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed, but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm. 
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality
Relationship to a device refers  to a determination of the relationship (if any) between an 
AE and the device. A causal relationship is pr esent if the investigator determines that 
there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_8121].
An AE could be considered procedure-related when, in the judgment of the investigator, 
it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the procedure, regardless of 
the relationship to the study device. Procedur e-related causes that contribute to the 
occurrence of the event can be attributed to other products, surgical techniques, or 
medications required specif ically for the procedure.
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the device and/or study procedure. Caus ality should be assesse d using the categories 
presented in the following table:
Not related: Clinical event of which the relationship to the device and/or 
procedure can be excluded, such as if the event is incompatible time 
relationship to study procedure and/or use of the device, involves a 
body part or organ not expected to  be affected by [CONTACT_148540], could be explained by [CONTACT_148541], and is not due to use error. 
Unlikely: Clinical event whose time relationship to use of the device and/or
study procedure makes a causal conn ection improbable, but that could 
plausibly be explained by [CONTACT_148542].
Possible: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to the use of the 
device and/or study procedure, but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_148543] s or chemicals. Cases in which
relatedness cannot be a ssessed or no information has been obtained 
should also be classified as possible. 
Allergan 21 Mar 2019
CMO-US-EYE-0600 Version 2.0 Page 39 of 63
CONFIDENTIALProbable: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to the use of the 
device and/or study procedure, and is  unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.
Causal 
relationship:Clinical event with plausible time relationship to the use of the device and/or study procedure, is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures; follows a known response pattern to the medical  device; involves a body-site or 
organ that the device or procedures are applied to and/or influence;harm is due to error in use, and that cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].
Follow-up of Adverse Events
All investigators should follow up subjects with  AEs until the event is resolved or until, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event is stabilized or determined to be chronic. 
Details of AE resolution must  be documented in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Serious Ad verse Events
Serious Adverse Event Definition
An AE is considered an SAE if it:
a) led to death,b) led to serious deterioration in the hea lth of the subject, that either resulted in
1) a life-threatening illness or injury, or2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or3) in-patient or prol onged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function,
c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious  deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)
An SADE is an adverse device effect that  has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of an SAE.
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All device- or surgery-related SAEs must be entered into the EDC system within
24 hours of being notified of the event. The sponsor will be notified by [CONTACT_148544].
Allergan 21 Mar 2019
CMO-US-EYE-0600 Version 2.0 Page 40 of 63
CONFIDENTIALThe relationship of the clinical event to t he devices and procedure should be reported
on the Serious Adverse Event Form for Devices and will be determined by [CONTACT_31035].
Following evaluation of each SAE, the responsible IEC/IRB will be notified as 
appropriate based on na tional regulations.
All SAEs that occur from the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed through to their final study visit must be reported to  the sponsor. In addition to entering the 
information into the EDC system, the investigator must:
xNotify the sponsor immediately (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_148545]. The fo rm should be sent directly to the 
sponsor at [EMAIL_3038] or fax to +[PHONE_3310] or 
+[PHONE_3311]. The SAE report should be completed regardless of the 
amount of information available although th e investigator is expected to provide 
as much information as possible.
xObtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent me dical records, information, 
and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and
follow-up of the subject.
xProvide the sponsor with a complete , written case history (AE report form) 
which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not related to the 
use of the investigational device or procedure.
The sponsor (or its representative) will report all SAEs associated with the use of the 
study device to the regulatory agencies (IEC/IRB, Competent Authorities) as 
appropriate according to rele vant SOPs and to the nationa l laws of the country where 
the trial is performed.
For every SAE, appropriate measures should b e taken to treat/resolve and monitor the
subject. The investigator should keep Alle rgan closely informed of the progress as
related to the SAE. Any subjects who are wit hdrawn from the study due to an AE shall
still be followed up until the outcome is resolved.

CONFIDENTIAL11 STATISTICAL METHODS
Prior to database lock a statistical analysis plan (SAP) defining all details of analysis 
will be prepared and finalized.
11.1.[ADDRESS_170657] has signed the 
ICF. The Enrolled population will be used to summarize disposition data.
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population consists of all enrolled eyes randomized to study 
glaucoma surgery (XEN or trabeculectomy) . The ITT population will be the primary 
analysis population for effectiveness data. Subject demographics, baseline 
characteristics, and PRO data will be an alyzed using the ITT population. Subjects will 
be grouped and analyzed according to the actual surgery received.
The Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) populati on consists of eyes in the ITT population 
that receive study glaucoma surgery and ha ve no major protocol deviations, which will 
be defined in the SAP and identified prior to database lock. The  mITT population will 
be used for selected effectiveness endpoints (a s specified in the SA P), and will be used 
for the analyses of PRO data also.
The Safety population consists of all en rolled eyes that undergo study glaucoma 
surgery, whether surgery is completed or  aborted, and have follow-up visits or 
evaluations. The Safety population will be used to analyze AEs, medical and ophthalmic 
history, and concomitant me dications (ocular and systemic). Subjects will be grouped 
and analyzed according to the surgery they received.
11.1.[ADDRESS_170658] characteristics will be summarized. Descriptive 
statistics (such as mean, SD, minimum, medi an, and maximum) will be presented for 
each continuous variable. Categorical vari ables will be displayed using frequency 
counts and percentages.
11.1.3 Effectiveness Variables and Statistical Analyses 
Definition of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint
The primary endpoint for the study will be the percentage of subjects achievin J
mean IOP reduction from baseline at Month 12 on the same or fewer number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_148518]-lowering medications, without clinical hy potony, loss of vision to count fingers, or 
secondary glaucoma surgical intervention.
Allergan 21 Mar 2019
CMO-US-EYE-0600 Version 2.0 Page 42 of 63
CONFIDENTIALDefinition of Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints
Effectiveness will be determined by [CONTACT_148546] 12, and the number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering medications at 
screening with number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowe ring medications at Month 12. Individual 
secondary effectiveness endpoints are defined in Section 7.2 .
Definition of Performance Endpoints (Device Studies)
The IOP change at all visit windows will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477], SD, median, 
maximum, and minimum. The percentage chan ge in IOP from baseline to Month 12
will also be summarized descriptively. When necessary, appropriate parametric or 
nonparametric analyses will be used to dete rmine statistically significant differences.
Methods of Statistical Analysis
The number and proportion of subjects DFKLHYLQJPHDQ,23UHGXFWLRQIURP
baseline at Month 12 on the same or fe wer number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering 
medications, without clinical hypotony, loss of vision to count fingers, or secondary 
glaucoma surgical intervention will be tabulated with 95% CI calculated by [CONTACT_148547]. The difference of  the proportions will be estimated and 
the 95% CI of the difference will also be calculated with the method of the normal 
approximation. The 2 treatment groups will be claimed as equi valent if the 95% CI of 
the differences is within the -18% to 18% interval. The least squares mean change from 
baseline in IOP and the least squares mean difference between the 2 treatment groups
will be estimated using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model or the mixed-
effect model repeat measurement (MMR M) model. The proportion and 95% CI of 
complete success and qualified success will be calculated with normal approximation.
11.1.4 Safety Variables
All reported treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related TEAEs, SAEs, and all 
safety measures collected will be tabulated by [CONTACT_33335]. Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_148548]. Any other information collected (such as AE severity) will be tabulated and listed as appropriate. Pregnancy of female subjec ts should also be tabulated. Analyses of AEs 
and other safety variables will be described in the SAP.
11.1.[ADDRESS_170659] reported significantly high 
treatment success rates. Grove r et al. reported 75.4% of the treated patients having 
achieved success, as defined by a >20% re duction from baseline in IOP at Month 12 on 
the same or fewer medications ( Grover et al. 2017 ). Mansouri et al. reported 81% 
success rate at Month 12, and Tan et al. ( 2018) reported success rates of 87% and 92% 
at Month 12 depending on if pa tients were using medications ( Mansouri et al. 2018, Tan 
et al. 2018 ). However, it should be noted that th e 3 studies are based on relatively small 
sample sizes in the XEN alone arm, rangin g from 21 to 61 evaluable study eyes, and a 
more conservative estimate of the succe ss rate is about 70%. A previous study 
supported that the XEN procedure and the stan dard of care therapy trabeculectomy are 
comparable in terms of treatment success ( Schlenker et al. 2017). Moreover, it is 
assumed that neither treatment is better or worse than the other by [CONTACT_726] 20% in 
terms of treatment success rate. This trial is intended to demonstrate that XEN is comparable to trabeculectomy in terms of treatment success rate. The sample size calculation is based on an equivalence test.
To control Type-I error rate at 5% and to attain 80% power for demonstrating that the 
difference is within the equivalence limit of  18%, about 256 study eyes will be needed 
for the study with a randomization ratio of 2:1 for the XEN arm: trabeculectomy arm.Allowing a 10% dropout rate for the first year, approximately 285 study eyes (190 for 
the XEN arm and 95 for the trabeculectomy arm) will need to be recruited for the study.

XEN implantation procedure to be 
“unplanned secondary surgical 
intervention ” (Section 8.2.2)Corrected an error in the protocol 
(previously was “unplanned 
surgical re-invention ”)
Increased the number of study sites to 
“approximately 25 to 40 sites”
(Section 8.3.1 and Synopsis )Increase enrollment rate into the 
study to complete enrollment in a 
timely manner
Inclusion criterion 4. “Best-corrected 
baseline Snellen visual acuity of 20/ 100
or better” (Section 8.3.2 and Synopsis )Allows inclusion of study eyes with 
poorer vision in order to improve 
enrollment rate based on investigator feedback
Inclusion criterion 5. “Visual field mean 
deviation no worse than - 18.0 dB (with 
no dense paracentral scotomas, eg, 
>18dB total deviation on 1 or more of 
the 4 paracentral points)” (Section 8.3.2
and SynopsisAllows inclusion of study eyes with 
slightly more advanced visual field 
damage in order to improve enrollment rate based on investigator feedback
Inclusion criterion 6. “Medicated IOP 15PP+JDQGPP+J on at least 
1topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering medication”

improve enrollment rate based on 
investigator feedback. Clarifies thatmore than 1 IOP-lowering medication will be allowed.
Inclusion criterion 7. “Subjects not 
anticipated to require any other ocular 
surgery (eg, cataract surgery) in either eye up to 3 months from the time of 
inclusion” (Section 8.3.2 and Synopsis)Allows inclusion of study eyes that 
may require ocular surgery during 
the 12-month study, provided the surgery occurs at least 3 months after enrollment
Inclusion criterion 9. “Visible trabecular PHVKZRUNZLWK6KDIIHUDQJOHJUDGHLQthe target area or, in eyes with prior 
failed angle surgery, an open angle in 
the target area ” (Section 8.3.2
and Synopsis )Clarification that the angle is open 
in eyes that have had angle surgery,such as GATT
Inclusion criterion 10. “Preoperative laser 
trabeculoplasty is allowed 3 or more 
months prior to randomization”
(Section 8.3.2 and Synopsis )Corrects an error in the allowed 
period for laser trabeculoplasty

Inclusion criterion 11. “Failed ab-interno 
canal or suprachoroidal microinvasive 
glaucoma surgery ( MIGS )procedures 
(such as iStent®,gonioscopy-assisted 
transluminal trabeculotomy [ GATT ],
ab-interno canaloplasty [ ABiC ™],
Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy, etc) are 
allowed 3 or more months before 
enrollment , with the exception of 
CyPass® Micro-Stent s, which are not 
allowed. Ab-interno ablative 
procedures (such as endoscopic cyclophotocoagulatio n [ECP]) are also 
allowed 3 or more months before 
enrollment. ” (Section 8.3.2
and Synopsis )Excludes CyPass Micro-Stents, 
which have been withdrawn from 
the market
Distinguishes ab-interno ablative 
procedures, such as ECP which is 
allowed, from transscleral 
cycloablative procedures that are 
excluded per exclusion criterion 2
Exclusion criterion 16. “Participation in 
another drug or device clinical trial that
conclud eswithin 30 days before the 
Preoperative Visit or that starts at any 
time during this study ” (Section 8.3.3
and Synopsis )Prohibits concurrent participation in another drug or device clinical trial
Added “Subjects may withdraw their 
consent to continue in the study at any 
time.” (Section 8.3.4 )Clarifies that subjects will be free 
to withdraw consent at any time
Added “Subjects who discontinue before undergoing a study surgery will not be 
required to return for study follow-up visits” (Section 8.3.4 ) and updated 
Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_170680] name (XEN-45
Gel Stent) (Section 8.4.2 )Clarified XEN implant lumen size

process (Section 8.4.4 )Adds information that was missing from the protocol
Clarified that IOP will not be measured at 
Visit 2 (Section [IP_ADDRESS] )Corrected the text to match Table 8.1
Added that the PRO questionnaires will be administered using an electronic tablet, 
from which data will be imported into the eCRF (Section [IP_ADDRESS] )Clarifies that PRO data will be 
entered externally in an electronic 
tablet and then imported into the eCRF electronically (ie, data will not be entered manually into the 
PRO eCRFs)
Added “ These and any other AEs that 
occur should be reported in the AE 
eCRF .” to Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 )Clarifies that all AEs, in addition to 
the listed possible intraoperative 
and postoperative AEs are to be 
reported in the AE eCRF

CONFIDENTIALVersion Date Description of Change (location) Rationale
Revised the worsening cataract AE to 
“Clinically significant progression of 
cataract , based on an assessment by [CONTACT_1275] ” (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 )Removed mention of Lens Opacities Classification System scoring because it will not be used in this study
Added Enrolled and mITT populations as analysis populations; updated definitions 
of ITT and Safety populations 
(Section 11.1.1 )Adds an Enrolled population to 
fully describe disposition of study eyes. Adds an analysis population 
(mITT) that excludes study eyes 
that do not undergo glaucoma surgery or have predefined major protocol deviations. Adds detail on which populations are used for study analyses.
Removed statement that all available IOP 
data will be used for calculations of 
changes from baseline, and added some 
statistical methodology (Section 11.1.3,
latter in Synopsis , too)Selection of IOP values for change 
from baseline calculations will be described in the SAP, as it will be 
based on timing of IOP 
measurements relative to the visits. 
Briefly describes statistical testing that was missing.
Clarified that treatment-emergent AEs 
will be summarized and added details on 
some types of tabulations that are planned (Section 11.1.4 and Synopsis )Clarifies that any AEs that occur before study surgery will not be included in AE summary tables. Cross-references the SAP for more 
details on safety analyses.
Revised “IOP, change in IOP from 
baseline, percentage change in IOP from 
baseline, number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-
lowering medications used, and change 
in number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering
medications used will be summarized 
descriptively at each scheduled visit.”(Section 11.1.6 )Clarified that the analysis will be of number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering 
medications
Deleted from the reference list those 
references not cited in the text (Section 16)Corrected an error in the protocol
Increased row height in SHPC-18
questionnaire (Appendix 17.1 )Makes “Both eyes” checkboxes visible in all rows
Added protocol revision history (Appendix 17.4)Adds a section to describe changes made in the protocol since the 
original version was approved
Added expansion of abbreviations and acronyms on first use in the synopsis and main text; used abbreviation/acronym 
thereafterStandardizes use of abbreviations 
and acronyms

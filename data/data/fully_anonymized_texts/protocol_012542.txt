Official Title:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: Hand & foot Neuromodulation for 
nocturnal enuresis in children  
  
 
 
ClinicalTrials.gov ID (NCT number):  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
 
 
Protocol Date:  June 08, [ADDRESS_583728] with a r andomized comparison study using the TENS device 
on the hand and foot as a control. The goal of this study is to prove that hand stimulation with the TENS 
device will not decrease nocturnal enuresis in children and will serve as a placebo 2) to prove that 
stimulation to the foot with the TENS device does decreasing the nocturnal enuresis in children.

Study Design  & Methods  
 This is an experimental, randomized study. Both the subject and the investigator will be 
informed about the foot and hand stimulation. The results obtained w ill be compared between the two 
groups. The study is expected to end when the six weeks have been completed with associated 
completion of weekly night -time voiding log and quality of life questionnaires. However, if the subject 
cannot follow the study proc edures such as an inability to tolerate foot or hand stimulation or non -
compliance with completing night -time voiding logs and/or quality of life questionnaires, the subject's 
participation will be discontinued and the study will be ended. We expect some e lectrodes to detach 
from the foot or hand. However, occasional unattached electrodes will not end the study, since the data 
will be collected in a week period and a few occurrences of detachment should not change the results. 
Also, if skin irritation is ca used by [CONTACT_456833], the study will continue by [CONTACT_456834] a day or two to recover. However, if unexpected serious irritation 
occurs that cannot be avoided by [CONTACT_456835], the study will  be terminated for that subject

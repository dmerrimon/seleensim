the proposed activity?  
HSD recognizes that everyone would like their IRB applications to be reviewed as quickly as possible. To ensure fairness, it is 
HSD policy to review applications in the order in which they are received. However, HSD will assign a higher priority to 
researc h with externally -imposed urgency that is beyond the control of the researcher. Researchers are encouraged to 
communicate as soon as possible with their HSD staff contact [CONTACT_52883] (in other words, before 
submitting the IRB application). Examples: a researcher plans to test an experimental vaccine that has just been developed for a newly emerging epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]; a researcher has an unexpected opportunity to collect data from students when the end of the 
school year is only four week s away.  
 
HSD may ask for documentation of the externally -imposed urgency. A higher priority should not be requested to compensat e 
for a researcher’s failure to prepare an IRB application in a timely manner. Note that IRB review requires a certain minimum 
amount of time; without sufficient time, the IRB may not be able to review and approve an application by a deadline. 
 
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, briefly describe the urgency or deadline as well as the reason for it.

clinical patient care, “off- label” clinical patient care, and/or research (collecting safety and/or effectiveness data).  
 This study is part of  preliminary and  pi[INVESTIGATOR_217251]  a technology -enhanced  eLearning  training in suicide 
safety planning that targets skill-building in general counseling skills to accompany a standard web- based didactic 
with skill demonstration in suicide safety planning. The training is designed to support acute medical care nurses 
to engage patients at -risk of suicide in collaborative and empathic suicide safety planning. Skill-building 
technologies include a chat bot called “Client Bot  Emily ” and an automated computer-based coding and computer-
generated feedback report through a platform called Lyssn. This study is a formative evaluation of the technology -
enhanced or eLearning approach. It includes assessment of training acceptability and engagement with the training 
components and technologies and the conduct of an end-of-evaluation focus groups with study nurses. Findings 
will be used to inform iterations to improve the acceptability of the training as well as to inform the 
implementation of the training and implementation of suicide safety planning with patients in a larger trial.  
1.6 Study design. Provide a one -sentence description of the general study design and/or type of methodology.   
Your answer will help HSD in assigning applications to reviewers and in managing workload. Examples: a longitudinal 
observational study; a double- blind, placebo -controlled randomized study; ethnographic interviews; web scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_52857] a 
convenience sample of blogs; medical record review; coordinating center for a multi -site study.

 1.8 Background, experience, and preliminary work. Answer this question only  if the proposed activity has one or 
more of the following characteristics. The purpose of this question is to provide the IRB with information that is 
relevant to its risk/benefit analysis.  
• Involves more than minimal risk (physical or non -physical)  
• Is a clinical trial, or 
• Involves having the subjects use a drug, biological, botanical, nutritional supplement, or medical device.  
“Minimal risk” means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater 
than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations o r 
tests.  
 a. Background . Provide the rationale and the scientific or scholarly background for the  proposed activity, based 
on existing literature (or clinical knowledge). Describe the gaps in current knowledge that the  proje ct is 
intended to address.  
 This should be a plain language description. Do not provide scholarly citations. Limit your answer to less than one page, or 
refer to an attached document with background information that is no more than three pages long.  
 Suicide prevention training is required for nurses in Washington State and nurses currently screen for suicide 
risk on acute care units at Harborview Medical Center. The Joint Commission, which oversees services at 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], recommends also having patients receiv e a brief intervention known as suicide safety planning to 
help support their ability to cope with suicidality after discharge. Current trainings in suicide prevention rely 
primarily on didactics without opportunities to practice skills, and nurses are not yet routinely trained in skills 
for suicide safety planning. This project is designed to develop training methods in suicide safety planning that 
can be further studied in a large trial. Additionally, procedures for a larger trial will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_217252].  The training 
methods incorporate technologies that can efficiently  and feasibly help nurses build skills needed in suicide 
safety planning. Future studies would test the effectiveness of the training on patient outcomes.  
 b. Experience and p reliminary work. Briefly describe e xperience or preliminary work or data (if any) that you , 
your team , or your collaborators/co -investigators  have that supports the feasibility and/or safety of this study.   
 It is not necessary to summarize all discussion that has led to the development of the study protocol. The IRB is interested 
only in short summaries about experiences or preliminary work that suggest the study is feasible and that risks are 
reasonable relative to the benefits. Examples: Your team has already conducted a Phase 1 study of an experimental drug 
which supports the Phase 2 study being proposed in this application; you r team has  already done a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_217253] -school program with 
classroom aides; your team has  experience with the type of surgery that is required to implant the study device; the  study 
coordinator is experienced in working with subjects who have significant cognitive impairment.  
  We have conducted focus groups to explore nurses’ interest in and opi[INVESTIGATOR_217254] a s well as using eLearning and computer technology for this purpose. We have 
conducted usability testing for the technologies involved. We have also been working with Harborview’s 
Nursing Clinical Inquiry Council, a committee that oversees nursing research,  education, and quality 
improvement initiatives. These activities indicate it will be feasible and appropriate to engage nurses in acute 
care in this formative evaluation.

 i. Describe the type of prisoners, and their location(s) : 
       
 ii. One concern about prisoner research is whether the effect of participation on prisoners’ 
general living conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities, and /or opportunity for 
earnings in pr ison will be so great that it will make it difficult for prisoners to adequately 
consider the research risks. How will the chances of this be reduced?

 N/A 
2.6 Native Americans or non-U.S. indigenous populations.  Will Native American or non- U.S. indigenous populations 
be actively recruited through a tribe, tribe -focused organization, or similar community -based organization?  
Indigenous people are defined in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their historical 
ties to a particular territory and their cultural or historical distinctiveness from other populations that are often politically 
dominant.

 X No  
  Yes  If yes,  name [CONTACT_52935], tribal -focused organization, or similar community -based  organization. T he 
UW IRB expects that tribal/indigenous approval will be obtained before beginning the research . 
This may or may not involve approval from a tribal IRB. The study team and any 
collaborators/investigators are also responsible for identifying any tribal laws that may affect the 
research.

study  subjects? Common examples include: collecting medical history information or contact [CONTACT_52885], friends, co -workers.  
“Identifiable” means any direct or indirect identifier that, alone or in combination, would allow you or another m ember of the 
research team to readily identify  the person. For example, suppose that the research is about immigration history. If subjects 
are asked questions about their grandparents but are not asked for  names or other information that would allow easy 
identification  of the grandparents, then private identifiable information is not being collected about the grandparents  and the 
grandparents are not subjects .

04/29/2021  APPLICATION IRB Protocol  6/21/[ADDRESS_260831] or describe the maximum number of subjects (or subject units) 
needed  to complete the  study, for each subject group?  
Subject units  mean units within a group. For most research studies, a group will consist of individuals. However, the unit of 
interest in some research is not the individual. Examples:   
• Dyads such as caregiver -and- Alzheimer’s patient, or parent and child  
• Families  
• Other units, such as student -parent -teacher  
Subject group means categories of subjects that are meaningful for  the specific study. Some research has only one subject 
group – for example, all UW students taking Introductory Psychology. Some common ways in which subjects are grouped 
include:  
• By [CONTACT_52886] – for example, an intervention group and a control group.  
• By [CONTACT_52887] – for example, urban versus rural families  
• By [CONTACT_654] – for example, children who are 6, 10, or 14 years old.  
 
The IRB  reviews the number of subjects in the context of risks and benefits. Unless otherwise specified, if the IRB determines 
that the  research involves no more than minimal risk: there are no restrictions on the total number of subjects  that may be 
enrolled. If  the research involves more than minimal risk: The number of enrolled subjects must be limited to the number 
described in this  application. If it is necessary later to increase the number of subjects, submit  a Modification . Exceeding the 
IRB-approved number ( over- enrollment ) will be considered non- compliance.   
  No  If no, provide the rationale in the box below. Also, provide any other available information about 
the scope/size of the research. You do not need to complete the table.    
  Example: It may not be possible to predict the number of subjects who will complete an online survey 
advertised through Craigslist, but you can state that the survey will be posted for two weeks and the number 
who respond is the number who will be in the  study.  
       
 X Yes  If yes, for each subject group, use the table below to provide the  estimate of the maximum desired 
number of individuals (or other subject unit, such as families) who will complete the research.

3.1 Reason for locations . Describe the reason(s) for choosing the location s.  
This is especially important when the research will occur in locations or with populations that may be vulnerable to 
exploitation. One of the three ethical principles the IRB must consider is justice: ensuring that reasonable, non- exploitative, 
and well -considered procedures are administered fairly, with a fair distribution of costs and potential benefits.

research , how it is conducted, or how consent is obtained or documented . 
Examples: It would be culturally inappropriate in some international settings for a woman to be directly contact[CONTACT_426] a male 
researcher; instead, the researcher may need to ask a male family member for permission before the woman can be approached. It may be appropriate to obtain permission from community leaders prior to obtaining consent from individual 
members of a group.  In some distinct cultural groups, signing forms may not be the norm.

• Age of consent  – laws about when an individual is considered old enough to be able to provide consent vary 
across states, and across countries.   
• Legally authorized representative – laws about who can serve as a legally authorized representative (and who 
has priority when more than one person is available) vary across states and countries.  
• Use of healthcare records  – many states (including Washington State) have laws that are similar to the

4 RECRUITING and SCREENING PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Recruiting and Screening . Describe how subjects will be identified, recruited, and screened.  Include information 
about: how, when, where, and in what setting. Identify who (by [CONTACT_52891], not name) will approach and recruit subjects, and who wil l screen them for eligibility.  
 
Note: Per UW  Medicine policy, the UW Medicine eCare/MyChart  system may not be used for research recruitment 
purposes.  
 
 Participants will be identified and recruited in several ways:  
1) Nurse managers/administrative staff will be invited to announce the study at staff meetings and post a flyer in 
work areas for nurses with information about the study and who to contact [CONTACT_217301] / sign 
up. The PI/research staff may also announce the study at staff meetings.  
2) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217255]/administrative staff  
3) An advertisement about the study may be included in an internal newsletter received by [CONTACT_39137] 
4) Flyers advertising the study may be posted in nurse working areas and common area s near or on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217256] (e.g., local coffee shop).

PI/research staff  will contact [CONTACT_217302] s to provide more information about the study.  
4.2 Recruitment materials .  
 
a. What materials (if any ) will be used  to recruit and screen subjects?  
Examples: talking points for phone or in- person conversations; video or audio presentations; websites; social media 
messages; written materials such as letters, flyers for posting, brochures, or printed advertisements; questionnaires filled 
out by [CONTACT_52893].  
 The recruitment materials will include talking points for staff meetings, emails, and flyers. Descriptions are 
uploaded in Zipline (see Attachment: Recruitment Materials).  
b. Upload descriptions of each type of material (or the materials themselves) to Zipline . If letters  or emails  will be 
sent to any subjects, the se should include a statement about how the subject’s name  [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_52894] . No sensitive information about the person (such as a diagnosis of a medical condition) should 
be included in the letter.  The text of these letters and emails must be uploaded to Zipli ne (i.e., a description will 
not suffice).  
HSD encourages researchers to consider uploading descriptions of most recruitment and screening materials instead of the materials themselves. The goal is to provide the researchers with the flexibility to change some information on the materials without submitting a Modification for IRB approval of the changes. Examples:  
• Provide a list of talking points that will be used for phone or in- person conversations instead of a script.   
• For the description of a flyer, include the information that it will provide the study phone number and the name [CONTACT_4007] a study contact [CONTACT_9702] (without providing the actual phone number or name). This means that a Modification would not be necessary if/when the study phone number or contact [CONTACT_52895]. Also, instead of listing the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the description below might  state that the flyer will list one or a few of the major 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• For the description of a video or a website, include a description of the possible visual elements and a list of the 
content (e.g., study phone number; study contact [CONTACT_9702]; top three inclusion/exclusion criteria; payment of $50; study name; UW researcher ).

• Purpose of the payment [e.g., reimbursement, compensation, incentive]  
• Whether payment will be “pro -rated” so that participants who are unable to complete the research may still 
receive some part of the payment  
The IRB expect s the consent process or study information provided to the subjects to include all of the above- listed information 
about payment, including the number and amount of payments, and especially when subjects can expect to receive payment. 
One of the most frequent complaints received by [CONTACT_217303] a check on the day that  
they completed a study and who were angry or disappointed when payment took [ADDRESS_260840] outside of work 
hours; therefore nurses are provided remuneration in exchange for their time, effort, and to offset any potential 
costs to them for participating (e.g., child care). The total amount of remuneration, $450, is detailed in the

  Nurses will be recruited to participate in a formative evaluation of an e Learning training in suicide prevention that 
includes participating in virtual training activities, completing surveys, completing training outcome assessments 
of skills using standardized patient role- plays , and participating in end-of-evaluation focus groups. 
 All study activities are detailed in Attachment: Nurse  Study Activities & Remuneration . 
 
There are 3 -4 hours of training activities and 3 hours of research activities.  
 Training activities include 1 hour of didactics that includes reading material  and watching video material, 
including skills demonstrating of suicide safety planning. Then, nurses practice skills of asking a virtual suicidal patient open- ended questions and making reflective statements using a chat bot (i.e., Client Bot Emily). The chat 
bot also provides feedback on skills practice. The third type of training activity is to practice suicide safety 
planning with a patient actor and receive feedback on general counseling skills  used during the role-play through 
a computer program and feedback platform (i.e., Lyssn). 
 
The training and technologies are further depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230]/described in the Attachment: eLearning Approach. 
 
Research activities include completing surveys about knowledge, skills, motivation, and confidence in engaging 
patients around suicidality in general and safety planning in particular. Surveys will also include acceptability of 
and interest in using the technology for training. Standardized patient role- plays are also used to evaluate skills 
learned through the training process. End -of-evaluation focus groups of about 5 nurses each will provide insight 
into implementation barriers and facilitators of completing the training and of potentially doing safety planning 
with patients.

 Measures & Variables  
Nurse training and technology acceptability will be assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS),  open-
ended questions, and a modified version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- 8 (CSQ- 8) to assess nurse 
satisfaction with the training.  
Nurses will complete demographic questions (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age) and asked about their length of 
current employment, training background, and experience with suicide prevention and other behavioral 
interventions. Nurse training targets will include use of the technology and nurse motivation for training and delivery of 
safety planning . Self -report sur veys at post -training and the [ADDRESS_260842] collaborative safety planning with patients (i.e., transfer of training) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_217305] (TDF; e.g., beliefs about capabilities and consequences, behavioral intentions, negative emotions).  
Nurse training outcomes of general counseling skill quality and quality of safety planning will be assessed 
using standardized patient assessments.  Nurses will complete four 30- minute role -plays over the course of 
the evaluation. These will be conducted by r esearch staff/patient actors via Zoom, recorded, and assessed for 
general counseling skill quality using the Lyssn system. Pre - and post-training and follow-up role- plays will be 
assessed for fidelity to the safety planning intervention by [CONTACT_978]. Self- reported perception of skills will be 
assessed via survey at baseline, post -training and 6-months post-training using methods modified from training 
clinicians in evidence- based psychotherapy.  Nurses will also complete knowledge quizzes  of what is safety 
planning and how to do it.

5.6 Identifiability of data and specimens . Answer these questions carefully and completely. This will  allow HSD to 
accurately determine the type of review that is required and the  relevant compliance requirements.  Review the 
following definitions before answering the questions:  
Access means to view or perceive data, but not to possess or record it. See, in contrast, the definition of “obtain”.  
Identifiable  means that the identity  of an individual is or may be readily (1) ascertained by [CONTACT_52905] a combination of data variables, or (2) associated with the information.  
Direct identifiers  are direct links between a subject and data/specimens. Examples include (but are not limited to): name, date 
of birth, medical record number, email or IP address, pathology or surgery accession number, student number, or a collection 
of data that is (when taken together) identifiable.  
Indirect identifiers are information that links between direct identifiers and data/specimens. Examples: a subject code or 
pseudonym.  
Key refers to a single place where direct identifiers and indirect identifiers are linked together so that, for example, coded data 
can be identified as relating to a specific person. Example: a master list that contains the data code and the identifiers li nked to 
the codes.  
Obtain  means to possess or record in any fashion (writing, electronic document, video, email, voice recording, etc.) for 
research purposes and to retain for any length of time. This is different from accessing , which means to view or perceive data.

5.[ADDRESS_260847] information will be used for any of the following:  
• Future research not described in this application (in other words, secondary research)  
• Submission to a repository, registry, or database managed by [CONTACT_3476] , colleagues, or others for 
research purposes  
• Sharing with others for their own research  
Please  consider the broadest possible future plans and whether consent will be obtained now from the 
subjects for future sharing or research  uses  (which it may not be possible to describe in detail  at this time).  
Answer  YES even if  future sharing or uses will use de -identified information or specimens. Answer  NO if sharing is 
unlikely or if the  only sharing will be through the NIH Genomic Data Sha ring described in question 5. 8. 
Many federal grants and contracts now require data or specimen sharing as a condition of funding, and many journals require 
data sharing as a condition of publication. “Sharing” may include (for example): informal arrangements to share banked 
data/specimens with other investigators; establishing a repository that will formally share with  other  researchers  through 
written agreements; or sending data/specimens to a third party repository/archive/entity such as the Social Science Open 
Access Repository (SSOAR), or the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive.  
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, answer all of the questions below.  
 a. Describe what will be store d for future use,  including whether any direct or indirect (e.g., subject 
codes) identifiers will be stored.  
       
 b. Describe what will be shared  with other researchers or with a repository/database/registry , 
including whether direct identifiers will be shared and (for specimens) what data will be 
released with the specimens.  
       
 c. Who will oversee and/or manage the sharing?

6 CHILDREN (MINORS) and PARENTAL PERMISSION  
6.1 Involvement of minors . Does the research include minors (children)?  
Minor or child means someone who has not yet attained the legal age for consent for the research procedures, as 
described in the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted. This may or may not be the same as the definition used by [CONTACT_217314].  
• In Washington State the generic age of consent is 18, meaning that anyone under the age of 18 is 
considered a child.  
• There are some procedures for which the age of consent is much lower in Washington State . 
• The generic age of consent may be different in other states, and in other countries.  
 X No  If no, go to Section 8 . 
  Yes  If yes, provide the age range of the minor subjects for this study and the legal age for consent in 
the study  population(s). If there is more than one answer, explain.    
        
  
Don’t know  This means is it not possible to know the age of the subjects. For example, this may be true 
for some research involving social media, the Internet, or a dataset that is obtained  from 
another researcher or from a government agency. Go to Section 8 .  
 
6.2 Parental permission.  Parental permission means actively obtaining the permission of the parents. This is not  the 
same as “passive” or “opt out” permission where it is assumed that parents are allowing their children to 
participate because they have been provided with information about the research and have not objected or returned a form indicating they don’t wa nt their children to participate.  
a. Will parental permission be obtained for:  
  
All of the research procedures   Go to question 6.2b.   
  
  
None  of the research procedures   Use the table belo w to provide justification , and skip question

7 ASSENT OF CHILDREN (MINORS)  
Go to Section 8  if your research does not involve children (minors).  
7.1 Assent of children (minors). Though children do not have the legal capacity to “consent” to participate in 
research, they should be involved in the process if they are able to “assent” by [CONTACT_7661] a study explained to them 
and/or by [CONTACT_5978] a simple form about the study, and then giving their verbal choice about whether they want to 
participate. They may also provide a written assent if they are older. See WORKSHEET Children  for circumstances 
in which a child’s assent may be unnecessary or inappropriate.   
a. Will assent be obtained for:  
  
All research procedures and child groups   Go to question 7.2.   
  
  
None  of the research procedures and child groups   Use the table below to provide justification ,

  b. Upload all assent materials  (talking points, videos, forms, etc.) to Zipline . Assent materials are not required to 
provide all of the standard elements of adult consent; the information should be appropriate to the age, 
population, and research procedures. The documents should be in  Word, if possible. 
7.6 Children who reach the legal age of consent during participation in longitudinal research.  
Children who were enrolled at a young age and continue for many years: It is best practice to re -obtain assent (or 
to obtain it for the first time, if it was not obtained  at the beginning of their participation).  
Children who reach the legal age of consent : Informed consent must be obtained from the now -adult subject for 
(1) any ongoing interactions or interventions with the subjects, or (2) the continued analysis of specimens or data 
for which the subject’s identify is readily identifiable to the researcher, unless the IRB waives this requirement.  
 a. Describe the plans (if any) to re -obtain assent from children.   
       
 b. Describe the plans (if any) to obtain consent for children who reach the legal age of consent.  
• If adult consent  will be obtained from them , describe what will happen regarding  now -adult subjects 
who cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] . 
• If consent will not obtained or will not be possible:  explain why.  
       
7.7 Other regulatory requirements . (This is for information only; no answer or response is required.)  Researchers are 
responsible for determining whether their research conducted in schools, with student records, or over the Internet comply with permission, consent, and inspection requirements of the following federal regulations: 
• PPRA – Protection of Pup il Rights Amendment  
• FERPA – Family Education Rights and Privacy Act  
• COPPA – Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  
  
[ADDRESS_260853]’s decision to participate in the research is  documented. This is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_52870] a consent form.  
CONSENT FORM  is a document signed by [CONTACT_1766], by [CONTACT_61952].  
ELEMENTS OF CONSENT  are specific information that is required to be provided to subjects.

 CHARACTERISTICS OF 
CONSENT  are the qualities of the consent pro cess as a whole. These are:  
• Consent must be legally effective.  
• The process minimizes the possibility of coercion or undue influence.  
• Subjects or their representatives must be given sufficient opportunity to discuss 
and consider participation.  
• The information provided must:  
o Begin with presentation of key information (for consent materials over 2,000 words)  
o Be what a r easonable person would want to have  
o Be organized and presented so as to facilitate understanding  
o Be provided in sufficient detail 
o Not ask or appear to ask  subjects to waive their rights  
PARENTAL PERMISSION  is the parent’s active permission for the child t o participate in the research. Parental 
permission is subject to the same requirements as consent, including written documentation of permission and required elements.  
SHORT FORM CONSENT  is an alternative way of obtaining written documentation of consent that is most 
commonly used with individuals who are illiterate or whose language is one for which translated consent forms are not available.  
WAIVER OF CONSENT  means there is IRB approval for not obtaining consent or for not including some of the 
elements  of consent in the consent process.  
 
NOTE : If you plan to obtain identifiable information or identifiable biospecimens without 
consent, any waiver granted by [CONTACT_52922] a subject’s refusal to provide 
broad consent (for example, the Northwest  Biotrust).  
WAIVER OF 
DOCUMENTATION OF 
CONSENT  means that there is IRB approval for not obtaining written documentation of consent.  
8.1 Groups  Identify  the groups to which the  answers in this section apply.

• The location/setting where consent will be obtained  
• Who will obtain consent (refer to positions, roles,  or titles, not names)  
• How subjects  will be provided sufficient opportunity to discuss the study with the research team and consider 
participation  
 Nurses interested in participating will be provided the consent form for the study, which will allow nurses  time 
to review what the study entails before meeting with the PI /research staff or starting training/research activities . 
Nurses will be offered the opportunity to have a phone call or videoconference session with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217262] s tudy procedures and ask any questions before agreeing to participate. Nurses will also have 
the opportunity to continue participation without this session. They will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_217316]. There will be instructions provided 
virtually also as part of each step in the process.   
 
Nurses willing to participate will receive a unique link to a REDCap survey to review the consent form  and 
indicate consent by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_217263] a field in the survey. This is followed by [CONTACT_217317], a demographic survey, and the baseline survey. Nurses will have access anytime through a study 
website and/or REDCap informational survey to the orienting information abou t the study and instructions for 
completing each part of the training and research activities.  
 At each standardized patient role- play, the actor will orient the nurse to the role -play, its purpose, and remind 
participants that their participation is volun tary.

provider’s research, study team members who are participants; outpatients recruited from an outpatient surgery waiting room just prior to their surgery.  
  No  
 X Yes  If yes, describe what will be done to reduce any effect of the setting or relationship on the 
participation  decision.    
  Examples: a study coordinator will obtain consent instead of the subjects’ physician; the researcher will not 
know which subjects agreed to participate; subjects will  have two days to decide after hearing about the 
study.  
 Nurses may perceive that participating in the research is a required part of their job. The 
PI/research staff will communicate that the research is voluntary and will not report back to 
supervisors about the participation or degree of study completion by [CONTACT_217318] (whether the 
study reaches the requested sample size may be communicated to assist with advertisement of the 
study again to nurses).  
e. Information provided is tailored to needs of subject population . Describe the basis for concluding that  the 
information that will be provided  to subjects (via written or oral methods) is what a reasonable member of the 
subject population(s)  would want to know. If the research  consent materials contain a key information section, 
also describe the basis for concluding that the  informatio n presented in that section is that which is most likely 
to assist the selected su bject population with making a decision. See GUIDA NCE Key I nformation for Consent 
Materials . 
 
For example: Consultation with publications about res earch subjects’  preferences, disease- focused nonprofit groups, patient 
interest groups, or other researchers/study staff with experience with the specific population. It may also involve directly 
consulting selected members of the study population.  
 I have experience conducting research with nurses providing services to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217264] U.S. states. This research includes training nurses in brief behavioral health 
interventions and asking the m to complete research surveys and standardized patient role -plays.  
f. Ongoing process . For research that involves multiple or continued interaction with subjects over time, describe 
the opportunities (if any) that will be given to  subjects to ask questions or to change their minds about 
participating.  
 The study includes training and research activities that occur over multiple occasions. Some activities are 
scheduled with the research team, such as the standardized patient role- plays.  Nurses will be reminded that they 
may opt out of participating at any point. They will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217265]. Nurses will be reminded that there is no 
consequence for withdrawing their participation and they will receive remuneration for attempted activities (e.g. 
they will receive remuneration for partially -completed surveys).

 8.3 Electronic presentation of consent information. Will any part of the consent -related information be provided 
electronically for some or all of the subjects?  
This refers to the use of electronic systems and processes instead of (or in addition to) a paper consent form. For example, an 
emailed consent form, a passive or an interactive website, graphics, audio, video podcasts. See GUIDANCE Electronic Informed 
Consent  for information about electronic consent requirements at UW . 
  No  If no, skip to question 8.4 
 X Yes  If yes, answer questions a through e 
a. Describe the electronic consent  methodology and the information that will be provided . 
All informational materials must be made available to the IRB. Website content should be provided as a 
Word document. It is considered best practice to give subjects  information about multi -page/multi -screen 
information that will help them assess how long it will take them to complete the process. For example, 
telling them that it will take about [ADDRESS_260856] in the study. To enroll, the consent form information will be presented in a REDCap 
survey.  
b. Describe how the information can be navigated (if relevant). For example, will the subject  be able to 
proceed forward or backward within the system, or to stop and continue at a later time?  
 Nurses will navigate using the REDCap system and indicate consent by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_217263] a 
text box and clicking a button to submit the response.  
c. In a standard paper -based consent process, the subjects generally have the opportunity to go 
through the consent form with study staff and/or to ask study staff about any question they may have after reading the consent form. Describe what will be done, if anything, to facilitate the 
subject’s comprehension and opportunity to ask questions when consent information is presented electronically. Include a description of any provisions to help ensure privacy and confidentiality during this process.  
Examples: hyperlinks, help text, telephone calls, text messages or other type of electronic messaging, video 
conference, live chat with remotely located study team members.  
 Nurses will be provided the consent form ahead of being provided a link to a web -based 
orientation and pre- training survey. Nurses will be invited to schedule a call or session with the 
PI/research staff to go over the consent but this will not be required. Nurses will be given contact 
[CONTACT_217319]/research team at any poi nt to get help or ask questions about the 
study.  
d. What will happen if there are individuals who wish to participate but who do not have access to 
the consent methodology being used, or who do not wish to use it? Are there alternative ways in 
which they can obtain the information, or will there be some assistance available? If this is a clinical trial, these individuals cannot be excluded from the research unless there is a compelling rationale.  
 
For example, consider individuals who lack familiarity with electronic systems, have poor eyesight or 
impaired motor skills, or who do not have easy email or internet access.  
 Nurses will have access to the consent methodology as they will need to use the same technology 
to participate in all portions of the stud y and will have basic skills for using this technology as a 
routine part of their work environment.

e. How will the research team ensure continued accessibility of consent materials and information 
during the study?  
 Nurses will be emailed copi[INVESTIGATOR_217266] a link to a 
website/REDCap survey that has all needed study information. They will be provided contact 
[CONTACT_71722]/research team.  
f. How will additional information be provided to subjects during the research, including any 
significant new findings (such as new risk information) If this is not an issue, explain why.  
 The technology being tested is already in use elsewhere with other healthcare providers. No 
known adverse effects of interacting with the technology have been noted. Should any 
information arise that would affect risks to participants, the PI /research team will notify 
participants by [CONTACT_217320].    
8.4 Written documentation of consent. Which of the statements below describe whether documentation of consent 
will be obtained? NOTE: This question does not apply to screening and recruiting procedures which have already 
been  addressed in question 4. 7. 
Documentation of consent that is obtained electronically is not considered written consent unless it is obtained by a method 
that allows verification of the individual’s signature. In other words, saying “yes” by [CONTACT_52923]

b. Electronic consent signature. For studies in which documentation of consent will be obtained: will subjects use 
an electronic method to provide their consent signature?  
• See the GUIDANCE Electronic Informed Consent  for information about options (including REDCap e- signature [CONTACT_217347]) and any associated requirements.  
• FDA-regulated studies must use a system that complies with the FDA’s “Part 11” requirements about electronic 
systems and records.  Note that the UW -IT supported DocuSign e- signature [CONTACT_52939] . 
• Having subjects check a box at the beginning of an emailed or web- based questionnaire is not considered legally 
effective documentation of consent.  
  No  
  Yes  If yes,  indicate which methodology will be used.

  Yes If yes,  describe how subject identity will be verified, providing a non - technical  
 description that the reviewer will understand.  
       
b.3 How will the requirement be met to provide a copy of the consent information (consent 
form) to individuals who provide an e -signature?  
The copy can be paper or electronic and may be provided on an electronic storage device or via 
email. If the electronic consent information uses hyperlinks or other websites or podcasts to convey 
information specifically related to the research, the information in these hyperlinks should be 
included in the copy pr ovided to the subjects and the website must be maintained for the duration 
of the entire study.  
       
8.5 Non- English -speaking or -reading adult subjects . Will the research enroll adult subjects who do not speak English 
or who lack fluency or literacy in English?  
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, describe the process that will be used to ensure that the oral and written information 
provided to them during the consent process and throughout the study will be in a language readily 
understandable to them and (for written materials such as consent forms or question naires) at an 
appropriate reading/comprehension level.    
       
 a. Interpretation . Describe how interpretation will be provided, and when. Also, describe the 
qualifications of the interpreter(s) – for example, background, experience, language proficiency 
in English and in the other language, certification, other credentials, familiarity with the research -
related vocabulary in English and the target language.  
       
 b. Translation s. Describe how translations will be obtained for all study materials (not just consent 
forms). Also, describe the method for ensuring that the translations meet the UW IRB’s requi rement that translated documents will be linguistically accurate, at an appropriate reading 
level for the participant population, and culturally sensitive for the locale in which they will be used.

 8.6 Barriers to written documentation of consent . There are many possible barriers to obtaining written 
documentation of consent. Consider, for example, individuals who are functionally illiterate; do not read English 
well; or have sensory or motor impairments that may impede the ability to read and sign a consent form.  
a. Describe the plans (if any) for obtaining written documentation of consent from potential subjects who may 
have difficulty with the standard documentation process (that is, reading and signing a consent form). Skip this question if written documentation of  consent is not being obtained for any part of the research.  
Examples of solutions : Translated consent forms; use of the Short Form consent process; reading the form to the person  
before they sign it; excluding individuals who cannot read and understand the consent form.  
 N/A 
8.7 Deception . Will information be deliberately withheld, or will false information be provided, to any of the subjects? 
Note: “Blinding” subjects to their study group/condition/arm is not considered to be deception, but not telling them ahead of 
time that they will be subject to an intervention or about the purpose of the procedure(s) is deception . 
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, describe what information and why.  
  Example: It may be necessary to deceive subjects about the purpose  of the study  (describe why) . 
       
 a. Will subjects be informed beforehand that they will be unaware of or misled regarding the 
nature or purposes of the research ? (Note: this is not necessarily required.)  
  No  
  Yes  
 b. Will subjects be debrief ed later? (Note: this is not necessarily required.)  
  No  
  Yes  If yes, describe how and when this will occur. Upload any debriefing materials, 
including talking points or a script, to Zipline .   
       
8.8 Cognitively impaired adults, and other adults unable to consent . Will such individuals be included in the 
research?  
Examples: individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or dementia; individuals who are unconscious, or who are significantly intoxicated.  
 X No  If no, go to question  8.9. 
  Yes  If yes, answer the following questions.  
 a. Rationale . Provide the rationale for including this population.

  b. Capacity for consent / decision making capacity . Describe the process that will be used  to 
determine whether a cognitively impaired  individual is capable of consent  decision making 
with respect to  the research protocol and setting.  
        
 b.1. If there  will be repeated interactions with the impaired subjects over a time period when 
cognitive capacity could increase or diminish, also describe how (if at all) decision -
making capacity will be re -assessed and (if appropriate) consent obtained during that 
time.  
       
 c. Permission (surrogate consent) . If the research  will include adults who cannot consent for 
themselves, describe the process for obtaining permission (“surrogate consent”) from a legally 
authorized representative (LAR).   
 For research conducted in Washington State, see the GUIDANCE Legally Authorized Representative  to 
learn which individuals meet the state  definition of “legally authorized representative”.  
        
 d. Assent . Describe whether assent will be required of all, some, or none of the subjects. If some, 
indicate which subjects will be required to assent and which will not (and why not). Describe 
any process that will be used to obtain and document a ssent from the subjects.  
        
 e. Dissent or resistance. Describe how a subject’s objection or resistance to participation 
(including non -verbal) during the research will be identified, and what will occur in response .

8.10 Consent -related materials . Upload to Zipline  all consent scripts/talking points, consent forms, debriefing 
statements, Information Statements, Short Form consent forms, parental permission forms, and any other 
consent -related materi als that will be used. Materials that will be used by a specific site should be uploaded to 
that site’s Local Site Documents  page.  
• Translations must be submitted and approved before they can be used. However, we  strongly encourage you to wait to 
provide them until the IRB has  approved the English versions.  
• Combination forms: It may be appropriate to combine parental permission with consent, if parents are subjects as well as 
providing permission for the participation of their children. Similarly, a consent form may be appropriately considered an assent form for older children.  
• For materials that cannot be uploaded: upload screenshots or written descriptions that are sufficient to enable the IRB to 
understand the types of data that will be collected and the nature of the experience for the participant. URLs (website 
addresses) may also  be provide d, or written descriptions  of websites. Examples of materials that usually cannot be 
uploaded: mobile apps; computer -administered test; licensed and restricted standardized tests.

recruiting, consenting, sensitivity of the data being collected, and the method of data collection.  
Examples:  
• Many subjects will feel a violation of privacy if they receive a letter asking them to participate in a study because they have ____ medical condition, when their name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and medical condition were drawn from medical 
records without their consent.  Example: the IRB expects that “cold call” recruitment letters will inform the subject 
about how their information was obtained.  
• Recruiting subjects immediately prior to a sensitive or invasive procedure (e.g., in an outpatient surgery waiting 
room) will feel like an invasion of privacy to some individuals . 
• Asking subjects about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g. details about sexual behavior) may feel like an invasion of privacy to some 
individuals.  
 The research team will take steps to protect nurses’ privacy. We will not share whether they enroll or complete 
study procedures with anyone outside the research team. The study team will ensure data is collected and 
transferred securely and de- identified when possible. All data is stored securely in UW’s REDCap instance and on 
a UW Medicine network drive accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27235]. Recordings of standardized patients will be 
necessarily identifiable. These will not be shared outside of the study team and will be stored on the secure UW 
server. REDCap survey data will be downloaded and stored in deidentified format. Focus groups will be recorded, 
transcribed, and transcriptions maintained in de- identified format. During the informed consent process for all 
project focus groups, we will inform participants that we cannot guarantee confidentiality in the focus groups as 
other participants can break confidentiality by [CONTACT_217321]. We 
will request at the start of all focus groups that participants not share what has been discussed in the focus groups 
with persons who did not participate in that focus group session.  
9.2 Identification of individuals in publications and presentations . Will potentially identifiable information about 
subjects be used in  publications and presentations, or is it possible that individual identities could be inferred from 
what is planned to be publish ed or present ed?

  Yes  
  No  If no, describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects (or small groups of 
subjects) from being identifiable.     
       
9.3 State mandatory reporting. Each state has reporting laws that require some types of individuals to report some 
kinds of abuse, and medical conditions that are under public health surveillance. These include:  
• Child abuse  
• Abuse, abandonment, neglect, or financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult  
• Sexual assault  
• Serious physical assault  
• Medical conditions subject to mandatory reporting (notification) for public health surveillance  
 
Are you or a member of the  research team  likely to learn of any of the above events or circumstances while 
conduc ting the  research AND  feel obligated to report it to state authorities?  
 X No  
  Yes  If yes,  the UW IRB expects subjects to be informed of this possibility in the consent form or during 
the consent process, unless you provide a rationale for not doing so:   
         
9.4 Retention of identifiers  and data . Check the box below to indicate assurance that any identifiers (or links between 
identifiers and data/specimens)  and data  that are part of the  research records will not be destroyed until after the 
end of the applicable records retention requirements (e.g. Washington State; funding agency or sponsor; Food 
and Drug Administration).  If it is important to say something about destruction of identifiers (or links to identifiers) 
in the consent form, state something like “the link between your identifier and the research data will be destroyed 
after the records retention period required by [CONTACT_52925]/or federal law.”  
This question can be left blank for conversion applications (existing paper applications that are being “converted” into a Zipline 
application.)

10.[ADDRESS_260861]:  
• Describe the magnitude, probability, duration, and/or reversibility of the harm, discomfort, or hazard, AND  
• Describe how the risks  will be reduced or managed. Do not describe data security protections here, these are 
already described in Question 9.6.  
• Consider possible physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic harms , including  possible negative effects on  
financial standing, employability, insurability, educational advancement or reputation.  For example, a breach of 
confidentiality might have these effects.  
• Examples of “others”: embryo, fetus, or nursing child; family members; a specific group.  
• Ensure applicable risk information from any Investigator Brochures, Drug Package Inserts, and/or Device Manuals is 
included in your description.  
• Do not include the risks of non- research procedures that are already being performed.  
• If the study design specifies that  subjects will be assigned to a specific condition or intervention, then the condition or 
intervention is a research procedure - even if it is a standard of care.  
• Examples of mitigation strategies: inclusion/exclusion criteria; applying appropriate data security measures to prevent unauthorized access to individually identifiable data; coding data; taking blood samples to monitor something that 
indicates drug toxicity.
 
• As with all questions on this application, you may refer to uploaded documents.  
 Potential Risks:  
Confidentiality.  Nurses may be concerned that performance on the standard patient role- plays and responses to 
study surveys and focus group questions may be shared with colleagues or supervisors. 
Observation/assessment burden.  Completing training and research tasks may be perceived as burdensome and 
nurses may experience some performance- related anxiety on the standardized patients. Nurses may experience 
some frustration interacting with the technology, which may depend on nurse computer technology literacy.  
Distress related to talking about suicide.  Nurses in Washington State are expected to have some experience 
talking about suicide and working with patients at- risk of suicide. They are required to take six continuing 
educati on hours of suicide prevention training for their license and routinely screen acute care patients for suicide 
risk. However, interacting with a standardized patient in a role-play about suicide and suicide safety planning may 
be novel. Reporting on or dis cussing experiences nurses have had with suicidal patients may be associated with 
anxiety, sadness, or other emotional distress.  
Coercion. There is a risk that nurses may feel coerced to participate in the study.

 Plans to Minimize Potential Risks  
Confide ntiality.  The study team will ensure data is collected and transferred securely and de-identified when 
possible. All data is stored securely in UW’s REDCap instance and on a UW Medicine network drive accessible 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27235]. Recordings of standardized patients will be necessarily identifiable. These will not be 
shared outside of the study team and will be stored on the secure UW server. REDCap survey data will be 
downloaded and stored in deidentified format. Focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and transcripts will be deidentified. During the informed consent process for all project focus groups, we will inform participants that we 
cannot guarantee confidentiality in the focus groups as other participants can break confidentiality by [CONTACT_217322]. We will request at the start of all focus groups that participants 
not share what has been discussed in the focus groups with persons who did not participate in that focus group 
session. No pres entation or publication arising from this research will use participant names or other information 
that would allow participants to be identified.  
Observation/assessment burden.  To manage potential performance anxiety related to the standardized patient r ole-
plays, nurses will be reminded that the assessments will be used only for the research study and will not be shared 
with their supervisor or others who may use the information in an evaluative way. We will remind nurse 
participants that the purpose of our project is to develop effective training methods, not to evaluate them as 
professional nurse providers. Nurses will be reminded that all activities are voluntary, including the training activities. They will be allowed to quit using any of the training  technology, end the session with the standardized 
patient, skip survey questions, and leave the focus group early or not answer questions if they choose. Nurses will 
have an opportunity to debrief with the research staff after the standardized patient. Nurses will be able to 
schedule the standardized patient to occur at their convenience.  
Distress related to talking about suicide.  Nurses will be allowed to end specific training or research activities if 
feeling distressed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217267]’ experiences with training and research activities and nurses may reach the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217268]. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_217269]. The PI [CONTACT_832] a licensed 
clinical psychologist who routinely supervises and consults with mental health providers on managing distress associated with patient care. [CONTACT_217352] has expertise in suicide prevention trials and training clinicia ns in 
suicide prevention and treatment and will also be available to consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217270].  
Coercion. Nurses will be recruited by [CONTACT_978]/research team . The PI /research team  will post advertisements, attend 
staff meetings, ask the unit nurse manager to send out a recruitment email, or email potential nurse participants 
directly to invite them to participate in the study. Nurses will be reminded that they can opt out of any part of the 
training and research activities and that whether they compl ete the activities is documented for research purposes 
and not reported to fellow nurses or supervisors. Remuneration was designed to balance adequate compensation 
for time and effort without being too large of an amount to be coercive. 
 
 
10.2 Reproducti ve risks. Are there any risks of the study procedures to men and women (who are subjects, or partner 
of subjects) related to pregnancy, fertility, lactation or effects on a fetus or neonate?  
Examples : direct teratogenic effects; possible germline effects;  effects on fertility; effects on a woman’s ability to continue a 
pregnancy; effects on future pregnancies.

  1.) The FDA has concluded that gadolinium is retained in the body and brain for a 
significantly longer time than previously recognized, especially for linear GBCAs. The health -related risks of this longer retention are not yet clearly established. 
However, the UW IRB expects researchers to provide a compelling justification for using a linear GBCA instead of a macrocyclic GBCA, to manage the risks associated with GBCAs.
 
 Describe why it is important to use  a GBCA with the  MRI scan(s). Describe the dose 
that will be used and (if it is more than the standard clinical dose recommended by 
[CONTACT_3455]) why it is necessary to use  a higher dose . If a linear GBCA  will be 
used , explain why a mac rocyclic GBCA  cannot be used .

10.10 Return of individual research results.  
In this section , provide your plans for the return of individual results. An “individual research result” is any information 
collected, generated or discovered in the course of a research study that is linked to the identity of a research participant. These may be results from screening procedures, results that are actively sought for purposes of the study, results that are 
discovered unintentionally, or after analysis of the collected data and/or results has been completed.  
  See the GUIDANCE Return of Individual Results
 for information about results that should and should not be returned, validity 
of results, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA), consent requirements and communicating results.  
 a. Is it anticipated  that the research will produce any individual research results that are clinically actionable?  
 “Clinically actionable” means that there are established therapeutic or preventive interventions or other available 
actions that have the potential to change the clinical course of the disease/condition, or lead to an improved health 
outcome.  
 
In general, every effort should be made to offer results that are clinically actionable, valid and pose life -threatening 
or severe health consequences if not treated or addressed quickly. Other clinically actionable results should be 
offered if this can be accomplished without compromising the research.  
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, answer the following questions ( a.1-a.3). 
 a.1. Describe the clinically actionable results that are anticipated and explain which results, 
if any, could be urgent (i.e. because they pose life -threatening or severe health 
consequences if not treated or addressed quickly).  
 Examples  of urgent results include very high calcium levels, highly elevated liver function test 
results, positive results for reportable STDs . 
       
 a.2. Explain which of these results will be offered to subjects.  
       
 a.3. Explain which results will not be offered to subjects and provide the rationale for not 
offering these results.  
 Reasons not to offer the results might include:  
• There are serious questions regarding validity or reliability  
• Returning the results has the potential to cause bias  
• There are insufficient resources to communicate the results effectively and appropriately  
• Knowledge of the result could cause psychosocial harm to subjects

 b. Is there a  plan for offering  subjects any results that are not clinically actionable?  
 Examples: non- actionable genetic results, clinical tests in the normal range, experimental and/or uncertain results.  
 X No  
  Yes  If yes, explain which results will be offered to subjects and provide the rationale for 
offering these results.   
  
 c. Describe the validity and reliability of any results that will be offered to subjects.  
 The IRB will consider evidence of validity such as studies demonstrating diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive value, 
use of confirmatory testing, and quality management systems.  
       
 d. Describe the process for communicating results to subjects and facilitating understanding of the results. In 
the description, include who will approach the participant with regard to the offer of results, who will 
communicate the result (if different), the circumstances, timing, and communication methods that will be 
used.  
       
 e. Describe any plans to share results with family members (e.g. in the event a subject becomes 
incapacitated or deceased).  
       
 f. Check the box to indicate that any plans for return of individual research results  have been described  in 
the consent document. If there are no plans to provide results to participants, this should be stated in the 
consent form.  
 See the GUIDANCE Return of Individual Results  for information about consent requirements.

10.[ADDRESS_260865] or patent could result from this 
study?  
  No  
 X Yes  If yes,  describe whether subjects might receive any remuneration/compensation and, if yes, 
how the amount will be determined.   
   The technology being used is an existing commercial product. There is no remuneration or 
compensation offered outside of what nurses receive for participating in the study activities.

CONSENT FORM
Formative Evaluation of an eLearning Approach to Suicide Prevention Training
Researchers: Doyanne Darnell, PhD (Lead) Psychiatry [PHONE_4592]
Andria Pi[INVESTIGATOR_98803], MEd
We are asking you to be in a research study.  This form gives you information to help you decide 
whether or not to be in the study. Being in the study is voluntary. Please read this carefully.  You 
may ask any questions about the study. Then you can decide whether or not you want to be in the 
study.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
We are evaluating an eLearning training for nurses in suicide safety planning that uses 
innovative technologies to provide nurses with opportunities to practice and get feedback on 
their skills. Findings will be used to inform iterations to improve the training and help guide 
future efforts to implement the training within a larger trial. 
STUDY PROCEDURES
All study procedures are done virtually. The study includes participation in eLearning training 
and training evaluation activities. 
Training Activities (3-4 hours over 1 month)
The eLearning training includes a 1-hour didactic component with information about suicide 
safety planning and how to do it along with video demonstration of suicide safety planning being 
done. You will be able to complete this at any time that works for you prior to using the two 
technologies below. 
The training also includes using two novel technologies:
1. A conversational agent or chat bot that allows a person to practice general counseling skills 
with a computer-simulated person. The computer will be designed to act as a suicidal patient.
2. An interactive, confidential report generated by a computer with feedback on a person’s use 
of general counseling skills in an interaction with another person. The feedback will be based 
on one of your standardized patient role-plays done as part of the study.
The training includes completing two standardized patient role-plays in which you will 
practice the suicide safety planning skills learned in the didactic portion. The role-plays will 
be audio and/or video recorded and the second will be uploaded into a web-based platform 
that generates the computerized feedback on your use of general counseling skills in the 
session.

Formative Evaluation of an eLearning Approach to Suicide Prevention Training  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_217276]  
1 
  
 
The eLearning approach in this study includes evaluation of  two technologies  used for skill- building in 
general counseling skills, after engaging in didactic content that explains and demonstrates suicide 
safety planning. The two technologies are:  
1. Client Bot (see example page 3) 
This technology uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to portray a client or patient in an interactive text format, providing a trainee the opportunity to practice general counseling 
microskills (e.g., reflective  statements of what a patient says or means; open -questions to elicit 
a patient’s perspective and interests) and receive real -time feedback on performance and 
coaching on use of these skills.  The computer -simulated patient will have the persona of a 
suicid al patient.  
 
2. Lyssn (see example page 4)  
The Lyssn platform is a system utilizing speech signal and natural language processing as well as 
machine learning to assess the quality of general counseling skills  (common in Motivational 
Interviewing). Lyssn has t hree main functions: a) it securely captures audio or video data from 
counseling sessions, using a HIPAA -compliant, cloud -based platform; b) it processes and 
analyzes this information; and c) it provides end -users access to the raw data (i.e., recording) 
and quality measures to give trainees feedback on their skills and monitory quality assurance. 
An interactive web report includes an automated speech -to-text transcript of the session and 
counseling quality statistics such as the provider’s level of empathy, collaborative style, how 
many reflective statements the provider  makes relative to questions they ask, and how many

 questions are open -ended (encourages patients to talk more). In addition, there is a timeline of 
the entire session, where each talk- turn is linked to the transcript of the session to facilitate 
review and study of specific exchanges within the session. Each talk -turn includes predicted 
counseling quality indicators based on the machine learning engine and a visual representation 
of vocally -encoded arousal of the speaker.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_217278]: Recruitment Materials
This study is part of developmental research for a technology-enhanced suicide prevention training for 
nurses working with patients at Harborview Medical Center.
Recruitment efforts may include flyers posted in work areas and places on and off the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217279] (e.g., local coffee shop), announcements at staff meetings, emails 
sent directly to nurses through a mailing list obtained from nurse managers or through nurse managers 
who can distribute the advertisement, and an advertisement in an internal newsletter that goes out to 
nurses.  The advertisements will explain that the study team is looking for volunteers to participate in an 
evaluation of an eLearning suicide prevention training and engage in research activities to inform 
improvements to the training program and how to study the program in a larger trial.

time they will engage in routine monitoring activities. They will communicate as needed for more 
immediate issues as described below. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217282].  
 
UW Human Subjects Division – Institutional Review Board  
 
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_217327]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217283] r eporting 
require ments  to the IRB as detailed below.  
 
2. Summary of the Study Protocol  
 
Overall purpose of the K23 research  
The K23 includes developmental and pi[INVESTIGATOR_217284] a technology -enhanced training  in suicide 
safety planning that targets skill -building in  general  counseling skills to accompany a standard web-
based didactic with skill demonstration in suicide safety planning. The training is designed to support 
acute medical care nurses to engage patients at -risk of suicide in collaborative and empathic suicide 
safety planning. Skill -building technologies include a chat bot called “Client Bot” and an automated 
computer -based coding and computer -generated feedback report through a platform called Lyssn. 
Aims [ADDRESS_260876] training outcome data.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
Acceptability. Nurse training and technology  acceptability  will be assessed using the System 
Usability Scale (SUS), open -ended questions, and a modified version of the Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire- 8 (CSQ -8) to assess nurse satisfaction with the training.  
Training outcomes.  Nurse training outcomes of general  counseling skill quality and quality of safety 
planning will be assessed using standardized patient assessments. Nurses will complete four 30-
minute role- plays over the course of the evaluation. These will be conducted by [CONTACT_217328], recorded, and assessed for general counseling skill quality using the Lyssn system. 
Pre- and post -training and follow -up role- plays will be assessed for fidelity to the safety planning 
intervention by [CONTACT_978]. Self -reported perception of skills will be assessed via survey at baseline, post -
training and 6- months post -training using methods modified from training clinicians in evidence- based 
psychotherapy.   
 
Secondary Outcomes  
Training targets.  Nurse training targets will include use of the technology and nurse motivation for 
training and delivery of safety planning. Self -report surveys at post -training and the 6- month follow -up 
will include questions to assess whether and when nurses used the Client Bot and Lyssn feedback 
system and how they used it in their training and practice. Use data will also be collected by [CONTACT_217329], which will consist of how often nurses accessed the program, times of day of 
use, how long nurses spent  on the program, and features used. A measure of nurse motivation to use 
the training materials, including the technology, will be asked at each survey time point. This will 
include variables such as nurse interest in the material, technology, and willingness to persist when 
challenged by [CONTACT_217330]. Motivation to use the general 
counseling skills to conduct collaborative safety planning with patients (i.e., transfer of training) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_217331] f rom the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF; e.g., beliefs about 
capabilities and consequences, behavioral intentions, negative emotions).  
 
Other Variables of Interest  
Nurse demographics. Nurses will complete demographic questions (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, 
age) and asked about their length of current employment, training background, and experience with 
suicide prevention and other behavioral interventions.  
Knowledge of safety planning. Nurses will complete brief quizzes to assess knowledge of  what 
safety planning is and how to do it.  
Implementation barriers and facilitators. Implementation barriers and facilitators will be assessed 
for both engaging in the training and using the skills learned with patients via nurse surveys at 
baseline, post -training and 6- months post -training as well as end- of-study focus groups. Questions 
will be designed using the TDF (e.g., beliefs about consequences, role & identity, environmental 
context & resources).  
 
 
 
3 
 Plan of Analysis  
Quantitative data will be viewed graphically and analyzed descriptively. Qualitative open- ended 
responses to questions will be summarized into common themes or content analyzed, as appropriate. 
Acceptability of the training will be supported by [CONTACT_217332] 24 (indicates average of 3) on the 
CSQ -8 provider -version, above 67 on the SUS, and responses to open- ended questions based on 
relevant TDF constructs. Feasibility of the training will be supported by [CONTACT_217333] (web- based didactic, Client Bot, and 
Lyssn feedback). Focus group qualitative data will be content analyzed according to TDF constructs.  
 
3. Human Subjects  Considerations  
 
Inclusion/exclusion Criteria  
All nurses working on participating units will be eligible for participation. There are no exclusion 
criteria. Nurses will opt into the study based on interest and willingness, including willingness to utilize 
a computer and the internet to participate in the web- based training activities.  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent may occur in person, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_217334]. The PI /research staff  will 
send the informed consent document to nurses ahead of time and then meet to go over and explain 
the study, review the consent form, and answer any questions. We will obtain a waiver of 
documentation of informed consent to facilitate virtual consent procedures. Nurses are expected to be 
literate in English at the high school level. They are also expected to be able to use computer, 
internet, REDCap technology as they routinely use these or similar systems in their routine work.  
 
Risks Associated with Study Participation  
Confidentiality . Nurses may be concerned that performance on the standard patient role- plays  and 
responses to study surveys and focus group questions may be shared with colleagues or supervisors.  
Observation/assessment burden.  Completing training and research tasks may be perceived as 
burdensome and nurses may experience some performance- related anxiety on the standardized 
patients. Nurses may experience some frustration interacting with the technology, which may depend 
on nurse computer technology literacy.  
Distress related to  talking about suicide.  Nurses in Washington State are  expected to have some 
experience talking about suicide and working with patients at -risk of suicide.  They are required to take 
six continuing education hours of suicide prevention training for their license and routinely screen 
acute care patients for suicide risk . However, interacting with a standardized patient in a role- play 
about suicide and suicide safety planning may be novel. Reporting on or discussing experiences 
nurses have had with suicidal patients may be associated with anxiety, sadness, or other emotional 
distress.  
Coercion. There is a risk that nurses may feel coerced to participate in the study.  
 
Plans to Minimize Potential Risks  
Confidentiality . The study team will ensure data is collected and transferred securely and de-
identified when possible . All data is  stored securely in UW’s REDCap instance and  on a UW Medicine 
network drive accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27235]. Recordings of standardized patients will be 
necessarily identifiable. These will not be shared outside of the study team and will be stored on the 
secure UW server. REDCap survey data will be downloaded and stored in deidentified format. Focus 
groups will be recorded and transcribed. Transcripts will be deidentified. During the informed consent 
process for all project focus groups, we will inform participants that we cannot guarantee 
confidentiality in the focus groups as other participants can break confidentiality by [CONTACT_217335]. We will request at the start of all focus groups that 
4 
 participants not share what has been discussed in the focus groups with persons who did not 
participate in that focus group session. No presentation or publication arising from this research will 
use participant names or other information that would allow participants to be identified.  
Observation/assessment burden . To manage potential performance anxiety related to the 
standardized patient role- plays, nurses will be reminded that the assessments will be used only for 
the research study and will not be shared with their supervisor or others who may use the information 
in an evaluative way. We will remind nurse participants that the purpose of our project is to develop 
effective training methods, not to evaluate them as professional nurse providers. Nurses will be 
reminded that all activities are voluntary, including the training activities. They will be allowed to quit 
using any of the training technology, end the session with the standardized patient, skip survey 
questions, and leave the focus group early or not answer questions if they choose.  Nurses will have 
an opportunity to debrief with the research staff after the standardized patient. Nurses will be able to 
schedule the standardized patient to occur at their convenience.  
Distress related to talking about suicide. Nurses will be allowed to end specific training or research 
activities if feeling distressed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217267]’ experiences with training and 
research activities and nurses may reach the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217285]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217286]. The PI [CONTACT_832] a licensed clinical psychologist who routinely supervises and 
consults with mental health providers on managing distress associated with patient care. [CONTACT_217352]  
has expertise in suicide prevention trials and training clinicians in suicide prevention and treatment  
and will also be available to consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217270].  
Coercion. Nurses will be  recruited by [CONTACT_978] /research team. The PI/research team  will post 
advertisements , attend staff meetings , ask the unit nurse manager to send out a recruitment email, or 
email potential nurse participants directly to invite them to participate in the study.  Nurses will be 
reminded that they can opt out of any part of the training and research activities  and that whether they 
complete the activities  is documented for research purposes and not reported to fellow nurses or 
supervisors. Remuneration was designed to balance adequate compensation for time and effort 
without being too large of an amount to be coercive.  
 
4. Quality Assurance P rocedures  
 
Data quality assurance  includes  monitoring data collection to ensure they are accurately and reliably 
collected and monitoring the storage of data to ensure they are stored securely and appropriately. 
Effective data quality assurance procedures involve proper training of staff in data collection  
procedures , use of appropriate data collection tools,  and periodic review of adherence to data 
collection , transfer, and storage procedures  as well as  data completeness and accuracy .  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217287], receiving guidance from 
mentors  and consultants as appropriate, and will tra in research staff in these procedures.  
 
Sources of Material  
This study includes four primary sources of data collected for research purposes:  
 
a) Standardized patient role -play recordings  
Nurses will be asked to complete four standardized patient role- plays with research staff or 
paid actors. These role -plays will be recorded. Quality assessment scores will be generated by 
[CONTACT_217336] [INVESTIGATOR_217288] r ole-plays  as outcome assessments for suicide 
safety planning adherence.  
 
b) REDCap surveys  
5 
 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a HIPAA -compliant data capture system used 
by [CONTACT_217337]’s Institute of Translational Health Sciences. It will capture 
self-report survey data for this study, which are completed at baseline, post -training, and [ADDRESS_260877] -training.  
 
c) Focus group recordings  & transcripts  
Nurses will be invited to participate in a 1- hour focus group with other study nurses to gather 
qualitative data about their experiences in the training and perceptions of implementation 
barriers and facilitators of other nurses utilizing the training and skills taught in safety planning.  
 
d) Technology use data  
The technologic innovations under study, including Client Bot and the Lyssn system will gather 
use data. Nurses will be provided access to the technologies in a fashion that allows use to be 
tracked internally by [CONTACT_217338].  
 
Data Confidentiality  
 
a) Standardized patient role- play recordings  
Neither the recordings of standardized patient role- plays nor the individual quality assessment 
scores based on the role- plays will be shared outside of the research team.  Scores will be 
maintained in de- identified format once downloaded from Ly ssn or after PI [INVESTIGATOR_217289].  
 
a) REDCap surveys  
REDCap survey data will be stored in identifiable format in REDCap to facilitate tracking of 
survey completion and participant remuneration; however, the data will be de- identified upon 
download and stored on secure UW Medicine servers.  
 
b) Focus group recordings & transcripts  
Audio/video files of focus groups will be stored on secure UW Medicine servers. Transcripts 
will be made in de- identified format and also stored on secure UW Medicine servers.  
 
c) Technology use data  
Technology use data is stored securely on the Client Bot and Lyssn systems. This data will be 
transferred in de- identified format using secure email from Lyssn to UW or downloaded by [CONTACT_1600]/research staff  and then de- identified for stor age. Data will be stored on a secure UW 
Medicine server.  
 
 
Data Security  
 
d) Standardized patient role- play recordings  
Audio/video files of standardized patient role- plays will be stored on secure UW Medicine 
servers and the Lyssn platform. Lyssn provides a high level of security, is HIPAA -compliant, 
and meets standards of UW Medicine. There will be no real patient interactions recorded.  
 
e) REDCap surveys  
REDCap is a HIPAA -compliant secure data capture system that requires a log -in and 
password through an associated UW account. Accounts are only provided by [CONTACT_217339]. 
The research team will keep their log -in information private.

5. Event Reporting  
 
The study team will follow procedures for reporting reportable events required of both the UW IRB 
(Guide to Reporting New Information - UW Research (washington.edu) ) as well as NIMH ( NIMH 
Reportable Events Policy ). 
 
 
 
 
7 
 The following Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) Definitions will be used to meet 
reporting requirements:  
 
Adverse Event (AE) . An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  
temporally associated with participation in the clinical study or with use of the experimental agent 
being studied. An adverse finding ca n include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test 
value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or any combination of these.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in 
one or more of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may jeopardize the participant’s health and may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the other events listed above (based upon appropriate 
medical judgment)  
 
Unanticipated Problem.  Unanticipated problems include any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol 
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied  
• R elated or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly 
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
• S uggest s that the research places participants  or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
AE a nd SAE Identification 
Nurses may experience emotional or psychological distress talking about suicide with other nurses, 
answering questions about working with suicidal patients, or role- playing suicide safety planning with 
a patient actor. There are no other known AEs or SAEs that are expected to occur through 
participation in the study. The study team may become aware of AEs or SAEs through survey 
responses or during attempts to engage nurse participants in study activities.

  Tel: (410) 884 -2900 Fax: (410) [ADDRESS_1002481] functional (idiopathic or non -ulcer) dyspepsia 
with no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation. Patients with functional dyspepsia 
usually describe postprandial ful lness, early satiety,  and/or  epi[INVESTIGATOR_323565]/burning. 
Symptoms may be severe enough to limit usual activities. Some patients may have nausea, 
vomiting, or heartburn; however, these symptoms are usually infrequent.  [28] The most 
common approach to treat occ asional indigestion and heartburn is to use antacids to 
neutralize what is often believed to be an overproduction of stomach acid. This acid -
blocking approach can perpetuate the problem when used over a long period of time. Acid 
blocking also has the drawb ack of causing deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals over 
time, such as calcium. By [CONTACT_733701], an overgrowth of bacteria 
and imbalances in gut health can also worsen health states. The Upset Stomach Relief test 
product is an herbal solution with ingredients that may ease occasional indigestion and 
heartburn, while helpi[INVESTIGATOR_733670]. [4]  
 
There are several causes of indigestion. Acid accumulation and improper gastrointestinal 
emptying can both prompt dyspepsia. Additionally, stomach or intestinal ulcers formed by 
[CONTACT_733702] l cause 
indigestion. Other potential causes  can be  from the intake of over -the-counter medications, 
like ibuprofen , overeating, fatty, greasy, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_99797], alcohol, and caffeine . [5] 
 
While dietary and lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms  of indigesti on and heartburn , 
HLNatural, Inc. created  the test product  to reduce occasional indigestion and heartburn . The 
test product  is a plant -based  remedy formulated with ingredients that have  demonstrated 
[ADDRESS_1002482] is 1) 
DGL Extract, 2) Artichoke Leaf Extract, 3) Ginger Root Extract (6% gingerols), 4) Chamomile 
(1% Api[INVESTIGATOR_733671]), 5) Marshmallow Root Extract,  6) Capsule (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, 
Purified Water, Carrageenan, Potassium Chloride ), , 7) Rice Hull Concen trate . Below, the  [ADDRESS_1002483] are listed. All ingredients are Generally Recognized as Safe 
(GRAS) by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
Upset Stomach Relief  
Active Ingredients: Licorice Extract, Artichoke Leaf Extract, Chamomile, Marshmallow  
Root, Ginger . 
 
Inactive Ingredients: Capsule (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, Purified Water, 
Carrageenan, Potassium Chloride), Rice Hull Concentrate.  
 
The ingredients in the test product  have been included because they have demonstrated 
benefit for  digestive health. The justifications for their inclusion are briefly described here:  
 
Licorice  has a long history of traditional use in promoting digestive health. DGL is a type of 
extract of licorice in which the glycyrrhizin has been removed, which helps prevent side 
effects that can occur in some people from regular Licorice use. Scientific inve stigation into 
the mechanism of activity of DGL for providing digestive support shows that it helps in 
maintaining digestive comfort by [CONTACT_733703]. It is also an anti -spasmolytic,  which helps to relax the 
intestinal wall and aid in digestive comfort. [10 , 16, 17, 18 ] 
 
Artichoke Leaf Extract  helps stimulate and aid the digestive process. Artichoke Leaf extract 
is a traditional herbal digestive bitter known to stimulate the digestive  process. Artichoke 
Leaf extract has been shown in studies to relieve occasional heartburn. [9]  
 
Marshmallow Root has a long history of traditional use for soothing mucosal membranes. 
The mucilage -rich roots of Marshmallow are thought to be responsible for  many of the 
pharmacological activities of Marshmallow. Preclinical research shows that the 
mucilaginous nature can help form a protective coating on the mucosal lining, which acts as 
a shield from irritants and exerting spasmolytic and antisecretory prope rties. [11 , 19, 20, 21, 
22] 
  
Ginger  is a spi[INVESTIGATOR_733672] . Clinical 
research shows that Ginger supports health through its benefits to the immune, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
[ADDRESS_1002484] and relief of 
occasional heartburn. [7, 8 , 23, 24 ] 
 
Chamomile is one of the most world -renowned herbs for promoting healthy digestion. It 
contains a phytochemical called api[INVESTIGATOR_733673] a number of health -promoting benefits, 
including promoting healthy cytokine balance. Chamomile is also antispasmodic, affecting 
the muscles of the intestine and promoting digestive comfort. Additionally, stress and mood 
have been proven to affect indigestion and i n clinical studies, Chamomile has shown 
support for relaxation and healthy mood. [3, 6 , 25, 26, 27 ] 
 
2.2. Scientific Rationale  
The test product’s  formulation is based on the most promising clinical research on natural 
ingredients  that safely impact digestive health  and relieve symptoms of occasional 
indigestion and heartburn . While the evidence to support the use of these individual active 
ingredients is growing, well -designed human clinical trials showing benefit are necessary to 
demonstrate efficacy of the test pr oduct’s unique formulation .  
The present study will include a minimum of  200 participant s who suffer from the 
symptoms of mild to moderate indigestion and/or heartburn and is designed to observe the 
level of symptom reduction in this population after consu ming the test product.   
 
2.2.1.  Potential Risk  
Minimal risk is foreseen for participant s through their participation in the study. All the 
ingredients composing the test product are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by [CONTACT_733704].  
The ingredients in th e test product have been shown to have some theoretical drug 
interactions which have been listed in the appendix.  (Appendix A ) 
Potential side -effects have been observed in high doses which are significantly greater 
than the dose of the capsules  as recommended in the instruction s for use:  
• Headache  
• Amenorrhea  
• Upset Stomach  
• Diarrhea  
• Hives  
• Difficulty breathing  
• Facial swelling  
11 
 • Drowsiness  
• Tiredness  
• Vomiting  
 
This study is determined by [CONTACT_733705] [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a Minimal Risk 
Study.  
Minimal risk is defined by 45 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46.102 (i) as follows:  
“Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.”  
Refer to : http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.[ADDRESS_1002485] questions answered before enrollment. Once an event occurs , review of symptoms 
will be ascertained at  onset,  15, 30, and 60  minutes. Reporting of adverse events will be 
reviewed routinely and in accordance with regulatory guidelines (21CFR, GCP) by [CONTACT_1268]. Participants with occurrence of worsening symptoms or adverse 
[ADDRESS_1002486],  may seek medical attention , and 
exit the study.  
 
3. Study Objectives  
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate 1) the impact of the test product on  
symptoms of occasional  indigestion  and h eartburn  in 200 adult participant s who suffer 
from occasional  indigestion and heartburn and 2) the subjective experience of these 
participants  related to general health, indigestion  and h eartburn symptoms, and personal 
experience with the test product.  
This will be evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints. These endpoints, the 
analysis populations, and their respective measures are described below. Further details on 
the methods for measuring the outcomes can be found in the Study Outcome Measures 
and Analysis Plan sections.  
 
 Primary En dpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint has two components, reduction in indigestion  severity and reduction 
in heartburn severity. Participants will be asked to rate each symptom  (bloating, early 
fullness during a meal, pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, burni ng in the upper 
abdomen, pain/burning in the center of your chest, nausea, vomiting, and burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  on a 4-
point scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the  test product, [ADDRESS_1002487] an individual’s quality of 
life, t he primary endpoint was chosen to see the  test product’s effects on symptoms. [1, 9, 
12] 
 
 Secondary Endpoint:  
 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed to evaluate safety  and patient satisfaction with relief  of 
symptoms . These include:  
 
● The time to other intervention will be analyzed . 
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
● Adverse events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
● The Net Promoter Score will be summarized and compared against outcomes .  
● Compariso n against normal behavior will use the paired sample t -test. 
[ADDRESS_1002488] meet additional inclusion/exclusion criteria (see 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria). Pa rticipant s will begin taking the capsules  at the onset of indigestion 
and heartburn  symptoms. Onset is defined as the point in time the participant take s the test 
product for relief of symptoms.  When the participant decides to take the test product, they will 
report  and rate their  symptoms  on a [ADDRESS_1002489]

supplementation (including all CBD products) other than the test product should be taken 
[ADDRESS_1002490]  on the start 
form in the platform . 
 
 
4.4. Data Collection  
All data in the present study will be self -reported by [CONTACT_733706] (Hawthorne Effect Study Visit Management System (HE VMS) ). Participants 
will be asked to take the test product according to the instructions for use, complete stud y 
surveys and respond to study reminders during the course of the study. The instructions for 
use and study forms  can be found in the appendix.  (Appendices B, D, E, F, G ) 
 
5. Study Population  
 
5.1. Selection of the Study Population  
The study population will consist of at least [ADDRESS_1002491] signed the study consent within 15 days and the total number of 
participants does not exceed 125% of the target  (either 200 or the recomputed target if 
recomputation has been performed.)   
In order to ensure an age and sex distribution that is reasonably representative of the US 
population, enrollment may be stopped early in some age and sex groups.  
Target population for this study are candidates who suffer from symptoms of  occa sional  indigestion  
and heartburn .  
Participants  will be enrolled from across the [LOCATION_002]. No participant s will be enrolled 
outside of the [LOCATION_002]. It is expected that the geographical distribution of the 
participant s enrolled in the study will correlate with the geographical distribution of the 
general population across the [LOCATION_002].  
Participant s will be recruited via digital advertisements and social media.   
 
After clicking on an advertisement, potential participant s will then be directed to a website where 
they will complete a screening questionnaire (See Appendix C ). The screening questionnaire will 
automatically qualify or disqualify them for study participation. If the participant  qualifies, they  will 
be provided  an informed consent. Upon completion of the informed consent they will be deemed 
enrolled in the study.  
 
 
5.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

consent will be prospectively enrolled in the study and provided a link to a patient  portal, which 
provides study resources. Participants will take the study formula at the onset of symptoms and 
provide information related  to symptoms of indigestion/heartburn during the follow -up period. A 
remote study coordinator may prompt participants to provide stud y information to ensure that the 
study forms are completed. Efforts will be taken to ensure minimal withdrawals and loss to follow -
up.  
 
6.4. Adverse Event and Safety Monitoring  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrences described by [CONTACT_114812].  All AEs will be self -reported and documented on the platform. The AEs will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_733708] [INVESTIGATOR_733679]. Partici pants who experience adverse events will be 
advised to seek medical attention.  
 
In the event that a participant experiences an adverse event, the clinical study manager or clinical 
ops coordinator will notify both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_80336]. The Sponsor will take  appropriate action 
according to their standard operating procedures for any adverse events that warrant action by [CONTACT_103].  
 
6.4.1.  Anticipated Adverse Events

study will be managed using an end to en d virtual clinical trial platform called Hawthorne Effect 
Study Visit Management Platform which is designed to make patient participation in clinical trials 
more accessible and as least burdensome as possible. The Hawthorne Effect platform 
(www.hawthorne -effect.com ) is GCP/ICH/21CFR and HIPAA compliant . Hawthorne Effect uses a 
network of specialty vetted and trained healthcare professionals, or HEROs who are study 
[ADDRESS_1002500] patient 
reported outcomes and to track screening, enrollment and study compliance.  
 
7. Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1. Study Outcomes Measures  
Analysis populations : 
The intent to treat  (ITT) population consists of all participants who are consented, report 
the onset of indigestion and heartburn , and have taken the study medication at least once. 
The primary analysis will be in the ITT population.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint has two components, reduction in indigestion  severity and reduction 
in heartburn severity. Participants will be asked to rate each symptom (bloating, early 
fullness d uring a meal, pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, burning in the upper 
abdomen, pain/burning in the center of your chest, nausea, vomiting, burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  on a 4 -point 
Likert scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the  test product, [ADDRESS_1002501]. The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each component and each time point. P -values will be 
computed for the improvement.  
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
Secondary endpoints will be gathered on the subjective experience of these participant s 
related to general health, personal experience with the test product. The secondary 
endpoints will be self -reported by [CONTACT_733710]. There will be a 
questionnaire related to general health and the subjective experience of the participant  
administered at baseline and at study exit .  
 
The purpose of the secondary analyses is to investigate the association between various 
baseline and other measurements and outcomes . These secondary analyses are considered 
hypothesis generating, and the descriptions are somewhat informal.  The trial data  may 
suggest secondary analyses not described here.  
 
Secondary endpoints:

 ● The time to other intervention will be analyzed . 
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
● Advers e events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
● The Net Promoter Score will be summarized and compared against outcomes .  
● Comparison against normal behavior will use the paired sample t -test. 
 
 
 
7.2. Sample Size Considerations  
Based on information from a variety of studies a highly pessimistic assumption is that there 
would be a mean improvement of 0.[ADDRESS_1002502] deviation of 1.5.  (These values refer 
to the 4 -point scale.) Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 97 participant s would 
result in a 90% power to detect an impro vement using the paired -sample t -test. If data from 
multiple incidents per participant  are useful, the power to detect an improvement would 
increase. The final sample size of [ADDRESS_1002503]. A 
longitudinal analysis will be performe d for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
 
General statistical methods : 
 
[ADDRESS_1002504] statistical methods, as further specified in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), which will be prepared in detail later.  
• Data analysis will largely consist of summary statistics and graphs. The only formal group 
comparisons will be in covariate analyses.  
• For continuous variables data presentation will consist of means, confidence intervals computed 
using the t-statistic, me dians, and interquartile ranges. Group comparisons will use t-tests or 
ANOVA . 
• For discrete variables confidence intervals will use the exact intervals, where available. Group 
comparisons will use Fisher’s exact test, with the Monte Carlo version used where  
computationally necessary.  
• For time to event variables analysis will use the Kaplan -Meier algorithm, and group comparisons 
will use the log -rank or proportional hazards methods, depending on the data type.   
• Visual analog scale values will be treated as continuous variables. Frequency counts will also be 
provided for scales with [ADDRESS_1002505] response levels.  
• Covariate analyses will investigate the relation between baseline and outcome variables, using 
methods appropriate to the data types involved . Age, gender, and baseline medications will be 
included in these analyses where appropriate data are available.  
• Present intention is that the analysis will be performed in R, and the precise form of algorithms 
will be the default of R. Kaplan -Meier, log -rank, and proportional hazards algorithms will be the 
defaults of the survival package.  
• The exact items to be compared depend on what is reported in each historical control study. 
When possible, the items will include symptom relief at each time measured, i ncluding within -
participant  p-values, and time to the lowest level on a [ADDRESS_1002506] 2 levels on 
a 10 -point scale. as well as reported baseline characteristics.  When two -arm studies are 
compared, both arms will be reported in this compar ison. In some studies,  only indigestion or 
heartburn will be reported; when both are reported they will be separated for the 
comparison.  Specific studies to be considered will be identified prior to the analysis of actual 
trial data.

13.1. 13.[ADDRESS_1002511] in the metabolism of certain drugs (which utilize the same 
enzymes it inhibits) , or other effects, such as estrogenic or diuretic effects . See Below for List.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro research shows that licorice extract and glabridin, a constituent found in the licorice 
species G. glabra , inhibit cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) isoenzymes ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). 
Licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  seems to inhibit CYP2B6 isoenzymes to a greater 
degree than G. glabra  extract in vitro ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might 
28 
 increase levels of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6; however, these interactions have not yet been 
reported in huma ns. Some drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6 include ketamine (Ketalar), 
phenobarbital, orphenadrine (Norflex), secobarbital (Seconal), rifampin (Rifadin), and 
dexamethasone (Decadron). Use licorice cautiously or avoid in patients taking these drugs.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice extracts from the species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 
(CYP2C19) isoenzymes in vitro ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase 
levels of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19; however, this interaction has not yet been reported in 
humans. Some drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19 include proton pum p inhibitors including 
omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and pantoprazole (Protonix); diazepam 
(Valium); carisoprodol (Soma); nelfinavir (Viracept); and others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice extract from the species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  inhibits cytochrome P450 2C8 
(CYP2C8) isoenzymes in vitro ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase 
levels of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8; however, this inter action has not yet been reported in 
humans. Some drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 include amiodarone (Cardarone), paclitaxel 
(Taxol); nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac (Cataflam, 
Voltaren) and ibuprofen (Motrin); rosiglitazone (Av andia); and others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
There is conflicting evidence about the effect of licorice on CYP2C9 enzyme activity . In vitro 
research shows that extracts from the licorice species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  moderately 
inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) isoenzymes ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). However, evidence from 
an animal model shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  can induce hepatic 
CYP2C9 activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. Until more is known, 
licorice should be used cautiously in people taking CYP2C9 substrates. Some drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 include celecoxib (Celebrex), diclo fenac (Voltaren), fluvastatin 
(Lescol), glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130] (Glucotrol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan 
(Cozaar), phenytoin (Dilantin), pi[INVESTIGATOR_18234] (Feldene), tamoxifen (Nolvadex), tolbutamide 
(Tolinase), torsemide (Demadex), and warfarin (Co umadin).  
CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
29 
 Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Pharmacokinetic research shows that the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin, taken in a dosage of 
150 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, modestly decre ases the area under the concentration -time 
curve of midazolam by [CONTACT_2902] 20%. Midazolam is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4). This suggests that glycyrrhizin modestly induces CYP3A4 activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Evidence from animal research also shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  
induces CYP3A4 activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). However, licorice extract from G. glabra  species appear to 
inhibit CYP3A4 -induced metabolism of testosterone in vitro. It is thought that the G. glabra  
inhibits CYP3A4 due to its constituent glabridin, which is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro  
and not present in other licorice species ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Until more is known, licorice should be 
used cautiously in people taking CYP3A4 substrates. Some drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 
include lovastatin (Mevacor), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cy closporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), 
diltiazem (Cardizem), estrogens, indinavir (Crixivan), triazolam (Halcion), and numerous 
others.  
ESTROGENS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Theoretically, licorice might interfere with estrogen therapy due to estrogenic and anti -
estrogenic effects ( 7860 ,[ZIP_CODE] ). 
MIDAZOLAM (Versed, others)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
In humans, the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin appears to moderately induce the metabolism of 
midazolam ( [ZIP_CODE] ). This is likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by [CONTACT_733714]. Until 
more is known, licorice should be used cautiously in people taking midazolam. .  
WARFARIN (Coumadin)  
Interaction Rating  = Major  Do not take this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice seems to increase metabolism and decrease levels of warfarin in an imal models. This is 
likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) metabolism by [CONTACT_733714] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Advise pati ents taking warfarin to avoid taking licorice.  
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
CARDIAC GLYCOSIDE -CONTAINING HERBS : Theoretically, the overuse or misuse of 
licorice can increase the risk of cardiotoxicity due to potassium depletion ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Cardioactive 
herbs include digitalis, lily -of-the-valley, pheasant's eye, and squill.  
 
STIMULANT LAXATIVE HERBS : Theoretically,  concomitant overuse or misuse of licorice 
30 
 with stimulant laxatives can increase the risk of potassium depletion ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Stimulant laxative 
herbs include aloe, alder buckthorn, black root, blue flag, butternut bark, colocynth, European 
buckthorn, fo ti, gamboge, gossypol, greater bindweed, jalap, manna, Mexican scammony root, 
rhubarb, senna, and yellow dock.

drugs . See Below for List.  
 
 
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Based on laboratory research, ginger is thought to inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease 
platelet aggregation ( 7622 ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). However, this has not been 
demonstrated unequivocally in humans, with mixed results from clinical trials ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Theoretically, excessive amounts of ginger might increase the risk of bleeding when used with 
anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. Some anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs include aspi [INVESTIGATOR_248], 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] (Ticlid), 
warfarin (Coumadin), and others.  
ANTIDIABETES DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Evidence from animal and human research suggests that ginger might incr ease insulin levels 
and/or decrease blood glucose levels ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). 
Theoretically, ginger might have an additive effect with antidiabetes drugs and cause 
hypoglycemia. Some antidiabetes drugs include glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, 
31 
 Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, metformin (Glu cophage), pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos), 
rosiglitazone (Avandia), and others.  
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Preliminary research suggests ginger might have hypotensive and calcium channel -blocking 
effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, ginger might have an additive effect with calcium channel 
blockers. Calcium channel blockers include nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Adalat, Procardia), verapamil (Calan,  
Isoptin, Verelan), diltiazem (Cardizem), isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (DynaCirc), felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Plendil), amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(Norvasc), and others.  
CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In an animal model, ginger juice taken 2 hours prior to cyclosporine administration reduced the 
maximum concentration a nd area under the curve of cyclosporine by 51.4% and 40.3%, 
respectively. This effect was not observed when ginger juice and cyclosporine were 
administered at the same time ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
METRONIDAZOLE (Flagyl)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combina tion.  
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In an animal model, ginger increased the absorption and plasma half -life of  metronidazole. In 
addition, the elimination rate and clearance of metronidazole was significantly reduced ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
NIFEDIPI[INVESTIGATOR_733682]  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that combined treatment with ginger 1 gram plus nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10 mg 
significantly inhibits platelet aggregation compared to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_733683] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
PHENPROCOUMON  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Phenprocoumon, a warfarin -related anticoagulant used in Europe, might increase the 
international normalized ratio (INR)  when taken with ginger. There is one case report of a 76 
32 
 year old woman with a stable INR on phenprocoumon that increased to greater than 10 when 
she began consuming dried ginger and ginger tea ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
WARFARIN (Coumadin)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Preliminary evidence suggests that ginger might inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease 
platelet aggregation ( 7622 ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). In one case report, ginger increased the 
INR when taken with phenprocoumon, which has similar pharmacological effects as warfarin 
([ZIP_CODE] ). In another case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with a combination of 
warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and acetaminophen ( [ZIP_CODE] ). A longitudinal analysis suggests 
that taking ginger increases the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin for at least 4 months 
([ZIP_CODE] ). However, research in healthy people suggests that ginger has no effect on INR, or the 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Until more is known, 
monitor INRs closely in patients taking significant amounts of ginger.  
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : Based on 
laboratory research, ginger is thought to inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease platelet 
aggregation ( 7622 ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). However, this has not been demonstrated 
unequivocally in humans with mixed results from clinical trials ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Concomitant use of 
ginger with other herbs that might affect platelet aggregation could theoretically increase the risk 
of bleeding in some people. These herbs include angelica, clove, danshen, garlic, ginkgo, Panax 
ginseng, red clover, turmeric , and others.  
 
HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL : Ginger might 
increase insulin levels and/or decrease blood glucose levels 
([ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, ginger might ha ve additive 
effects with herbs that decrease blood glucose levels. Herbs with hypoglycemic potential include 
devil's claw, fenugreek, guar gum, Panax ginseng, and Siberian ginseng.  
 
 
 
CHAMOMILE EXTRACT  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Chamomile . There are some theoretical

Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
There i's preliminary in vitro evidence that German chamomile might inhibit cytochrome P450 
2D6 (CYP2D6) ( [ZIP_CODE] ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in animals or humans. 
However, watch for an increase in the levels of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 in patients 
taking German chamomile. Some drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 include tric yclic 
antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) and amitriptyline (Elavil); antipsychotics such as 
haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), and chlorpromazine (Thorazine); beta -blockers 
such as propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol  XL), and carvedilol (Coreg); 
tamoxifen (Nolvadex); and others. Use German chamomile cautiously or avoid in patients 
taking these drugs.  
CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
There is preliminary evidence that suggests that German chamomile might inhibit the 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzymes ( 6450 ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, German chamomile 
might increase levels of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. However, so far, this interaction has 
not been reported in humans. Some drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 include lovastatin 
(Mevacor), ketoconazole (N izoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), fexofenadine (Allegra), triazolam 
(Halcion), and numerous others. Use German chamomile cautiously or avoid in patients taking 
these drugs.  
ESTROGENS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Theoretically, concomitant use of large amounts of German chamomile might interfere with 
hormone replacement therapy through competition for estroge n receptors ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
TAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D

 Theoretically, large doses of German chamomile might interfere with tamoxif en because of its 
potential estrogenic effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
WARFARIN (Coumadin)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Taking German chamomile and warfarin together might increase the effects of warfarin and 
increase the risk of bleeding. In one case, a 70 -year-old woman taking warfarin developed 
retroperitoneal hematoma and bilateral recti muscle bleeding along with an INR of 7.9 
following ingestion of German chamomile tea 4 -5 cups/day and use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_733686] -
based lotion applied 4 -5 times daily ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH SEDATIVE PROPERTIES : German chamomile has 
mild sedative effects. Theoretically, concomit ant use with herbs that have sedative properties 
might enhance therapeutic and adverse effects ( 9765 ,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Some of these supplements 
include [ADDRESS_1002512]. John's 
wort, scullcap, valerian, yerba mansa, and others.  
 
 
 
 
MARSHMALLOW ROOT EXTRACT  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for  Marshmallow Root Extract.  There are some 
theoretical Moderate Interactions, where Marshmallow Root may interact in the metabolism of 
certain drugs , have hypoglycemic, blood thinning, or diuretic effects which may also affect the 
activity of certain drugs . See Below for List.  
 
 
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Animal research suggests that marshmallow flower extract has antiplatel et effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Theoretically, concomitant use of marshmallow and anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs might lead 
to add itive anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects, potentially increasing the risk for bleeding in some 
patients.  
 
Some antidiabetes drugs include glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, 
Micronase), insulin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos), rosiglitazone (A vandia), and others.

Theoretically, marshmallow might have additive effects with hypoglycemic therapy ( 4). 
Monitor blood glucose levels closely. Dose adjustments to antidiabetes drugs may be necessary. 
Some antidiabetes drugs include glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, 
Micronase), in sulin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), and others.  
LITHIUM  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Marshmallow is thought to have diuretic properties. Theoretically, due to these potential diuretic 
effects, marshmallow might reduce excretion and increase levels of lithium. The dose of lithium 
might need to be decreased.  
ORAL DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
The mucilage in marshmallow might impair absorption of oral drugs ( 1,11,12,19). 
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : Animal research 
suggests that marshmallow flower extract has antiplatelet effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, 
concomitant use of marshmallow with herbs and supplements with anticoagulant/antiplatelet 
effects m ight increase the risk of bleeding in some people. These herbs include angelica, clove, 
danshen, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, Panax ginseng, red clover, turmeric, willow, and others.  
 
HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL : Animal research 
suggests t hat marshmallow may have hypoglycemic effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, marshmallow 
might have additive effects when used with other herbs and supplements with hypoglycemic 
potential. This might increase the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. Some herbs and 
supplements with hypoglycemic potential include alpha -lipoic acid, bitter melon, chromium, 
devil's claw, fenugreek, garlic, guar gum, horse chestnut, Panax ginseng, psyllium, Siberian 
ginseng, and others.

ABOUT THE STUDY  
 
Background  
 
Dyspepsia , also known as indigestion,  is a common symptom that can have many different 
causes. It occurs in about  [ADDRESS_1002532] functional dyspepsia , which means 
that there is no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation. People with this type of  dyspepsia 
usually describe feeling bloated , feeling full early during a meal , and/or  upper middle stomach  
pain/burning. Symptoms may be bad enough to limit usual activities. Some people may have 
nausea, vomiting, or heartburn; however, these symptoms are usually infrequent.  The most 
common  approach to treat occasional indigestion and heartburn is to use antacids to neutralize 
what is often be lieved to be an overproduction of stomach acid. This acid -blocking approach 
can perpetuate the problem when used over a long period of time. Acid blocking also has the

1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Administration of Intravenous Vitamin C in Novel Coronavirus Infection 
and Decreased Oxygenation  (AVOCADO)  
  
Study Des cription : A novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) has been  recently identified  to cause a 
new  respi[INVESTIGATOR_23715],  Coronavirus  disease -19 (COVID -19), and  declared 
pandemic by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) on March 11, 2020.   
 
While the current mortality rates are unknown, a certain percentage of 
COVID -19 patients develop the Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] 
(ARDS) leading to respi[INVESTIGATOR_330657] d death in high risk subjects such as 
elderly , and immunocompromised individuals.   
 
Previous research has shown that high dose intravenous vitamin C  (HDIVC)  
may benefit in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. However, it 
is not known  if early ad ministration of  HDIVC could prevent progression to 
ARDS.  
 
We hypothesize that intravenous administration of  HDIVC  is safe in COVID -
19 subjects  given early or late in the disease course  and may reduce the 
risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_330658].  
  
Objectives:  
 To assess the safety , tolerability, and efficacy of a 96 -hour intravenous 
vitamin C infusion protocol ( 50 mg/kg every 6 hours ) in patients with 
COVID -19 and evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517] .

2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy of intravenously infused ascorbic 
acid (HDIVC ) therapy for patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_408643] objective sign of 
worsening oxy genation, documented by [CONTACT_116659] S/F ratio  or decreased pulse oximetry at baseline, 
HDIVC  may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_330661]. We will also enroll patients already in respi[INVESTIGATOR_330662], therapy demonstrating that HDIVC  is safe in COVID -19 subjects early or late in the 
disease course. Due to the difficulty of running a study in a pandemic of highly infectious disease, we will 
use non-invasive measurements of deoxygenation , (i.e., Pulse Oximetry Saturation /Fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218686], SFR) as opposed to obtaining an arterial blood gas to calculate P aO2/FiO2 ratio. The S/F ratio has 
been correlated with ARDS in previous studies. By [CONTACT_330687] -free days, we can 
potentially signal efficacious endpoints  that could be used  in larger clinical trials needed  to answer a 
crucial therapeutic  question —can early administration of HDIVC  in COVID -19 lead to faster recovery  or 
improve outcomes ? Moreover, we will document change in inflammatory markers that are elevated in 
COVID -19 (d-dimer, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes,  and ferritin) to develop a mechanistic understanding and 
risk stratification of response to HDIVC  infusion. Ultimately, if HDIVC  is deemed safe in COVID -19 
subjects, a larger clinical trial will be urgently needed,  and AVOCADO will provide the framework t o 
quickly up -scale in  the context of an unprecedented pandemic and strain on health system s.  
 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
Brief Overview of COVID -19 Pandemic  
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were 
reported in Wuhan, China , and a novel coronavirus, severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2), was 
identified.1 The World Health Organization (WHO) designated 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_330663] (COVID -19) on 
February 12, 2020.[ADDRESS_408644] since 
characterized the COVID -19 clinical syndrome, ranging from 
asymptomatic/mild disease to severe disease leading to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_61160], acute -
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), multi -organ failure, sepsis, and 
death.3–5 On March 12, 2020, WHO declared COVID -19 a pandemic as 
the virus had spread to 6 continents, with outbreaks in China,  South 
Korea, Iran, Europe, and the [LOCATION_002]  (Figure 1) .6,7

Figure 2. Clinical Measures in Critically Ill COVID -19 Patients in Washington State.8 
While only a small percentage of COVID -19 patients develop severe 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], the predicted surge in patient volume is causing concern 
about access to int ensive -care unit (ICUs) and mechanical ventilators. Italy 
has already reached maximum capacity of ICU beds and early reports 
suggest rationing of ventilators in certain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330664].9–[ADDRESS_408645] deaths due to 
ARDS (Figure 2). A safe, effective, and inexpensive  therapy is urgently 
needed that can alter the n atural history of the disease process and reduce 
strain on health systems.  
Preliminary Data To Support the Use of HDIVC  in ARDS  
 
HDIVC  prevents pulmonary neutrophil infiltration in a feces -induced peritoni tis (FIP) model of 
sepsis /ARDS  (Figure 3).  
 
HDIVC has been proposed to have a pleotropic effect in ARDS14 (Table) , including acting as a stress 
hormone  (required for sy nthesis of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dopamine, vasopressin)15, improves endothelial 
function by [CONTACT_330688]16, promotes lymphocyt e maturation,17 and reduces 
cytokines driving inflammatory pathways in ARDS,18 including IL -6 in patients with pneumonia.19IL-6 is 
emerging as a key cytokine in COVID -19 pneumonia and ARDS and has been associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality.20

  11 In the same murine model of sepsis, blood was obtained by [CONTACT_330690]  (Figure 4) .  10 µl  of blood 
was plated on agar plates and colonies counted after overnight 
incubation.  HDIVC  treated mice had a highly significant decrease in 
colony counts compared to untreated mice (p< 0.01). Bronchoalveolar 
lavage in these mice also demonstrated an incr eased in alveolar 
protein content after induction of FIP and protection from HDIVC  
(data not shown).  
 
Human Data to Support the Safety and Efficacy of HDIVC  in Humans with S epsis /ARDS  
In the CITRIS -ALI study21, a multi -center, randomized, double 
blind placebo controlled trial, ARDS patients  resulting from  
sepsis  who received HDIVC  (at 50 mg/kg  every 6 hours for 4 
days, n=84) had high er ventilator -free days at day 28 than 
placebo though not significant  (Figure 5) . However, CITRIS -ALI 
showed that 
patients treated 
with HDI VC had 
significantly 
more ICU free da ys at day 28 
than placebo. (Figure 5)  and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330669] 60 
(Figure 6)  found that 
patients receiving vitamin C 
had a higher number of ICU 
free days at day 28 and a higher  show a statistically significant reduction in 
mortality and ICU -free days at 28 days in ARDS subjects receiving HDIVC  
compared to placebo. Further trials are currently in the planning and enrolling phase for HDIVC  in sepsis 
and ARDS. A recent trial using the trio of lower dosage vitamin C  plus thiamine  and hydrocortisone 
(VITAMINS) did not show improvement in time alive or vasopressor free days in a multicenter, 
randomized, open -label trial. However, this trial gave a lower dose of HDIVC  than CITRIS -ALI, was open -
label, and not in an ARDS -specific cohort.22 Further more,  patients treated with HDIVC showed a 
significantly decre ased organ failure as assessed by [CONTACT_330691] (SOFA) 
(Figure 7).  Most importantly, the CITRIS -ALI trial found that patients treated with HDIVC had a 
significantly improved survival at days 28 (Figure 8). Thus with the clin ical data in patients with acute 
lung injury (ARDS) we have justification to proceed with the application of HDIVC in COVID -19 positive 
patients.

Ascorbic acid is known to artefactually raise POC blood glucose readings by [CONTACT_330692]. However, it does not raise blood glucose readings from a basic metabolic panel or 
glucose results using the gas lab.  Thus, extreme care must be taken to assure an accurate blood glucose 
level from a metabolic laboratory (BMP) or arterial bloo d gas panel before initiating any insulin therapy, 
including sliding scale or scheduled insulin.  
 
Inpatient units not using the StatStrip POC glucometer should follow these guidelines:  
Guidance for blood glucose monitoring in patients enrolled this study:  
• Critical Care and Inpatient Unit Nursing and  Treating  Physician must be informed of vitamin C’s 
effect on point of care (glucometer) blood glucose and arterial blood gas glucose point of care 
values.  The PI(s) will instruct the ordering providers about h ow to monitor blood glucose and 
insulin management in the study.

  13 • In-service training will be documented in the Study Training Log  
• Bold signage will be displayed on all study instructions, data collection forms, and at the 
patient’s head of bed, stating : 
❖ STOP! Do not use Accuchek or other Point of Care devices to measure glucose on this 
patient  
❖ Use only metabolic or gas lab glucose screening methods  
❖ This patient is enrolled in a study with Vitamin C, which artefactually increases POC glucose 
testing  
❖ Do N ot Initiate or Utilize Sliding Scale, Scheduled Insulin, or Continuous Insulin Infusion 
Without Laboratory Confirmation of Blood Glucose  
• Those receiving insulin infusion or sliding scale insulin as a part of standard of care will have 
metabolic glucose screening on the schedule determined by [CONTACT_124268] /ordering  physician  
• Blood glucose monitoring for insulin administration guidance should only be by a metabolic or 
blood gas laboratory measured blood glucose results, whether  or not  the study patient is 
receiving insulin  
• Study personnel will follow each study patient closely to monitor insulin use to ensure that point 
of care glucose screening is suspended for the research subject.  
• Point of care glucose testing may resume [ADDRESS_408648] reported significant  Vitamin C -related 
toxicity.  An animal model of acute lung injury with intravenous LPS and feces induced peritonitis 
demonstrate significantly less lung injury with Vitamin C, which may result in shortening the time 
patients require mechanical ventilation . 
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The identifiable risks arising from exposure to intravenous ascorbic acid infusion are low . Given the low 
risk associated with ascorbic acid infusion and the potential high likelihood of benefit we assess the 
risk/benefit ratio to be low (i.e., that benefit far outweighs risk).  
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION  FOR ENDPOINTS  
Primary    
 
Vitamin C infusion will be safe and 
tolerable in COVID -19 subjects  Documented side effects and 
serious adverse events at hours

mouth, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, 
headache, flushing, rash, diarrhea. 
HDIVC  can be excreted from kidney 
and lead to crystalluria, so will 
monitor urine pH via urinalysis.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Up to  20 subjects with COVID -19 and decreased oxygenation will  receive Vitamin C  (sterile L -ascorbic 
acid for injection at 200 mg/kg per 24 hours with entire calculated 24-hour  dose diluted in 200 ml of 5% 
dextrose in water ). One fourth of the [ADDRESS_408649] objective sign of worsening oxygenation, documented by S/F ratio, decreased pulse oximetry at 
baseline, HDIVC  may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_330661], which is critical in a pandemic when ventilators, ICU beds, and medical staff may be in short 
supply. We will also enroll patients already in respi[INVESTIGATOR_330675] -
free days,  demonstrating proof of concept  that COVID19 patients with ARDS may have similar recovery 
compared to sepsis -induced ARDS in other HDIVC  clinical trials . 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
Dosing and bio -distr ibution data in humans show that pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C can 
only be attained follow ing intravenous administration.  Dosage selection for this trial was determined 
both from animal modeling, examining the biological effectiveness in a lu ng injury model system and 
from the recently conducted randomized double -blind  phase I human sepsis safety trial.25 The 200 
mg/kg/ 24-hour IV  dosing protocol was determined from quantification of plasma ascorbate levels and 
from assessing the impact on SOFA scores. Fur ther, the dosage was selected following observation of 
the 200 mg/kg/ 24-hour  regimen on biomarker levels.  
 
 
 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.[ADDRESS_408650].  All subjects will be followed to day 28 for collection of outcomes data even 
though the study intervention will be completed by 96 hours from enrollment.

8. Pregnancy  
9. Enrolled in another COVID -19 clinical trial that does not allow concomitant  study drugs  
 
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
Not applicable to this study.  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently enrolled in  the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants , to meet the 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  16 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  Subjects  will be documented in the Study 
Screening Log when all Inclusion Criteria are met.   
 
Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of 
exclusion criteria such as  failure to obtain consent, inability to locate the legally authorized 
representative ( LAR), or delay in diagnosis  may be rescreened. Rescre ened participants should be 
assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Patients with COVID -19 will be recruited from the Emergency Department  (ED) , the medicine inpatient , 
and the intensive care units (ICU) at Central Virginia VA Health System in Richmond, Virginia (RICVA) . 
RICVA  is a large tertiary care medical center with a large referral base . Study personnel will review 
patients within the  electronic medical record  to id entify potential candidates for enrollment. Permission 
to approach patients and/or their families will be requested from the attending physicians in charge of 
patient care in the ED, inpatient unit , or the ICU. All patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will 
be approached with a consent and will be entered into a screening log. If the patient is not enrolled, the 
screening log will include information explaining why enrollment did not occur (exclusion criteria, 
attending physician denial, patient  refusal, etc.).  
 
For this study, we will not exclude subjects enrolled in other COVID -19 clinical trials as obtaining safety 
data of interactions with other medications has clinical merit. We will track all COVID -19 related 
medications given during this study, including a category for “other”. Subjects may be excluded from 
this study if other COVID -19 trials do not allow concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330677] -19 treatments in protocol with or without washout phase. The IRB will be infor med of initial 
enrollment and study investigators will follow IRB recommendations when multiple experimental 
studies are available to subjects.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_408652] an 
availab le administration time beyond this delay, a dedicated new line (peripheral or central) could  be 
inserted  depending on judgment of attending physician.  
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  17 1) First study drug dose  (L-ascorbic acid) will be considered “Dose 1” and will b e administered within [ADDRESS_408653] any clinically indicated procedure which 
requires the patient to be off the unit. All doses will be administered in the medicine inpatient unit 
or ICU.  Patients receiving vitamin C will receive 25% of the total daily c alculated dosing 
(200mg/kg/24 hours) and will be infused over [ADDRESS_408654] dosing.  
2) Subsequent doses  which represent 25% of the day’s total dose will be infused every six hours 
through 96 hours (+/ - 6 hours).  
a) Timing of Dose 2 will be triggered  by [CONTACT_330693]  6-hour administration and will 
therefore be listed on the bedside MAR.  As such, timing of Dose 2 may be out of the +/ - 6 hour 
window and will not trigger a protocol deviation.  
b) If for any reason any other maintenance dose i s not administered within window, the dose will 
be skipped and the next scheduled dose will be given and documented in the data collection 
tool.  
 
6.2 PREPARATION/H ANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION  AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
VA Investigational Drug  and/or  VA Inpatient Pharmacy  will coordinate acquisition of sterile L -ascorbic 
acid for infusion from the manufacturer.  
 
6.2.2  FORMULATION, APPEARANCE, PACKAGING, AND LABELING  
ASCOR  vials contain 25,000 mg /50mL  of ascorbic acid and is supplied as pharmacy bulk packaging (PBP). 
The diluted ASCOR solution should appear colorless to pale yellow.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_408655] STORAGE AND STABILITY  
ASCOR is light sensitive so light exposure should be minimized  and stored per package insert 
instructions : 
 
Store under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C); protect from light with amber IV bag cover. Infusion solutions 
prepared by [CONTACT_330694][INVESTIGATOR_220886] [ADDRESS_408656]. Alpha Fowler has unpublished data that was 
obtained prior to an earlier IND  trial (IND #113856) which demonstrates the stability of samples 
prepared in the same manner as described  below.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_408657] remains stable with 
no quantifiable oxidation.  
 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  18 Study drug will be pre pared in 50 ml D5W bags , USP,  using aseptic technique according to USP 
797requirements.  All ASCOR pharmacy bulk package vials utilized will be discarded within 4 hours or 
sooner as per the ASCOR package insert.  
 
The volume of ascorbic acid to be added to the IV bag will be calculated. This same amount of fluid will 
be drawn out of the D5W 50 mL bag and discarded.  Then, the calculated volume of ascorbic acid will be 
added to the IV bag.  As much air as possible will be removed from the IV bag using an empt y syringe 
with needle attached (in order to prevent oxidation).  The IV bag will be covered with a light -protective 
shroud.   
 
Microbiologic Controls:

8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
 
Assessment of hepatic safety: We will follow the current guidance from FDA for assessment of liver 
safety in those with pre -existing hepatic impairment. Evaluation of Drug Induced Severe Hepatitis 
(eDISH): eDISH plots will be overlayed from drug treated arms at the end of the study to look for  DILI 
signals. Those cases with bilirubin > 3x ULN and ALT > 8x ULN will be studied individually and adjudicated 
for DILI. These data will be provided for concordance to IRB . 
 
For individual cases, the following rules will be followed for drug discontinuat ion for DILI:  
 
If AST or ALT rise by > 50% from baseline but  are less than 8 times the upper limit of normal and this is 
associated with less than 3 mg/dl rise in bilirubin, a hepatic panel will be repeated within [ADDRESS_408662] and ALT continue to rise >100 IU/L over 24 hours or bilirubin rises by >3 mg/dl, the study drug 
will be discontinued . 
 
If AST or ALT exceed 8 times the upper limit of normal at any time or bilirubin rises by 3 or more mg/dl 
from baseline within a 48 -hour time frame, the study drug will be discontinued.   
 
Assessment of infusion safety: If the subject has clinically significant side effects based on the L -ascorbic 
acid package insert, the infusion will be stopped, the primary provider and PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718].  
 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.[ADDRESS_408663] common adverse reactions are pain and swelling at the site of inf usion. Nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, facial flushing, rash, headache, fatigue, or disturbed sleep can rarely occur. If clinically 
significant  symptoms occur during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped, and subsequent doses 
reduced by 50% (100 mg/kg/day  for 16 total doses). If symptoms continue at reduced dose, then the 
study drug will be discontinued.  
 
If development of severe acute kidney injury (increase  in serum creatinine 3.0 times baseline) with 
urinalysis show ing evidence of oxalate nephropathy (new onset proteinuria, hematuria, or oxalate 
crystals) , or kidney biopsy with oxalate crystal deposition in tubules or interstitium , then the infusion 
will be discontinued, and treatment started for oxalate nephropathy. A recently published systemic 
review  found 5 cases of oxalate nephropathy in 2,360 HDIVC subjects , and all occurred at 3 times higher 
doses (60 grams /day or higher)26 than described in protocol section 6.1.2.  
 
If hemolysis is suspected based on reduction in hemoglobin  by >2 gram s from baseline with laboratory 
evidence of hemolysis (increased reticulocyte count, elevated LDH, indirect bilirubin, reduced 
haptoglobin ), the study drug will be discontinued, and treatment initiated as needed.  
 
If the patient is started on an insulin drip or it is deemed medically necessary to monitor blood glucose 
more than every 6 hours, then study infusion  will be discontinued .  
 
These events will be documented in the SAE form, AE form and CRF form after grading by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_330680] 8.3.  
 
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered interventi on-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse re action is considered "serious" if, in the view of  the 
investigator (s), it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congeni tal anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, or be life -threatening, may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical 
interv ention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
The following subsections will include a discussion of how AEs will be classified.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  23  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incap acitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not n ecessarily equate to “serious”  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_330697]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is e vidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternat e etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The Principal and Sub -Investigator s will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is 
expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study mo nitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All  AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an as sessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of

AVoCaDO  Version 6.[ADDRESS_408664] all reportable events with start dates occurrin g any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study

last visit.  Events w ill be followed for outcome information unt il resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_408665] clinical occurrences , or disease -related events (DREs)  that are expected in the 
course of COVID -19 include: 1) transient or worsening hypoxemia, 2) agitation, 3) delirium, 4) diarrhea, 
5) nosocomial infections, 6) skin breakdown, 7) acute hepatitis, 8) acute kidney injury  that may require 
renal replacement therapy , 9) worsening of cardiopulmonary  function  that may require artificial 
cardiopulmonary  support, 10) worsening hypotension that may require vasopressor support, and 1 1) 
acute thrombosis or coagulopathy . Such events, which are often the focus of prevention efforts as part 
of usual ICU care, will not be considered reportable adverse events unless the event is considered by [CONTACT_330698], or unexpectedly severe or frequent for 
an individual patient with sepsis and A RDS. Examples of unexpectedly frequent untoward clinical 
occurrences would be repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_330681] a. This would be in contrast to an 
isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_330682] (e.g., Sp02 ~85%), related to positioning or suctioning.  This

assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. 
Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there  is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the IRB. 
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed unti l satisfactory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable . 
 
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  25 The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria  from the time of consent to through study hour [ADDRESS_408667] to follow up : 
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protoc ol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experienc e, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known o r recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing IRB. The UP report will 
include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 48 hours  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 5 business  days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within 5 business  days  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of 
the problem from the investiga tor. 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  FOR PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Not applicabl e to this study.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
We will aim to enroll 20 patients to establish safety data and consider an amendment to the protocol for 
additional enrollment based on COVID -19 cases and further evaluation of secondary endpoints.  
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  26  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
We will stratify subjects for secondary analysis into subjects with mild decreased oxygenation, 
defined as SaO2 <95% on room air upon admission or requiring supplemental oxygenation and 
SFR ≥ 250. subjects with severe decreased oxyge nation  will be defined as SFR <250.  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
Continuous variables will be compared across groups using Student’s T -test, ANOVA , or a Kruskal Wallis 
ANOVA depending on their distribution. Changes from baseline to time of measurement will be 
compared by [CONTACT_144406]. Categorical variables will be measured by [CONTACT_3493]’s Exact test. 
Correlations will be assessed by [CONTACT_4532]’s coefficient.  The Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test will be applied to 
determine normality. Parametric dependent means will be compared with paired Student’s T -test and 
non-parametric means will be analyzed using Wilcox on signed -rank test. 95% confidence intervals will 
be calculated and a p value of <0.[ADDRESS_408668] analysis.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The primary endpoint will  be treatment related adverse events at end of study drug infusion, as defined 
in 9.4.3 . Subjects will be stratified into two cohorts: mild deoxygenation and severe deoxygenation. 
Descripti ve statistics will be applied.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_408669] terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). Adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_330699] -preferred 
term, start and stop date and time, study day, duration, severity, relationship to study drug, and 
seriousness. Additionally, data may be grouped for analysis by [CONTACT_330700]. 
The incidence of AEs, the incidence  of treatment - related AEs, and the severity of A Es will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_9084] ( mild versus severe deoxygenation ). The number and percentage of patients with SAEs and 
treatment -related SAEs and patients who withdraw due to an AE will be tabulated . 
 
Clinic al Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory test parameters will be listed for individual patients. Baseline for clinical laboratory 
parameters will be defined as the last evaluation before the start of the initial dosing with study drug. 
Summary statistics,  including mean absolute change from baseline, will be calculated for each 
parameter and summarized.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs results (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate , pulse oximetry, and body 
temperature) will be listed for individual pa tients. Each vital sign measure will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_330701]. Baseline for vital signs measurements will be defined as the last evaluation before 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.[ADDRESS_408670] previously reported 
with intravenous Vitamin C based on the package insert  will be recorded daily, including dizziness, 
headache, nausea, vomiting , flushing, rash, or diarrhea.  Physicians managing COVID -19 subjects will be 
listed as sub -investigators and amendments may be made to add investigators to protocol in order to 
limit research activities and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE).  
 
10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPER ATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCED URES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-appr oved and the participant  will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  participant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing . The participant s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant  will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Participant s must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participant s for their records. 
The informed  consent process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participan t undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights 
and welfare of the participant s will be protected by [CONTACT_21223].  
 
Many of the patients approached for participation in this research protocol will have limitations of 
decision -making abilities due to their critical illness. Hence, most patients will not be able to provide 
informed consent.  Accordingly, informed consent will be sought from the potential subject’s legally 
authorized representative.  
 
AVoCaDO  Version 6.0 
Protocol 001  7 July 2020  
  28 Regarding proxy consent, the existing federal research regulations (‘the Common Rule’) state at  
45 CFR 46.116 that: “no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research…unless the 
investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject’s le gally 
authorized representative”; and defines at 45 CFR 46 102 (c) a legally authorized representative (LAR) 
as: “an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a 
prospective subject to the subject’s partici pation in the procedures(s) involved in the research.”  OHRP 
defined examples of “applicable law” as being state statutes, regulations, case law, or formal opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] 
a State Attorney General that addresses the issue of surrogate consent to medical procedu res.  Such 
“applicable law” could then be considered as empowering the surrogate to provide consent for subject 
participation in the research.  
 
According to a previous President’s Bioethics Committee (National Bioethics Advisory Committee), an 
investigato r should accept as an LAR…a relative or friend of the potential subject who is recognized as an 
LAR for purposes of clinical decision making under the law of the state where the research takes place. 
Finally, OHRP has opi[INVESTIGATOR_299360] a surrogate could serve as a LAR for research 
decision making if such an individual is authorized under applicable state law to provide consent for the 
“procedures” involved in the research study.  
 
According to the Belmont Report, respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions; first, 
that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished 
autonomy are entitled to protection. One method that serves to protect subjects is restrictions on the 
participation of subjects in research that presents more than minimal risks. Commentators and Research 
Ethics Commission have held the view that it is permissible to include incapable subjects in research that 
involves more than minimal risk as long as ther e is the potential for beneficial effects and if the research 
presents a balance of risks and expected direct benefits similar to that available in the clinical setting.  
Several U.S. task forces have deemed it is permissible to include incapable subjects in research.  For 
example, the American College of Physicians’ document allows surrogates to consent to research 
involving incapable subjects only “if the net additional risks of participation are not substantially greater 
than the risks of standard treatm ent.”  Finally, the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) stated 
“that an IRB may approve a protocol that presents greater than minimal risk but offers the prospect of 
direct medical benefits to the subject, provided that…the potential subject’s LAR  gives permission…”  
 
Consistent with the above ethical sensibilities regarding the participation of decisionally incapable 
subjects in research and the previous assessment of risks and benefits in the previous section, the 
present trial presents a balance of risks and potential direct benefits that is similar to that available in 
the clinical setting, with the exception of the additional blood draws.  
 
In this study, consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_25963] -19 RICVA providers in order to limit risk of exposure 
to non -essential staff. The providers are listed as sub -investigators in the study and include experts in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65303], infectious disease, and pulmonary/critical care. Providers will be educated on 
consent process and additional providers may be adde d to protocol via amendment process. The 
consent form itself will either kept in the subject’s room until discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] a digital 
photograph may be obtained in order to limit spread of COVID -19. Infectious disease and epi[INVESTIGATOR_330683], which may be updated by 
[CONTACT_330702].  If informed consent is obtained via telephone or virtual meeting, then a 
witness not related to study team will be present to listen to conversa tion and sign ICF. All study 
participants who are consented via telephone or virtual meeting will be offered a physical consent form 
to be signed via fax or mail.

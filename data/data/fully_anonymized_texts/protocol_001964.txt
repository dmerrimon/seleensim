In general, the purpose of the Statistical Analys is Plan (SAP) is to provide a framework that 
addresses the protocol objectives  in a statistically rigorous fa shion, with minimized bias or 
analytical deficiencies.  Specifically , this plan has the following purpose: 
To prospectively (a priori) outline the types of analyses and data presentations that addresses 
the study objectives outlined in the protocol, and to explain in  detail how the data will be 
handled and analyzed, adhering to comm only accepted standards and practices of 
biostatistical anal ysis in the pharmaceutical industry. 
1.[ADDRESS_1285787] histologically-
confirmed CD30-positive (CD30+) cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) by [CONTACT_914791].  Patients are to be stratified by [CONTACT_637]:  
primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lym phoma (pcALCL) or mycosis fungoides (MF), 
and randomized to treatment with brentuxi mab vedotin monotherapy (Arm 1) up to 16 
cycles total (48 weeks), or methotrexate (MTX ) or bexarotene per physician’s choice (Arm 
2) up to a total of [ADDRESS_1285788] 4 months (ORR4), per inde pendent review facility (IRF) 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_914792] (G RS), which consists of skin evaluation 
(mSWAT assessment), nodal and visceral ra diographic assessment, and detection of 
circulating Sézary cells (MF only).  Complete response (CR) or part ial response (PR) per 
GRS will be confirmed by [CONTACT_914793].  All randomized patients wi ll be followed for survival every 12 weeks for 
a minimum of 24 months after the EOT vis it, and then every 6 months until patient 
withdrawal, death, or study closure.   
Patients with a documented PR or CR at the e nd of Cycle 3 and at any disease assessment 
thereafter may continue treatment with study drug for up to 16 cycles with brentuximab 
vedotin or 48 weeks with bexarotene or met hotrexate; patients with stable disease may 
continue therapy at the discreti on of the investigator.  Patients  with progressive disease (PD) 
at any time during the study will be disconti nued from study treatment.  Patients with 
increasing mSWAT before assessment at the en d of Cycle 3 will be allowed to continue 
therapy until the Cycle 3 assessment if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the findings are due to 
tumor flare rather than disease progression.

The exploratory objectives include: 
2.    POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSIS 
2.1    Intent-to-Treat Population
 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) popul ation will include all patient s identified as CD30+ by [CONTACT_914794]30 (Ber-H2) assay and randomized to  treatment.  All patients in the ITT 
population will be analyzed accord ing to the treatment they were randomized to receive and 
not according to what they act ually received, if different. 
The ITT population will be used for the prim ary efficacy analysis and analyses on all 
efficacy endpoints unless specified otherwise. 
2.2    All-Enrolled Population 
The All-Enrolled population will include all pati ents randomized to treatment.  All patients 
in the All-Enrolled population will be analyz ed according to the treatment they were

3.1    Statistical Hypotheses 
The primary null hypothesis to be tested is th at the proportion of patients achieving ORR4 
per IRF is not different between the brentu ximab vedotin (BV) treatment group and the 
physician’s choice treatment group (MTX or bexarotene); i.e., 
H0:  ORR4 BV = ORR4 Control  
The alternative hypothesis is that ORR4 per IR F in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group 
is higher than that of the physician’s choice group, i.e., 
HA:  ORR4 BV > ORR4 Control 
The key secondary hypotheses to be tested include: 
 CR rate per IRF is not different between  the brentuximab vedotin treatment group 
and the physician’s choice treatment group. 
 PFS is not different between the brentuximab vedotin treatment group and the 
physician’s choice treatment group. 
 Changes in symptom domain per the Ski ndex-29 assessment tool are not different 
between the brentuximab vedotin trea tment group and the physician’s choice 
treatment group. 
3.2    Statistical Decision Rules 
The primary null hypothesis will be tested at a type I error rate of 0.05 (2 sided).  We will 
conclude that brentuximab vedotin treatment can significantly improve the ORR4 compared 
to the physician’s choice (MTX or bexarotene) in patients with CD30+ CTCL if the ORR4 
for the brentuximab vedotin treatment group is st atistically significantly higher than that of 
the physician’s choice treatment group in the pr imary efficacy analysis (refer to Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). 
A fixed sequential testing proce dure will be used to test be tween the primary endpoint and 
the key secondary endpoints; that is, the key secondary endpoints will be tested only if the 
primary endpoint is stat istically significant.  
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Study C25001 
Confidential 11To test the key secondary endpoint s, a weighted Holm procedure(1) will be used.  The 
weighted Holm testing procedure is applied at the final analysis at the 0.05 level (2-sided) 
with weights:  0.7, 0.2, and 0.1 for CR, PFS, and the symptom domain of the Skindex-29, 
respectively.  Once the unad justed 2-sided p-values 3 , 2 , 1  ,i pi  [INVESTIGATOR_914789], q-values 3 , 2 , 1  ,i qi  are calculated by [CONTACT_81821] p-values with their respective 
weights

icpq , where c i is the weight for endpoint i, i = 1,2,3.  Then the ordered q-values,

for endpoints corresponding to ] 1 [ ] 1 [ ,...,iq q .  If i = 1, then no endpoint is significant, and if i 
does not exist, then all endpoints are significant. 
Assuming that the probabilities of success for the endpoints are 0.85, 0.55, and 0.50 with a 
0.05 (2-sided) individual alpha level and a multiv ariate normal distribution with an equal 
correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_1285791] 1 significant endpoint is 
84%, and the powers to show significance for CR, PFS, and the symptom domain of the 
Skindex-29 using the weighted Holm me thod are 82%, 48%, and 40%, respectively. 
The weighted Holm testing procedure controls  the type I error unc onditionally.  The impact 
on power has been evaluated through simulation for a range of corre lation and/or success 
probability assumptions.  Holding the success probabilities as assumed, the power to detect at least 1 significant endpoint decreases from 89% to 81% when correlation between 
endpoints increases from 0.[ADDRESS_1285792] 1 significant endpoint increases from 79% to 88% when probabilities of success for 
all 3 endpoints increases from 0.8, 0. 5, and 0.45 to 0.9, 0.6, and 0.55, respectively. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints are tested  at the 0.05 level, and the key secondary 
endpoints are gated by [CONTACT_53229].  Du e to the sequential pr ocedure property, the 
overall type I error rate for testing the primary and key s econdary endpoints is strongly 
controlled at the 0.05 level.

4.1    Interim Analysis 
There will be no interim efficacy analysis.   
4.2    Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC ) will be established to review safety 
data periodically per the IDMC charter.  The fi rst formal safety review will occur after 
approximately [ADDRESS_1285793] patient is randomized  (whichever comes first).   
Detailed information regarding the composition of the IDMC and IDMC procedures will be 
provided in the IDMC charter. 
 
5.    STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY 
In general, summary tabulations will be presented that display the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and 
the number and percentage (of nonmissing) per category for categorical data, unless 
specified otherwise.   
5.1    Sample Size Justification 
Approximately 124  patients (approximately 62 patients per treatment arm) will be 
randomized to the study (124 patients are targeted for the ITT population).  The sample size 
was calculated to provide 90% power to de tect a 30% improvement in ORR4 in the 
brentuximab vedotin treatment group, assuming ORR4 for the MTX or bexarotene alone 
treatment group is 40%.  This cal culation is based on a 2-sided [ADDRESS_1285794] with a significance 
level of  = 0.05, and a 10% dropout rate using nQ uery Advisor 7.0.  A minimum of 30 
patients (15 per treatment arm) with pcALCL will be included in the study.   
5.2    Randomization and Stratification  
The randomization scheme will be genera ted by [CONTACT_20555].  Before dosing, a 
randomization number will be assigned to each patient.  The randomization schedule will 
also include the study-specific identifiers (company name, protocol name, and protocol 
number) and the date and time the schedule was generated.

Patients will be randomized to receive study treatment, either brentuximab vedotin or 
bexarotene or MTX.  
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered by [CONTACT_914798] (IV) infusion given 
over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 of each  21-day cycle.  The dose of brentuximab 
vedotin is 1.8 mg/kg.  Study treatment will be administered through a dedicated IV line and 
cannot be mixed with other medications.  De tails on the dosing of study drug can be found 
in the protocol. MTX will be given once weekly as a single dose of [ADDRESS_1285796] not exceed 50 mg/week.  
Once optimal clinical response is achieved, the MTX dosage should be  decreased to the 
lowest effective dose.  For patients deriving benefit, MTX dosing should be continued up to 
48 weeks.   
The recommended initial dose of bexarotene capsules is 300 mg/m
2/day.  Bexarotene 
capsules should be taken as a single oral da ily dose with a meal.  Bexarotene capsules 
should be continued as long as the patient is de riving benefit, up to 48 weeks.  All patients 
(with normal or normalized triglyceride levels ) who are to be given bexarotene should 
receive 7 days of pretherapy with fenofibrate  145 to 200 mg daily starting from Cycle 1 Day 
1 (i.e., the initial dose of bexarote ne starts on Day 8 of Cycle 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]    Extent of Exposure  
The exposure to study drug will be characterized by [CONTACT_914799], total 
number of dose taken, number of treated cycles, duration of treatment, numbers and 
percentages of patients in trea ted cycle categories (1, 2…,16), a nd dose intensity (mg/week).  
Dose intensity (mg/week) will be calculated as  total dose administered (mg)/(3 * number of 
treated cycles) where a treat ed cycle is defined as a 21-day period during which the patient 
received any amount of brentuximab vedotin  (scheduled for a single dose in a 21-day cycle), 
MTX (single weekly dose) , or bexarotene (single oral daily dose).  The duration of treatment 
is defined as time from the first study dose to [ADDRESS_1285797] study dose ([last dose date + 
21] – first dose date) of brentuximab vedotin , or time from the first study dose to [ADDRESS_1285798] study dose ([last dose date + 7] – first dose date) of MTX, or  time from the first study 
dose to [ADDRESS_1285799] study dose ([last dose date + 1] – first dose date) of bexarotene .

but otherwise meet the primary endpoint criter ia will be excluded.  For objective response, a 
patient must achieve a CR or PR. The objective response will be considered maintained for 
patients with a previous CR who experience r ecurrent disease (i.e. Relapse) unless the 
criteria for progressive disease are met. Determination of objective response will be based

GRS will be determined by [CONTACT_914802] 3, EOT, and at 
post treatment follow-up visits until disease progression, death or study closure.  The GRS 
assessment at each cycle will inco rporate the skin response at that cycle as well as the most

response and [ADDRESS_1285802] confirmed skin response.  For patients with baseline 
nodal/viscera/blood involvement, GRS assessment at each cycle will incorporate the skin 
response at that cycle as well as nodal, visceral, and blood responses based upon the most recent respective compartment assessments prior to the GRS assessment time point. Blood results should be within [ADDRESS_1285803] scans should also be within 3 cycles for patients

Confidential [IP_ADDRESS]    Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint, ORR4 per IRF, will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test stratified by [CONTACT_914795]  (pcALCL or MF) based on the ITT population.  
The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the differe nce in ORR4 between the [ADDRESS_1285804] no 
response before dropout, will be counted as nonresponders. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for O RR per IRF in the study as well as ORR4 per 
IRF defined by [CONTACT_914806] 2010.(2)  Analysis for ORR4 per IRF defined by [CONTACT_914807].  Sensitivity analyses will 
be performed for ORR and ORR4 based on investigator’s GRS assessment as well. 
Another sensitivity analysis will be conducte d for ORR4 per IRF in the ITT population to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis’s use of most recently available CT scans and 
blood assessments for GRS.  For patients with baseline nodal/visceral /blood disease, the 
sensitivity analysis will only use GRS a ssessed at time points with concurrent 
nodal/viscera/blood component assessments as specified in the protocol SOE while for 
patients with skin-only disease, the analysis will use the same GRS assessment frequency as 
the primary analysis.    
[IP_ADDRESS]    Other Analysis 
The same analysis on ORR4 per IRF using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by 
[CONTACT_914795] (pcALCL and MF ) will be performed for the All-Enrolled

investigator’s GRS assessment.  PFS is define d as the time from randomization until PD per 
IRF or death due to any cause, whichever occu rs first.  The sympto m domain of Skindex-29 
includes 7 items:  1) My skin hurts; 2) My skin  condition burns or stings; 3) My skin itches; 
4) Water bothers my skin conditions (bathing, wash ing hands); 5) My skin is irritated; 6) My 
skin is sensitive; and 7) My skin condition bleed s.  The following scoring system is used for 
all items:  never (0), rarely (1), sometimes (2), often (3), and always (4).  The total score for

[IP_ADDRESS].1    Handling of Missing Assessment and Censoring for Analysis of 
Progression-free Survival 
Disease assessment data should be collected  according to the intended schedule of 
assessment, and the date of PD/response should be assigned based on the time of the first 
documentation of PD/response regardless of vi olations or discontinuation of study drug.  
For the PFS endpoint, patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw c onsent, or those who 
discontinue treatment due to undocumented PD af ter the last adequate disease assessment 
will be censored at the last disease assessment.  If death or PD occurs after a missed visit, 
then the patient is treated as progressed at the date of death or PD.  Patients without baseline 
and/or no sufficient post baseline data for di sease assessment and with no death recorded 
will be censored at the date of randomizati on.  If PD is documented between scheduled 
visits, then the date of the documented PD is the date of progression.  If the patient starts 
new antineoplastic therapy before PD, then the patient is treated as progressed at the date of 
assessment at which PD was documented. 
The following sensitivity analyses will be perf ormed for PFS to evaluate the robustness of 
treatment effects.  They will be performed on the basis of 1 alteration at a time, not on 
combined alterations, unle ss specified otherwise.  
 If the PD is documented between scheduled  visits, then the date of the next 
scheduled visit is the date of progression.   
 If treatment is discontinued for undocumente d PD, then the patient is treated as 
progressed at the date of last disease assessment. 
 Patients who start new antineoplastic therapy before PD will be censored at the date 
of the last disease assessment. 
 Patients who start new antineoplastic therapy before PD will be treated as progressed 
at the date of the last disease assessment.  
 If death or PD occurs after more than [ADDRESS_1285808] disease assess ment before the missed visits.  
Another sensitivity analysis will be conduc ted for PFS per IRF in the ITT population to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis’s use of most recently available CT scans and

patients with skin-only disease, the analysis will use the same GRS assessment frequency as 
the primary analysis.     
[IP_ADDRESS].2    Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Because a fixed sequential testing procedure is  used between the primary endpoint and the 
key secondary endpoints, the key secondary endp oints will be tested only if the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant.   The weighted Holm procedure(1) will be used for testing 
the key secondary endpoints.  See Section 3.[ADDRESS_1285809] ratios along with the 95% CIs will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression 
model.  The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of the time-to-
event endpoints for each treatm ent.  Median times (if esti mable), along with the 2-sided 
95% CIs, will be presented.  
Assuming the median PFS for the brentuxima b vedotin treatment group and the physician’s 
choice treatment group (MTX or bexarotene) ar e 9 and 6 months, respectively, the number 
of PFS events is projected to be approximately 101 at the time of the planned final analysis.  
This is based on an approximately 2-year enrollment period, a dropout rate of 10%, and an α 
level of 0.01 (2-sided), as specified in S ection 3.[ADDRESS_1285810].  The 95% CI of the difference in the response rates between the [ADDRESS_1285811] baseline response assessment as specified in the protocol will be counted as nonresponders. 
For skin symptoms (Skindex-29), the primary an alysis will be comparing the mean symptom 
reduction between brentuximab vedotin and the control arms .  ‘Symptom reduction’ is 
defined for each patient as the maximum reduction from baseline (sum of the 7 items related 
to skin symptoms normalized to a 1-100 scal e).  The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model controlling for baseline covariates (treat ment group, baseline score, disease diagnosis, 
ECOG) will be employed for the analysis.  As a sensitivity analysis, comparison of the 2 treatment groups will be conducted using the linea r mixed model with repeated measures at 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Study C25001 
Confidential 22each time point specified in the protocol SOE.  The estimation of variance covariance 
matrix and statistics such as Akaike inform ation criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information 
criterion (BIC) will be included in evaluating the linear mixed model.  The 95% CIs of the 
difference of the changes from baseline between  the 2 treatments will also be provided.   
The total score for skin symptoms (Skindex-29) will be imputed with the mean of the other 
items if there is no more than 1 missing item; otherwise, it will be considered invalid and 
excluded from the analysis.   
In addition, the entire distribution of change in Skindex-29 symptom sc ores at the individual 
patient level will be presented for each arm, respectively.  The patient’s largest score of 
change from baseline will be determined first, and then a cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve will be used to display the cumula tive percentage of patients experiencing that 
change.  It is noteworthy that the higher scores in Skinde x-29 indicate worse levels of 
symptoms; therefore, the patient’s largest score of change from baseline needs to be presented in the format of “reduction in scores ” (e.g., a -10 of change needs to be presented 
as +10 in reduction) on the X-axis.  Categor ical definitions of responders or minimum 
important difference (MID) will be determined by [CONTACT_914810]. 
Primary analyses of key secondary endpoi nts will be performed based on the ITT 
population.  Sensitivity analyses will be performe d for CR using similar statistical analyses 
based on the Response-Evaluable population. 
5.8.3    Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Other secondary endpoints include EFS, DOR, and duration of skin response.  EFS is 
defined as the time from randomization un til any cause of treatment failure:  PD, 
discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or  death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first.  DOR in subjects with a confirmed re sponse is the time between first documentation of 
response and PD.  Duration of skin response is  the time between the fi rst skin response and 
PD in skin.    
[IP_ADDRESS]    Other Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The ITT principle will be used to determine the event time or censoring time for the EFS 
analysis.  Disease assessment data should be co llected according to the intended schedule of 
assessment, and the date of progression should be assigned based on th e time of the first 
documentation of PD regardless of viol ations or disconti nuation of study drug.  
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Study C25001 
Confidential 23For EFS, patients who are lost to follow-up w ill be censored at last disease assessment.  
Patients who withdraw consent or start new antineoplastic therapy  will be treated as if 
experiencing an EFS event.  Patients without baseline and/or sufficient post baseline data for 
disease assessment and no treatm ent discontinuation or death recorded will be censored at 
the date of randomization.  Analyses of EFS will be performed based on the ITT population. 
DOR will be analyzed for the subgroup of patients with confirmed response (CR or PR) in the 
ITT population.  Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or discontinue 
treatment due to undocumented PD  after the last adequate disease assessment will be 
censored at the last disease assessment.  If the patient starts new antineoplastic therapy before PD, the patient is treated as progresse d at the date of assessment at which PD was 
documented. 
Duration of skin response will be analyzed 
for the subgroup of patients with skin response (CR 
or PR in skin) in the ITT population.  Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or 
discontinue treatment due to undocumented PD in skin after the last adequate skin 
assessment will be censored at the last skin assessment.  Patients without sufficient skin 
assessment data after the initial skin response an d with no death recorded will be censored at 
the date of the initial skin re sponse.  If the patient starts new antineoplastic therapy before 
skin PD, then the patient is treated as progresse d at the date of the skin assessment at which 
PD in skin was documented. EFS will be analyzed similarly as the key s econdary efficacy endpoint PFS as described in 
Section 5.8.1.  DOR and duration of skin response will be summarized descriptively using 
the Kaplan-Meier method.

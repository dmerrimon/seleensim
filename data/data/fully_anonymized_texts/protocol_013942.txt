  This study is an international, multicenter , prospective, double blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel design protocol. It will be performed at multiple ICUs. 
Patients with a documented diagnosis of pneumonia, due to P. aeruginosa , and require ICU care, 
who are intubated (or have a trache ostomy tube in place) and are mechanically ventil ated, are 
eligible for screening.  
Patients meeting all other eligibility requirements will be assessed for P. aeruginosa  pulmonary 
infection on the basis of culture results (known from recent quantitative/s emi-quantitative 
cultures)  or on the basis of  rapid diagnostic testing of a fresh airway specimen using methods 
available at the site (e.g. mass spectrometry, PCR, etc.), or using devices such  as CE marked 
Cepheid’s GeneXpert® with “Investigational  / Resea rch Use Only ” (IUO  / RUO ) PA Cartridge, or 
BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (a BioMerieux company)’s  IUO FilmArray® LRTI Panel .  
Acceptable airway samples are  BAL, mini -BAL, or ETA  (ETA sample with < 10 squamous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] >25 polymorphonuclear cells per  low power field) . It is e xpected that some 
subject s will have a positive rapid diagnostic test result that will not be confirmed by [CONTACT_97908]  (quantitative, or semi -quantitative) . These subjects will be followed according 
to al l the proce dures described in this pr otocol  but will not accrue toward the target 
microbiologically evaluable intent to treat  population (micro -ITT). Subjects with a positive 
diagnosis of P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection will be randomized to receive either 
investig ational product or matching placebo (more than one pathogen allowed, if P. aeruginosa is 
regarded a key pneumonia causing pathogen) . In total, approximately 154 microbiologically 
evaluable subjects will be randomized 1 -1 to be treated with placebo plus SOC  or Aerucin 
(20 mg/kg)  plus SOC in this Phase 2/[ADDRESS_107859] that many study sites will enroll only a few 
patients. Randomization will acco unt for existence of sub -populations regarding oxygen status at 
baseline (PaO2/FiO2  200 or >  200). 
Study subjects will receive a single treatment dose (at Day 0) in addition to SOC  antibiotic 
treatment, and then enter a safety, efficacy and PK follow -up study period for a total study duration 
of [ADDRESS_107860] will be monitored to confirm continuation 
of Clinical Cure , re-infecti on (pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa ), or new infection (pneumonia due 
to an unknown pathogen or  a pathogen  other than P. aeruginosa ). “Clini cal Cure” can be declared 
at any time during the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_97857] , that the required criteria are met either based on 
documented improvements in signs and symptoms , +/- changes documented by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if 
performed as part of SOC ), as interpreted  by [CONTACT_093].  
The assessment of Clinical Cure (resolution of pneu monia) by [CONTACT_97909]. An adjudication committee will apply new ly defined  Clinical Cure 
criteria post hoc in a secondary analysis . “Clinical Cure” will be assessed for analytical purposes 
on Day 7, 14, 21 (primary efficacy endpoint) and 28.

Clinical Study Protocol # AR -105-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   Page [ADDRESS_107861] results 
obtained for medical reasons between these mandatory time poin ts will be assessed for adverse 
events and documented accordingly.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed in a similar manner during the 28 -day period, when 
appropriate, daily when possible (e.g., time on mechanical ventilation  including if tracheostomy 
is in place , time on supplemental oxygenation , measures of respi[INVESTIGATOR_97858] 2/FiO 2 using arterial blood  gases and/or pulse oximetry measurement s), or upon occurrence 
(e.g., antibiotic utilization, duration  of stay in the ICU,  duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], duration of 
intubation  with ventilation , or duration of mechanical ventilation if tracheostomy in place ). 
Microbiologic al endpoints of eradication and re-infection/new infection  will be determined based 
on quantitative/semi quantitative cultures performed by [CONTACT_97910] a central microbiology  laboratory .  
Two PK analyses will b e performed to assess the PK profile of Aerucin in the target patient 
popula tion. The pharmacokinetics of Aerucin will be assessed using a population PK 
(compartmental modeling) approach as well as a non -compartmental analysis approach. A PK 
sub-study (“Full PK”)  will be included, wherein more extensi ve sampling will be performed  in a 
small number of patients  (from select sites) who provide consent (i.e., 16 patients  to obtain 8 
patients on active treatment). In the remaining patients, a sparse sampling s trategy will be 
implemented with only a few samp les obtained from each patient  at varying time points  (“Sparse 
PK”) . A compartmental population PK model will be developed using the PK data collected from 
the sub -study and the sparse samples. PK parameters will be estimated as well as between -subject  
or inter-individual  variability (IIV) and residual variability  (RV) . The effects of select factors 
describing the characteristics of sub -populations of interest (e.g. high or low bacterial load, cause 
of admissi on [trauma or non -trauma], and type of pneumonia ) on the PK of Aerucin will be 
assessed via covariate analysis. In addition to the population PK evaluation, non -compartmental 
analysis of the PK sub -study data will be performed.  
The investigational therap y will be studied as an adjunct to antibiotic th erapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_97911]/her institution. The duration and nature of the initial 
and any subsequent antibiotic therapy related to the baseline pneumonia event and other infections 
will be recorded . Duration of antibiotic treatment for the index pneumonia should not exceed 14 
days. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Aerucin is provided as a sterile solution  for intravenous infusion , in the amount of 4.5  mL in 
10 mL vials at a concentration of 27.5  mg/mL.

  The proportion of patients  with Clinical Cure at Day 21  in patients treated with Aerucin versus 
the placebo group as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Th e investigators’ assessment will be the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint . 
Additional ly, newly defined Clinical Cure criteria will be applied post -hoc by [CONTACT_97912]: 
1. The subject must be alive through the index day visit  
2. The patient must have improved respi[INVESTIGATOR_97859], because:  
• The patient is  now off the ventilator and extubated   
or 
• if the patient entered the study with mechanical ventilation due to reasons other than 
pneumonia and was a ssessed “ likely ventilated beyond day 28”  at screening, criteria #1 
(survival) and #3 (no signs and symptoms of pneumonia) are sufficient to establish 
Clinical Cure  (presumed not ventilate d) 
3. The subject must show no clinical signs and symptoms of bacter ial pneumonia  at the index 
day, which is determined by  
• Not receiving any antibiotic therapy active against the initial P. aeruginosa  strain or 
against persisting pulmonary bacterial infec tion for 48 hours (antibiotic therapy for 
documented extra -pulmonary  infection permitted)  
and 
• Resolution of signs and symptoms of bacterial pneumonia, as determined by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_97860] . Parameters to be considered may include :  
o Fever >  38°C or hypothermia (<  35°C)  attributable to the primary bacter ial 
pneumonia  
o Tachypnea or shortness of breath (>  22 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]/min) if off the ventilator 
and/or back to baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  
o Tachycardia (>  100 bpm) or bradycardia (<  60 bpm) a nd/or back to baseline

When no specimen is obtained within this time frame,  microbiological outcome will be assessed 
as “Eradicated ” only if the study subject is not receiving any antibiotic active against the initial 
strain af ter the study drug administration visit day and displays no signs and symptoms of 
pneumonia.

  Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_6654]. 
Disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], a nd various outcomes (completed or 
discontinued the stud y, and reasons for discontinuation, etc .).  
Safety analysis  
Safety evaluations will include treatment emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical exam, and 
laboratory values. Safety will be summariz ed by [CONTACT_1570]. All treatment emergent adverse 
events, and serious adverse events, will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) . Relationship to treatment, as well as severity will also be summarized. 
Changes in vita l signs and physical exam s will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313].  Changes in laboratory 
values, as well as shifts (normal -> abnormal) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Pharmacokinetic analyses  
Two types of pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed to assess th e PK hypothesis that the PK 
profile of Aerucin in the target patient population is similar to the profile observed in healthy 
human volunteers (HV). The first pharmacokinetic analysis will consist of a population PK 
(compartmental modeling) approach using  the combined concentration data collected in th e PK 
sub-study and the sparse concentration data, pooled with the available PK data from healthy 
volunteers (Study ARC -11-01). A compartmental population PK model will be developed and the 
effects of select i ntrinsic and extrinsic factors, including but no t limited to patient status (e.g., HV 
versus patient with pneumonia), high or low bacterial load, and cause of admission [trauma or 
non-trauma]) on the PK of Aerucin will be evaluated via covariate analysis.  The population PK 
model will be described by [CONTACT_3433] e estimation of mean structural model parameters, the magnitude of 
IIV in these parameters, and the magnitude of RV.  
The second pharmacokinetic analysis to be performed will be a non -compartmental analysis o f the 
extensively sampled concentration -time dat a collected in the PK sub -study. The pharmacokinetic 
parameters to be derived from the individual concentration  time profiles will include: the

  SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with Clinical Cure at Day 21.  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects with Clinical Cure  will be 65% in the pl acebo group, 
and 85% in the 20 mg/kg dose group. With 69 subjects per group, there will be > 90% power for 
a statistically significant difference at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance. Sample size  
calculation was performed based on Fisher ’s Exact test using binomial enumerations (PASS  
version 14).  Assuming a 10% drop -out rate, approximately  154 subjects  (77 per group ) will be 
randomized.  
SITES:   Approximately  120 sites worldwide .

  1 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Rationale  
Nosocomial infections such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97867] ( HAP ) and particularly ventilator 
associated pneumonia (VAP ) are a major problem for providers and payers  [1,2]. Gram-negative 
bacteria are responsible for approximately 80% of cases of pneumonia in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] (this 
contrasts with bloodstream infections, fo r example, which are mainly caused by [CONTACT_6907] -positive 
bacteria, of which me thicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) is the most prominent  [3]. 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (P. aeruginosa ) causes the majority of multi -drug resistant (MDR) 
nosocomial infections. Pne umonia accounts for approximately 1 5% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated 
infections, and also 27% and 24% of all infections acquired in medical intensive -care units (ICU) 
and coronary care units, respectively, making it the second most common hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated 
infection after urinary tract infect ions. Being intubated and attached to a mechanical ventilator are 
two of the most common risk factors for infection in ICU patients  [4].  
Mortality for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated pneumonia and ventilator -associated pneumonia in parti cular, is 
high, e.g., for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated, pneumonia -attributed mortality rates of 20% to 33% have been 
reported and ventilator -associated pneumonia accounted for 6 0% of all deaths due to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated infections  [1]. Direct mortality from HAP is ~50% with about 21% of all HAP 
caused by P. aeruginosa  infections  [2]. The unmet medical need in VAP treatme nt is even more 
acute than in cystic fibrosis ( CF), as it is increasingly clear that mor tality in VAP is high despi[INVESTIGATOR_97868] (up to 70%)  [1], leading to expensive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051] 
(~$150,000 per pa tient)  [4]. VAP patients are also at a high risk of MDR P. aeruginosa  infection  
[1,3]. 
Given the rise in naturally occurring antibiotic resistance and the widening gap between the 
number of drug -resistant pathogens and the number of antibiotics under deve lopment within the 
past 3 decades, the development of new anti -infective is clearly of increased importance. Human 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a promising class of anti -infective alternatives to 
antibiotics, exhibiting attractive attributes such  as strong safety track records, long plasma half -life 
(e.g. 3 -4 weeks for an IgG1), and thus require much less frequent dosing than antibiotics, 
differenti ated immunological mechanisms that do not require transport across the 
membrane/capsule of the bacte ria and thus not susceptible to common mechanisms of antibiotic 
resistance. A recognized binding target of some antibacterial mAbs is the capsule surface an tigens 
of pathogens, such as extracellular polysaccharides. Aerucin is a fully human mAb that was 
discovered by [CONTACT_15249] B -cells of a volunteer that was immunized with P. aeruginosa  
extracellular polysaccharide alginate.  
Alginate (also called mucoid exop olysaccharide) is an ideal epi[INVESTIGATOR_97869] P. aeruginos a. It consists of β -1, 4-linked D -mannuronic acid and 
L-glucuronic acid and confers resistance to antibiotics  [5]. It is a key virulence associated factor 
with the absence of detectable escape mutants  (alginate negative) , and it is a conserved, polymeric, 
high-density and high -avidity cell surface target. Alginate expression is key to colonization, 
biofilm growth, vir ulence, and immune evasion.

Clinical Study Protocol # AR -105-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   Page 23 of 78 
Version  3.0, 09NOV 2018  
  In support of alginate as a clinically effective target, it has been observed tha t alginate production 
is the hallmark of progressive decline in lung function in CF patients  [5,6] and P. aeruginosa  
persistence and virulence  [7]. Addi tionally, a described subpopulation of older CF patients who 
were not colonized with P. aeruginosa  produced alginate specific phagocytic antibodies  [8]. 
Patients with opsonic antibodies had a lower rate of positive cultures for P. aeruginosa , while 
those lacking these antibodies were usually infected with P. aeruginosa  [5,6,7]. One treatment 
approach is the use of vaccines to gen erate specific mAb against P. aeruginosa . Vaccines studies 
of P. aeruginosa , including alginat e and alginate conjugate vaccines, have not resulted in data 
demonstrat ing the ability of vaccines to generate broadly protective antibodies in humans. Thus, 
an approach to overcome the potential problems of active vaccination is to produce human mAbs 
that can be administered passively; both for prophylactic (very early in life) and therapeutic (for 
patients with an existing P. aeruginosa  infection) use. This appro ach formed the basis for the 
development of Aridis’ human mAb (Aerucin). 
1.2 Aerucin 
Aerucin binds to the conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_60987] P. aeruginosa , alginate, at the C6 carboxyl group of 
mannuronic acid and mediates complement dependent phagocytic killing of both mucoid and non -
mucoid P. aeruginosa . Our data show that alginate is present on  >90% of clinical P. aeruginosa  
isolates tested, and that there is no non -specific binding of Aerucin against a panel of 40 normal 
human tissues. Opsonization is a key feature o f Aerucin ’s mechanism of action as demonstrated 
in vitro : phagocytic assays show ed that enabling P. aeruginosa  killing require s the presence of 
phagocytes (e .g., neutrophils, macrophages) and complement. Its binding target (alginate) is a 
common cell surfa ce component of P. aeruginosa  and is critically required for host colonization 
and pathogenicity . Indeed,  if selection pressure resulted in down regulated expression of alginate 
(which is not known to occur naturally), P. aeruginosa  would become  unable to colonize the host 
and significantly more susceptible to conventional antibiotics . Aerucin offers additional features 
that may be advantageous compared to conventional small molecule antibiotics for use in 
pneumonia and in CF, including long systemic serum  half-life of about 3 weeks, and thus require s 
much less frequent dosing than an tibiotics. As a result, Aerucin offers a unique profile and an 
entirely new mode of action, with no direct competition from antibiotics.  
Aerucin has not yet been approved fo r human use. Cellular and animal studies conducted with 
Aerucin have confirmed the stability and efficacious quality of this antibody. Experimental tests 
were performed using a refrigerated stable liquid formulation of Aerucin. These in vitro and in 
vivo studies have demonstrated that: 1) Aerucin binds to more than 90% of P. aeruginosa  strains 
tested, 2) Aerucin protected  against and treated infection , and 3) the delivery modalities were 
efficient enough to deliver the required concentration of Aerucin to the target and to demonstrate 
efficacy i n the animal model. Human tissue binding and mouse toxicology evaluations show no 
human tissue binding and no adverse toxic effects.  
A Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers showed that Aerucin has a favorable safe ty profile and a 
PK profile consistent with that of IgG immunoglobulins. The highest dose tested was 20  mg/kg, 
which is the dose selected for this study.

Version  3.0, 09NOV 2018  
  1.3 Indication  
Aerucin is being developed as adjunct therapy in combination with antibiotics for the trea tment 
of pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa .  
1.4 Hypotheses  
1. Treatment of P. aeruginosa  pneumonia with Aerucin improves the rate of Clinical Cure  
of the index pneumonia.  
2. Treatment of P. aeruginosa  pneumonia with Aerucin results in an increase in survival 
rate in the target population  
3. Treatment of P. ae ruginosa  pneumonia with Aerucin improves microbiological, 
functional and health economic outcomes overall.  
4. Aerucin at the proposed dose level is safe based on clinical observation, standard 
laboratory tests, an d frequency and nature of related adverse events.  
5. Aerucin does not trigger an adverse immunogenic response (i.e., anti -Aerucin 
immunogenicity).  
1.5 Risk/Benefit  
1.5.1 Risks related to Aerucin 
Aerucin is a fully human monoclonal antibody. It has been shown in a p hase 1 study (Protocol 
ARC -11-01) in healthy volunteers to be safe in doses of 2.0, 8.0, and 20.0 mg/kg, administered 
intravenously over [ADDRESS_107875] subjects (14/16, or 87.5%)  
experienced at least [ADDRESS_107876], were mild, were deemed possibly related by [CONTACT_093], and promptl y resolved 
without any medical intervention.  
The effectiveness of Aerucin has not been establish ed. Therefore, no benefit should be expected.

1.5.2 Risks related to the study design and required procedu res 
Aerucin will be administered in addition to standard -of-care antibiotic therapy, as determined by 
[CONTACT_97920]/her patient. Therefore, 
participation in this study does not affect the chance s of a positive clinical outcome in any given 
study subject , also taking into account  the favorable safety profile of the investigational product.  
Except for blood sampling for PK and anti-drug antibody ( ADA ), and rapid testing of airway 
specimens  for assessing t he presence of P. aeruginosa , the procedures that are required for the 
study are all routine procedures, in nature and frequency, for this type of patients whose clinical 
status requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97870]. Therefore , with the excepti ons noted earli er, this study 
does not impose an unreasonable burden on the study subjects.  
Blood sampling for PK and ADA has been reduced to the minimum necessary by [CONTACT_97921] , on the one hand, and by [CONTACT_97922] , thus limiting the related 
burden as much as possible.  
Eligible study subjects will be randomized and treated either on the basis of culture results (known 
from  recent cultures) or on the basis of rapid  diagnostic  testing of airway specimen s using devices 
such as CE marked Cepheid’s GeneXpert® with Investigational  / Research Use Only (IUO  / RUO) 
PA Cartridge, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (a BioMerieux company) ’s IUO FilmArray® LRTI Panel  
(please refer to section 14.3). This approach is necessary to allow the study intervention to be 
imple mented as early as poss ible in the course of the disease, as early treatment is a known driver 
of clinical out comes. It is expected that the results of rapid testing will not be confirm ed by 
[CONTACT_97923] a small number of subjects for various reasons including t he 
possibility of rapid test false positive, inadequate samples, or sample  cultures  affected by [CONTACT_97924]. This situation is not expected to occur in more tha n 5% of the 
randomized subjects.  Considering the safety profile of Aerucin and of similar fully human anti-
infective mAbs, this risk is deemed acceptable in the c ontext of this study protocol.

placebo -controlled, parallel design protocol  in patients  with VAP caused by P. aeruginosa . It will 
be performed at multiple ICUs. 
Patients with a documented diagnosis of pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa , and require  ICU care, 
and who are intubated (or have a tracheostomy tube in place) and are mechanically ventil ated, are 
eligible for screening.  
Patients meeting all other eligibility requirements  will be assessed for P. aeruginosa  pulmonary 
infection  on the basis of culture res ults (known from recent quantitative/semi -quantitative cultures) 
or on the basis of rap id diagnostic testing of a fresh airway specimen  using methods available at 
the site (e.g., mass spectrometry , PCR , etc. ), or using  devices such as  CE marked  Cepheid’s 
GeneXpert® with IUO / RUO PA Cartridge, or BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (a BioMerieux 
compan y)’s IUO FilmArray® LRTI Panel (please refer to section 14.3). Acceptable samples are  
bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ), mini -BAL,  or endotracheal tube aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (ETA , ETA sample 
with < 10 squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] >25 polymorphonuclear cells per low power field) . It is 
expected that a small number of subjects will have a positive rapid diagnostic test result that will 
not be confirmed by [CONTACT_97926]  (quantitative/semi -quantitative ). These subjects  
will be followed according to al l the procedures de scribed in this protocol but will not accrue 
toward the target microbiologically evaluable intent to treat population (micro -ITT). Subjects with 
a positive diagnosis of P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection w ill be randomized to receive either 
investigational product or matching placebo (more than one pathogen allowed, if P. aeruginosa is 
regarded a key pneumonia causing pathogen). In total, approximately 154 microbiologically 
evaluable subjects will be random ized 1 -1 to be treated with placebo plus SOC or  Aeru cin 
(20 mg/kg)  plus SOC in this Phase 2/[ADDRESS_107881] that many study sites will enroll only a few 
patients. Randomization will account for existence of sub-populations regarding oxygen status at 
baseline (PaO2/FiO2  200 or >  200). 
Study subjects will rec eive a single treatment dose (at Day 0) in addition to SOC  antibiotic 
treatment, and then enter a safety, efficacy and PK follow -up study period for a to tal study duration 
of [ADDRESS_107882] will be mo nitored to confirm continuation

  The assessment of Clinical Cure (resolution of pneumonia) by [CONTACT_97927].  An adjudication committee will apply new ly defined  Clinical Cure  criteria  
post hoc in a secondary analysis. “Clinical Cure ” will be assessed for analytical purposes on  Day 
7, 14, 21 (primary efficacy endpoint) and 28.  
Clinical safety assessments will be performed on an ongoing basis while predefined laboratory 
assessm ents will be performed at baseline, and thereafter at Day 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Test results 
obtained for medical reasons between these mandatory time points will be assessed for adverse 
events and documented accordingly.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints will  be assessed in a similar manner during the 28 -day per iod when 
appropriate, daily when possible , (e.g., Time on mechanical  ventilation  including if tracheostomy 
is in place ; Time on supplemental oxygenation ; measures of respi[INVESTIGATOR_97872] i n 
PaO 2/FiO 2 using arterial blood  gases and/or pulse oximetry measurements ), or upon occurrence 
(e.g., antibiotic utilization , duration of stay in the ICU, duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], duration of 
intubation  with ventilation , or duration of mechanical venti lation if tracheostomy in place ). 
Microbiologi cal endpoints of eradication and re-infection/new infection  will be determined based 
on quantitative/semi -quantitative cultures performed by [CONTACT_97928] a central microbiology  laboratory .  
Two PK analyses will be performed to assess the PK profile of Aerucin in the target patient 
population. The pharmacokinetics of Aerucin in patients will be assessed using a population PK 
(compartmental modeling) approach as well as a non -compartmental an alysis approach. A PK 
sub-study (“Full PK”) will be included, wherein more extensive sampling will be performed in a 
small number of patients (from select sites) who provide consent (i.e., 16 patients to obtain 8 
patients on active  treatment). In the remai ning patients, a sparse sampling strategy will be 
implemented with only a few samples obtained from each patient at varying time points  (“Sparse 
PK”) . A compartmental population PK model will be developed using the PK data collecte d from 
the sub -study and the sparse samples. PK parameters will be estimated as well as between -subject  
or inter -individual  variability (IIV) and residual variability  (RV) . The effects of select factors 
describing the characteristics of sub -populations of interest (e.g. high or lo w bacterial load, cause 
of admission [trauma or non -trauma], and type of pneumonia) on the PK of Aerucin will be 
assessed via covariate analysis. In addition to the population PK evaluation, non -compartmental 
analysis of the PK su b-study data will be perf ormed.  
The investigational therapy will be studied as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_97911]/her institution. The duration and nature of the initial 
and any subsequent antibiotic therapy related to the  baseline pneumonia event and other infections 
will be recorded.  Antibiotic treatment of the index pneumonia should not exceed 14 days.  
3.2 Study Indication(s)  
Aerucin is intended for use as adjunct therapy for the treatment o f VAP due to  P. aeruginosa  in 
combination with  SOC  antibiotic  therapy .

  5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
After completing all  screening  procedures, eligible study subjects will be randomized to one of the 
following treatment groups:  
- Control group : placebo  
- Investigational Product group : Aerucin 20 mg/kg  
5.2 Rationale for Dosi ng 
Aerucin was shown to be safe when administered in doses up to 20  mg/kg intravenously over 1 
hour in a phase 1 safety and PK study of 16 healthy volunteers. The 20  mg/kg dose, the highest 
dose then tested, was selected for this study b ecause of the exis tence of a dose -response in animal 
studies, because of the severity of the target infection, and because the target for Aerucin is 
specific to P. aeruginosa , the amount of which may  affect the PK profile of the product.  
5.[ADDRESS_107891] stratified as follows:  
- Stratum  1: VABP or non -VABP 
- Stratum  2: PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200 or  >200 
- Stratum  3: Americas, Eastern EU, Western EU and Asia  
Randomization will proceed in a 1:[ADDRESS_107892] using the electronic data capture (EDC) / interactive web -
based randomization system (IWRS)  system.  
5.[ADDRESS_107893] igator will be allowed  to break the b lind if, in his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], this is necessary to provide 
proper medical care to his/her patient.  In general, study drug unblinding should not impact any 
necessary treatment decisions by [CONTACT_093]. Prior to break ing the blind, the Inves tigator will 
confer with the Medical Monitor to confirm the necessity of such action . 
In the absence of the Investigator, the Medical Monitor may break the b lind for a specific study 
subject under such urgent circumstances and after assessing the necessity  of such action with a 
sub-investigator.  
Members of the Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC ) will be allowed to break the blind if it is 
deemed necessary to assess specific adverse events.  
The circumstances leading to breaking the b lind will be fully documented  in detail in a memo to 
file and as required, in the EDC system.

  6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
An overview of the study is provided below ( Figure 6-1). Day-by-day details are provided in 
(Table 6-1). In summary, any patient with VAP , who is intubated, older than  18 years (at least  [ADDRESS_107899] 19 years of age in South Korea ) and who signed an informed 
consent, will ente r a screening phase dedicated to identifying any pathogen that is present, and in 
particular,  verifying whether P. aeruginosa  is present. This screening phase is critical to ensuring 
that no potentially eligible patient is missed. Therefore, the related ac tivities should be organized 
and managed proactively. Participation of key hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97877], including personnel 
involved in managing infectious diseases in the institution, the local microbiology department, and 
any relevant personnel.   
If a culture from a valid airway specimen  (BAL, min i-BAL or ETA) obtained with in [ADDRESS_107900] specimen  will be sent to  the site’s local microbiology laboratory 
for quantitative/semi -quantitative culture . These baseline  culture results are not required prior to 
randomization.  
The sit es will obtain airway specimens for culture prior to treatment (baseline), as medically 
indicated, at time of extubation , and at Day 28 (i f not extubated prior to Day 28). Airway specimen 
cultures will be sent to the local microbiology laboratory for cultu re, including identification of 
genus and species, quantification and susceptibility testing as outline d in the microbiology 
laboratory ma nual.  
Isolates of unique organisms from airway specimen cultures will be sent to the central lab. The 
central microbi ology laboratory will confirm identification and perform standardized antibiotic  
quantitative/semi -quantitative culture,  susceptibility te sting and serotypi[INVESTIGATOR_97878].  
If the results of an airwa y specimen obtained within [ADDRESS_107901] specimen (BAL, mini -BAL or ETA) should  be obtained  and tested using rapid  
diagnostic testing  (see section 14.3) if available  at site and approved to use by [CONTACT_97940] (RA) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  If such rapid testing  is positive for P. 
aeruginosa , the subject can be randomized on this sole basis.  
The same airway  specimen used for rapid testing w ill be assessed at  the site’s local laboratory for 
baseline  culture including identification of genus  and species, quantitative/semi -quantitative 
culture  and susceptibility testing  as outlined  in the laboratory procedure manual.  These baseline  
culture resu lts are not required prior to randomization.   
Isolates of unique organisms will be sent to the central lab . The central microbiology laboratory 
will confirm identification, perform the standardized antibiotic susceptibility testing , and 
serotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
If no rapid diagnostic test is available and no culture within [ADDRESS_107902] specimen (BAL, mini -BAL or 
ETA) collected and sent to their local microbi ology lab  as soon as pos sible . The randomization 
cannot  be done in this case until the microbiology results of a positive P. aeruginosa culture have 
been confirmed.

7.1 Primary Clinical Efficacy Parameter  
The proportion of patients with Clinical Cure at Day 21 in patients treated with Aerucin versus 
the placebo group as assessed by [CONTACT_11168]. The investigators’ assessment will be the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint . 
Additional ly, newly defined Clinical Cure (Table 7-1) and will be applied post -hoc by [CONTACT_97950] . 
Table 7-[ADDRESS_107922] improved respi[INVESTIGATOR_97859], because:  
• The patient is  now off the ventilator and extubated   
or 
3. if the patient entered the study with mechanical ventilation due to reasons other than 
pneumonia and was assessed “ likely ventilated beyond day 28”  at screening, criteria #1 
(survival) and #3 (no signs and symptoms o f pneumonia) are sufficient to establish Clinical 
Cure  (presumed not ventilated ) 
4. The subject must show no clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial  pneumonia  at the 
index day, which is determined by  
• Not receiving any antibiotic therapy active against the initial P. aeruginosa  strain or 
against persisting pulmonary bacterial infection f or 48 hours (antibiotic therapy for 
documented extra -pulmonary infection permitted)  
and 
• Resolution of signs and symptoms of bacterial pneumonia, as determined by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_97885] . Parameters to be considered may include :  
o Fever >  38°C or hypothermia (<  35°C)  attributable to the primary bacterial 
pneumonia  
o Tachypnea or shortness of breath (>  22 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]/min) if off the ventilator 
and/or back to base line respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  
o Tachycardia (>  100 bpm) or bradycardia (<  60 bpm) a nd/or back to baseline 
heart rate  
o Improvement of hypoxemia (ABG or PaO 2/FiO 2 > 200 or pulse 
oximetry  > 90%)  
o If patient still produces sputum - negative P. aeruginosa  culture from 
sputum, blood or pleural fluid

7.3 Microbiological Endpoints  
1. Microbiological outcome of the index P. aeruginosa  pneumonia based on the data 
provided by [CONTACT_97951] . 
2. Eradication of P. aeruginosa  at Day 21 and 28. Eradication is considered as obtained 
when a specimen of respi[INVESTIGATOR_97886] 28 
and is negative. When no specimen is obtained within this time frame, microbi ological 
outcome will be assessed as “Eradicated” only if the study subject is  not receiving any 
antibiotic active against the initial strain after the study drug administration visit da y and 
displays no signs and symptoms of pneumonia . 
3. Change in bacterial  load related to the index P. aeruginosa on the basis of quantitative 
or semi -quantitative  cultures  by [CONTACT_97915].  
An antibiotic susceptibility profile  will be obtained locally in order to confirm the effectiveness of 
the concomit ant antibio tic regimen  prior to enrollment and thereafter, as medically indicated.  
Quantitative and semi -quantitative  cultures will be performed locally  prior to treatment (bas eline), 
as medically indicated, just prior to extubation, and at Day 28 (if not  extubated prior to Day 28) . 
Organism identification and a ntibiotic susceptibility profiles will be confirmed by [CONTACT_97952] g the infecting pathogen(s), and the adequacy 
of the concomitant antibio tic reg imen.

this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dise ase temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not rela ted to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Adverse events, which include clinical laborato ry test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time of randomization  until [ADDRESS_107927] the adverse  
event on the appropriate eCRF  using the EDC system .  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator  and recorded on the eCRF using the EDC 
system. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a 
specific  disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event . 
Additi onally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adver se event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present prior to Day [ADDRESS_107928] ed as a pre -existing 
condition in the Medical History, and not be reported as an adverse event . However, should  the 
medical condition or signs or symptoms pr esent at baseline change in severity or seriousness at

  any time after randomization or  during the s tudy, an adverse event sh ould be reported (worsening 
of pre -existing condition) . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g. electr ocardiogram) findings 
independent from the underlying medical condition that are detected during the study or are present 
at prior to  Day [ADDRESS_107929] of  study drug is capture d as 
an efficacy measure ( i.e., clinical failure) and in general will not be considered an AE. However, 
if the worsening of the index infection meets seriousness criteria (see Section 8.3), the event will 
be deemed an SAE.  
8.3.1 Adverse (Dr ug) Reaction  
All noxio us and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event  is at least a reasona ble possibility, 
i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_107930] information. F or Aerucin, the reference safety 
information is included in 7.1 of the Investigator’s Brochure currently in force. The reference 
safety information will be reviewed yearly, and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized 
with th e reporting period of the De velopment Safety Update Report.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_107931] of  study drug should not  be deemed an AE or 
deemed related to study drug.  
The Investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship t o study drug 
using the  categories of “yes” or “no”. 
Assessment of Severity:  
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal  daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment:  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the fol lowing definitions:  
Aridis Pharmaceut icals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol # AR -105-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   Page 56 of 78 
Version  3.0, 09NOV 2018  
  No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], co mplicat ions, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], compli cations , etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following factors  should  also be considered:  
- The temporal sequence  from study drug administration: The event should  occur during or after 
the study drug is administered . The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the  event.  
- Underlying, concomita nt, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated in the context 
of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject 
may have.  
- Concomitant drug : The other drugs the subject is taki ng or the treatment the subject receives 
should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event 
in question.  
- Known response pattern for this class of study drug : Clinical and/or preclinical data may 
indicate wheth er a pa rticular response is likely to be a class effect.  
- Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses : The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event.  
- The pharmacology and phar macokin etics of the study drug : The known pharmacologic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be 
considered.  
8.4 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the vi ew of e ither the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
- Death , 
- A life -threatening adverse event , 
- NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator  or Sponsor, i ts occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have 
caused death.  
- Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889] , 
- NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97890]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmission will not be 
recorded as a serious adverse event ( SAE ) under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]

  complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97891] s and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97892] ( i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97893]) will not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
- A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to cond uct 
normal life functions , 
- A congenital  anomaly  or birth defect ,  
- An important medical event.  
- NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate  medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency roo m or at home, blood 
dyscrasia or convul sions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development 
of drug dependency.  
8.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
Serious a dverse events will be reported in compliance with country -specific regula tory 
requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority IRB/EC and investigators.  
All SAEs  occurring from randomization until [ADDRESS_107932] Research Organization ( CRO ) Clinical Safety within 24 hours 
of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the 
aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs  that the Investigator  considers related to stu dy drug 
occurring after the 28-day foll ow-up period must be reported to the Aridis Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study. When 
the form is completed, CRO  Safety personnel will be notifi ed electronically and will retrieve the 
form. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible  to access the EDC system , send an

Within [ADDRESS_107935] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation ( e.g., 
subject discharge summary or autopsy report s) to Clinical Safety via fax or e -mail. If it is not 
possible to access the EDC s ystem, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of 
SAEs.  
8.[ADDRESS_107936]  should be followed by [CONTACT_97954]. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the antici pated date, the Investigator  should notify Clinical 
Safety. At the completion of t he pregnancy, the Investigator  will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
SAE ( i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congen ital 
anomaly), the Investigator  should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
8.7 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor , or CRO  (on behalf of the Sponsor),  will report all relevan t information about initial  
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) that are fatal or life -threatening as soon 
as possible to the FDA, applicable competent authorities in all the Member States concerned, and 
to the Central Ethics Committee s, and in any case no later t han [ADDRESS_107937] knowledge by [CONTACT_97955] .  
The Sponsor and the CRO (on behalf of the Sponsor) will comply with country -specific regul atory 
requirements relating  to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/EC and investigators if 
country requirements are different than the above.  
The Sponsor  will also inform all investigators as required.  
Expedited reporting of suspected unexpe cted serious adverse reacti ons related to non-
investigational medical products ( NIMPs ) will not be necessary.  Listings of cases related to NIMPs 
will be included in the Development Safety Update Report.

9.3.3 Pharmacokinetic analyses  
Two types of ph armacokinetic analyse s will be performed to assess the PK hypothesis that the PK 
profile of Aerucin in the target patient population is similar to the profile observed in healthy 
human volunteers (HV). The first pharmacokinetic analysis will consist of a population PK 
(compar tmental modeling) approach using the combined concentration data collected in the PK 
sub-study and the sparse concentration data, pooled with the available PK data from healthy 
volunteers (Study ARC -11-01). A compartmental population P K model will be devel oped and the 
effects of select intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including but not limited to patient status (e.g., HV 
versus patient with pneumonia ), high or low bacterial load, and cause of admission [trauma or non -
trauma]) on the PK of Aerucin will be e valuated via  covariate analysis. The population PK model 
will be described by [CONTACT_89506], the magnitude of IIV in 
these parameters, and the magnitude of RV.  
The second pharmacokinetic analysis t o be performed will b e a non -compartmental analysis of the 
extensively sampled concentration -time data collected in the PK sub -study. The pharmacokinetic 
parameters to be derived from the individual concentration -time profiles will include: the 
maximum obs erved plasma concentr ation (C max), the time of occurrence of C max (tmax), the area 
under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to Day 28 (AUC 0-28), the terminal 
elimination rate constant ( λz), and , if data permits,  the terminal half -life (t 1/2). Parameter estimates 
will be summarized and tabulated by [CONTACT_97919]. Graphs of p lasma concentration

14.3 Microbiological basis for randomization and treatment  
Any patients with pneumonia who are intubated (or have a tracheostomy) in whom evidence that 
P. aeruginosa  is the infective pathogen can be randomized a nd treated. Such evidence can be 
provided by [CONTACT_97965], either based on available cultures or on rapid testing me thods.  
Patients with culture results of more than one pathogen can be included, if P. aeruginosa  is 
regarded a key pneumonia causing pathog en. 
14.3.1  Culture  
Acceptable sampling methods are BAL, mini -BAL and ETA  (ETA sample with < 10 squamous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] > 25 polymorphonuclear cells per low power field) . Acceptable airway 
specimens must have been obtained less than [ADDRESS_107966] microbial culture  
(quantitative, semi -quantitative) , mass spectrometry or PCR.  
If randomization and treatment is based on such evidence, a new sample must be obtained prior to 
treatment for standard microbial culture by [CONTACT_97966].  The culture at the 
local microbiology lab should include identification of genus a nd species, quantitative, 
semi -quantitative  culture  and susceptibility testing . 
14.3.[ADDRESS_107967] microbial cultures (quantitative, 
semi -quantitative) by [CONTACT_97967].  Rapid diagnostic testing will not be used 
for other purpose tha n screening and randomization in this study. In particular, they will not be 
used to assess m icrobiological outcomes.  
Acceptable rapid diagnostic testing discussed hereunder are IUO / RUO.  Other methods available 
at the site may be used (e.g., mass spectrometry , PCR, etc. ).

  [IP_ADDRESS]  Rapid testing using  the IUO FilmArray  LRTI Paneli 
The BioFire Diagnostics,  LLC (a BioMérieux company) ’s IUO FilmArray lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_97896] ( LRTI ) panel can be used to determine whether P. aeruginosa  is present in the 
sample obtained at baseline for the purpose of screening and randomizing patients who meet 
eligibil ity criteria . The corresponding methods are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Briefly, the IUO FilmArray (FA) LRTI panel allows for identifying the etiological agent (s) of LRT 
infections . This is a multiplexed device, allowing the simultaneous detection o f multiple bacteria , 
including P. aeruginosa , viruses and fungi. Semi -quantitative results can be obtained for bacteria  
(reported positive if detected at levels of 10e3.5 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL or above) . Although any relevant 
sample can be used, including sputum, only  BAL, mini -BAL and ETA samples are allowed at  
baseline and prior to extubation to ensure the quality of standard microbial cultures  and to avoid 
any ambiguity that would preclude determining the etiological agent or assessing bacterial load 
with confidence .  
The procedure entails injecting an adequat e airway specimen  and rehydration medium to the IUO 
LRTI pouch, and then inserting the pouch in the FilmAr ray instrument. Time to results is about 1 
hour.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rapid testing using the GeneXpert RUO PA Cartridgeii 
The CE marked Cepheid GeneXpert PA Assay, perform ed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, 
is a qualitative in vitro test designed for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Gram negative 
bacteria.  
The GeneXpert (GX) Instrument Systems automate and integrate s ample preparation, nucleic acid 
purification and amplification, and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples 
using real -time PCR assays. The systems consist of an instrument, personal computer, and 
preloaded software for performing te sts and viewing the results. The systems requ ire the use of 
single -use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the 
cartridges are self -contained, cross - contamination between samples is minimized. For a full 
descr iption of the system, see the GeneXpert Dx Sy stem Operator Manual or the GeneXpert 
Infinity System Operator Manual.  
The primers and probes in the GeneXpert PA Assay detect proprietary sequences for the detection 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa .  
Endotracheal asp irates (ETA) may be used with the GeneXpert P A assay kit. For ETA samples, a 
swab is dipped into the sample, then material on the swab is eluted by [CONTACT_97968], followed by [CONTACT_31955]. The disposable transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_97897] (Figure 2).

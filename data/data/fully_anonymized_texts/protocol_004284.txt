[ADDRESS_462190] on women’s lives are often worse for women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and lower health literacy. They are more likely than women of higher SES to experience lower knowledge of breast cancer surgery, higher uptake of mastectomy, increased decision regret, worse patient-centered health outcomes, and poorer care. These disparities are differences that are unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s preferences but are partly explained by [CONTACT_369128] 

 
[ADDRESS_462191] cancer treatments. Their choice should ideally be informed by [CONTACT_369129]. We will be comparing two effective patient decision aids used in the health care visit (Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) to usual care in women of higher SES and lower SES. We hope that the decision aids help all women (irrespective of SES) achieve higher decision quality and a treatment choice that is informed by [CONTACT_369130]. In addition, we hope to demonstrate that women who have used the decision aids are meaningfully involved in treatment decisions, have lower anxiety, experience less decision regret and higher quality of life, and perceive more coordination and integration of care compared to women who receive usual care. We also hope to show that the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369061]-making and treatment choice between women of higher and lower SES.   This project is important to patients because making the wrong treatment decision for early stage breast cancer will have serious consequences on the patient’s life and quality of life. This project is likely to change the way patients and clinicians make decisions about breast cancer surgery, regardless of SES.   Patient and stakeholder partner involvement is an essential aspect of this study. Patient and stakeholder partners have been involved in designing the study, identifying the research questions, and choosing the outcomes to be measured. They will also be involved in conducting the study and monitoring progress and risks. At each site, one patient associate (a former breast cancer patient) will recruit patients with a research assistant and will collect data and contribute to data analysis. The patient associates’ continuous input in designing, planning, conducting, and managing the study will maximize the success of recruitment and data collection procedures as well as the applicability and implementation potential of the findings and intervention(s).   1.[ADDRESS_462192] Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_369062], women of lower SES diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (compared to women of higher SES): - Continue to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery and decision-making, and higher decision regret; - More often play a passive role in decision-making; - Are less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS); - Are less likely to receive optimal care.  Those differences are disparities that predominantly affect women of low SES with early stage breast cancer, irrespective of race or ethnicity. For early stage breast cancer, low SES is a stronger predictor of poorer outcomes, treatment received, and death than race or ethnicity. We define low SES as having a lower income and uninsured or state-insured status. We will 
 
9  not use educational attainment as part of the inclusion criteria but will examine it using multiple informants analysis as an indicator of lower SES (see Section 4.7 Statistical Analysis).   BCS is the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer (stages I to IIIA) although research confirms equivalent survival between mastectomy and BCS. Both options are offered yet have distinct harms and benefits, valued differently by [CONTACT_1962]. Research shows that women of low SES are not usually involved in an informed, patient-centered dialogue about surgery choice. There is no evidence that women of low SES have distinct preferences that explain a lower uptake of BCS and limited engagement in decision-making. Further, communication strategies are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_369063]. Most patient decision aids for breast cancer have been designed for people at high literacy levels and have low accessibility and readability. It is critical to determine how to effectively support women of low SES in making informed breast cancer surgery choices. There is some evidence that simpler, shorter decision aids delivered by [CONTACT_369131] (encounter decision aids) may be more beneficial to underserved patients and reduce disparities, but further research is needed.  Objectives: First, we will assess the comparative effectiveness of two encounter decision aids (Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) against usual care on a patient-reported measure of decision quality (primary outcome), shared decision-making, treatment choice, and other secondary outcomes across socioeconomic strata (Aim 1). Second, we aim to explore the effect of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369064]-making (decision quality, knowledge, and shared decision-making) and treatment choice, as well as mediation and moderation effects (Aim 2). Third, in order to maximize the implementation potential, we will explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids’ sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model (Aim 3).   Design: We will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by [CONTACT_45520] (Aims 1 and 2) and randomization at the clinician level. Six hundred (half higher SES and half lower SES) will be recruited from four large cancer centers. In preparation for the trial (Year 01), we will conduct semi-structured interviews with women of lower SES who have completed treatment for early stage breast cancer at all four participating sites, to adapt the “What Matters Most to You” subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for women of lower SES. Lastly, we will use interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions’ sustained use and dissemination using the Normalization Process Theory (Aim 3). Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods will be used throughout the trial with continuous patient and stakeholder involvement.   Population: We will include women at least [ADDRESS_462193] cancer (I to IIIA) from both higher and lower SES, provided they speak English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese.   Interventions: Both interventions have been developed, tested, and shown to be effective. The Option Grid (intervention 1) is a one-page, evidence-based summary of available options presented in a tabular format, listing the trade-offs that patients normally consider when making breast cancer surgery decisions. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060] (intervention 2) uses the same evidence and tabular layout, but it is tailored to women of lower SES and low health literacy by [CONTACT_369132]. Because patient decision aids are not routinely 
 
[ADDRESS_462194] cancer.   Outcomes: The primary outcome measure is the 16-item validated Decision Quality Instrument. Secondary outcome measures include CollaboRATE, a three-item validated measure of shared decision-making, PROMIS, an eight-item validated anxiety short form, the validated five-item Decision Regret scale, Chew’s validated one-item health literacy screening item, EQ-5D-5L, the validated 6-item quality of life measure, IntegRATE, a four-item measure of integration of health care delivery, four items from COST, an 11-item validated measure of financial toxicity, and one patient-reported measure of out-of-pocket expenses. All measures will be available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Observer OPTION5 will be used to rate the level of shared decision-making in the clinical encounter in a subsample of consultations.  Analysis: We will use a regression framework (logistic regression, linear regression, mixed effect regression models, generalized estimating equations) and mediation analyses. We will use multiple informants’ analysis to measure and examine SES and use multiple imputation to manage missing data. We will also perform heterogeneity of treatment effects analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site. 2 Research Team Marie-Anne Durand, BSc, MSc, MPhil, PhD, CPsychol (Principal Investigator) is an assistant professor at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice at the Geisel School of Medicine.

[ADDRESS_462199] cancer treatment, communication in healthcare, long-term health outcomes and mortality5,6. Extensive evidence suggests that women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer have significantly poorer communication with their clinicians, lower knowledge of breast cancer surgery options, higher uptake of mastectomy, and worse cancer-related and patient-centered health outcomes compared to women of higher SES5-13. They also tend to receive breast cancer care that is inferior to that offered to women of higher SES and that deviates from established clinical guidelines (e.g., inconsistent use of radiation after breast conserving surgery; BCS)6,12. For the purpose of recruiting participants into the study, we define low SES as meeting the following two criteria: 1) 138% of the Federal Poverty Level or below and 2) uninsured or government-insured status (Medicaid or Medicare without supplemental insurance) or Accountable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans14,15. Although educational attainment will not be used as part of the inclusion criteria, we will examine it using multiple informants analysis (see analysis section) and include it in our overall definition of lower SES. This definition is considered valid and relevant to the populations and outcomes under study14,16.  SES-linked differences in early stage breast cancer care meet the Institute of Medicine (IOM)’s definition of a health service disparity: a difference in treatment or access not justified by [CONTACT_369134]17. There is no evidence that women of lower SES have distinct values and preferences that explain a significantly lower uptake of BCS and limited engagement in decision-making6,10,11. Differences in treatment received, doctor-patient communication, engagement in decision-making, and patient-centered health outcomes are disparities that predominantly affect women of low SES with early stage breast cancer, irrespective of race or ethnicity5,11,18. For early stage breast cancer, low SES is a stronger predictor of poor outcomes and treatment received than race or ethnicity19,20.  Although BCS is the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer (stages I to IIIA), research confirms equivalent survival between mastectomy and BCS21-24. Both options are offered routinely yet have distinct harms and benefits, which are valued differently by [CONTACT_6904]25. In this context, patient preferences play an essential role in decision-making. According to the IOM, patient participation in decision-making should be promoted to improve the quality of health care, particularly for cancer care26-30. Our patient and stakeholder partners have emphasized the critical importance of supporting women in making high-quality breast cancer surgery decisions that are informed by [CONTACT_369135], regardless of SES and health literacy31,32. Only 44 to 51% of women with early stage breast cancer across all socioeconomic strata achieve the degree of participation in decision-making they desire7,8,33-36. Poor knowledge of breast cancer surgery is commonly reported7,8,33-36. Women of lower SES with early stage breast cancer tend to experience lower knowledge of breast cancer surgery, receive lower quality of care, play a passive role in decision-making, and have higher decision regret and lower 
 
15  satisfaction with both surgery and decision-making6,7,10,11,13. Research also suggests that surgeons tend to spend more time communicating and engaging with more educated, affluent patients than with patients from lower socioeconomic strata13. A review demonstrated that patients of lower SES received significantly less information and socio-emotional support while experiencing less partnership building and a more directive approach than patients of higher SES37. 3.1.2 Gaps in Evidence Evidence Gap 1: How Can We Effectively Involve Women of Low SES in Breast Cancer Treatment Decisions?  The gap analysis identified a number of reviews and systematic reviews that have highlighted the association between SES, participation in decision-making, and breast cancer disparities5,6,9,11,12,18. Hurd’s and Polacek’s reviews demonstrate that healthcare disparities cannot be eliminated unless underserved patients are appropriately informed and supported in making informed breast cancer surgery decisions6,11. It remains unclear, however, how best to promote participation in decision-making, improve decision quality and knowledge, and reduce disparities across socioeconomic strata11,38,39.  Limitations and Benefits of Decision Aids for Patients of Low SES. Patient decision aids provide evidence-based information about the harms and benefits of reasonable healthcare options to help individuals deliberate about their preferences40. For breast cancer, they have been shown to influence treatment decisions, increase BCS uptake, reduce decisional conflict, increase knowledge and satisfaction with the decision-making process, and in some instances, improve quality of life32,41,42. However, research confirms that most communication strategies (including decision aids) are designed for highly literate audiences, have poor accessibility and readability, and are not tailored to the needs of women of low SES and low health literacy32,38,41,43-47. Except for one computerized pre-encounter decision aid evaluated in low-literacy women, decision aids for breast cancer have always been evaluated in women of higher SES39.  The PI’s recent systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that decision aids significantly improved outcomes in underserved patients across disease areas38. Further, decision aids that were specifically tailored to underserved patients’ needs appeared most effective. The narrative synthesis also suggested that disparities in knowledge, decisional conflict, uncertainty, and treatment preferences between disadvantaged and more privileged patients tended to disappear after using a decision aid. Underserved populations may therefore benefit more than advantaged groups from such interventions. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_369074]48, only a minority of decision aids use formats, layout, and content that are tailored to underserved patients’ needs38,44,45,48.  Encounter Decision Aids. To date, most decision aids have been introduced to patients ahead of clinical encounters (i.e., pre-encounter decision aids). They have focused on providing extensive information, often on the Internet, with poor accessibility and readability44-47. A systematic review of the readability and cultural sensitivity of web-based decision aids for cancer screening and treatment indicated that the vast majority of decision aids had low readability, complicated text, and a lack of cultural sensitivity47. Further, research has shown that although decision aids improve outcomes in controlled settings (with literate audiences), 
 
16  their use in routine care remains rare because of resistance to implementation49. Clinicians argue that consultation time is limited and that complex pre-encounter decision aids are not designed for use in face-to-face encounters and disrupt workflows49-55. Shorter, simpler decision aids designed for use in clinical encounters—encounter decision aids—have received less attention than complex pre-encounter interventions56. An encounter decision aid (see Fig. 1) provides evidence-based information about significant harms and benefits of available options, is used in the clinic visit to facilitate the elicitation of patient values and preferences, and enables clinicians to tailor information to patients’ needs and characteristics. They have been shown to increase patients’ knowledge and participation in decision-making, to improve risk perception, and in some instances, to influence choice and improve adherence to treatments57-62.   Recent evidence suggests that encounter decision aids are successfully used by [CONTACT_15098], do not increase consultation time, and are becoming routinely adopted in usual care with integration in the electronic medical record59,63-65. They are showing great promise in overcoming common implementation challenges63,64. Politi (Co-Investigator) et al. suggest that underserved patients may prefer and benefit more from shorter, paper-based encounter decision aids than from complex, digital interventions43. However, the effect of encounter decision aids in patients of low SES and low health literacy, and their potential to reduce disparities across socioeconomic strata, have never been evaluated.  Tailoring Information to Reduce Disparities. When preparing information for low SES populations, it is imperative to recognize the barriers of limited health literacy and numeracy and to consider the use of images and easy-to-access formats such as paper-based interventions. Approximately [ADDRESS_462200] low textual literacy and limited health literacy66-68. Healthcare professionals consider low health literacy a major barrier to involving patients in treatment decisions44,69,70. Patients’ abilities to benefit from decision aids largely depend on their capacity to understand and use the interventions available to them44,70. Tailoring information to patients of low SES, who typi[INVESTIGATOR_369075], is essential, though it is largely overlooked11,45.  Our proposal seeks to challenge this highly textual literacy-assuming paradigm, by [CONTACT_23992] a validated pi[INVESTIGATOR_369076] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) to a validated text-based encounter decision aid (Option Grid) across socioeconomic strata. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369077] 

 
17  easily when they are presented as pi[INVESTIGATOR_369078] (see Fig. 2)71. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369079]72,73. There is evidence of visual literacy in people of lower textual literacy74. Research confirms that the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_369080], compliance, and recall associated with health education information74,75. No studies have yet to compare the effectiveness of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_369081] a text-based encounter decision aid across socioeconomic strata.  Evidence Gap 2: Why are Women of Low SES More Likely to Choose Mastectomy?   Treatment disparities in breast cancer care have been extensively examined5,11,12,18,76-81. The literature suggests that treatment disparities are associated with patient-, clinician-, and system-level factors76,82. The reasons women of low SES are more likely to choose mastectomy over BCS, however, are not well defined10. A higher uptake of mastectomy in this group would not be a concern, provided that this choice was the result of an informed preference and not a treatment disparity (i.e., treatment not justified by [CONTACT_369136]). In fact, there is no evidence that women of low SES have clear preferences for mastectomy10. Based on extensive research evidence5,6,9,11,12,18, we hypothesize that there is indeed a treatment disparity, which is strongly associated with less effective communication, lower knowledge of breast cancer surgery, and less participation in decision-making10,11,13.  Other factors, such as limited financial resources and lack of insurance coverage, do not seem to predict decision-making for early stage breast cancer surgery83. There is no significant difference in monetary cost to patients between BCS and mastectomy, as BCS has higher short-term cost but lower long-term cost84. For many women of low SES, Medicare and other programs targeted at lower SES groups would cover the costs of either treatment, thus minimizing the impact of cost on decision-making. Other patient-level factors, such as childcare, transportation expenses, and other financial pressures (e.g., a need to return to work quickly) may be strong influences on the treatment choices of women of low SES irrespective of knowledge and participation in decision-making. The impact of these factors, however, is unclear and has not been demonstrated to date85,86. According to the literature, communication, accessible information, and participation in decision-making seem to play a significant (possibly the most significant) role in decision-making5,6,9,11,12,18. We hypothesize that encounter decision aids can address these issues and reduce disparities across socioeconomic strata. However, since it remains unclear how other factors (limited financial resources and other socioeconomic barriers) may affect decision-making, we will explore, in Aim 2, factors that may be mediating and moderating the intervention’s effect10,11,13,39. 3.2 Aims and Objectives The three specific aims will be realized in the context of the logic model shown in Fig. 3:  AIM 1: Assess the comparative effectiveness of two effective encounter decision aids (Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) against usual care on shared decision-making (SDM), decision quality, treatment choice and other direct outcomes in women, and differentially by [CONTACT_369137] (SES).   
 
18  Hypothesis 1. The encounter decision aids will increase SDM in the clinic visit and improve decision quality, knowledge, and quality of life in women of higher and lower SES compared to usual care. We also anticipate that they will reduce decision regret and improve the perceived integration of healthcare delivery (see Fig. 3).  Hypothesis 2. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369082]. There will be no difference between the effects of the two encounter decision aids in women of higher SES.   AIM 2:  Measure the effect of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369064]-making (decision quality, knowledge, and SDM) and treatment choice, and conduct an exploratory analysis of the mediation and moderation effects.   Hypothesis 1. Compared to the Option Grid and usual care arms, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369083], knowledge and participation in shared decision-making between women of lower and higher SES. It is also likely to reduce disparities in treatment choice.   Hypothesis 2. The effect of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369084]-intervention knowledge, shared decision-making, and post-intervention values (reported in ‘What Matters Most to You’ subscale of DQI, e.g., keepi[INVESTIGATOR_369085], removing breast to gain peace of mind, avoiding radiation, etc.) (see Fig. 4).  Hypothesis 3. For women of lower SES, socioeconomic barriers (e.g., resource constraints, as reported in the Decision Quality Instrument) will affect treatment choice and thereby [CONTACT_369138]’s effect.  AIM 3: Explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids’ sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model.   Hypothesis 1. Pre-visit planning, minimal clinician training, flexibility of use, and integration into the workflow and EMR will facilitate sustained use.  Hypothesis 2. Successful use by [CONTACT_369139].

20  4 Methods 4.1 Design 4.1.1 Design Overview We will use a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by [CONTACT_369140] (Aims 1 and 2). One thousand one hundred patients (half higher SES and half lower SES) will be recruited from four large cancer centers over a 18-month period. Randomization will be at the clinician level, nested within study sites, and will involve data analyst blinding. In preparation for the trial, we will conduct semi-structured interviews in Year [ADDRESS_462201] cancer to adapt the “What Matters Most to You” subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for women of lower SES. For Aim 3, we will use interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids’ sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model. See study Gantt Chart on page 46.  4.1.2 Randomized Controlled Superiority Trial (Aims 1 and 2) According to Cooper et al., the most appropriate design for evaluating interventions that aim to eliminate disparities is a classic experimental design with random assignment to experimental and control groups, with measurements of key variables pre- and post-interventions82. We have thus chosen to conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by [CONTACT_45520] (high versus low) and randomization at the clinician level (nested within study sites) (see Fig. 5).  Fig. 5. CONSORT* Study Flow Diagram 
 *CONSORT stands for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, as reported in the CONSORT statement87.   At each site, we will use a cross-sectional study design and randomize participating clinicians (three to five clinicians per site) to one of three arms (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060], Option Grid, or usual 

 
21  care). We will use an R script written by [CONTACT_369141]. At each site, patients who have given informed consent and are seeing one of the participating clinicians will be allocated to the clinician’s corresponding arm (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060], Option Grid, or usual care). Approximately the same number of patients in each socioeconomic stratum will be allocated to each arm. We will monitor accrual within each arm for each socioeconomic stratum at each site to ensure that a similar number of patients in each socioeconomic stratum receive each treatment. The total number of patients recruited at each site will be allowed to vary. 4.1.[ADDRESS_462202] size we estimate is reduced by [CONTACT_369142].   4.1.4 Adapting the Decision Quality Instrument In preparation for the comparative effectiveness trial, we will adapt the “What Matters Most to You” subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI)89. We aim to capture the factors (including potential barriers) that are important to women of lower SES when deciding about early stage breast cancer treatments and that are not currently captured in the DQI. We will conduct up to 45 semi-structured interviews with women of lower SES in both urban and rural settings.  4.2 Setting The DQI adaptation interviews and randomized controlled trial will be conducted at four large cancer centers in the [LOCATION_003]. The four study sites include: ● Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Lebanon, NH and Manchester, NH ● [LOCATION_001] University (NYU) School of Medicine, [LOCATION_001], NY ● Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY ● Joanne Knight Breast Health Center, St. Louis, MO 4.3 Participants 4.3.1 Randomized Controlled Superiority Trial (Aims 1 and 2) We will include [ADDRESS_462203] cancer (I to IIIA) (see inclusion/exclusion criteria below). Approximately half will be on 
 
22  Medicaid or Medicare without supplemental insurance, or uninsured (lower SES population) and about half will be women with private insurance or Medicare with supplemental insurance (higher SES population) (see 4.3.4 for stratification by [CONTACT_45520]). Participants will be recruited across the four study sites over 18 months.   To facilitate recruitment and retention, participants will be compensated for their time with a $[ADDRESS_462204] at T2, T3, T4, and T5.  Participant Inclusion Criteria  The study team at each study site will use the following inclusion criteria:  ● Assigned female at birth; ● At least 18 years of age; ● Confirmed diagnosis (via biopsy) of early stage breast cancer (stages I-IIIA); ● Eligible for both breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy based on medical records and clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_369087]; ● Spoken English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese.  Participant Exclusion Criteria  The following exclusion criteria will be used:   ● Transgender men and women; ● Women who have undergone prophylactic mastectomy; ● Women with visual impairment (because of the visual nature of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]); ● Women with a diagnosis of severe mental illness or severe dementia; ● Women with inflammatory breast carcinoma.  Women who are receiving neoadjuvant therapy will be invited to take part in the study in the first nine months of the trial in order to be able to complete all follow-up assessments before the end of the trial. Their T3 assessment will occur after the neoadjuvant therapy has been completed and post-surgery. This may occur up to 7 months after T0 (baseline).   4.3.2 DQI Adaptation (Year 1) We will recruit up to [ADDRESS_462205] subscale of the DQI. We will use purposive sampling. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_462206].   Participant Inclusion Criteria  - Assigned female at birth; - Between the ages of 18 and 74 years of age; - Government insured (without supplemental insurance) or uninsured (as well as ACA marketplace plans);  
 
23  - 138% of the federal poverty level or below; - Breast cancer surgery and radiation have been completed in the past three years; - At least spoken English.  Participant Exclusion Criteria  The following exclusion criteria will be used:   - Transgender men and women; - Women who have undergone prophylactic mastectomy; - Women >74 years of age (as other treatment options may be relevant); - Women who are unable to complete the study procedures due to mental health impairment, cognitive impairment, or visual issues, as determined by [CONTACT_369143]; - Women with inflammatory breast carcinoma.  4.3.3 Explore Strategies that Promote the Encounter Decision Aids’ Sustained Use and Dissemination (Aim 3) We will conduct up to 100 interviews in total for Aim 3. A purposive sample  of 60 participants balanced in arm, SES, and age will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview after completion of the final follow-up assessment (T4). We will also encourage the participant’s family or caregivers who are supporting the patient in making treatment decisions to attend the interview and share their perspective. Patients will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_462207]. We will also include up to 10 healthcare professionals and other stakeholders per site, with and without involvement in the trial (up to 40 in total).  4.3.[ADDRESS_462208]. Louis (this number may vary depending on stratification and patient volume). Given the lower patient volume at NYU School of Medicine, we will aim to recruit [ADDRESS_462209] Health Center (Washington University in St. Louis), [ADDRESS_462210] accounted for this (see section 4.8 - Analysis).  Barriers to enrollment will be overcome by [CONTACT_18120] a research assistant and patient associate at each site throughout the study, by [CONTACT_369144]-up assessments, by [CONTACT_369145], by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_369088], by [CONTACT_369146], and by [CONTACT_369147] (see section 
 
[ADDRESS_462211]) and patient and stakeholder partners to overcome potential issues with recruitment. We have allocated two extra months for the analysis and write-up of the findings, in case recruitment would need to be extended. We anticipate that the attrition rate will be minimal given the brevity of the trial, and will implement various strategies to maximize recruitment and retention.  Table 1.

At baseline, we will collect information about median household income and highest educational attainment. Considering the populations and outcomes being studied, and 
 
[ADDRESS_462213] for the measurement of SES, using household income (commonly used in US research and census data) and highest educational attainment to measure SES (in combination with insurance status) is considered an acceptable and relevant approach and one that follows Braveman et al.’s recommendations for the measurement of SES14,16,90. For each included participant, we will verify whether her income is consistent with the higher or lower SES group designation made at the initial screening. As part of the analysis, we will also examine educational attainment and use a multiple-informants analysis to examine SES (see Statistical Analysis).  We will ensure that study participants are representative of the target population (i.e., women of higher and lower SES diagnosed with early stage breast cancer) by [CONTACT_369149] a combination of urban (Joanne Knight Breast Health Center, St. Louis, MO, [LOCATION_001] University School of Medicine, [LOCATION_001], NY, and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY) and rural (Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Lebanon, NH and Manchester, NH) settings as well as racially and ethnically diverse populations. The US Census Bureau rates the Bronx as the most diverse area in the US, with more than 50% of Hispanic or Latino origin91. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246] (one of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369089]) originate from approximately 80 countries, with varying race, ethnicity, and languages spoken (the majority of patients are Spanish and Mandarin Chinese speakers). In St. Louis, the proportion of African American women (approximately 23%) is higher than in the general US population. Dartmouth-Hitchcock serves a large and primarily rural population of patients in New England.  4.[ADDRESS_462214] chosen are paper-based and range from one to four pages in length. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060] (specifically designed for women of low SES and low health literacy) has a Flesh-Kincaid grade level of 6.5. The Option Grid was written in plain language (in collaboration with the Plain English Campaign: www.plainenglish.co.uk) but was not specifically designed for women of low SES with a Flesh-Kincaid grade level of 6.6.   Both interventions are delivered and used by [CONTACT_369150]. By [CONTACT_369151], we have facilitated a direct comparison.  Both interventions have been developed, tested, validated, and are already used in routine care (see below)59,94,95,97-99. 
 
26  4.4.1 Intervention 1: Option Grid The Option GridTM encounter decision aid for early stage breast cancer surgery is a one-page, evidence-based summary of available options presented in a tabular format (see Appendix A). The efficacy of Option GridTM decision aids has been tested in a stepped wedge trial, where they were shown to increase patients’ knowledge and SDM during the clinic visit59. Similar results were achieved using qualitative methods63,65,100,101. Option Grid decision aids are used in routine clinical practice and downloaded over 5,000 times a month (www.optiongrid.org)61. The Option Grid for breast cancer surgery was developed in 2010 and downloaded 1,346 times in 2016. It is evidence-based and was initially adapted from a web-based decision aid shown to facilitate readiness to decide and strengthen surgery intentions98,99.   4.4.2 Intervention 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369090] (see Appendix B). It uses the same evidence and integrates images and simpler text, thus exploiting pi[INVESTIGATOR_369091]73,75. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369092]. It was iteratively developed and tested in underserved community settings with lay women and breast cancer patients of low SES using CBPR97. We have tested its acceptability, feasibility, and perceived impact in [ADDRESS_462215] chosen outcome measures that are patient-centered and relevant to our target population with our patient and stakeholder partners. To accommodate varying levels of literacy and health literacy of our target group and to comply with patient partners’ advice, we will use validated short-form questionnaires whenever possible. All patient and stakeholder partners have deemed the chosen measures important and relevant, highlighting their impact on patients’ lives in both the short-term (e.g., treatment choice, anxiety) and longer-term (e.g., quality of life, decision regret). Aside from the Observer OPTION5 scale102, all are patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. All included scales and tests are validated and have been developed and tested with patients. The demographic questions and item assessing the amount of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by [CONTACT_369152].   
 
27  We will measure outcomes at baseline (T0), during the clinic visit (T1), immediately after the visit (T2), one week post-surgery or around the first post-operative visit (T3) and [ADDRESS_462216]-operative visit (T4). For all participants who receive surgery before May 2018, we will also measure decision regret and financial toxicity one year post-surgery (T5).   4.5.1 Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure (see Table 3) is the validated 16-item Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for breast cancer (see Appendix C), which includes a knowledge subscale89. The DQI, designed to be administered post-decision, will be assessed at T2 and T3. It aims to measure the extent to which patients are informed about their options, are involved in the decision-making process, and receive a surgery (mastectomy or BCS) aligned with their values, attitude towards risks, and preferences. It produces three scores: (1) knowledge, (2) concordance, and (3) decision process. Validation demonstrated good feasibility with minimal missing data and good 4-week retest reliability for both knowledge (ICC = 0.70) and concordance (ICC > 0.72). Discriminant validity was acceptable89.  Table 3.

We will also ask participants to estimate the out-of-pocket (OOP) portion of their medical expenses 
 
[ADDRESS_462217] derived from Wyatt’s work to assess the actual use of encounter decision aids56. Finally, we will use IntegRATE, a four-item generic patient-reported measure of integration of healthcare delivery111,112. At T2 and T3, we will also investigate each intervention’s patterns of use. At T2, the research assistant or patient associate will take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_369093]-consultation to determine how the intervention has been used and whether the patient/family and/or clinician have annotated it. At T3, participants will be asked to indicate how many times they used the intervention post-surgical consultation and whether family members, relatives, or caregivers have used the intervention. 4.6 Translation Procedure For Spanish speakers, we will use the existing certified Spanish translations of the DQI, PROMIS anxiety short form, decision regret, EQ-5D-5L, and Chew’s one item health literacy screening question and will translate CollaboRATE, IntegRATE, COST, and OOP expenses question into Spanish. For Mandarin Chinese speakers, we will use the certified translation of EQ-5D-5L, PROMIS anxiety short form, and decision regret. We will translate all other measures into simplified Mandarin Chinese in Year 1.  Our research group at the Preference Laboratory, Dartmouth College, has recently completed a review of best practices in translation of health-related materials for patients. On the basis of this review, we have developed a standard operating procedure for the translation of text into non-English languages comprising four stages:  1. Two translators who are suitably qualified and native speakers of the target language create independent translations of the original text; 2. A bilingual reviewer (who is a native speaker of the target language) compares the original text, Translation 1, and Translation 2, and either selects the preferred translation and offers revisions to the preferred translation, or produces a third translation that builds on the previous two; 3. The translation committee (i.e., two independent translators together with the bilingual reviewer) meets to review and reconcile translations by [CONTACT_21128]; 4. The resulting translation is tested via cognitive debrief interviews with a small sample of patients fluent in the target language (see section 4.5.4).  We have successfully adopted the above procedure in the translation of patient reported outcomes measures into Latin American Spanish113 and Polish.  We will follow the above steps for the translation of all study-related documents.  Spanish and Chinese interpreters or ‘language lines’ will also be available at each site before, during and after the clinic visit.  4.6.[ADDRESS_462218] the final translation of study documents. Participants in these interviews will be native speakers of the target language and identified through a purposive sampling strategy. Participants will be compensated the equivalent of $10 USD for their time. The bilingual reviewers will use the findings in the cognitive debrief interviews to finalize the translated study documents. 4.7 Procedure 4.7.1 Trial Setup Between November 2016 and May 2017, the study team will seek ethical approval from Dartmouth College’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) for the adaptation of the DQI and for Aims 1, 2, and 3. Dartmouth College’s CPHS will be the primary ethics committee reviewing those documents on behalf of Montefiore Medical Center. NYU School of Medicine and Washington University in St Louis will seek and obtain approval from their own committee for the protection of human subjects. We anticipate that ethical approval will be granted for all study activities by [CONTACT_58472] 2017.   In parallel, other study setup activities will include:  1) Recruiting a research assistant and patient associate at each site.  2) Designing all study documents in partnership with our patient partners, Community Advisory Board, and broader study team in preparation for the trial recruitment start date of September 2017.   3) Translating all study documents (outcome measures, information sheets, interventions, etc.) into Spanish and simplified Mandarin Chinese. We have allocated 10 months for the translation of these documents using the translation procedures outlined in section 4.5.3.   4) Development and launch of the study website by [CONTACT_369153] 2017.  5) Registration of trial on ClinicalTrials.gov.  6) Establishing the Community Advisory Board (see section 7, Engagement Plan).  7) Establishing the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.  8) Carrying-out initial study site visits (January 2017).   9) Ensuring that all relevant study team members and patient associates have undergone CITI training and made their COI declarations.   10) Training all clinicians prior to the recruitment start date. This is likely to occur in early September 2017.

Food and beverages will be served at each focus group meeting. 4.7.3 Screening for Inclusion in the Randomized Controlled Trial Insurance status (self-reported or obtained via EMR) will be used to screen for women of lower SES. For each included participant, we will check whether her income is consistent with the higher or lower SES group designation made at the initial screening or whether the patient belongs to the other group. As part of the analysis, we will also examine educational attainment and use a multiple-informants analysis to examine SES.  At each study site, our research assistants will screen for eligible participants using the inclusion criteria outlined in section 4.3.1. Eligible participants will be identified in advance of each breast clinic by [CONTACT_369154].   At the Joanne Knight Breast Health Center and D-H patients who are eligible will receive an information sheet describing the study, sent on behalf of the breast care team at least one week before their surgical consultation. The information sheet will be short, written using plain language and pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and carefully developed with our patient partners, patient associates, and Community Advisory Board to address the needs of women of lower SES and low literacy/low health literacy. An introduction letter will accompany the information sheet. The letter will explain that the research team will call them a few days before their surgical consultation to discuss the study, support their decision on whether or not to take part, and help them complete the short baseline questionnaire over the phone using standardized interviews should they decide to participate.  At NYU School of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center the research assistant will approach pre-screened patients when they come for surgical consultations and discuss the study and potential for participation while they are waiting to see the surgeon. Patients will receive the information sheet at this time. At all sites, the patients may also receive a letter signed by [CONTACT_369155].   4.7.[ADDRESS_462220] cancer and has completed all treatments (“patient associate”) will recruit and consent all eligible participants at each study site. Each patient associate will be recruited from breast cancer advocacy groups, existing patient networks, and contacts already established at each site. An effort will be made to recruit patient associates from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.   
 
[ADDRESS_462221] study based on her surgeon’s review of her medical record. Patients will have an opportunity to ask any questions they may have and decline participation in the study at this stage. Once all questions have been answered, if patients choose to participate, they will give verbal consent to take part in the study. Finally, the patient associate or research assistant will ask the patient a series of questions using standardized interviews to complete the baseline questionnaire. We have successfully used this approach with low SES groups before. An interpreter will also be involved when necessary.  At Montefiore Medical Center and NYU School of Medicine the study team will approach pre-screened and eligible patients when they come in for the surgical consultation. The research assistant and/or patient associate will introduce the study and discuss their interest in participation. Patients will receive the information sheet and may also receive a letter signed by [CONTACT_11065]. If they decide to participate, provide written consent and complete the baseline questionnaire before the surgical consultation. This recruitment approach will also be followed at D-H in scenarios where the surgeon hasn’t confirmed eligibility prior to the appointment with enough time given to conduct verbal consent and the baseline assessment over the phone.  At all four sites, in the event that a patient is unaware of her diagnosis prior to her surgical consultation, the surgeon will inform the patient of the study during the consultation and use the intervention (if in an intervention arm). After the appointment, the surgeon will introduce 
 
33  the study and notify study staff if the patient is interested in participation at which point the research staff will obtain written consent and administer the questionnaires from T0 and T2. The study staff will approach the patient and introduce the study if the surgeon doesn’t mention the study to the patient after the consultation. Additionally, at all four sites, we will recruit participants after their surgical consultation if they explicitly request this when first approached about the trial. For these patients, research staff will obtain written consent and administer the questionnaires from T0 and T2 after the patient has her surgical consultation.  See Appendix D for a sample information sheet and consent form.   At all study sites, the patient associate and/or research assistant will attend the clinic whenever eligible patients are scheduled to attend a surgical consultation. They will be notified that the eligible patient has arrived by [CONTACT_369156].   At the Joanne Knight Breast Health Center, surgeons will give a card with the study name [INVESTIGATOR_59260]’ contact [CONTACT_369157]. The patient associate and/or research assistant will approach all patients who leave the consultation room with a card. The patient associate and/or research assistant will then check eligibility with the patient, obtain the signed consent, and help the patient complete the first follow-up assessment (T2).   At D-H, if verbal consent and the baseline assessment were done over the phone, the patient associate and/or research assistant will obtain the written consent (either before or after the surgical consultation), and help the patient complete the first follow-up assessment (T2). If for any reason, the patient is deemed ineligible after their consultation with the surgeon, they will be unenrolled in the study.   At NYU School of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, the first follow-up assessment will also be completed immediately after the surgical consultation.   At all sites, the research assistant or patient associate will read the questions to patients who cannot read or write by [CONTACT_369158] a private room. We will document whether the questionnaires were read to the patient using a standardized interview and whether the assistance of an interpreter was needed. 4.7.[ADDRESS_462222] given informed consent and are seeing one of the participating clinicians will be allocated to the clinician’s corresponding arm (Option Grid, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060], or usual care).   
 
[ADDRESS_462223] clinical encounters with consented patients to assess the fidelity of intervention delivery (T1). After the visit, participants will be asked to complete a second questionnaire (T2). Two additional follow-up assessments will occur around 1-2 weeks (T3) and [ADDRESS_462224]- surgery (T4) (Fig. 5). For participants recruited in the first nine months of the trial, we will also conduct a follow-up assessment [ADDRESS_462225]-surgery (T5).  Follow up questionnaires will be administered in the clinic, when possible, and aligned with regularly scheduled return clinic visits. If this is not possible, follow-ups will be conducted either over the phone, online (sent as an email via REDCap), or on paper (sent via mail with a pre-stamped, self-addressed envelope).   To minimize respondent burden and disruption and to accommodate varying levels of literacy and health literacy, validated short-form questionnaires will be used. Each follow-up assessment (T2, T3, T4, and T5) comprises 10-[ADDRESS_462226] that T0 (baseline assessment) will take between 15 and 30 minutes. All subsequent assessments will take approximately 10 minutes.   For each assessment, the outcome measures will be combined into one questionnaire to improve ease of use (see Table 4).   Table 4.

We plan to share information on recruitment numbers with the core team on a weekly basis and with each clinic every two weeks. Should a participant drop out, the research assistant will notify the breast care team who will review the electronic medical record to identify a potential reason for attrition. We will specifically monitor recruitment in the lower SES strata on a weekly basis. Should recruitment in this group prove slower than expected, we will solicit the advice and expertise of our patient partners, patient associates, and Community Advisory Board members to identify solutions and implement additional recruitment strategies. 4.7.8 Tracking and Retaining Participants The research assistant or patient associate employed at each site will track participants and ensure that they are called in advance of the follow-up assessments and provided with a questionnaire in the format of their choice. Interpreter services will be used whenever necessary. Telephone calls will also be made by [CONTACT_369159].   Retention among patients of lower SES will be maximized by: - Using short-form validated measures; - Translating those measures into Spanish and simplified Mandarin Chinese; - Using interpreter services whenever necessary; - Calling (or emailing at Dartmouth) all participants three to five days before each follow-up assessment  is due, prompting patients to complete the questionnaires and offering to conduct a standardized interview over the phone. The latter is likely to be particularly helpful in patients of lower SES and lower literacy/health literacy; - Conducting follow-up assessments in-person when possible; - Giving patients a choice of questionnaire format for the completion of baseline and follow-up assessments (online via email, paper-based, or standardized interviews); - Compensating participants for their time: $[ADDRESS_462231] protected section of the website. We will provide supervision, feedback and additional training to clinicians and other study staff, as necessary at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months into recruitment. Feedback will be provided using a preliminary analysis of the audio recordings of selected consultations across all three arms and field-notes. 4.7.11 Reporting Plan and Study Termination Our reporting plan will diligently adhere to the updated guidelines set-out in the CONSORT 2010 statement for reporting randomized trials87 and will be sufficiently transparent and comprehensive to allow for assessment of the study’s internal and external validity.  For participants recruited in the first nine months of the study, the study will end after completing the T5 assessment ([ADDRESS_462232]-surgery). For all other participants, the study will end [ADDRESS_462233] been conducted (where applicable). Depending on the participant, the Aim [ADDRESS_462234] deviation between patients in the intervention arms compared to usual care is 12.00, and that a within-physician intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.05 is reasonable. This ICC is justified because treatment varies within clinic, thereby [CONTACT_369160]. We assume that four physicians will participate in the study at each of the four clinics (at least one assigned to each of the three trial arms at each center) and assume a patient attrition rate of 20%. Under these assumptions, a study of 1,100 participants (68.75 participants per physicians and 366.66 per treatment group) has power of greater than 99.8% 
 
[ADDRESS_462235] cancer diagnoses and a lower number of eligible patients than planned based on the feasibility assessments (see reasons in modification letter), the sample size has been revised to 600 participants. The power will remain above 80% for all primary hypotheses.  A crucial feature of this power calculation is that the design-effect equals 4.04, implying that approximately 4 times as many patients are needed to obtain the same power as for a study with patient-level randomization. Power remains above the traditional 80% threshold with an ICC greater than 0.19, implying that the power remains adequate even if the level of clustering of patients within physicians is greater than anticipated. Further, the attrition rate of 20% is expected to be an overestimate given the brevity of the trial. The standard deviation between patients’ DQI values deliberately errs on the side of an overestimate; hence, power may be substantially greater. For hypothesis 2, we are basing the effect size estimation on the comparison between Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369094]. Because we anticipate obtaining a similar number of women in the higher and lower SES categories, the same power calculation is performed on a sample size of half the size. With 550 patients in total (34.375 patients on average per physician), under the same assumptions as above, the power for this subgroup test is 99% with ICC = 0.05 and 80% with ICC = 0.175.  For Aim 2, the power of the test for disparities between higher and lower SES is necessarily lower than the overall test at the same effect size, as four groups are compared (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369095], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369096], Option Grid and usual care higher SES, Option Grid and usual care lower SES). However, because patient SES varies within physician, power can be conservatively computed as if the patient-level variance was doubled and the total number of patients halved. If the true difference in the effect of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369097] 8.[ADDRESS_462236] above 80%. With a revised sample size of 600 participants, the power is unlikely to reach 80%. However, given those power calculations are resting on assumptions that may not be entirely accurate, we will know once we start the analysis if we have enough power for aim 2 hypotheses with a sample size of 600 participants. A significant finding is even more likely to be obtained if the estimated variability in the data turns out to be much smaller than assumed here. It could indeed be the case with the revised sample size. It is not critical to account for multiple testing because in both the primary (Aim 1) and secondary (Aim 2) analyses, a single pair of groups is compared.  We are assuming an effect size of 9.[ADDRESS_462237] cancer surgery32,41,115. 4.8.2 Analysis Plan All data will be entered into REDCap, a secure research electronic data capture database (developed for the trial), and subsequently transferred to Stata for analysis. Initial examination of data will include descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, and histograms in order to identify outliers and missing data. All participants will be asked to indicate at T2 which 
 
[ADDRESS_462238], the transcripts will be coded to identify DQI items and instructions that require adaptation. In a second and more detailed analysis, the interview transcripts will be coded according to all the themes discussed in the interviews, including spontaneously emerging themes. Similar codes will be merged and subsequently grouped into families of codes and networks. Dual independent coding will be used for 100% of all interview transcripts, to ensure reliability of coding and to agree the themes and family of codes for all remaining interview transcripts. Discrepancies among raters will be discussed until agreement is reached.    Aim 1: Assess the comparative effectiveness of two effective encounter decision aids (Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) against usual care, on shared decision-making, decision quality, treatment choice and other direct outcomes in women, and differentially by [CONTACT_45520].  We will first perform separate analyses for each follow-up period using linear and logistic regression models as appropriate for continuous (decision quality, SDM, quality of life, anxiety, decision regret, and IntegRATE) and binary (treatment choice) outcomes, respectively. The results will provide potentially valuable insights into how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_369098]. Outcomes measured multiple times after T0 (anxiety, regret, decision quality, and financial toxicity) may also be analyzed using a longitudinal model. If the interventions are found to have an effect, a secondary analysis that adds predictors for the number of prior Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369099].  We will adopt a regression framework for all analyses as it allows seamless transition between basic analyses involving a single predictor (or two indicators corresponding to each intervention versus the comparator) and more complex analyses involving additional predictors (mediation variables, control covariates, time-trends, interaction terms or effect modifiers). Further, the regression framework allows clustering of observations due to repeated measurements on patients across time, nesting of health professionals within sites, and patients within health professionals, to be accurately accounted for using mixed-effect regression models117 or generalized estimating equations118,119. Multiple comparisons will be accounted for using Scheffe’s method120.  The secondary outcomes (SDM, anxiety, integration of healthcare delivery, decision regret, quality of life and financial toxicity) have in excess of [ADDRESS_462239] educational attainment. For each included participant, we will check whether income and education confirm the initial screening allocation to higher or lower SES group or whether the patient belongs to the other group. The three measures of baseline socio-economic status: (1) insurance status, (2) highest educational attainment, and (3) median household income, will be analyzed separately for a multiple informants analysis122, or, provided they are not excessively collinear, we will enter them in the model together and test their combined effect. For income, we will use a poverty income ratio: the ratio of household income accounting for household size and poverty line published by [CONTACT_369161]123. To aid interpretation of our results, we will report the consequence of reassigning a patient from above median SES group to below median SES group, even if for added precision, it makes sense to base significance tests on continuous measures.  To gain insight into whether the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369100], we will add each SES measure and its interaction with the intervention indicator variables to the model. If the SES intervention interaction is non-significant, we will remove them from the model and test if the overall effect of SES is significant. Otherwise, we will perform stratified analyses of the interventions’ effects by [CONTACT_369162]. 4.8.4 Analyses Corresponding to Aim 2 Aim 2: Measure the effect of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369064]-making (decision quality, knowledge and shared decision-making) and treatment choice, and conduct an exploratory analysis of the mediation and moderation effects.  A logistic regression model will be used to test for differences in decision quality, knowledge, participation in SDM, and treatment choice between the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369101], within subpopulations (higher SES versus lower SES). A reduction of disparity due to the interventions will be claimed if the effect of SES on outcomes is significantly smaller for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369102]-up. As for Aim 1, a linear regression model will be used for the decision quality analysis while an analogous set of other predictors will be included as covariates in the model. The assumptions of the models will be evaluated for adequacy using residual analysis and other model fit diagnostics121. Our exploratory mediation analyses seek to identify and explicate the mechanism or process that underlies the relationship between the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369103] a dependent variable via the inclusion of a third explanatory variable, known as a mediator variable (e.g., knowledge, values, SDM). We are specifically interested in whether interventions operate through the mediator as opposed to directly affecting the outcome. We will perform these analyses even if the findings from Aim 1 and Aim 2 (hypothesis 1) are non-significant in order to determine whether the null effect was due to a null effect of the intervention on the mediator or a null effect of the mediator on the outcome. To determine the generalizability of these mechanisms and identify subpopulations for whom mediation is most pronounced, we will compare the mediation effects across different subgroups (e.g., higher SES versus lower SES).  
 
40  The traditional and often-used approach to estimating mediation effects is the causal steps approach, which originated in Baron and Kenny (1986)124. However, due to the limitations of that approach, we will estimate the mediation effect using the product of coefficients method125. Standard errors will be evaluated using the bootstrap126 or the PRODCLIN program127. Software exists for sensitivity analysis to violations of sequential ignorability and other assumptions required for causality in mediation analyses128,129. We will apply this software and any additional procedures available to our analyses in order to obtain the most robust and defendable results. 4.8.5 Analyses Corresponding to Aim 3 Aim 3: Explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids’ sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model.  We will use a framework analysis, guided by [CONTACT_369163] (NPT)130,131, having successfully used this approach previously63,101,132,133. Observations and field-notes will be included in the analysis. Initial descriptive codes will be generated by [CONTACT_369164]. In-vivo coding will also be used to capture other naturally occurring exchanges. Categorical codes that group initial and in-vivo codes will be developed in a third round of coding. In addition, 100 photos of the interventions taken at T2 (approximately 50 of Option Grid and 50 of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) will be included in the analysis to answer questions 1 and 2. Triangulation of data will also be performed.   NPT was developed to understand how complex interventions become implemented in routine healthcare settings96. NPT is built around four theoretical constructs: 1) Sense-making: processes of individual and communal sense-making of a complex intervention regarding its use and value; 2) Participation: processes of ‘cognitive participation’ that promote or hinder users’ buy-in and commitment to the intervention; 3) Action: processes of ‘collective action’ that determine or hinder whether the intervention is being used by [CONTACT_369165]; and 4) Monitoring: Processes of communal and individual appraisal of the effect of the intervention. We will use NPT as an analytical lens to consider the data collected according to our hypotheses and the following five questions: (1) how the interventions were perceived and used in and outside the clinical encounter (including with family and caregivers), (2) preferred ways for introducing and using the intervention in routine clinical settings, from several perspectives: patients, family, health professionals, administrators (3) perceived fit in clinic workflow as well as reported barriers and facilitators to routine integration, (4) other perceived patient-, physician- and system-level barriers and facilitators to routine use, and (5) perceived generalizability and feasibility in routine care.   4.8.[ADDRESS_462240] several secondary data analyses:   Cost discussions analysis In this analysis we will aim to (1) examine the prevalence and characteristics of cost discussions in the surgical consultations (2) investigate whether having a mention of cost in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369104], the length of the cost 
 
41  conversation, and whether surgeons make referrals to outside providers or resources for patients to learn more about costs, and (3) study whether patients’ financial toxicity, age, race, and/or ethnicity influence our outcomes. Our primary outcome measure will be whether or not cost was discussed in the surgical consultation. Our secondary outcome measures will include who initiated the cost conversations and the length of the conversations, if they occurred. We will also explore the number of times cost was discussed, and whether a referral had been made to address cost.  We will adapt a checklist to analyze the cost discussions from previous published literature and use it to code the recordings.134,135 Reviewers will use a combination of audio and transcription files to code each consultation. Two reviewers will dual code a subsample of the recordings, after which kappa and percent agreement will be calculated until kappa reached .75 and percent agreement is over 90%. Once these threshholds are met, the two reviewers will independently code the remaining consultations. A third reviewer will code a 20% subsample of all consultations to ensure consistency.    We will link our analysis with patient-reported demographics (including age, race, and socioeconomic status), patient-reported financial toxicity at one week and [ADDRESS_462241]-surgery, and surgery choice as documented in the patient’s electronic health record.   We will conduct linear or logistic regression analyses to examine whether our primary and secondary outcomes varied by [INVESTIGATOR_216] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369105]. Option Grid and usual care). We will explore whether financial toxicity scores, age, race, or ethnicity influenced our primary outcome. We will also conduct logistic regression analyses to evaluate whether the presence of a cost discussion influenced surgical choice.  Treatment discourse analysis In this analysis we will aim to (1) examine whether and how breast cancer surgeons give surgical recommendations to early stage breast cancer patients eligible for both lumpectomy and mastectomy, (2) compare surgeon recommendation talk with suggested shared decision making practices, and (3) study the impact effect of clinician decision aid use (Option Grid and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060]) on communication, conversational turn-taking, and surgical stance, and overall surgical recommendations. We will compare to usual care in the context of the decision about lumpectomy or mastectomy for early stage breast cancer.  We will analyze a sample of surgical consultations transcripts. Roughly an equal number of transcripts in each group will be coded. We will code transcripts until we reach saturation in themes (estimated at approximately thirty transcripts per arm).   The study team will devise the codebook by [CONTACT_369166]’ and Barnes’ 2017 paper “Treatment recommendation as actions.”[ADDRESS_462242] cancer surgery decision, and removing the “opportunity space” code which identified turn-constructional unit boundaries by [CONTACT_369167]. We also added the following codes based on a preliminary review of transcripts: “offers comparable options,” “offers time to deliberate,” “patient states preferences,” and “patient preferences incorporated”.   
 
42  We will code the transcripts using qualitative coding software (NVivo and Atlas.ti) by [CONTACT_369168] a 20% subsample by a second reviewer. The study team will be available for review when questions or discrepancies arise.  Aberrant transcripts in which only one option was made available by [CONTACT_369169] (as opposed to physician preference) will be excluded. Codes will be applied according to the agreed upon code description and the context of the transcript. Coding specifics are as follows:  • We will only factors relevant to the breast cancer surgery decision. For example, we will not code detailed information on different types of radiation will, but we will code radiation as a consideration for the lumpectomy decision. • We will not focus on the surgical logistics after a decision has been made by [CONTACT_102].  • We will not code standard of care surgical treatments. For example, we will not code details about the sentinel node biopsy (performed during both mastectomy and lumpectomy) because this procedure is standard of care and does not involve comparable options.  We will code all conversations with all clinicians (including surgeons, residents, and medical students)about the early stage breast cancer surgery decision. Conversations between patients and their family members outside of the surgical consultation are occasionally recorded. Although these conversations will not be coded as they are not systematically included for all patients, interesting excerpts about the surgical decision may be marked for later consideration. After reading a transcript, coders will utilize the “memos” feature to document notes and comments on the transcripts.  We will identify major and minor themes from transcripts based on our study framework. We will select representative quotes to illustrate these themes. Additionally, a trained discourse analyst will conduct in-depth analysis of transcripts identified by [CONTACT_369170].  Analysis of spoken plain language   We have three primary aims in this secondary analysis:  1. Qualitatively determine the extent to which clinicians use plain language in the context of breast cancer surgical visits,  2. Quantitatively develop a ‘listenability’ score and determine clinicians’ individual listenability scores to analyze how clinicians communicate with their patients,  3. Compare the qualitative and quantitative results across arms and according to select patient characteristics, and 4. Use existing readability software to analyze the de-identified transcripts for readability scores.  Qualitative analysis  We will use Atlas.ti to conduct a dual independent qualitative analysis of the transcripts. We will perform a deductive analysis using the US federal plain language guidelines137-139. We will develop a codebook from these guidelines as a team, pi[INVESTIGATOR_369106] 2-[ADDRESS_462243] analyses based on listenability scores and participant characteristics. Additionally, we will use readability software on each de-identified transcript to determine the “readability score” of each included transcript.  4.8.[ADDRESS_462244] data collection will be via online questionnaires (i.e., at T0, T2, T3, T4, and T5), which provide opportunities for preventing and monitoring missing data. We will offer other formats for questionnaire completion (including paper and standardized interviews), thus minimizing missing data. We will prompt each patient, by [CONTACT_756] (or email at Dartmouth), to complete the follow-up questionnaires (i.e., T3, T4, and T5) or reach them in the clinic during their post-surgery appointments. Given the brevity of the trial and the procedures described above, we do not anticipate more than 5% of missing data. However, should there be more than a trivial amount of missing data, we will use multiple imputation to cope with missing baseline, interim, and outcome data. We will record and report all reasons for dropout and missing data. Multiple imputation creates multiple completed data sets by [CONTACT_369171]142. This approach will address both generalizability and causal validity bias. We will also examine sensitivity of inferences. 4.8.8 Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects The main goals of the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) analyses are to estimate treatment effects in clinically relevant subgroups and to predict whether an individual might benefit from exposure to the decision aid. As the HTE analyses are exploratory rather than hypothesis-driven, exploratory subgroup analyses will be conducted to identify hypotheses for future evaluation. Patient characteristics will be considered for treatment by [CONTACT_369172], age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site143. As described in the analytic plans for testing interactions by [CONTACT_369173] [ADDRESS_462245] submission and review process for formal requests to make use of the data so as to prevent 
 
44  duplication in analysis and publication. Given the data sharing plans, we will provide a detailed description of these plans to all participants during the informed consent process to ensure that participants are aware of all potential uses of data.   4.9 Data Management Data management for the study will be done through REDCap, a HIPAA-compliant web-based data management system. REDCap will be hosted at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center for data collected at DHMC. Data collected from all other sites will be hosted on REDCap at Dartmouth College. REDCap is designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources144. Access will only be granted to study team members designated to manage the study data and will require a dedicated username [CONTACT_2383]. Study team members with access at participating study sites will only have access to the data at their corresponding institution This database management system is designed to comply with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.   Data entry into REDCap will be done by [CONTACT_369174]. Samples of the data collection forms will be available once they are finalized.  In addition, each study site will have a data-protected, encrypted external hard drive for the local storage of sensitive study-related materials. Each of the study sites will return the hard drives to Dartmouth College at the end of the trial. Dartmouth will store the encrypted data for six years after the conclusion of the trial, after which all data will be destroyed. No personally identifiable data will be transferred or stored outside of REDCap and encrypted hard drives.  Signed consent forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a secure location at each study site and kept for six years after the conclusion of the trial.  4.9.[ADDRESS_462246] (DSMB) will be appointed to provide additional oversight in the trial. The DSMB will meet and review data bi-annually throughout the project. The DSMB will include key stakeholders in the participating communities (one patient representative and breast surgeon) as well as academics with expertise in statistics, patient engagement in health care, breast cancer surgery, and health disparities. The DSMB will operate independently from the study sponsor.  The DSMB will review the protocol, data collected to date, advise the PI [INVESTIGATOR_369107]. The DSMB recommendations will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_369108], which meets quarterly (see section 7.2). Those recommendations will also be fed back to PCORI every six months as part of the bi-annual reports. The Trial Steering Group will consider all DSMB recommendations and revise relevant aspects of the trial accordingly. All data will be reviewed for protocol adherence, including a data verification check that the appropriate outcome measures are given at the appropriate time points. 
 
[ADDRESS_462247] any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Adverse Events (AE) in the trial that would require immediate reporting. There are no invasive procedures related to the interventions. However, some patients, particularly those with diagnosed mental illness or patients who are finding it difficult to cope with their recent cancer diagnosis, may find it stressful to be randomized to one of the two encounter decision aids or to usual care. All members of the research and medical care team who are involved in patient recruitment and follow-up assessments will be asked:   - Ahead of recruitment: To identify available counseling/psychological support. This information will be included in the cover letter and information sheet; - During recruitment: To refer participants (who are distressed as a result of participating in the trial) to relevant counseling/psychological support services;  - During recruitment: To remind the participant that she is free to withdraw from the trial at any time without providing any reason; - During recruitment: To notify the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_369109]. - During recruitment: All research assistants and patient associates will know who to refer patients to when patients have clinical questions or need additional information or support.   In addition, during each DSMB meeting, the DSMB will review data on subject withdrawals from the study and will be provided with the stated reason for withdrawal and the study subject anxiety score (measured  PROMIS) for each withdrawal.  If for any reason, an SAE or AE were reported to the Principal Investigator (PI), the IRB at Dartmouth would be immediately notified as well as the appropriate safety board at the participating sites. The DSMB would convene urgently and review the SAE/AE.  [ADDRESS_462248] cancer treatment decisions and address disparities in this area. Currently, women of low SES are more likely to make treatment decisions based on incomplete or uninformed preferences, potentially leading to poor decision quality, poorer quality of life, and decision regret. This study hopes to identify solutions that effectively improve outcomes across socioeconomic strata and reduce disparities in quality of care (Aim 1 and 2). Addressing the current disparity in care based on SES requires effective dissemination of the results, maximizing implementation potential, and  embedding these protocols into routine care (Aim 3)  
 
[ADDRESS_462249] access to the study findings and are able to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_369110](s) in routine clinical settings. In order to promote access to patients and other non-academic stakeholders, we will publish all study outputs in open-access journals. Recently, some journals (i.e., New England Journal of Medicine) have begun including a short video abstract alongside the article. We will try to publish in academic journals with this video functionality with the aim of making the material accessible to a broader audience.   Given the vast amount of information available, many clinicians do not have time to keep up with all research literature and instead focus on clinical practice guidelines145. We hope that recommendations arising from this study about optimal ways to engage patients of low SES in breast cancer surgery decisions can be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines at the participating institutions and beyond.   We will also present the findings at up to four domestic and international scientific conferences (e.g., International Shared Decision Making Conference) and professional meetings to promote wider dissemination of the study findings. We hope to do a pre-conference workshop in order to train clinicians using interactive role-play and instructive videos (replicating the training of physicians in our study). It is our hope that these dissemination activities will be enhanced through networking and have a ripple effect where workshop participants will return to their own workplaces and integrate the use of successful intervention(s) into clinical practice.  5.1.2 Patient and Advocacy Organizations We will prioritize working with national groups (e.g., Susan G Komen, Breast Cancer Alliance) and local patient advocacy groups at each participating site (e.g., Breakfast Club, Inc., Living Beyond Breast Cancer) to disseminate findings to patients, their families and caregivers, and other community stakeholders. Our research team members have established relationships with several national breast cancer and generic patient and advocacy organizations (e.g., e-
 
[ADDRESS_462250], Society for Participatory Medicine), which we will approach to promote the dissemination of our findings. We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a final report that is accessible and readable to patients and other non-academic stakeholder partners, using plain language and a lay summary. This report will serve as a summary of project findings and recommendations for implementation among organizations, health professionals, patients, and other community stakeholders. We will also create newsletters and press releases using lay language. All documents will be written in partnership with our patient partners and CAB members, and they will be freely available on the study website. 5.1.[ADDRESS_462251] Surgeons, American Society of Clinical Oncology, American College of Surgeons Diversity Issues Committee, International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration, American College of Radiology Imaging Network, and Society for Medical Decision Making, among many others. We will disseminate our findings and successful intervention(s) to these influential professional organizations to inform practice recommendations and implement lasting changes in routine care. Further, Dartmouth-Hitchcock is part of the High Value Healthcare Collaborative, a consortium of [ADDRESS_462252]. 5.1.4 Social Media and Lay Press Increasingly, patients desire to be involved in the decisions of their care and want information that is easily accessible, relevant, and tailored to their own needs146. With the help of community members and patients participating in our study, we hope to create an informative, accesible video through YouTube to share the experience of study participants, the results of this study,  and how they can empower patients to be more active in their healthcare choices. Additionally, we hope to provide patient-focused informational summaries and diagrams that focus on the key points and are easy to understand.  We will also use social media and partner with patient advocacy groups and patient engagement experts (e.g., e-Patient Dave, e-Patients.net, Mighty Casey) that are active on Twitter and other social media platforms to disseminate key study messages. We will work with our CAB and selected patient engagement experts (as listed above) to plan an effective social media campaign using regular Twitter feeds, blogs on the study website, and planned “tweet chats”. We will also reach the lay public who may not have access to social media by [CONTACT_369175], lay press, and magazine print. 5.1.[ADDRESS_462253] cancer care ([CONTACT_369216], [CONTACT_369217], [CONTACT_85022], [CONTACT_369218], [CONTACT_369219] and [CONTACT_369209]-Lima). We have also involved several patient and stakeholder partners who will be engaged in all aspects of the project, including its dissemination and implementation. We have designed the project around a representative sample of patients, which determined our choice of four geographically diverse sites by [CONTACT_369176]. We will ensure that the findings are effectively disseminated at each site as well as nationally using the channels listed above.   Another clear barrier to disseminating findings to patients, clinicians, and non-academic audiences is the difficulty in communicating information in a way that is clear and meaningful to each stakeholder group. We will work closely with our patient partners and clinician stakeholder partners to produce reports, newsletters, and informative videos that are understandable and pertinent.

Our patient and stakeholder partners immediately echoed those findings and insisted on the short-term (e.g., increased anxiety) and long-term implications (such as poor quality of life) of playing a passive role in healthcare decisions and failing to make an informed choice about breast cancer treatments.  From the start, we have engaged patient partners from different locations (New Hampshire, [LOCATION_004], and Missouri) and backgrounds. We have also engaged the broader stakeholder community in developi[INVESTIGATOR_369113], adapted from the validated Option Grid for women of low SES. Our stakeholder partners included breast surgeons, a parish nurse, two social workers, the executive director of the Upper Valley Haven (a nonprofit organization that provides temporary shelter and educational programming for homeless families and adults), and a breast cancer patient advocate who facilitates the “Living Beyond Breast Cancer” telephone group (three of which have been named on in this protocol). All patient and stakeholder partners have been actively involved in regular research meetings and have attended a focus group where the research questions, study outcomes, study design, and characteristics of the study participants were discussed. Their input has significantly shaped and influenced the study design. For instance, they have identified ways to minimize disruption to study participants by [CONTACT_369183] a patient associate and by [CONTACT_369184]-form validated measures whenever possible. To promote retention among women with varying literacy and health literacy levels, our patient partners suggested calling or emailing participants before each follow-up assessment was due and offering to complete the questionnaire on the phone using standardized interviews.  Our patient and stakeholder partners were also involved in identifying the goals and outcomes of the interventions. Our patient partners emphasized the surge of fear and anxiety associated with their breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment decisions. They also underscored the impact of the diagnosis and treatment on their quality of life. One of our patient partners recalled having trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_369114]. Our patient partners felt that it was essential to measure anxiety and quality of life. These measures were thus chosen and reviewed with them.  Finally, our patient and stakeholder partners were involved in writing and reviewing the Research Plan and Abstract. They helped us simplify language for the public abstract and ensure that their views were accurately represented. 
 
[ADDRESS_462268] cancer is emotionally sensitive and anxiety provoking, the research team (in consultation with patient partners) has deliberately chosen to include one patient associate at each site. The patient associate is a former breast cancer patient who will be recruited at each study site from local breast cancer patient groups or advocacy programs. She will partner with each research assistant by [CONTACT_369185], informing, and gaining patients’ informed consents in clinics. She will receive appropriate research and CITI training. She will also collect baseline and follow-up data with the research assistant and conduct some Aim [ADDRESS_462269]. Lastly, the patient associate will be involved in analyzing the data. One of our patient partners strongly advocated for including a patient associate because, in her words, a former patient “has already been through similar experiences” and will approach patients from a more empathic perspective.  We recognize that patient groups at each site will vary. To meet site-specific needs and be consistent with the CBPR approach, we will include Community Advisory Board (CAB) members from each study site, who will monitor and report back to the steering group. The CAB will include multiple stakeholders whose role is to meet quarterly, examine trial progress, and report findings to the steering committee. The patient associates will also be invited to join all CAB meetings. One member of the CAB (as well as all patient partners named as key personnel) will be invited to attend all Trial Steering Group meetings and relay the CAB’s discussion and action points:  - A Trial Steering Group that will involve all key personnel (including patient and stakeholder partners and invited CAB members) will meet every three months using videoconferencing; - Research Team meetings will be held on a monthly basis and will include key personnel from each study site including patient and stakeholder partners.  In addition, all study documents including information sheets, consent forms, questionnaires, and interview schedules will be developed with patient partners, patient associates, and the CAB. 7.[ADDRESS_462270] through and after recruitment is complete. The interview guide will assess the patient associate’s feelings about research and their involvement with the research team, recruiting patients, challenges they face, and their thoughts about the involvement of patient associates in future research. Patient associates also sent reflections and notes intermittently to the study team. An external researcher will also interview WMM patient partners about their participation in the study. The interview guide will ask about the patient partner’s engagement with the research team and their experiences on with the various groups involved in the study (e.g., monthly 
 
56  study meeting, quarterly trial steering group meeting). A research team member will interview patients that sit on the CAB to learn more about the distinguishing features of the CAB and the patients’ experience on this board.

All major decisions will be made collaboratively and discussed at scheduled meetings with the research team (including patient and stakeholder partners) or via email correspondence for any urgent matters.    
 
58  8 Ethical Considerations Human subjects will be involved in this research in:  - The adaptation of the DQI subscale for women of lower SES in year 1; - Cognitive debrief interviews to test translation of study documents; - Focus groups to test the information sheet and informed consent form; - The randomized controlled trial in years 1, 2, and 3 (Aims 1 and 2); - Interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions’ sustained use (Aim 3).  In designing this study, we have taken steps to minimize the probability and magnitude of all or any physical or psychological harm to human subjects. We have also ensured that any potential risks are offset by [CONTACT_369188] a diagnosis of breast cancer in the future. All participants will be able to provide voluntary informed consent prior to data collection. All data collected will be stored securely with restricted access, thereby [CONTACT_369189]. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained from the Dartmouth College Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) prior to the involvement of human subjects in the research. We will adhere strictly to all protocols and ensure that all potential risks to human subjects are reviewed by [CONTACT_259355] (see section 6 Timeline). 8.1 Adapting the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) Subscale (Year 1) 8.1.1 Risk to Human Subjects Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design In preparation for the comparative effectiveness trial, we will adapt the “What Matters Most to You” subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument. We will conduct up to 45 semi-structured interviews with women of lower SES at all four cancer centers involved in the trial. As mentioned in the Research Strategy section, we will include women over 18 years of age of lower SES who are uninsured or on Medicaid or Medicare without supplemental insurance (or ACA marketplace plans) who have completed treatments in the past three years. We will exclude women over [ADDRESS_462275] information on participant characteristics (i.e., age, race, ethnicity, median household income, insurance status, highest educational attainment, and health literacy). The interviews will seek to understand which factors affect women’s treatment decisions related to breast cancer in women of lower SES. We will remove any identifying information from the audio-recording transcripts. We will not require participants to provide written consent to take part in the interviews but will audio-record participants’ verbal consent at the interview’s outset. At the Joanne Knight Breast Health Center, written informed consent will be obtained. Each audio recording will be labeled with a unique, anonymous study identification (SI) number. A record of the names, contact 
 
59  details of the participants, and their unique SI numbers will be stored securely in the REDCap database and separately from the audio recordings. Potential Risks We do not anticipate any physical, financial, legal, or other risks to the interview participants beyond those of natural occurrence. We anticipate potential risks to be limited to psychological discomfort. If this were to occur, we will immediately terminate the interview and ensure that appropriate support (such as access to a psychologist or social worker) is provided. Interviews will be conducted in private. 8.1.[ADDRESS_462276] Risks Recruitment and Informed Consent Eligible participants will be identified by [CONTACT_3252]-investigators and stakeholder partners at each participating site and through existing patient support and advocacy groups. Participants’ names and contact [CONTACT_369190]. No personally identifiable information will be transferred or stored outside the REDCap and encrypted hard drives. Eligible participants will be sent an information sheet by [CONTACT_369191]. Subsequently, potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_369192]. To facilitate recruitment, we will offer $[ADDRESS_462277] on them or on the medical care they receive. Participant compensation of $[ADDRESS_462278] drives and in the REDCap database. Anonymized data will be retained for six years after the conclusion of the study, per Dartmouth’s CPHS requirements, and then destroyed. Although potential risks to patients are minimal, the Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the interview data at their October 2017 meeting. We do not foresee any risks or adverse events.  Interview recordings will be transcribed using a HIPAA-compliant company. Recording files and subsequent transcripts will be transferred using a secure FTP.  
 
60  8.2 Years 1, 2, and 3: Randomized Controlled Trial (Aims 1 and 2) 8.2.1 Risk to Human Subjects Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design We plan to recruit 600 women (approximately 300 higher SES and approximately 300 lower SES). Participants eligible for the trial will be women (a) with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA); (b) eligible for both BCS and mastectomy; (c) at least 18 years old; and (d) with at least a basic comprehension (6th grade level) of English, Spanish or Mandarin Chinese (e) assigned female sex at birth. We will exclude: - Transgender men and women; - Women who have undergone prophylactic mastectomy; - Women with diagnosis of psychosis or severe dementia; - Women with inflammatory breast carcinoma.   Sources of Materials Using five questionnaires (at T0, T2, T3, T4, and T5), we will collect information on primary and secondary outcome measures. The questionnaires will also assess patient characteristics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, median household income, insurance status, highest educational attainment, and health literacy). All information will be stored securely on the REDCap database and in encrypted external drives. Potential Risks We do not anticipate any physical, financial, legal, or other risks to the participants beyond those of natural occurrence. We anticipate potential risks to be limited to psychological discomfort. If this were to occur, we would ensure that appropriate support (such as access to a psychologist or social worker) is made available at each participating site. 8.2.[ADDRESS_462279]. Louis will receive an information sheet and an introduction letter in the mail in advance of their surgical consultation. The information sheet will be short, written using plain language, and include pi[INVESTIGATOR_369116].  The letter will explain that a patient associate (i.e., a former breast cancer patient) or research assistant will call during the week before the consultation to answer any questions about the study, discuss the consent process, and help complete baseline questionnaire should they wish to participate. Each eligible patient will be told (in letter and on the phone/face-to-face) that she is potentially eligible to participate in the study but that eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_369193]. Once all questions have been answered, patients will give verbal consent to take part in the study and, if her surgon confirms her eligibility, a written consent following the consultation.  At other sites, the patient associate or research assistant will be in the clinic to meet the patients before the surgical consultation. Together with the patient associate and research assistant, the patients will have an opportunity to (a) review the information sheet if they have not yet had a chance to do so; (b) ask any questions they may have about the study; (c) give 
 
61  consent, should they wish to take part; and (d) complete the baseline questionnaire before seeing their surgeon.  Participants will be subsequently allocated to receiving Option Grid, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369060], or usual care depending on the surgeon they are scheduled to see that day. The purpose of involving a patient associate is to promote patient-centeredness and facilitate recruitment in a context that is highly sensitive and emotional for potential participants given their recent cancer diagnosis. All signed consent forms will be stored securely in locked cabinets at each study site and collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_369117].   Protections Against Risks We anticipate minimal potential risks. First, privacy of individuals and confidentiality of data will be protected using the following procedures. Information on eligible participants collected at each study sites prior to consent and in the questionnaires after consent will only be shared with IRB-trained researchers from Dartmouth College and subcontracting institutions. It will be stored securely on the REDCap database. Names and contact [CONTACT_369194].  Patients who have consented to take part in the study will be assigned a unique, anonymous study identification number. All identifying patient information will be deleted prior to analysis. Any printed forms with patient data (including the consent forms) will be stored in a locked cabinet or shredded. All digital data will be stored in encrypted external hard drives and in the REDCap database. Anonymized data will be retained for six years after the conclusion of the study, per Dartmouth’s CPHS requirements, and then destroyed. Paper-based signed consent forms will be shredded six years post study completion date.  As part of the standard consent process, participants will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time, without providing any reason or any impact on them or on the care they receive. Participant compensation of $[ADDRESS_462280]-visit assessment in clinic, as well as subsequent $15 gift cards for each follow-up questionnaire, has been carefully chosen and discussed with our patient and stakeholder partners so as not to exert undue influence on patient consent. 8.3 Interviews, field-notes and observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions’ sustained use (Aim 3) 8.3.1 Risk to Human Subjects Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design In order to facilitate implementation in routine clinical settings, we will assess the perceived acceptability and feasibility of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_369118]. We will also assess perceived patient-, physician-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to routine use and explore strategies for promoting the interventions’ sustained use. At each site, we will select a purposive sample of up to [ADDRESS_462281] completed the final follow-up assessment (T4). We will also encourage a family member, caregiver, or close relative to attend the interview and share their views. Patients will be compensated with 
 
62  a $[ADDRESS_462282] drives.  Potential Risks We do not anticipate any physical, financial, legal, or other risks to the participants beyond those of a natural occurrence. Interviews will be conducted in private, and no identifying information or information on a participant’s health status will be actively sought. We anticipate potential risks to be limited to psychological discomfort. If this were to occur, we would ensure that appropriate support (such as access to a psychologist or social worker) is made available at each participating site. 8.3.[ADDRESS_462283] Risks Recruitment and Informed Consent In Years 2 and 3, and after the patient’s T4 follow-up assessment has been completed, we will recruit a convenience sample of participants who have taken part in the randomized controlled trial to ensure involvement of patients of varying SES, trial arms, age, race, ethnicity, and language spoken. We will contact [CONTACT_369195] a telephone semi-structured interview. Verbal consent will be audio-recorded on the telephone at the interview onset.  Once the last patient has been recruited for these T4 interviews, we will recruit a small sample of up to [ADDRESS_462284] consent process, participants will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.

[ADDRESS_462286] Participants Before data collection starts, all key study personnel (i.e., all study personnel except the scientific consultants) will be required to undertake appropriate Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), including, but not limited to, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training. 8.[ADDRESS_462287] cancer treatment. The interventions evaluated in this comparative effectiveness trial are likely to improve decision quality and the alignment between treatment chosen, knowledge about key differences, harms and benefits of those options, women’s values and preferences, and quality of life, while reducing anxiety and decision regret. We also anticipate that disparities between women of higher and lower SES will be reduced. 8.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 8.7.1 Planned Distribution of Subjects For all aims and activities, we will be recruiting women (assigned female at birth) only. Given that the study is focused on early stage breast cancer in women and that the intervention is targeted at women, men will be excluded from the study. Transgender men will also be excluded as their treatment course would be managed on a case-by-case basis. 8.7.[ADDRESS_462288] cancer (I to IIIA) at all four participating study sites. We will ensure that study participants are representative of the target population (i.e., women of higher and lower SES diagnosed with early stage breast cancer) by [CONTACT_369196] a combination of urban (Joanne Knight Breast Health Center, St. Louis, MO; Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY; NYU School of Medicine, [LOCATION_001], NY) and rural settings (Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Lebanon, NH and Manchester, NH) as well as racially and ethnically diverse populations. 
 
64  Men are excluded from this study because: - Early stage breast cancer is about 100 times less common in men than in women; - There are fewer options for men given the relative paucity of breast tissue. These shared decision-making resources do not, therefore, apply to this small sub-set of patients; - The intervention was specifically targeted at women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (e.g., images of female anatomy only). 8.7.[ADDRESS_462289], patient advisors, and patient associates. We will also work closely with research assistants, patient associates, and research coordinators at each clinic to ensure that patients with varying levels of literacy are adequately supported to use the interventions and complete the questionnaires. We will also involve interpreters at each site as and when necessary. All study materials including the interventions will be translated into Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. 8.8 Inclusion of Children 8.8.1 Justification for the Exclusion of Children Children are excluded from the proposed study because: - Breast cancer is not diagnosed in patients under the age of 18. Most breast tumors in children are fibroadenomas and are thus benign. The interventions that we have developed are not applicable to children with benign clinical diagnoses; - The interventions being studied were developed and tested with adults at least [ADDRESS_462290].  9.1 Trial Steering Group and Research Team A Trial Steering Group will involve all key personnel (including patient and stakeholder partners and invited CAB members) and will meet every three months using videoconferencing. Research team meetings will also be held on a monthly basis and will include key personnel from each study site, including patient and stakeholder partners. The duties of the TSG will include supervising the trial, monitoring trial progress, as well as reviewing and acting on all DSMB recommendations.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 3, INterVentional, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of DCC -[ADDRESS_1128537] Received Treatment with Prior 
Anticancer Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815157]:  DCC -2618-03-001 
Protocol Name:  [CONTACT_815247]:  3 
Study Centers:  Appr oximately 35 centers globally  
Number of 
Patients Planned:  Approximately 120 patients ( approximately 80 randomized to DCC-2618 
and approximately 40 randomized to placebo) 
Objectives:  Primary Objectives:  
• To assess the efficacy (progression -free survival [PFS]) of DCC -2618 by 
[CONTACT_815181] (GIST) who have received prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815158]:  
• To assess objective response rate by [CONTACT_815182]:  
• To assess other parameters of efficacy, including but not limited to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)  
• To assess the PD/PK relationship of DCC-2618 
• To assess the robustness of efficacy using a sensitivity analysis  
• To assess im provement of disease -related symptoms and quality of life 
• To assess the safety of DCC -2618 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To assess the efficacy of DCC -2618 in patients after dose escalation to 
DCC -2618 150 mg twice daily (BID)  
• To characterize KIT and PDGFRA gene resistance mutations (and 
potentially other gene mutations) and their DCC-2618-driven longitudinal mutation allele frequency changes in plasma cell- free DNA 
(cfDNA)  
• To retrospectively correlate KIT and PDGFRA mutation/s and/or their frequency (as well as of potentially other gene mutations) in baseline 
cfDNA with clinical benefit  
• To understand potential tyrosine kinase inhibitor- (TKI) resistance mechanisms of GIST at time of progression  
• To determine concordance between KIT, PDGFRA, and other mutations in tumor and cfDNA at baseline 
• To assess healthcare utilization in patients with advanced GIST who have received approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
[ADDRESS_1128538] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 97 Study Design:  This is a 2 -arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double- blind, international, 
multicenter study comparing the efficacy of DCC -2618+best supportive care 
(hereafter referred to as “DCC -2618”) to placebo+best supportive care 
(hereafter referred to as “placebo”) in patients with advanced gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors (GIST) who have received treatment with prior anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Prior anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815159], 
sunitinib, and regorafenib (3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). Up to 40% of enrolled patients 
may have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, and other drugs (≥4 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). Approximately 120 patients will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to DCC-2618 150 mg once daily (QD) or placebo 
(see Figure  1). Randomization will be stratified by: 
• Patients who have received [ADDRESS_1128539] received ≥[ADDRESS_1128540] received 
≥4 prior anticancer treatments will be limited to 40% of the overall 
sample size.  
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
(PS)=0 versus ECOG PS=1 or 2  
The primary response for the study will be evaluated using the modified 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) Version 1.[ADDRESS_1128541] -specific (hereafter referred to as “modified RECIST”) based on 
independent radiologic review.  
Upon disease progression by [CONTACT_815183], study drug treatment will be unblinded. At that time:  
• Patients randomized to DCC -2618 150 mg QD  will be given the 
option to:  
o continue DCC-2618 at an increased dose of 150 mg BID, or  
o continue treatment on study with the same dose if the Investigator 
feels the patient is receiving benefit from DCC -2618 or if dose 
escalation may not be tolerable for the patient (dose escalation is not 
permitted at a later time during the study), or 
o discontinue DCC-2618. 
• Patients randomized to placebo will be given the option to:  
o cross over to receive DCC -[ADDRESS_1128542] based on 
Investigator assessment  will be given the option to:  
o continue DCC-2618 at an increased dose of 150 mg BID, or 
o continue treatment on study with the same DCC -2618 dose if the 
Investigator feels the patient is receiving benefit from DCC -2618 or 
if dose escalation may not be tolerable for the patient (dose 
escalation is not permitted at a later time during the study), or 
o discontinue DCC-2618.

1. All assessments must be performed predose, unless otherwise specified. Additional unscheduled safety or efficacy assessments may be performed at any time as 
clinically indicated to determine the relevance of specific findings and/or  the duration of events.  
2. Screening must occur within [ADDRESS_1128572] dose of study drug.  
3. All patients will be followed until withdrawal of consent or death from any cause. After the Safety Follow -Up Visit, patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months 
(±1 month) to collect long -term survival data.  
4. Any medication or non- drug therapy or procedure taken or performed within [ADDRESS_1128573] may be performed instead of urine, if it is the site’s standard practice and results are r eceived prior to the patient being dosed in the clinic.  
6. Randomization may occur up to [ADDRESS_1128574] (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) for at least [ADDRESS_1128575] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent position) for at least [ADDRESS_1128576] cycle thereafter (ie, Cycle 6, 9, 12, etc), and the EOT  Visit, unless 
deemed clinically appropriate at other times. The same modality (echocardiogram or MUGA) must be used throughout the study. Echocardiogram or MUGA performed 
as standard of care prior to informed consent may be used as the Screening assessmen t as long as the echocardiogram or MUGA was performed within [ADDRESS_1128577] for skin lesions, especially for squamous cell carcinoma, actinic  keratosis, and keratoacanthomas, within 
21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline). Subsequently, patients will be assessed at Cycl e [ADDRESS_1128578] cycle thereafter (ie,  Cycle  6, 9, 12, etc.), at the 
EOT Visit, and as clinically indicated. Dermatologic exam that meets the protocol criteria that was performed as standard of care prior to informed consent may be used 
 
[ADDRESS_1128579] come to the site for study drug to be dispensed. 
19. PK sampling will be performed at the following time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 predose and 6 hours after dosing, Cycle 1 Day 15 pr edose, and  2 and 6 hours after dosing, 
Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 predose, predose at every other cycle (eg, Cycle 5, 7, etc.), at disease progression, and at the EOT Visit. All predose samples must be 
collected within [ADDRESS_1128580] be collected ±[ADDRESS_1128581] anticancer 
therapy.   
All Patients (optional): Additional tumor tissue samples may be collected for patients undergoing medical procedures including resection of metastases  while on study 
or for patients that have disease progression if the patient consents and these samples will be used for further molecular testing of the cancer while treated wit h study 
drug.  
21. CT scans of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest will be performed at screening (within 21 days of Cycle 1 Day 1). Subsequently, CT scans of the pelvis and abdomen will be 
performed every cycle through and including Cycle 4, and then every other cycle thereafter (ie,  Cycle  6, 8, 10, etc.). CT scans of the chest will only be performed 
subsequently if the patient had lung metastases at screening or in case of lung symptoms (per the Investigator’s discretion). Radiologic imaging may be performed up to 
[ADDRESS_1128582] 
be confirmed ≥4 weeks later. MRI scans of the abdomen/pelvis and CT scan without contrast of the chest can be used for patients who are allergic to radiographic 
contrast media. Additionally, for patients whose local regulatory authority and/or ethics committee has not approved use of CT scans, MRIs may be used. Throughout the 
study, the same assessment technique must be used. Ultrasound scanning is not an acceptable substitute for CT scanning. See Section  6.10.1  for further details.  
Confirmation of No Disease Progression:  If the independent radiologic reviewer confirms that there is no disease progression, the patient will continue to receive st udy 
drug unless there is a medical need (ie, rapid progression or clinical deterioration) that requires the study drug to be disc ontinued. If the Investigator determines 
progression based upon clinical deterioration, a scan must be performed and reviewed by [CONTACT_815189] t o determine if the patient progressed. The 
basis for determination of progression per clinical deterioration must be documented in the patient’s source documents and electronic case report form.  
Disease Progression: Following confirmation of disease progression by [CONTACT_815190] r adiologic review, 
the patient's treatment assignment will be unblinded via the Interactive Response Technology system.  
• Patients randomized to DCC -2618 150 mg QD  will be given the option to continue DCC -2618 at an increased dose of 150 mg twice daily, continue tr eatment on 
study with the same dose if the Investigator feels the patient is receiving benefit from DCC -2618 or if dose escalation may not be tolerable for the patient (dose 
escalation is not permitted at a later time during the study), or discontinue DCC -2618. At the time of dose escalation, the patient must come to the site for study drug 
to be dispensed.  
• Patients randomized to placebo will be given the option to cross over to receive DCC -[ADDRESS_1128583] follow 
the schedule of assessments in Table  2. 
22. Biomarker and PD plasma samples will be collected predose at Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline), every other cycle (ie, Cycle 3, 5, 7, etc.), and at the EOT Visit.

Visit.  
3. All patients will be followed until withdrawal of consent or death from any cause. After the Safety Follow -Up Visit, patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (±1  month) 
to col lect long -term survival data.  
4. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all visits , except Cycle [ADDRESS_1128588] may be performed instead of urine, if it is the site’s standard practice 
and results are received prior to the patient being dose in the clinic.  
5. Patients taking anticoagulants will also have a test at Cycle [ADDRESS_1128589] (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) for at least [ADDRESS_1128590] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent position) for at lea st [ADDRESS_1128591] cycle thereafter (ie, Cycle 6, 9, 12, etc.) and the EOT Visit, unless deemed clinicall y appropriate at other times. The same modality (echocardiogram or MUGA) must be used throughout the study.  
11. All patients will be assessed, within [ADDRESS_1128592] cycle thereafter (ie,  Cycle  6, 9, 12, etc.), at the 
EOT Visit, and as clinically indicated. See Section  6.11.6 for further details. Note: If the patient had a recent dermatologic examination in the cycle when they 
progressed, then a dermatologic examination does not need to be performed at the Cycle [ADDRESS_1128593] come to the site for study drug to be dispensed. 
15. PK sampling will be performed at the following time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 predose and 6 hours after dosing, Cycle 1 Day 15 predose, and 2 and 6 hours after dosing, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 predose, predose at every other cycle (eg, Cycle 5, 7, etc.), at disease progression, and at the EOT Visit. All predose samples must be 
collected within [ADDRESS_1128594] be collected ±30 minutes of the nominal time point. An unscheduled PK sample may be taken at 
the time of the onset of a new suspected, treatment -related adverse event when requested by [CONTACT_1034].  
16. All Patients (optional): Additional tumor tissue samples may be collec ted for patients undergoing medical procedures including resection of metastases while on study or 
for patients that have disease progression if the patient consents and these samples will be used for further molecular testing of the cancer while treated w ith study drug.  
17. CT scans of the pelvis and abdomen will be performed every other cycle. CT scans of the chest will only be performed subseque ntly if the patient had lung metastases at 
screening or in case of lung symptoms (per the Investigator’s discretion). Radiologic imaging may be performed up to [ADDRESS_1128595] be confirmed ≥4 weeks later. MRI scans  of the 
abdomen/pelvis and CT scan without contrast of the chest can be used for patients who are allergic to radiographic contrast media. Additionally, for patients whose local regulatory authority and/or ethics committee has not approved use of CT scans,  MRIs may be used. Throughout the study, the same assessment technique must be used. 
Ultrasound scanning is not an acceptable substitute for CT scanning. See Section  6.10.1 for further details.  
Disease Progression: Following confirmation of disease progression by [CONTACT_815191], patients 
will be given the option to continue DCC-2618 at an increased d ose of 150 mg twice daily according to the rules in Section  5.2.1 , continue DCC -2618 at the same dose if 
the Investigator feels the patient is receiving benefit from DCC -2618 or if dose escalation may not be tolerable for the patient (dose escalation is not permitted at a later 
time during the study), or  discontinue DCC -2618. At the time of dose escalation, the patient must come to the site for study drug to be dispensed.

Figure 4:  Pharmacokinetic Model of DCC-[ADDRESS_1128605] been identified 
in multiple ca ncer types such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), subsets of 
melanoma, testicular seminomas and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and in myeloproliferative neoplasms such as systemic mastocytosis (SM) that include aggressive SM (ASM) and mast cell leukemia ( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). In addition, aberrant wt KIT and/or 
PDGFRA overexpression is found in GIST, melanoma, AML, gliomas and neuroendocrine tumors ( 7, 8, 9, 10). 
Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors are driven by [CONTACT_815193] (~80%) or the 
related PDGFRA (~10%) receptor tyrosine kinases ( 1, 23). In GIST patients at presentation, 
mutations in the KIT gene are usually found in exon [ADDRESS_1128606], but there are limitations to their therapeutic success.  
Upon treatment with targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], secondary resistance mutations in KIT usually arise 
in the catalytic domain of the kinase, and frequently these mutations map to the embedded conformational switch control mechanism that regulates KIT activity ( Figure  2). Secondary 
mutations in KIT typi[INVESTIGATOR_815161] 13 and 14 (near the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket) that sterically disrupt drug binding or conformationally activate KIT, and in the activation loop (conformation-controlling switch) encoded by [CONTACT_815194] 17 and 18 
(11, 12). Activation loop mutations act by [CONTACT_815195][INVESTIGATOR_014] ( 13). Other diseases 
that have primary mutations in the KIT (or PDGFRA) activation loop include SM, A ML, and 
PDGFRA-driven GIST ( 7, 14, 15).

[ADDRESS_1128607] in 2002 ( 16). 
Imatinib therapy is usually not curative in unresectable and/or metastatic disease with 
complete responses (CRs) seen in ~5% of patients and an objective response rate (ORR) of 
68% ( 17). More than 80% of GIST patients will receive clinical benefit from imatinib 
monotherapy, but as development of imatinib- resistance is essentially inevitable, more than 
half will develop progressive disease by 2  years ( 18). Progression is largely due to secondary 
mutations in  the KIT kinase domain that cause resistance to imatinib ( 12). Although imatinib 
is effective against exon [ADDRESS_1128608] exon 9 
mutations when the dose is increased to 800 mg, little to no response to imatinib is seen for 
other mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, particularly those that mediate the conformational 
dynamics of switch activation ( 18, 19). 
Sunitinib was approved in [ADDRESS_1128609] exon 11 mutations ( 15, 18 ). 
Additionally, sunitinib shows activity against KIT exon 13 and 14 mutations, but only half 
the patients show benefit and median progression-free survival (PFS) is 5.5 months ( 18). 
Sunitinib is not effective against KIT exon 17/[ADDRESS_1128610]- line therapy f or adult patients with metastatic 
and/or unresectable GIST who have had disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib and 
sunitinib treatment. In addition to being active against KIT exon [ADDRESS_1128611] a subset of exon 17 mutations in KIT and for patients who respond, PFS approaches 5 months. Some patients present with mutations in 
KIT that are not effectively treated by [CONTACT_39707], and additionally, other or multiple secondary mutations ar ise and cause resistance to therapy ( 12). Tumor heterogeneity has 
been found with multiple secondary mutations in KIT arising within an individual patient in 
different areas of [ADDRESS_1128612] sites of metastasis ( 12).  
The complex heterogeneity of KIT mutations within individual patients is a major  cause of 
resistance to therapy ( 12). A kinase inhibitor that could broadly inhibit clinically relevant 
KIT mutations or multiple mutations in KIT within an individual GIST patient could be of 
high therapeutic value in the treatment of refractory GIST patients. Importantly, determining whether such an inhibitor could delay development of resistance mutations within KIT is an 
important therapeutic objective with DCC -2618. 
At present, there are no approved targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815162]-resistant mutations in GIST. Thus, a high medical need remains for developi[INVESTIGATOR_815163].  
1.2. Clinical Indications  
DCC -2618, an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA kinases, is being developed for the treatment 
of patients with GIST, in addition to other advanced malignancies driven by [CONTACT_815196]- oncogene 
tyrosine-protein kinases. In addition to KIT and PDGFRA, the drug inhibits CSF1R (FMS), 
VEGFR2, and TIE2, which are less frequently documented to initiate tumor development.  
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors represent the most common form of sarcoma, a relatively 
rare subset of cancers arising from mesenchymal cells in the body ( 20). Adult GIST occurs 
with an incidence rate of ~3,000-6,000 new cases per year in the US ( 21, 22, 23), generally 
presents around age 50-70, and occurs in men and women at similar rates ( 24). Surgery is the 
primary treatment for localized GIST and can be curative, though local and/or distant 
recurrence occurs in more than half of patients ( 25). For metastatic or unresectable GIST, 
 
[ADDRESS_1128613] 2018

chemotherapy are not effective ( 20, 25). The era of targeted cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815164], though CRs are rarely achieved ( 20). Resistance to therapy occurs in a large majority of patients within a few 
months to years depending on treatment ( 21), similar to that observed in other cance rs 
successfully treated with targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.3. Study Drug  
DCC -2618 is a novel, oral inhibitor of KIT kinase and PDGFRA kinases, developed by 
[CONTACT_815179], LLC (hereafter referred to as the “Sponsor”), using its 
proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor technology platform. DCC-[ADDRESS_1128614] range of primary and secondary mutants of KIT and PDGFRA kinases, including KIT primary mutations in exons 9 and 11 and secondary resistance 
mutations in exon 13 and 14 of the KIT ATP binding/switch pocket region and primary or 
secondary mutations in exons [ADDRESS_1128615] profile of mutant KIT/PDGFRA inhibition by [CONTACT_815197]/PDGFRA switch 
pockets. 
1.3.1. Nonclinical Experience 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a more detailed summary of the 
nonclinical experience with DCC -2618. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacology 
DCC -2618, and its active metabolite, DP-5439, were evaluated in vitro in recombinant 
kinase assays an d in cellular assays with GIST cell lines from treatment- resistant patients, 
AML and mastocytosis cell lines, or cell lines transfected with KIT or PDGFRA mutants. 
These studies provided a comprehensive profile of inhibition versus clinically relevant KIT 
and PDGFRA mutations that cause either de facto refractoriness to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815165]. Results from evaluation in cancer cell lines guided further 
evaluation of DCC-2618 in refractory/resistant in vivo xenograft models. 
A variety of cancer model systems were employed to evaluate the pharmacology of 
DCC -2618 in vivo, including the evaluation of efficacy in human tumor xenografts in nude 
mice and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies in tumor- bearing mice to 
evaluate exposures required for durable mutant KIT inhibition in vivo. 
In vivo, DCC-[ADDRESS_1128616] models. 
In a PK/PD study performed in a human GIST xenograft mouse model, a single oral dose of 
50 mg/kg resulted in a DCC -2618 exposure (area under the concentration × time curve from 
0 to 24 hours [AUC
0-24hr]) of 2500 ng•h/mL (5000  ng•h/mL when active metabolite DP-5439 
is included) that led to 69-88% inhibition of KIT kinase in vivo through 8-hours post dose and ~40% inhibition at 12-hours post dose. This exposure led to 90% inhibition of tumor 
growth in the GIST T1 model when dosed at 50 mg/kg twice daily (BID; 10,000  ng•h/mL 
daily  exposure) in a multiple-dose efficacy study. This PK/PD derived exposure was used to 
guide identification of toxicology formulations capable of achieving exposures as multiples of this durable inhibition of KIT in vivo. 
 
[ADDRESS_1128617] that mice may be exposed to an approximately equal amount of 
DCC -2618 and DP-5439 when measured as AUC 0-24hr. The total active drug exposure in 
mice (AUC 0-24hr), as measured by [CONTACT_815198]-2618 and metabolite 
DP-5439, is therefore regarded as 5000 ng•h/mL following a single oral 50 mg dose or 
10,000 ng•h/mL after a 50 mg/kg BID administration, a value which will be referenced in the 
analysis of nonc linical safety studies. Metabolite DP -5439 has been shown to be formed in 
the Phase 1 dose- escalation study. At clinically effective doses the exposure to metabolite is 
greater than exposure to parent DCC-2618. 
DCC -2618 was selected for clinical developmen t based on the efficacy and tolerability 
observed in these model systems. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Safety Pharmacology  
DCC -2618 exhibits negligible binding to human ether-à- go-go related gene potassium 
channel components. 
DCC -2618 given at 15, 60, or 300 mg/kg had no effect on any component of the modified 
Irwin battery of behavioral testing at any measured time point in rats. DCC -2618 given at 15, 
60, or 300 mg/kg mildly decreased tidal volume by 10% at 15 mg/kg and up to 17% at 
300 mg/kg in rats. The observed changes in tidal volume were not considered physiologically 
important because they were transient and of small magnitude.  
Cardiovascular safety was assessed by [CONTACT_53402] (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and 
troponin I measurements in the dog 4-week repeat dose toxicology study. No significant 
effects on blood pressure, heart rate, ECG intervals, or troponin I levels were noted. In a stand -alone cardiovascular safety study in Beagle dogs, single doses of DCC-2618 resulted in 
increased diastolic pressure and mean arterial pressure ([ADDRESS_1128618] dose) that were 
generally correlative with the anticipated time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T
max). Diastolic pressures were higher (12, 12, and 17%) than control at 7, 20, and 75 mg/kg, 
respectively. DCC -2618- related in creases in mean arterial pressure were higher (up to 12, 10, 
and 14 mmHg) than control at 7, 20, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. There were no changes to systolic pressure or arterial pulse pressure.  
Increases in heart rate and lower QT - and PR- intervals (like ly secondary to changes in heart 
rate) were seen at [ADDRESS_1128619] dose during the dark phase of the study. There were no 
changes in corrected QT interval (QTc) values. Heart rate values were elevated throughout 
the dark phase with maximal differences occurring between [ADDRESS_1128620] dose when 
heart rates were 45%, 70%, and 129% higher than concurrent controls at 7, 20, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. The mechanism of these changes is not understood; BP and heart rate 
are being closely monitored in clinical studies. The magnitude of BP and heart rate changes 
was considered noteworthy, but not to represent severe toxicity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and 
Excretion Profile 
In vitro studies were performed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion properties of DCC-2618 and metabolite DP-5439 in human and other mammalian 
species relevant to drug development. In vivo PK studies (both oral and intravenous [IV] routes) were conducted in rodents (mice, rats) and non-rodents (dogs, cynomolgus monkeys). 
 
[ADDRESS_1128621] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 97 DCC -2618 exhibited oral bioavailability in all species, confirming the potential for 
development as an oral therapeutic agent.  
Total exposures (AUC 0-24hr) for DCC -2618 achieved in dogs and rats were 1.9-2.6 × the 
target area under the curve (AUC) of 10,000 ng•h/mL for DCC-[ADDRESS_1128622] efficacy model. The elimination half- life (T 1/2) after a single IV 
dose was comparable in dogs (2.7 hours) and rats (2.0 hours). 
Metabo lite identification studies demonstrated that all observed human metabolites were also 
detected in the Sprague-Dawley rat and/or Beagle dog, supporting the relevance of these 
species for toxicology studies. The major metabolite observed in all species of hepatocytes is 
the N -desmethyl metabolite (DP -5439) and it was determined that DP-[ADDRESS_1128623] range 
of 19 single and double-mutant KIT assays performed in transfected Chi nese Hamster Ovary 
cells, DCC -2618 inhibited mutant KIT phosphorylation with half maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values ranging from 6 nM to 221 nM. Similarly, the metabolite 
DP-5439 inhibited mutant KIT phosphorylation in these assays with IC 50 values ranging from 
21 nM to 191 nM.  
The in vitro metabolism of DCC -2618 and active metabolite DP-5439 by [CONTACT_815199] P450 (CYP) enzymes contribute to the metabolism of DCC-2618. The metabolism of D CC-2618 was found to be 
dependent on the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), 
reduced form. Blocking the metabolism of DCC-[ADDRESS_1128624]- acting or metabolism-dependent CYP inhibitors 
revealed that CYP3A4/5 is the major metabolizer of DCC-2618 (ketoconazole, 63% 
inhibition; troleandomycin, 79% inhibition); CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil glucoronide, 24% 
inhibition) and CYP2D6 (quinidine, 26% inhibition) were implicated as only minor metabolizers. In recombinant human CYP enzyme preparations, however, CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C8 were also found to be strong metabolizers of DCC-2618. Inhibition of DP-[ADDRESS_1128625]- acting inhibitor 
ketoconazole (CYP3A4/5, 72% inhibition), and with metabolism-dependent inhibitors 
gemfibrozil glucuronide (CYP2C8, 59% inhibition), tienilic acid (CYP2C9, 25% inhibition), 
esomeprazole (CYP2C19, 31% inhibition), paroxetine (CYP2D6, 42% inhibition), diethyldithiocarbamate (CYP2E1, 50% inhibition) and troleandomycin (CYP3A4/5, 100% 
inhibition). Incubations of DP-[ADDRESS_1128626] or metabolism-dependent inhibitors 
evaluated resulted in less than 14% inhibition. This study revealed that CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1128627] manner. After a 30-minute pre-incubation with pooled human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH, however, DP-5439 
demons trated evidence of metabolism -dependent (time -dependent and NADPH-dependent) 
inhibition of CYP3A4/5- mediated testosterone 6β -hydroxylation. The inhibition observed in 
the presence of 7.0  µM DP -5439 increased 41% after pre-incubation. There was little or no 
evidence of metabolism -dependent (time- and NADPH-dependent) inhibition of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 by [CONTACT_301050]-5439. DCC -[ADDRESS_1128628] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 97 exhibit potential for DDIs with other agents dependent on CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or 
CYP2D6 for their metabolism.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of DCC -2618 was evaluated in vitro in the bacterial mutagenicity assay 
and in vivo in nude mice, Sprague- Dawley rats and Beagle dogs. There was no evidence of 
bacterial mutagenicity up to the maximum tested concentration of 3000 µg/plate (concentration resulting in precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332]), with or without metabolic activation, in a 
non-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant ass essment.  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], GLP- compliant 4 -week oral study was conducted in rats at 0, 15, 60, and 
300 mg/kg/day DCC -2618. Recovery animals were held for an additional 4 weeks following 
the dosing phase. There were no drug related deaths or adverse clinical obser vations in this 
study. A higher prevalence of thinning hair coat was noted at 300 mg/kg/day. A decrease in 
body weight and food consumption was seen in DCC-[ADDRESS_1128630] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 97 the animals’ overall body condition. Several minor clinical pathology findings were observed 
on Day 29. These changes were of small magnitude, lacked microscopic correlates, exhibited 
reversibility at the end of the recovery ph ase, and were not considered adverse. DCC-2618 
related increased lung weights (15% to 33%) were noted in males given 300 mg/kg/day and 
females given ≥15  mg/kg/day. There were no correlating microscopic changes and the lung 
weight increases partially reversed during the recovery phase. Microscopic changes were limited to the non -glandular stomach (diffuse hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis) of rats given 
≥60 mg/kg/day and the change partially reversed during the recovery phase. Since humans do 
not have this anatomic feature, the changes have no relevance to humans. Based on these 
results, 300 mg/kg/day was the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) after 4 weeks of dosing. 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], GLP compliant 4 -week oral study was conducted in Beagle dog at 0, 7, 20, and 
75 mg /kg/day. Recovery animals were held for an additional 4 weeks following the dosing 
phase. Dosing was suspended in several animals at 20 and 75 mg/kg/day during Week 2 or 3 
due to DCC-2618- related adverse clinical observations. Three males given 75 mg/kg/da y 
were sacrificed on Day 13, and 7 additional animals at both the 20 mg/kg dose (2 males and 
2 females) and the 75 mg/kg dose (3 females) underwent early sacrifice during Week 4, due 
to DCC -2618-related adverse clinical observations. Clinical observations in these animals 
included erythema of feet, inside of ears, muzzle, periorbital area, and ventral thorax, and 
thinning of cranial hair coat. Some dogs also exhibited dry and flaky skin, otitis, 
erythematous external ear canals, excessive salivation, emesis , and non-formed/liquid feces. 
In dogs administered 7 mg/kg/day, skin changes were of lesser severity and judged not to be 
adverse. The skin lesions at 20 and 75 mg/kg/day were partially or completely resolved 
during the recovery phase. Decreased body weig hts were noted in males given 20 or 
75 mg/kg/day. Animals at 7  mg/kg/day had small changes in body weight that were not 
considered adverse. No alterations in blood pressure or ECG intervals were noted at any dose of DCC -2618. Mild hematology, clinical biochemistry, and/or coagulation findings occurred 
in animals given ≥20 mg/kg/day and all changes exhibited evidence of reversibility by [CONTACT_815200]. Troponin I levels in DCC-2618- treated animals were unaffected 
by [CONTACT_360676]. Microscopic  findings of hyperkeratosis, cytoplasmic rarefaction of 
hepatocytes consistent with increased glycogen, decreased lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, and one instance of an intra- epi[INVESTIGATOR_815166] ≥20 mg/kg/day. The only test 
article -related micr oscopic finding at the recovery sacrifice was minimal cytoplasmic 
rarefaction of liver cells in some animals given 75 mg/kg/day, indicating partial recovery of this finding. 
Based on these results, the NOAEL is 7 mg/kg/day. This dose also is considered the highest 
non-severely toxic dose.  
1.3.2. Clinical Experience 
There is [ADDRESS_1128631]- in-human, dose- escalation study in patients with advanced malignancies 
with a molecular rationale for activity. This study has 2 parts: (1) Dose- Escalation Phase and 
(2) Expansion Phase. 
In the Escalation Phase, sequentially increasing dose levels of oral DCC -2618 dosed BID in 
repeated 28 -day cycles are being evaluated for safety based on pharmacologically guided 3+3 
escalation rules until a maximum tolerated dose has been identified or a recommended 
expansion dose/regimen(s) is declared. Sequentially increasing dose levels of oral DCC -2618 
dosed once daily (QD) were introduced based on the suspec ted long plasma half -life of an 
active metabolite (30 -60 hours), that support a QD dosing regimen.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Markers 
Nonclinical studies had identified DP- 5439 as an active metabolite of DCC -2618 with similar 
activity profile to its parent compound. 
The long plasma T 1/2 of the metabolite (30-60 hours) suggests that QD dosing is feasible. The 
food effect sub-study has shown that taking DCC-[ADDRESS_1128638]. Overall, a high total plasma concentration, determined as C
max, was observed exceeding 5 μM (3,000 ng/mL) starting at 100 mg BID at 
Cycle  1 Day 15; the observed mean exposure exceeds targeted plasma levels by [CONTACT_187237], 
including exposures required for inhibition of the KIT mutations least sensitive to DCC-2618 (V654A and T670I). 
Next -generation sequencing of plasma cell -free DNA (cfDNA) was perform ed in all GIST 
patients at baseline and every 2 cycles while a patient is on study. Mutations were detected 
and quantitated by [CONTACT_86052] 360 v2.9 or v2.10. Only amino acid- altering mutations in KIT 
and PDGFRA were considered resistance mutations. Cell -free DNA was not detected in all 
patients. Based on the preliminary data, 19 mutations in unique genes were observed in 11/[ADDRESS_1128639]. Across exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18, a total of 
43 mutations were detected in the KIT gene. The PDGFR A D842V- mutation was detected in 
only 1 cfDNA patient sample out of 4 PDGFRA D842V-mutant patients enrolled (confirmed by [CONTACT_815201]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Efficacy  
Efficacy data (measured by [CONTACT_16622] [RECIST] Version  1.1) ar e available for [ADDRESS_1128640]. The 
waterfall plot ( Figure 3 ) is representative of the [ADDRESS_1128641] scans. Data show patients who were treated at doses <[ADDRESS_1128642] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 97 ≥100 mg daily. Patients who received the RP2D of 150 mg QD are noted an ‘#’ in the figure. 
In the ≥100 mg daily dose cohorts there were 5 partial responses (PR), 25 stable disease 
(SD), and 3 progressive disease (PD). In the <100 mg dose cohorts there were 3 SD, 1 PD 
and zero PR.

Patients (N=37) 
 
 
 
18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG- PET) scans were performed in 
GIST patients as an early marker of tumor activity and treatment response to DCC -2618. 
Scans were obtained at baseline and during Cycle [ADDRESS_1128643] art of 
continuous dosing. Response was assessed according to European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET response criteria by a central imaging review.  As of 
Amendment 3, the Sponsor no longer requires FDG- PET scans to be perform ed in the 
Escalation Phase because sufficient data supporting an impression of strong antitumor metabolic activity in KIT -mutant GIST patients are available. In the Expansion Phase, 
FDG -PET scans will be performed for GIST patients that progress and dose e scalate 
(ie, intra -patient dose escalation).  
Across the dose levels examined to date, no clear evidence for increased activity at higher 
dose levels was observed based on PD markers. Partial metabolic responses (PMRs) determined by [CONTACT_815202] [ADDRESS_1128644] a study with an acceptable active 
comparator is difficult. There are limited data to support that rechallenge with prior failed treatment options may offer minor benefit. A Korean, single-center, randomized, placebo-
controlled study (ie, ‘RIGHT Trial’) demonstrated that a rechallenge with imatinib provides a small benefit (median PFS of 1.8 months) to some patients compared to placebo ( median 
PFS of 0.9 months) ( 26). Nevertheless, the study did not show any accompanied symptom 
palliation based on a health-related quality of life sub analysis using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30-item (EORTC QLQ -C30) ( 27). The RIGHT Trial generally excluded patients who had a 
limited benefit from initial treatment with imatinib (defined as a PFS of ≤6 months), and thus the patient population was skewed towards ensuring enrollment of patients who had greater initial success on imatinib. A rechallenge with imatinib is not an approved treatment option 
anywhere in the world, and some treating physicians would rather choose sunitinib 
depending on the patient history.  
DCC -[ADDRESS_1128645] -in-human study, DCC-2618-01-001, are heavily pre- treated and considered to 
be tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant. DCC-[ADDRESS_1128646], 
DCC -2618 has led to notable decreases in mutation allele frequency (MAF) of resistance 
mutations in KIT exons 13, 14, [ADDRESS_1128647] received treatment with prior anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patients will be randomized to the active arm, DCC-2618 + best supportive care (hereafter referred to as “DCC -2618”), or and the control arm, placebo + best supportive care (hereafter referred to as 
“placebo”).  
To address the ethical concern of patients with advanced cancer receiving placebo, the study will allow for crossover of patients on the placebo arm who radiographically progress per 
modified RECIST by [CONTACT_551274]. Tumor assessments are scheduled 
initially after each cycle to allow for an early detection of disease progression.  
Additionally, the study will include a 2:1 randomization scheme to the study, which will also 
minimize the number of patients that receive placebo. The study will randomize 
approximately  120 patients, randomized 2:1 (DCC-2618:placebo). This sample size was 
 
[ADDRESS_1128648] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 97 selected based on considerations for PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and rate to detect 
rare safety events and overall exposure to DCC -2618, recommended by [CONTACT_8415]. 
1.4.2. Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Duration Rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nonclinical Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacokinetic Analyses to 
Support Optimal Phase  [ADDRESS_1128649]. The dose 
recommendation is based on nonclinical pharmacology, clinical PK assessment, and PD 
results of the ongoing Phase 1 study (up to 01 June  2017). Upon completion of the Phase 1 
study, clinical PK analysis and evaluation of the exposure-response relationship shall be 
updated. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. In Vitro Pharmacology 
The in vitro pharmacology studies demonstrated DCC-2618 and its active metabolite 
DP-5439 potently inhibit the wild-type and oncogenic KIT variants with IC 50 values in the 
range of 3 -20 nM ( Table 5 ). Data for the currently available KIT inhibitors, imatinib, 
sunitinib, and regorafenib, are shown for reference. Imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib and DCC -[ADDRESS_1128650] active metab olites. The following dose considerations are primarily 
based on the pharmacological properties of the parent compounds.  
Table 5: In vitro Inhibition of Recombinant KIT and KIT Mutants  
 
The reported fraction unbound (fu) of imatinib and sunitinib are the same (5%), while in vitro 
potency of sunitinib is approximately 6-fold higher (wt KIT). Correspondingly the daily dosage of sunitinib for GIST (125 µmol, 50 mg) is 6.5-fold lower (based on molar dose ratio) than imatinib (810 µmol, 400 mg). At 0.5% the reported fu of regorafenib is 10-fold lower than sunitinib, while the in vitro potency is 2-fold higher. However, the daily dose of regorafenib (331 µmol, 160 mg) is only 2.6-fold greater (based on molar dose ratio) than sunitin ib for GIST, likely due to the inhibition of more KIT mutants. 
The measured in vitro fu of DCC-2618 was 0.2% for albumin and 0.6- 1.4% for α -1 acid 
glycoprotein, closer to that of regorafenib (fu=0.5%) than imatinib or sunitinib (fu=5%). The 
molecular weight of DCC -2618 (510.4 Dalton) is slightly greater than that of regorafenib 
(482.8 Dalton). As such the projected daily dose of DCC- [ADDRESS_1128651] (294 µmol, 150 mg) 
is similar to regorafenib (331 µmol, 160 mg), although the optimal dose could be lower g iven 
more potent inhibition of KIT mutants exon [ADDRESS_1128652] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 97 [IP_ADDRESS].2. In vivo Pharmacology  
In an exon [ADDRESS_1128653] T1 cell line xenograft mouse model, KIT signaling was 
suppressed by 69-88% out to 8 hours after administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg 
DCC -2618 and sustained at ~40% inhibition at [ADDRESS_1128654] T1 xenograft model, DCC-2618 significantly inhibited tumor growth, with 90% 
suppression at 50 mg/kg. In an imatinib- resistant GIST patient- deriv ed xenograft model, 
100 mg/kg QD or 50 mg/kg BID DCC -2618 completely stopped the tumor growth. In the 
Kasumi -1 AML xenograft model expressing a primary exon 17 KIT mutation (N822K KIT), 
both 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses of DCC-[ADDRESS_1128655] efficac y while imatinib 
was ineffective at a dose of 50 mg/kg BID.  
From in vivo pharmacology studies, the target PK exposure for tumor growth inhibition was determined to be 10,000 ng ⋅h/mL for AUC
0-24hr of DCC -2618 and DP- 5439 at steady -state.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Clinical Pharmacok inetics Assessment  
A population PK analysis was performed on pooled BID and QD data collected from the ongoing Phase 1 study of DCC-2618 in patients with advanced malignancies 
(Protocol DCC -2618-01-001). The model structure is shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1128656]-order rate constant for the metabolism of DCC-2618 to its 
active metabolite DP -5439 by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. CL and CLM represent the clearance of 
DCC -2618 by [CONTACT_815203] -5439, respectively. To 
avoid overparameterization, the central and peripheral distribution volumes of DP-5439 were assumed to be the same as those of DCC-2618.

The population PK analysis indicated that at DCC -2618 dose regimens of 30-200 mg BID or 
100-150 mg QD in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_815168], the combined steady -state PK exposure 
(AUC 0-24hr) of DCC -2618 and DP-5439 exceeds the 10,000 ng ⋅h/mL threshold for efficacy 
identified from xenograft mouse studies. However, the observed PK of both DCC-2618 and 
DP-5439 were highly variable among patients.  
Using the population PK model, a simulation was conducted based on 100 clinical studies, 
each including 100 patients, in order to estimate the proportion of patients achieving the 
10,000 ng ⋅h/mL threshold for efficacy. Results showed that a dose of 150 mg QD (estimated 
from comparative in vitro pharmacology) is predicted to maintain the PK exposure above 
10,000 ng ⋅h/mL in 93.6% of patients. The simulation was repeated with a dose of 100 mg 
QD, at which 87.9% of patients are predicted to reach the efficacy threshold. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Summary  
An oral QD dose of [ADDRESS_1128658] based on the following considerations: 
• Comparison of in vitro pharmacological properties of DCC-[ADDRESS_1128659] suggests an efficacious daily dose of ≤[ADDRESS_1128660]  
• In vivo pharmacology studies in xenograft mouse models indicated a target combined PK 
exposure (AUC 0-24hr =10,000 ng ⋅h/mL) of DCC -[ADDRESS_1128661] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CON FIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 97 inhibition. A daily oral dose of 150 mg is predicted to maintain the PK above this 
threshold in 93.6% of patients. 
• Both in vitro and in vivo pharmacology data are consistent in predicting that 150 mg QD 
will be an efficacious dose.  
• Safety data collected from the Phase 1 study support administration of 150 mg QD as a 
tolerable dose.  
Further points of consideration are listed below: 
• Comparing with BID regimens that are predicted to achieve the exposure target for 
efficacy, daily dosing is more convenient and may improve treatment adherence. 
Therefore, the 150 mg QD regimen is preferred over a similar daily dose given BID. 
• Due to the large PK interindividual variability, doses lower than 150 mg will result in PK 
exposure falling below the efficacy threshold in more patients. On the other hand, further 
improvement in efficacy is likely incremental at a higher dose.  
• A dose of 100 mg QD is predicted to reac h the exposure target for efficacy in a large 
majority (87.9%) of patients. If individual patients experience lack of tolerance at 150 mg  QD, the dose could be lowered to 100 mg QD potentially without compromising 
efficacy.  
• Further PK -efficacy and PK-safety assessments are being conducted to confirm the 
selection of [ADDRESS_1128662]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intra -patient Dose Escalation After Disease Progression  
Dose escalation of other TKIs (imatinib) is already a therapeutic option for patients with 
primary, as well as secondary resistance to standard doses of imatinib.  
Based on the population PK model simulations, by [CONTACT_10540] 150 mg QD regimen, around

2.3. Exploratory Objectives  
• To assess the efficacy of DCC -2618 in patients after dose escalation to DCC-2618 
150 mg BID  
• To characterize KIT and PDGFRA gene resistance mutations (and potentially other gene 
mutations) and their DCC-2618- driven longitudinal mutation allele frequency changes in 
plasma cfDNA  
• To retrospectively correlate KIT and PDGFRA mutation/s and/or their frequency (as well as of potentially other gene mutations) in baseline cfDNA with clinical benefit 
• To understand potential TKI- resistance mechanisms of GIST at time of progression  
• To determine concordance between KIT, PDGFRA, and ot her mutations in tumor and 
cfDNA at baseline  
• To assess healthcare utilization in patients with advanced GIST who have received approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
 
[ADDRESS_1128665] include treatment 
with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib (3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). Up to 40% of enrolled patients may have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, and other drugs (≥4 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). Approximately 120 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to DCC -2618 
150 mg  QD or placebo (see Figure  1). Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Patients who have received [ADDRESS_1128666] received ≥4  prior anticancer treatments

study drug treatment will be unblinded. At that time:  
• Patients randomized to DCC -2618 150 mg QD  will be given the option to:  
• continue DCC-2618 at an increased dose of 150 mg BID (See Section  5.2.1 for more 
details on intra -patient dose escalation), or  
• continue treatment on s tudy with the same dose if the Investigator feels the patient is 
receiving benefit from DCC -2618 or if dose escalation may not be tolerable for the 
patient (dose escalation is not permitted at a later time during the study), or   
• discontinue DCC-2618. 
• Patie nts randomized to placebo  will be given the option to:  
• cross over to receive DCC -2618 150 mg QD , or 
• discontinue the study. 
Patients randomized to placebo who cross over to receive DCC -[ADDRESS_1128668] based on Investigator assessment  will be 
given the option to:

magnesium stearate %).  
Placebo will be supplied as identically sized and color- matched tablets.  
5.2. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the Investigator or an authorized 
designee and only for administration to study patients. Patients will be randomized to receive 
[ADDRESS_1128690] the patient to take the study drug as per protocol. 
• Patients should be instruct ed to take their assigned dose at the same time each day.  
• Patients should take their study drug dose with a 6-ounce glass of water with or without 
food.  
• Patients must be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. Tablets must not be crushed, 
chewed, or dissolved in liquid or food.  
• The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration must be recorded for the 
3 days prior to PK sample collections and on the days of PK sample collection. 
• On days of scheduled visits, the dose of study drug must be administered at the site after 
pre-dose assessments have been completed. The date, amount taken and time of study 
drug administration must be recorded.  
If a patient dose escalates to [ADDRESS_1128691] the patient to take the study drug as per protocol. 
• Patients should be instructed take the study drug twice a day, at least 6 hours apart, and at 
the same time each day. 
• Patients should take their study drug dose with a 6-ounce glass of water with or without 
food.  
• Patients must be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. Tablets must not be crushed, 
chewed, or dissolved in liquid or food.  
• The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration must be recorded for the 
3 days prior to PK sample collections and on the days of PK sample collection. 
• On days of scheduled visits, the dose of study drug must be administered at the site after 
pre-dose assessments have been completed. The date, amount taken and time of study 
drug administration must be recorded. 
If a patient forgets to take a dose at the s cheduled time, the patient can take the scheduled 
dose if taken within 8 hours of the scheduled time that was missed for QD dosing and within 
4 hours of the scheduled time that was missed for BID dosing. If more than 8 hours (for QD 
dosing) or 4 hours (for BID dosing) have passed after the scheduled time, then that missed 
 
[ADDRESS_1128692] not be “made up,” and the 
patient may be offered prophylactic anti -emetics prior to their next dose.  
For information on overdose, refer to Section  7.12 . 
5.2.1. Intra -patient Dose Escalation 
• Patients who are randomized to DCC-[ADDRESS_1128693] based on independent radiologic review may continue DCC-2618 at an 
increased dose of 150 mg BID. 
• Patients who are randomized to placebo who cross over to receive DCC-[ADDRESS_1128694] based on 
independent radiologic review will be given the option to cross over to receive DCC-2618 
150 mg  QD. Once the indepen dent radiologic review has confirmed disease progression, the 
patient's study drug treatment will be unblinded and either the patient may start the crossover 
procedures, or discontinue if the patient declines to enter the crossover.  
The initiation of cros sover will start with the assessments described in Cycle 1 Day 1 of 
Table 2 (Schedule of Assessments for Crossover). Following crossover, if a patient has 
disease progression by [CONTACT_815206], then the patient 
may continue DCC-2618 with the same dose if the Investigator feels the patient is receiving 
benefit from DCC -2618, may dose escalate according to the rules in S ection  5.2.1, or may 
discontinue DCC-2618. Detailed instructions will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
5.3. Dose Interruption and Modification  
Study drug may be interrupted or modified (ie, dose reduction) at the discretion of the 
Investigator at any time due to adverse event (AE), to accommodate palliative treatment, or 
for other reasons after consultation with the Sponsor. An interruption must be limited to no 
more than 1 cycle (28 days). Upon resumption following a dose interruption, the Investigator must continue with the patient’s original visit schedule calculated from Cycle [ADDRESS_1128695] be taken into consideration. The following guidance applies:  
• Planned minimally invasive surgery: study drug must be interrupted for [ADDRESS_1128696] 2018

5.6. Study Drug Compliance  
To ensure study drug compliance, the Investigator or designee must supervise all study drug 
dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel must review that the patient is 
compliant with study drug dosing and remind the patient of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance must also be assessed by [CONTACT_252864]. 
If a patient demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despi[INVESTIGATOR_363513], the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_815210].  
5.7. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the study site is the responsibility of the Investigator. The Inves tigator must ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this 
protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability 
responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. Drug accountability records 
indicating the study drug’s delivery date to the site, study drug inventory at the site, study 
drug dispensed to each patient, study drug returned by [CONTACT_6904], and study drug returned 
to the Sponsor or study drug destruction on site must be maintained by [CONTACT_977]. 
Accountability records must include dates, quantities, bottle numbers, and patient numbers. The Sponsor or its designee must review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis 
during monitoring visits. If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the 
Sponsor must be notified immediately. 
Patients must be instructed to return all unused, partially used, and used study drug bottles to 
the site at each visit. The study monitor must verify study drug records and inventory 
throughout the study. 
 
[ADDRESS_1128709] be instructed to return all used, partially used, and full study drug bottles. The 
site staff or pharmacy personnel (as appropriate) must retain all materials return ed by [CONTACT_815211]/designee or destroyed by [CONTACT_3452]. If the study drug will be destroyed at the study site, the Investigator or designee, must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, 
and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Destruction must be adequately 
documented. 
5.9. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment

will be stratified by:  
• Patients who have received [ADDRESS_1128710] received ≥[ADDRESS_1128711] received ≥4 prior 
anticancer treatments will be limited to 40% of the overall sample size.  
o Prior anticancer treatments are only counted once and without regard to when 
the patient received treatment, unless they were given as combination 
treatments.   
• ECOG=0 versus ECOG=[ADDRESS_1128712] be blinded, with the exception of the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the 
patient in the event of a life threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information  is important to ensure the safety of the 
patient and their fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vendors responsible for pharmacovigilance and regulatory personnel at the Sponsor to satisfy serious adverse event (SAE) processing and reporting regulations 
• Clinical Supply Chain  
• Unblinded statistician and programmer preparing the final (production) randomization list and unblinded analyses for the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) 
• IDMC  
• Vendors analyzing PK and biomarker samples 
• Vendor conducting the population PK analysis 
• IRT vendor 
 
[ADDRESS_1128713] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 97 • The Investigator, patient, site personnel, site monitor and study team will become 
unblinded to a specific patient's treatment assignment, if the patient has disease progression based on independent radiologic review. 
5.11. Unblinding  
Instructions for unblinding through IRT will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. 
Unblinding of the individual patient’s study drug assignment by [CONTACT_815212]: medical emergencies in which knowledge of the patient’s study 
drug is necessary for clinical management. In cases of medical emergencies, the Investigator must use their best judgment as to whether to unblind. If the Investigator deems it is not 
necessary to unblind immediately, the Investigator must first attempt to contact [CONTACT_815213]. If the Investigator has tried but is unable to reach the Sponsor, the Investigator must use their best judgment, based on the nature and 
urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having 
successfully reached and discussed the situation with the Sponsor. 
If a patient’s study drug assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency, the 
Sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_1128714] be documented clearly in the patient's source documents. Information regarding the study drug assignment obtained from the unblinding must be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled acces s and must not be shared with the Sponsor, contract 
research organization, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the patient). In 
addition, the Investigator must consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding 
must be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and 
if so, submit an SAE report, per Section 7.11. If a patient’s study drug assignment i s 
unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the patient must discontinue 
study drug. 
The Sponsor or designee may also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, the Sponsor may, for matt ers relating to safety concerns, 
unblind individual patients at any time.  
5.12. Prior and Concomitant Treatment and Procedures  
5.12.1. Prior Medications and Procedures  
Information regarding any medication or non-drug therapy or procedure taken or performed within [ADDRESS_1128715] be documented 
in the patient’s source documents and the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
5.12.2. Prior Anticancer Medications and Procedures  
Any prior anticancer medication or procedure must be documented in the patient’s source 
documents and the eCRF. 
5.12.3. Concomitant Medications  
All medications, including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter medications, and oral 
herbal preparations; non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815171] [ADDRESS_1128716] be documented in the 
patient’s source documents and the eCRF. In addition, any new treatments taken after the last

events.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128726] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 97 6.6.1. Timing of Assessment  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EuroQol 5- Dimension 5 -Level (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaires must 
be performed before the patient sees the Investigator or designee on the day of the scheduled 
visit. If the dermatologic examination or imaging assessments are completed within [ADDRESS_1128727] be 
performed prior to the EQ-5D- 5L, followed by [CONTACT_467410] 
(HCUQ).  
All other assessments may be completed in any order as shown in Table 1 (schedule of 
assessments) and Table 2  (schedule of assessments for crossover). 
6.7. Informed Consent Procedure  
Each patient must sign and date a study- specific informed consent form (ICF) before any 
study specific procedures can be performed. The ICF will comply with all applicable 
regulations governing the protection of patients. An ICF, approved by [CONTACT_815217]'s Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Research 
Ethics Board (REB) must be used. The Investigator or designee must document the 
consenting process, including the date when the informed consent form was signed in the patient’s source document.  
6.8. Assigning Patient Number  
A unique patient identification number (patient number) will be assig ned to each patient once 
informed consent is obtained. Detailed instructions on assigning patient numbers will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. If a patient is rescreened, the patient retains the 
original patient number. 
6.9. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic information must be collected at screening.  
Cancer history and prior treatment (including reason for discontinuation), must be obtained during screening. Cancer history will include: 
• Known histologic diagnosis of GIST 
• Tumor mutational status  
• All prior cancer treatment regimens, including:  
• Surgery (including tumor tissue sample[s]): include date(s), site(s), and extent of 
resection (eg, tumor tissue sample only, R0, R1, or R2) 
• Systemic therapy: include dates of treatment, agents (includin g dose and dosing 
regimen), reason for treatment (eg, adjuvant therapy or for metastatic disease), best 
response, date of disease progression or date and reason for treatment discontinuation 
other than disease progression. 
• Radiation therapy: include the site(s) treated, total dose(s), date(s) of treatment, and response(s) 
• Other procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (if applicable) 
Medical history, including any significant conditions or diseases that stopped at or prior to informed consent, must be elicited from each patient during screening. Based on the medical 
 
[ADDRESS_1128728] medical and surgical histories, and any allergies. Ongoing conditions are 
considered concurrent medical conditions; if possible, the start date for these comorbidities 
must be documented. 
6.10. Efficacy 
6.10.1. Radiologic Imaging 
All patients will have radiographic tumor evaluation by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scans of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest according to the schedule of study assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for crossover).  Radiologic 
imaging performed as standard of care prior to informed consent may be used as the Screening assessment as long as the imaging was performed within [ADDRESS_1128729] be confirmed ≥4 weeks later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen/pelvis and CT scan without contrast of the 
chest may be used for patients who are allergic to radiographic contrast media. Additionally, 
for patients whose local regulatory authority and/or ethics committee has not approved use of CT scans, MRIs may be used. Throughout the stud y, the same assessment technique must be 
used. Ultrasound scanning is not an acceptable substitute for CT scanning. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_815172] a separate protocol specific manual. The 
independent imaging vendor will assess the quality of the images and be responsible for 
performing an independent radiologic review. 
The independent imaging vendor must ensure that the independent radiologic reviewer 
remains bl inded to the local assessment from the Investigator and other unblinding 
information. This and all other imaging procedures will be documented in a protocol specific 
review charter agreed upon between the Sponsor and the independent imaging vendor before 
initiation of any independent radiologic reviews. 
The independent radiologic reviewer and Investigator will assess tumor response using 
modified RECIST (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Response as determined by [CONTACT_815218]. Data from the independent radiologic review will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. 
Confirmation of No Disease Progression:  If the independent radiologic reviewer c onfirms 
that there is no disease progression, the patient will continue to receive study drug unless 
there is a medical need (ie, rapid progression or clinical deterioration) that requires the study drug to be discontinued. If the Investigator determines progression based upon clinical 
deterioration, a scan must be performed and reviewed by [CONTACT_815219]. The basis for determination of progression per clinical deterioration must be documented in the patient’s source documents and eCRF. 
Confirmation of Disease Progression: Following confirmation of disease progression by 
[CONTACT_815204], the patient's treatment assignment will be unblinded via the IRT.  
• Patient s randomized to DCC -[ADDRESS_1128730] come back to the 
site for study drug to be dispensed. 
• Patients randomized to placebo  will be given the option to cross over to receive 
DCC -[ADDRESS_1128731] follow the 
schedule of assessments in Table 2. 
Confirma tion of Disease Progression Following Crossover: Following confirmation of 
disease progression by [CONTACT_815220], patients will be given the option to dose escalate according to the rules in Section 5.2.1, continue DCC-[ADDRESS_1128732] come back to the site for study drug to be dispensed. 
More details on image acquisition guidelines and radiographic assessment will be provided in 
a separate protocol specific manual.  
6.10.2. Overall Survival Follow- Up by [CONTACT_815221]. After the 
Safety Follow -Up Visit, patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3  months (±1 month) to collect 
long- term survival data.   
6.10.3. Patient Reported Outcome Measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS]. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality 
of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 -item (EORTC QLQ -C30) 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated, standardized, patient-completed questionnaire used 
extensively in international clinical studies and developed to assess health- related quality of 
life in patients with cancer (
28). The time required for completion is approximately 
3-5 minutes. Validated translations will be provided for sites in non- English -speaking 
countries. 
The questionnaire is composed of multi- item and single -item scales. These include 
5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, social 
functioning, cognitive functioning), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, 
dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale.  
The functioning and symptoms scales ask the patient to rate his or her experience for a particular item during the last week by [CONTACT_815222] “not at all,” “a little,” “quite a bit,” or “very much.” The 2 items comprising the global health status scale 
also evaluate the patient’s experience over t he past week using numerical rating scales with 1 
representing “very poor” and 7 representing “excellent.” 
Patients will be asked to complete EORTC -QLQ -C30 in their native language using an 
electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) system on provided tabl et computers before 
dosing at the visits indicated in Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of 
assessments for crossover).  
 
[ADDRESS_1128733] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 97 [IP_ADDRESS]. EuroQol 5- Dimension 5 -Level (EQ -5D-5L) 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a validated, standardized, patient -completed questionnaire developed by 
[CONTACT_815223] a measure of patient 
utility for clinical and economic appraisals ( 29). The time required for completion is 
approximately [ADDRESS_1128734] usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. 
The patient will select from 5 response levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate 
problems, severe problems, extreme problems) to rate their level of difficulty on that 
dimension that day. The EQ-5D-5L represents a revision to the original EQ-5D- 3L (with 
3 response levels per item) and has been shown to s ignificantly increase reliability and 
sensitivity (discriminatory power) while maintaining ease of completion.  
The sixth item is a EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS). The EQ -VAS records the 
patient’s self -rated health on a vertical scale with endpoints labeled “the best health you can 
imagine” and “the worst health you can imagine.” This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by [CONTACT_78037]. A patient is asked to “mark an X on the scale to indicate how your health is TODAY” and “write the number you 
marked on the scale in the box below.” 
Patients will be asked to complete EQ -5D- 5L after the EORTC -QLQ -C30 in their native 
language using an ePRO system on provided tablet computers before dosing at the visits 
indicat ed in Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for 
crossover). 
6.11. Safety  
The safety profile will be assessed based on physical examinations; ECOG PS; changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, LVEF based on echocardiogram/multigated acquisition scan 
(MUGA), dermatologic examination, and clinical laboratory tests; and the reporting of AEs.  
6.11.1. Physical Examinations 
A full physical examination will be performed at screening. A full physical examination 
includes a review of  the following systems: head/neck/thyroid, eyes/ears/nose/throat, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, lymph nodes, abdomen, skin, musculoskeletal, and neurological. 
Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. At 
all other visits, examinations will be driven by [CONTACT_583906]/or patient complaints. 
After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations must be reported as AEs.  
6.11.2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS (
30) will be assessed according to the schedule of 
assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for 
crossover). ECOG may be performed pre or post dose. 
6.11.3. Vital Signs, and Weight and Height 
Vital sign measurements, height, an d weight will be performed according to the schedule of 
assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for 
crossover). Vital sign measurements will include sitting blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
 
[ADDRESS_1128735] (seated or 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]). 
6.11.4. Electrocardiograms  
Digital, 12-lead ECGs will be performed with central over-reading according to the schedule 
of assessments in Table 1  (schedule of assessments) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for 
crossover). All sites will be provided with an ECG machine and associated materials by [CONTACT_815224].  
Performance of all ECGs must adhere to the following guidelines: 
• All standard digital ECGs must be performed after the patient has been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_47342] -recumbent position for at least [ADDRESS_1128736] period will start after 
the placement of the ECG leads.  
• The ECG must be performed before the dose of study drug. 
A hard copy of the ECG must be printed and signed by [CONTACT_2057].  
ECG data will be transmitted to the central ECG diagnostic service and all interval 
measurements will be reviewed and adjusted using the central ECG core labs methodology 
by a trained ECG analyst. A cardiologist at the central ECG diagnostic service will then 
review each ECG to confirm if intervals were calculated correctly and to provide an interpretation. A report containing this information will be provided to the site for review and 
signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_737]. This report will be filed with the machine ECG report for each 
visit in the patient’s source documents. The values reported by [CONTACT_441315].  
Heart rate and the following ECG intervals will be captured in the database:  
• PR interval  
• QT, QTcB (Bazett’s corrected QT interval [QTcB  = QT/RR
0.50]) and QTcF 
(QTcF  = QT/RR1/3) intervals  
• QRS duration 
• RR interval  
The central ECG diagnostic service's standard reference ranges will be used throughout the study.  
6.11.5. Echocardiograms/Multigated Acquisition Scans  
Echocardiograms or multigated acquisition scans (MUGAs) will be performed according to 
the schedule of assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessment s) and Table 2 (schedule of 
assessments for crossover). Echocardiogram or MUGA performed as standard of care prior 
to informed consent may be used as the Screening assessment as long as the echocardiogram 
or MUGA was performed within [ADDRESS_1128737] dose of study drug. The same 
modality (echocardiogram or MUGA) must be used throughout the study. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be documented in the patient’s source documents and eCRF. 
6.11.6. Dermatologic Examination 
All patients will be assessed by a consulting dermatologist for skin lesions, especially for 
SCC, actinic keratosis, and keratoacanthomas, according to the schedule of asses sments in 
 
[ADDRESS_1128738] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 97 Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for crossover) and as 
clinically indicated. The examinations must include the entire skin. Dermatologic exam that 
meets the protocol criteria that was performed as standard of care prior to informed consent 
may be used  as the Screening assessment as long as the exam was performed within [ADDRESS_1128739] be documented in the patient’s source documents and eCRF . In cas e 
of suspected SCC or keratoacanthomas, a skin biopsy must be taken for confirmation of 
diagnosis by a certified pathologist at the clinical site. Samples with confirmed SCC or 
keratoacanthoma lesions will be sent to a central laboratory for histopathological and/or 
molecular analysis.  
6.11.7. Ophthalmologic Examination 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be performed by a licensed ophthalmologist according to 
the schedule of assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of 
assessments for crossover) and if clinically indicated during treatment with study drug.  
Examinations will include examination of anterior structures (including cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens ) and posterior structures (including optic nerve, macula, retinal 
vessels, the retinal p eriphery, and the vitreous); assessment of intraocular pressure in each 
eye; assessment of visual acuity.  
This examination does not have to be repeated if there is documentation of an examination 
that met protocol criteria within [ADDRESS_1128740] dose of 
previous anticancer treatment.  
6.11.8. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples will be collected according to the schedule of assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments ) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for crossover) and 
analyzed at a central laboratory. All blood samples must be collected while patients are in a 
seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Specific instructions for the collection, processing and shipment of 
samples will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant must be reported as AEs ( Section  7.7.1). 
Screening laboratory results must be available before randomization. All samples must be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures and graded for toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_815225] 
(NCI -CTCAE), Version 4.03. 
Available local laboratory test results will be used for treatment management decisions (eg, dose modifications [ Section  5.3.2]) and initial assignment of CTCAE grading. Every effort 
must be made to discuss any changes to study drug dosing with the Sponsor before implementation, and only if not feasible beforehand, to inform the Sponsor within the same day. Central laboratory results will be used for final assignment of CTCAE grading. In the 
case of different grades associated with local versus central laboratory results for AEs, the 
central laboratory resul ts must be used for documenting AEs.

6.13.1. Sample Collection  
Biomarker and PD samples will be collected according to the schedule in Table 1 (schedule 
of assessments) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for crossover). A laboratory manual 
describing the details of obtaining, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_815173]. 
Remaining PD samples, including archival samples, will be stored for up to 15 years. These 
samples will be used for further analysis intended to address scientific questions related to 
study drug and/or cancer. A decision to perform such exploratory biomarker research studies 
will be based on data obtained from DCC-2618 clinical studies, new scientific findings related to the drug class or disease, and/or reagent and assay availability.  
6.13.2. Sample Ass essments  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Tissue Samples  
Mandatory archival and/or fresh tumor tissue samples will be collected and analyzed by a central laboratory to identify molecular alterations in KIT or PDGFRA or other kinases. At screening, an archival tumor tissue sample will be collected as long as no anticancer therapy 
was administered since the sample was collected. Fresh tumor tissue samples will only be 
collected if a patient qualifies for the study based on all other entry criteria and archival tissue is not available or not collected after the last  anticancer therapy.  
All Patients (optional): Additional tumor tissue samples may be collected for patients undergoing medical procedures including resection of metastases while on study or for patients that have disease progression if the patient consents and these samples will be used 
for further molecular testing of the cancer while treated with study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Plasma Samples  
Biomarker and PD plasma samples will be collected and analyzed by a central laboratory to 
evaluate mutations in KIT or PDGFRA and possibly other genes and their longitudinal 
frequency changes in cfDNA. Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_077]. Drug treatment effect on 
additional mutations of interest may also be evaluated.  
6.14. Pharmacogenomic Measurements  
6.14.1. Sample Collection  
A pharmacogenomic sample will be collected at Cycle 1 Day  1 according to the schedule of 
study assessments in Table 1 (schedule of assessments). A laboratory manual describing the details of obtaining, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_815174]. 
6.14.2. Sample Assessment  
A single whole blood sample will be collected and may be used to correlate study drug 
response and PK with individual genetic variation. The pharmacogenomic sampl e will be 
stored and analyzed by a central laboratory and may be stored for up to 15 years. 
6.15. Healthcare Utilization  
6.15.1. Healthcare Utilization Questionnaire (HCUQ)  
The Healthcare Utilization Questionnaire was designed specifically for this study to collect data on the use of healthcare resources. It will be completed via a patient interview conducted

Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 97 by [CONTACT_815228] 1 
(schedule of assessments) and Table 2 (schedule of assessments for crossover). The required 
time for completion is approximately [ADDRESS_1128758] section of the questionnaire deals with utilization of ambulatory healthcare services, with the staff member asking the patient about utilization of each of the services (emergency 
room, ambulance, primary care physician, specialist physician, counseling, other) and recording information as to whether the type of service had been used in the past 28 days 
(yes, no) and, if so, the number of times it was utilized. The second section proceeds in a 
similar way with data collection regarding the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815175] 28 days, the length of stay, and the reason for each admission (disease/treatment related, 
other). The last section focuses on paid care provided in the patient’s home by a nurse, home 
health aide, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815176], or another provider type in the last [ADDRESS_1128759] a causal 
relationship with the study drug. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, 
including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of the study drug, whether or not it is considered to be study drug related. This 
includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or 
frequency after the ICF is signed.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815177] i n the study and progression of underlying disease are not to 
be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the 
study (eg, surgery was performed earlier than planned). 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, must not 
be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  
Elective surgeries or procedures must not be reported as AEs, but must be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. 
Each AE must be assessed immediately to determine if it meets the definition of serious 
(Section  7.8). If a serious adverse event (SAE) occurs, expedited reporting must follow local 
and international regulations, as appropriate. 
7.2. Severity Assessment  
The Investigator must determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. The NCI -CTCAE, Versio n 4.03, must be used for grading the severity of AEs (Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program website; available at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf. 
The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE scale must be determined 
according to Table 13 . 
Table 13: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.03 Severity Grading Scale 
Grade 1  (Mild)  Experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and 
do not interfere with the patient's daily activities.  
Grade 2  (Moderate)  Experiences which introduce some level of inconvenience or concern the patient, and may somewhat interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212] (may include drug therapy).  
Grade 3  (Severe)  Experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly interrupt the 
patient's usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment.  
Grade 4  (Life -threatening)  Experiences which cause the patient to be in imminent danger of death.  
Grade 5  (Death)  Death related to AE.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128760] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 97 7.3. Causality Assessment  
The Investigator’s assessment of relationship of the AE, if any to the study drug must be 
provided for all AEs. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether 
there is reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
Relationship  to study drug administration must be determined by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator according 
to the following criteria in Table 14 . 
Table 14: Relationship to Study Drug Criteria  
Related  There is  an association between the event and the administration of study 
drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug and 
causes other than the study drug has been ruled out, and/or the event re-appeared on re- exposure to the study dr ug. 
Possibly Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of th e 
patient's clinical status or underlying disease.
 
Unlikely Related  The event is unlikely to be related to the study drug and likely to be related to factors other than the study drug.
 
Not Related  The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative 
etiology must be documented in the study patient’s medical record).  
 
For the purpose of the safety analyses, all AEs that are classified as possibly related will be 
considered treatment -related events.  
7.4. Study Drug Action Taken  
The Investigator must classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action 
taken must be classified according to the categories shown in Table 15 . 
Table 15: Classification for Study Drug Action Taken with Regard to an Adverse 
Event  
Classification  Definition  
Dose Not Changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE.  
Dose Reduced  Study drug dose reduced  in response to an AE.  
Drug Interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE.  
Drug Withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE.  
Not Applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration d oes not apply.  
"Not applicable" must be used in circumstances such as when the study drug had 
been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to 
continue, interrupt, or withdraw study drug is possible.  
 
7.5. Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE must be followed until the Investigator has determined and provided the final 
outcome. The outcome must be classified according to the categories shown in Table [ADDRESS_1128761] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 97 Table 16: Classifications for Outcome of an Adverse Event 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms.  
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms.  
Recovering/Resolving  Improvement of an AE  
Not Recovered/Not Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, 
such that it remains ongoing.  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. "Fatal" must be u sed when death is 
at least possibly related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a patient lost to follow -
up). 
 
7.6. Treatment Given  
The Investigator must ensure adequate medical care is provided to patients for any AEs. In 
addition, the Investigator must describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. "Yes" 
is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE and may include treatments such as 
other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. "No" indicates the abs ence of 
any kind of treatment for an AE.  
7.7. Additional Points to Consider for Adverse Events  
7.7.1. Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs must be assessed and those deemed as cli nically significant must be documented as an AE. 
When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment must be provided rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (eg, urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself may be listed as the AE (eg,  bacteria in urine or 
decreased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the patient has 1 or more 
of the following: 
• Worsening, from baseline, concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study 
assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention is required  
• A change in the dose of study drug, if study drug is withheld, or discontinuation from 
study drug occurs 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant must be made by [CONTACT_3786]. 
A laboratory abnormality judged to be Grade 4, in itself, may not constitute an SAE 
unless the clinical status of the patient indicates a life -threatening AE.  
Symptoms of the disease under study must not be recorded as AEs as long as they are within 
the nor mal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease, including 
significant worsening unless the deterioration was unexpected, and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128762] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 97 7.8. Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious i f it meets any of the following:  
• Results in death (regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or 
occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
• Is life threatening (an event/reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time 
of the event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes (ie, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at  home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse).  
Clinical outcomes or symptoms related to progressive disease need to be reported as an SAE 
if they meet SAE criter ia and occur within [ADDRESS_1128763] be reported according to the diagnosis or symptom of event and not by [CONTACT_123473] “progressive disease.”  
Clarification must be made between the terms "serious" and "severe," because they are not 
synonymous. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as "serious," which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and 
is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
7.9. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to study 
drug, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_379925]. Such AEs may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or removed during a study 
by a protocol amendment. 
The following AEs are considered AESI s: 
• SCC  
• Actinic keratosis  
• Keratoacanthoma  
 
[ADDRESS_1128764] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 97 7.10. Adverse Event Reporting Periods  
The AE (including SAEs and AESIs) reporting period begins from the time that the patient 
provides informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_1128765] be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study drug is suspected.  
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the safety reporting period ends at the time the 
new treatment is started; however, death must always be reported when it occurs during the safety reporting period irrespective of intervening treatment.  
7.11. Adverse Event, Serious Adverse Event, and Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Requirements  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information must be obtained in the form of non- leading questions (eg, “How are you feeling?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patients.  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to 
an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or 
other diagnostic procedures must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating 
a common underlying pathology must be noted as 1 comprehensive event. Accompanying 
signs or symptoms (eg, abnormal laboratory values) must not be reported as additional AEs. 
If a diagnosis is unknown, one or more symptoms may be reported as separate AEs. If an underlying diagnosis is subsequently determined for the reported symptom(s), then the reported symptom(s) term(s) must be revised to be “attributed” or “due” to the diagnosis. 
All SAEs and AESIs that occur within the reporting period, regardless of causality, must be 
reported by [CONTACT_815229] [ADDRESS_1128766] be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the Investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to the Sponsor the outcome of the event. Further instructions on reporting of SAEs will be provided in the Study Reference Manual
.  
If there are serious, unexpected, suspected adverse drug reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) associated with 
the use of the study drug, the Sponsor or authorized designee will ensure that the appropriate 
regulatory agency(ies) and all participating investigators are notified on an expedited basis. 
In addition, the Sponsor or authorized designee will be responsible for notification of 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the ethics committee. It is the respons ibility of the Investigator to promptly 
notify the local IRB/IEC/REB of S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to the institutional policy. An 
unexpected event is one that is not reported in the IB. 
7.12. Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error  
Occurrences of events of overdose, drug misuse, drug abuse and medication error must be 
reported to the Sponsor.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128767] : Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal 
products, which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584] [DIR 
2001/83/EC Art 1(16)]. 
Misuse : Intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product not in accordance with the 
prescribed or authorized dose, route of administration, and/or the indication(s) or not within 
the legal status of its supply. 
Overdose: Administration of a quantity of study drug given per administration or per day, 
which is above the assigned dose. 
Medication Error:  An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of 
the study drug. Medication errors are reportable to the Sponsor as defined below. 
• The dispensing, administration and/or use of the unassigned study drug. 
• The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_143187]. 
Note: Cases of patients missing doses of the study drug are not considered reportable as 
medication errors . 
AEs or SAEs associated with drug abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error must be 
reported as appropriate ( Section 7.1 and Section 7.8).  
 
[ADDRESS_1128768] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 97 8. WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF PATIENTS  
8.1. Withdrawal of Patients  
A patient is free to withdraw from the study drug and/or study for any reason and at any time 
without giv ing reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice. The Investigator is also 
free to terminate a patient's involvement in the study at any time if the patient's clinical condition warrants it. The primary reason for discontinuation or withdrawal of a patient from the study must be determined using the following categories:  
• Adverse event  
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Non-compliance with study drug 
• Physician decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Confirmed progressive disease by [CONTACT_76377]  
• Confirmed progressive disease by [CONTACT_551274]  
• Protocol deviation 
• Termination of site by [CONTACT_2728] 
• Termination of study by [CONTACT_2728] 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676]  
• Any other reason that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], would justify removing the 
patient from the study, based on the best interest of the patient 
If a patient voluntarily withdraws from the study, the Investigator should attempt to contact 
[CONTACT_118542](s) for discontinuation and request the patient return for an 
EOT Visit and Safety Foll ow up Visit. If a patient withdraws from the study for any reason 
other than withdrawal by [CONTACT_102], an EOT Visit and Safety Follow up Visit must be 
conducted, and the patient must be followed for overall survival . . Patients must return all 
used, partially used, and unused study drug bottles. 
8.2. Replacement of Patients  
Patients will not be replaced in this study.   
 
[ADDRESS_1128769] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 97 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size selection of approximately 120 patients (n=80 DCC-2618, n=40 placebo) 
was based on considerations for powering of the primary endpoint, key secondary endpoint, 
detection of rare safety events and overall exposure to DCC -2618, and assuming 15% patient 
dropout. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of DCC-2618 versus placebo. 
This sample size [105 patients (n=70 DCC-2618, n=35 placebo) with 90 events 
(55 DCC -2618, 35 placebo) at the final analysis] will have at least 90% power to detect a 
difference in PFS between DCC -2618 and placebo assuming a median PFS of 4.5 months for 
DCC -2618 and 1 month for placebo. Moreover, this assumes 9 months of uniform 
recruitment and 6 additional months of follow- up (total patient follow -up of 15 months). 
Furthermore, 105 patients (n=70 DCC-2618, n=35 placebo) will have approximately 80% 
power to detect a 0.2 difference in ORR assuming that the ORR for DCC-2618 = 0.22 and 
the ORR for placebo = 0.02. 
In addition, a minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_1128770] the incidence of rare safety events.  A sample of 80 patients yields 95% probability that 
the study will reveal at least one occurrence of all safety events that occur in patients at a rate of 4.0% or greater. This in combination with the exposure to DCC-2618 from other studies conducted in this clinical program will meet the recommendations for overall exposure 
recommended by [CONTACT_8415].  
9.2. Analysis Endpoints  
9.2.1. Primary Endpoint  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy  
Progression-free survival based on independent radiologic review using modified RECIST 
(1; Appendix 17.1). Modified RECIST criteria includes: 
• No lymph nodes chosen as target lesions; enlarged lymph nodes followed as non- target 
lesions;  
• No bone lesions chosen as target lesions;   
• PET not acceptable for radiological evaluation;  
• A progressively growing new tumor nodule within a pre- existing tumor mass must meet 
the following criteria to be considered as unequivocal evidence of progression according 
to the modification of RECIST Version 1.1: (a) the lesion is at least [ADDRESS_1128771] lesion (eg, enhancing with contras t or other criteria to rule 
out artefact); or (b) the lesion has to be expanding on at least 2 sequential imaging 
studies.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Healthcare Utilization  
• Changes over time in healthcare util ization  
9.3. Populations for Analysis  
The following populations will be used in the analysis: Intent- to-treat (ITT), Safety, PK, and 
Per Protocol (PP).  
The ITT population is defined as all patients who signed the informed consent and were 
randomized. The ITT po pulation will be used for all efficacy analysis as a primary analysis 
set with treatment assignment based on randomization.  
The Safety population is defined as all patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_1128773] protocol violations that are expected to compromise the efficacy and/or safety assessments 
(eg, patients enrolled who do not meet key eligibility criteria) during the st udy. Protocol 
violators resulting in exclusion from the PP population will be identified and documented 
prior to database lock. 
9.4. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
All available data will be included in data listings.  
Algorithms for  imputing partial or missing dates are shown in Table 17 . If a period 
determination cannot be made for an adverse event, it will be attributed to the randomized 
blinded period, with missing dates imputed as explained in Table 18 . Adverse event end 
dates are imputed to facilitate calculation of AE du ration.

Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 97 9.5. Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis for efficacy will be performed for this study. An IDMC will be used to 
review safety data periodically throughout the course of this study (see Section 10.1 for 
further details).  
9.6. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons  
To control family wise type- I error, the hypothesis tests for treatment difference will be 
performed at two -sided 0.05 level of significance sequentially in the following order:  
1. The primary endpoint PFS 
2. The key secondary endpoint ORR 
3. OS 
4. QOL as determined by [CONTACT_815232] 1  of cycle 2 in EORTC -QLQ -
C30 Role function and Physical function  (each at 0.025 level significance) 
 
Once a hypothesis test is nonsignificant at alpha=0.05 level, the remaining analyses will be 
viewed as descriptive.  
9.7. Blinding  
Prior to the unblinding of study data, the Sponsor will approve a comprehensive statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). 
Where required, safety personnel at the Sponsor or designee may be unblinded to a patient’s 
study drug assignment to meet reporting requirements to regulatory agencies. In addition, the Investigator, patient, Sponsor, and study team will be unblinded at the time the patient has 
disease progression by [CONTACT_815233]. 
Additional Sponsor representatives may be unblinded to some data for the purposes of 
ensuring adequacy of study conduct, including proper distribution of study drug. 
At no point in time  before official full study unblinding  will any aggregate efficacy and 
safety analyses be conducted by [CONTACT_815234], unless there is explicit permission to do so, for instance high level efficacy assessment for the purposes of 
IDMC review to determine the adequacy of the risk/benefit profile of the drug as it pertains 
to the conduct of the clinical trial.  
Upon determining the results based on the primary PFS analysis, all remaining patients will 
be unblinded to their treatment assignment and patients assigned to placebo will be allowed 
to cross- over to active therapy.  
9.8. Statistical Methods  
9.8.1. General Methods  
Data collected in this study will be documented using summary tables and patient data 
listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of 
patients, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and proportions. Time- to-event data  will be 
summarized via Kaplan -Meier (KM) methodology using the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th

assessment prior to that visit would be used.  
Medical history, adverse events, and concurrent procedures will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA). Prior and concomitant medications will be 
coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. 
This study will be broken into 2 periods: the randomized blinded period and the open- label 
portion which occurs after the study treatment unblinding at the time of disease progression 
based on the independent radiologic review.  
The data cut -off for the primary analysis will occur when [ADDRESS_1128777] patie nt is enrolled 
into the trial.  
Unless specified, the ITT population is used for efficacy analysis and the Safety population is 
used for the safety analysis.  
9.8.2. Disposition of Patients  
Patient disposition will be summarized overall for all patients who entered  the study 
(ie, signed the informed consent for the study). The number and proportion of patients who 
entered the open -label portion of the study will be displayed. In addition, the number of 
patients in each population ( ITT, Safety , and PP if applicable) and patients were removed 
from a population. The number and proportion of patients who complete the study, as well as those who discontinue the study will be summarized along with the reason for 
discontinuation. 
9.8.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics at study entry will be summarized for the ITT, 
Safet y, and PP populations. 
Medical history will be summarized overall for the Safety population.  
9.8.4. Extent of Exposure

percentage. In addition, the number of cycles received will be displayed using continuous 
descriptive statistics. These analyses will be performed for the Safety population. 
9.8.5. Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Endpoint: Progression -free Survival Analysis 
The primary endpoint of PFS (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date 
of randomization and the earliest documented evidence of disease progression based on the 
independent radiologic review, or death due to any cause. Patients who undergo surgical 
resection of target or non- target lesions, who have received other anticancer treatments, or 
patients who do not have a documented date of progression or death due to any cause will be 
censored at the date o f the last assessment. Analysis for PFS will be stratified  by [CONTACT_150087] [prior lines of therapy (3  versus  ≥4) and ECOG (0  versus 
1 or 2)] . The p- value will be from a [ADDRESS_1128778] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 97 Cox regression model with the treatment and the  randomization stratification factors as fixed 
factors and it’s 95% CI will be obtained using the Wald method.    
Analysis will be using the ITT population as the primary analysis and PP as supportive. 
Progression- free survival will have sensitivity analyses performed which will be further 
detailed in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Key Secondary Endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint is ORR. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Objective Response Rate Analysis  
Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR 
based on the independent radiologic review. This analysis will be performed in the ITT 
population as the primary analysis and the PP population as supportive analysis. To be assigned a status of a CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_815235] [ADDRESS_1128779] met. Patients with unknown or missing response will be treated as non -responders, that 
is, they will be included in the denominator when calculating the proportion. Time to 
confirmed response (CR or PR) (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the 
date of first dose of s tudy medication and the earliest date of first documented confirmed CR 
or confirmed PR. Patients who do not have a confirmed PR or CR will be censored at the 
date of the last adequate assessment. An unstratified two -sided Fisher’s Exact test at a 0.05 
significance level will be used to investigate statistical differences between treatment groups. 
A 95% confidence interval of treatment rate difference in ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_815236]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Time to Tumor Progression  
The secondary endpoint of TTP (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the 
date of randomization and the earliest documented evidence of disease progression based on 
the independent radiologic review. Patients who undergo surgical resection of target or non-target lesions, who have received other anticancer treatments, who do not have a documented 
date of progression or death due to any cause, or who die prior to tumor progression will be 
censored at the date of the last assessment. P -value for treatment dif ference will be obtained 
using the log rank test. Hazard ratio will be from a Cox regression model and it’s 95% 
confidence intervals will use Wald method. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Overall Survival 
Overall survival (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date of 
randomization and date of death from any cause. Patients who are still alive or who are lost 
to follow- up will be censored at the date of last contact. Differences between treatment 
groups will be evaluated using a model similar to that used for PFS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Time to Best Response Analysis 
The time to best response, as defined by [CONTACT_622449], will be summarized and displayed using KM methods in a manner similar to the PFS analysis as 
described above.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128780] 2018  
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 97 [IP_ADDRESS].4. Progression -free Survival based on Investigator Assessment  
PFS (reported in weeks) is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the 
earliest documented evidence of disease progression based on Investigator assessment, or 
death due to any cause. Patients who undergo surgical resection of target or non- target 
lesions, who have received other anticancer treatments, or patients who do not have a 
documented date of progression or death due to any cause will be censored at the date of the 
last assessment. Differences between treatment g roups will be evaluated using a model 
similar to that used for the primary endpoint. . 
[IP_ADDRESS].5. EORTC -QLQ- C30 
The EORTC -QLQ -C30 will be summarized by [CONTACT_99722]. In all scales, a high scale score 
represents a higher response level. The scoring for this questionnaire will be done in [ADDRESS_1128781] step is to estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale. This will be 
considered the raw score for the scale. After the raw score has been calculated, a linear transformation will be used to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. 
An analysis of covariance with treatment, KIT/PDGFRA fourth line/KIT/PDGFRA fifth 
line/PDGFRA D842V status, and ECOG status at baseline will be performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6. EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L will be summarized overall b y n and percentage for each level of each 
dimension. The Cochran–Mantel –Haenszel test will be used to test differences between 
DCC -2618 and placebo. The EQ-VAS will be summarized using continuous descriptive 
statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7. Disease Control Rate Analysis 
Disease control rate will be calculated and summarized with n and percentage at 12  weeks. 
Disease control will be defined as having a response (complete or partial) or stable disease. 
This analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_7206]. Fisher’s Exact test will be used to investigate statistical differences between treatment groups and the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) 
will be utilized to assess the effect of strata.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be summarized utilizing the number and proportion of patients overall 
and by [CONTACT_6278] (randomized/open- label), system organ class and preferred term for the Safety 
population. All tables will only include TEAEs, where treatment emergent is defined as any AE tha t occurs after administration of the first dose of study drug and through [ADDRESS_1128783] dose of study drug, but listings will include all AEs.  
Adverse event toxicity grade will be classified using NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria (See 
Table 13 ). If a patient has multiple occurrences of the same system organ class (SOC) or 
preferred term, then only the most severe event will be summarized in the tables for that SOC 
and preferred term. Adverse events of ≥Grade 3 will also be summarized. A missing toxicity 
grade will not be imputed. 
The AE analysis will be repeated for SAEs, AEs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, 
and AESIs.  
No formal hy pothesis- testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.

Data collected on the HCUQ will be summarize d using n and percentage or continuous 
descriptive statistics as appropriate based on the item collected. These data will be compared 
between treatment groups over time as applicable using the appropriate statistical test.  
9.8.11. Procedures for Reporting Deviatio ns to Original Statistical Analysis Plan  
All deviations from the original SAP will be provided in the final clinical study report.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128785]. 
The IDMC objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC 
Charter), which will be finalized before the first patient is randomized in the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128786] periodic monitoring visits to 
ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors will review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on eCRFs is accurate. The Investigator and 
institution will allow the Sponsor’s monitors or designees and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access  to source documents to perform this verification. 
The study site may be subject to review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_1034], or companies working with or on behalf of the Sponsor, and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].  
It is important that the Investigator and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
11.2. Protocol Compliance  
The Inve stigator must conduct the study in compliance with the protocol provided by [CONTACT_815240]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC/REB and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies). Modifications to the protocol must not be made without agreement 
between both the Investigator and the Sponsor. Changes to the protocol will require written 
IRB/IEC/REB and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51703], except when the modification is needed to eliminate an  immediate 
hazard(s) to patients. The IRB/IEC/REB may provide, if applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51704](s) in ongoing studies that have the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC/REB. The Sponsor must 
ensure that all protocol modifications are submitted to the regulatory authority(ies) in 
accordance with the governing regulations.  
If other unexpected circumstances arise that require deviation from protocol -specified 
procedures, the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor (and IRB, IEC, or REB, as 
required) to determine the appropriate course of action. 
The site must document all protocol deviations in the patient’s source documents. In the 
event of a significant deviation, the site must notify the Sponsor (and IRB, IEC, or REB, as 
required). Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or misconduct, increase the health risk to the patient, or confound interpretation of primary 
study assessments.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128787] indicate the patient’s 
participation in the study and must document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, 
other observations, and patient status. 
The Investigator, or designated representative, must complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected.  
The audit trail will show the user’s identification information and the date and time  of the 
any correction. The eCRFs must be signed electronically by [CONTACT_815241], including any changes made to the eCRFs, is correct and 
endorse the final submitted data for the patients for whom the Investigator is responsible. 
The completed eCRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and must not be made available in 
any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permis sion from the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final 
archival eCRF in the form of a compact disc or other electronic media will be provided to the 
site for placement in the Investigator’s study file.  
12.2. Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent forms, eCRFs, SAE forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting 
minutes, telephone calls reports). The recor ds must be retained by [CONTACT_815242], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is 
longer. 
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), the Sponsor must be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another 
Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor. The Investigator must obtain the 
Sponsor's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128788] of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical 
Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, adopted by [CONTACT_815243] ( 31). 
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and 
applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  
The Investigator must ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations 
for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in [ADDRESS_1128789] be prospectively approved by [CONTACT_28150]/IEC/REB and the Sponsor before use. 
The Investigator must ensure that each study patient is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. The Investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_737], must obtain written informed consent from each 
patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before any study -specific activity is 
performed. The Investigator must retain the original of each patient's signed consent form. 
13.3. IRB/IEC/REB  
It is the responsibility of th e Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, (eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable) from the IRB/IEC/REB. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC/REB must be retained in the Investigator Site File.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC/REB approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC/REB and the Sponsor in 
writing immediately after the implementation.  
13.4. Patient Confidentiality  
The Sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a patient’s source data must only be 
linked to the Sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification 
number. As permitted by [CONTACT_1763], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date of  birth may be used to verify the patient and accuracy of the patient’s 
unique identification number.

 Page 4 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/19 2.0 Objectives* 2.[ADDRESS_845248] the efficacy of an exposure-based intervention for perfectionism. The aims of the study include: • Evaluating whether a short-term computerized intervention can decrease perfectionism symptomatology (as measured by [CONTACT_298508] (FMPS)). • Seeing if this intervention also decreases levels of anxiety, depression, and symptoms of eating disorders.  2.2 We hypothesize that the exposure-based intervention for perfectionism (ETP) group will have significantly lower levels of perfectionism than the stress management group at post-test and follow-up. We also hypothesize that the ETP group will have decreased levels of anxiety, depression, and eating disorder symptoms at post-test and follow-up than those in the stress management group, after controlling for baseline scores. 3.0 Background*  3.[ADDRESS_845249] et al. (1990) indicated that there were five dimensions of perfectionism including (1) concern over mistakes, (2) personal standards, (3) doubts about actions, (4) parental expectations, (5) parental criticism, and (6) organization. Similarly, Hewitt and Flett (1990) also reported that perfectionism is multidimensional and includes self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism. A recent review of these conceptualizations showed that they continue to be accurate and relevant (Smith et al., in press).  Perfectionism has been associated with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders, making it a transdiagnostic concept (Dimaggio et al., 2015; Egan et al., 2011; Fairburn et al., 2003; Limburg et al., 2017). Perfectionism is an important target for intervention as it spans many different disorders and has a negative impact on intervention outcome. Higher levels of perfectionism have been found in individuals with anorexia or bulimia nervosa than in controls (Sassaroli et al., 2008). Bardone-Cone et al. (2007) suggested that repeatedly attempting to hide mistakes may lead those high in perfectionism to develop an eating disorder.  In addition, poor intervention response has been predicted by [CONTACT_633087] (Bizuel et al., 2001; Blatt, 1995; Blatt et al., 1998; Elkin et al., 1989; Shahar et al., 2004; Zuroff et al., 2000). More specifically, Blatt (1995) found that heightened perfectionism interfered with intervention for depression. In those with anorexia nervosa, perfectionism contributed to intervention resistance, drop out, and relapse (Bastani et al., 1995; Sutandar-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_633084]., 2003).  Several interventions for maladaptive perfectionism have been developed, including face to face and self-guided interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been the most commonly evaluated intervention for perfectionism thus far. A recent meta-analysis reviewed the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for perfectionism, including 15 randomized-controlled trials 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Exposure-Based Intervention for Perfectionism 
 Page 5 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/[ADDRESS_845250], placebo, and active control groups (Galloway et al., 2021). They found that CBT for perfectionism is efficacious with medium to large effect sizes reported for personal standards, concern over mistakes, and clinical perfectionism. Furthermore, medium effect sizes were reported for eating disorders and depression, and small-medium effect sizes were reported for anxiety. Additionally, a meta-analytic review of perfectionism intervention research had similar findings including significant reductions in perfectionism when compared to waitlist, general stress management, self-help, and a CBT-based general psychology group (Suh et al., 2019). Lloyd et al. (2015) also completed a meta-analytic examination of CBT for perfectionism and found that CBT, both in person and online, outperformed waitlist, self-help, and stress management control conditions with medium to large effect sizes. Decreases in depression and anxiety were also found post-intervention (Lloyd et al., 2015; Suh et al., 2019).   Though exposures have been used within cognitive behavioral therapy, only one intervention study thus far has focused on an intervention focusing completely on exposures (Redden & Cougle, under review). The exposure-based intervention for perfectionism (ETP) included several tasks designed to elicit accidental and intentional mistake-making to target elevated levels of concern over mistakes. These tasks were completed by [CONTACT_633088] (one session every three days). Compared to waitlist, ETP significantly decreased levels of overall perfectionism, concern over mistakes, levels of depression and social anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms. Effect sizes were comparable to previously evaluated longer interventions (e.g., 6 to 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy for perfectionism).  3.2 The knowledge gained from this study will add to the existing literature by [CONTACT_633089] a computerized intervention for perfectionism. We would like to further research on ETP by [CONTACT_480322] a stress management condition and observing if the effects remain one month after the intervention has been completed.  4.0 Study Endpoints* 4.[ADDRESS_845251] Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS)- Concern Over Mistakes Subscale at post-test. We will evaluate pre vs. post differences. The secondary endpoint will include scores from the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), and the ED-[ADDRESS_845252] versus one month follow-up differences on the above stated measures. 5.0 Study Intervention 5.1 Description: Exposure-Based Perfectionism Intervention (EPT) involves repeated engagement in computerized tasks that instruct participants to purposefully make mistakes. There are three main tasks: Shape Ordering Task: The first task presents participants with a series of shapes followed by a question asking in which order they saw the shapes. They have 20 seconds to decide in which order the shapes were presented. The task begins by [CONTACT_633090]: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Exposure-Based Intervention for Perfectionism 
 Page 6 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/[ADDRESS_845253] based on their responses.   Spelling Task: Participants are instructed to read a sentence then type the sentence in a textbox below misspelling three words. The screen immediately following displays their sentence with the spelling errors and tells participants to read the sentence. After 10 seconds, they are automatically advanced to a feedback screen that displays “incorrect”.  Math Task: Simple math problems (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are displayed to participants. Some of the math problems include both correct and incorrect answers while others only include incorrect answers, with participants actively choosing an incorrect answer to proceed in the task. For questions with both correct and incorrect answers, a “correct” or “incorrect” screen appears based on their response. For questions with only incorrect answers, a feedback screen appears with “incorrect”. 6.0 Procedures Involved* 6.1 The study will be a randomized control design, with 50% of participants receiving the ETP and 50% of subjects receiving the stress management condition.  • The stress management condition will consist of psychoeducational videos about exercise, diet, hygiene, social support, and sleep. This will be followed by [CONTACT_633091], wildlife, or space. This condition is based on previous studies run by [CONTACT_95205], including Cougle et al. (2017). 6.2 Participants will be identified using the mass screening survey distributed to the pool of psychology students maintained by [CONTACT_633092] (SONA) or using a brief, [ADDRESS_845254] complete the informed consent before beginning other study procedures. After consenting, the participant will be directed to complete the FMPS and questions to assess exclusion criteria. If the participant scores a 28 or lower on the FMPS-CM or do not meet all inclusion, they will be given credit for their time (.5 credits) and the experiment will end.  In addition to student participants recruited via the mass screener and SONA, participants from the community will be provided the opportunity to participate for monetary compensation in the form of Amazon gift cards, which will be sent to them via email. Community participants will be given a link to the informed consent form before beginning study procedures. After consenting, community participants will be directed to complete the FMPS and questions to assess exclusion criteria. If they score lower than 29 on the FMPS-CM or meet any 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Exposure-Based Intervention for Perfectionism 
 Page 7 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/19 exclusionary criteria, they will be told they do not qualify for the study and will not be compensated. If participants meet inclusion criteria, they will be randomized to either the exposure-based perfectionism intervention (ETP) group or the stress management group. Based on that randomization, they will be sent one of two Qualtrics links: 1. Stress Management Condition Qualtrics Link: This link will include questionnaires asking about their perfectionism, mood, and behaviors. A detailed list of questionnaires is provided below. After completing questionnaires, participants will be directed to a screen explaining that they will watch a series of videos educating them on health behaviors, including exercise, diet, sleep, and social support, and will then watch relaxing videos about nature. They will also be informed that they will be asked to click on a link to complete the first session immediately following this video and complete the sessions at home 7 times: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and [ADDRESS_845255] session will be provided on the page after this explanation. At the end of the session, they will be directed to a screen reminding them that they will receive Qualtrics links 7 more times over the next two weeks: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after the baseline visit. They will be instructed to complete each intervention session within 24 hours of receiving the link. 2. ETP Qualtrics Link: This link will include questionnaires asking about their perfectionism, mood, and behaviors. A detailed list of questionnaires is provided below. After completing questionnaires, participants will be directed to a screen providing information about perfectionism and the rationale of the intervention. They will also be informed that they will be asked to click on a link to complete the first intervention session immediately following this video and complete the intervention at home 7 more times: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and [ADDRESS_845256] intervention session using the provided link. This will include three tasks, each targeting specific symptoms of perfectionism. Detailed information about the tasks is provided above. At the end of the intervention session, they will be directed to watch a video reminding them that they will receive Qualtrics links 7 more times over the next two weeks: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_845257] via email for $[ADDRESS_845258], delivered via email, for $10 after completing the follow-up questionnaires. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Exposure-Based Intervention for Perfectionism 
 Page 8 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/19 All participants will be debriefed after completing follow-up assessments.  After completing all assessments for the study, participants will be emailed to ask for feedback about the treatment. The text of the email will say: “We are interested in your feedback on the treatment for perfectionism you received. What were your general impressions of the treatment? Were there parts of the treatment you would change to make it better? If so, what would you recommend?”  They may opt-out or not reply if they choose.

Data will include demographics and self-report questionnaire responses. 7.0 Data and Specimen Banking* 7.[ADDRESS_845259] access to. 7.2 The data stored will include demographics and all responses to self-report questionnaires. Subjects will be assigned an ID number. Data will not be linked to participants’ names. 8.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects* 8.1 Individual or study results will not be shared with subjects directly.  9.0 Study Timelines* 9.[ADDRESS_845260] Population*

Subjects must be between the ages of [ADDRESS_845262] 4 weeks. 10.3 We will exclude the following populations: • Adults unable to consent • Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) • Prisoners 11.0 Vulnerable Populations* N/A 12.[ADDRESS_845263] pool and through the community using flyers and online advertisements. 13.2 Subjects will be identified using the mass screening survey. They may also respond to the posting on SONA, a flyer, or an online advertisement.  13.3 Questions from the FMPS will be used on the mass screening survey in order to recruit subjects. Study slots will be posted on SONA, which potential subjects can see if they are eligible to sign up for.  14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects* 14.[ADDRESS_845264] assessment. 15.0 Risks to Subjects* 15.1 The risks to human subjects in the proposed study are minimal. Nevertheless, precautions will be taken to minimize participants’ risk in the study. All individuals will be informed of the nature of the investigation and the types of assessments and procedures. Participants will be given an opportunity to have any questions answered to their satisfaction and then will be asked to sign an informed consent statement prior to participating in the project. The specific potential risks involved in the proposed investigation are enumerated below.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Exposure-Based Intervention for Perfectionism 
 Page 10 of 17 Version 1: 3/30/19 Self-report measures:  There are no foreseeable risks associated with these assessment procedures. While some participants may be hesitant to answer the assessment forms, others may derive benefit from the self-assessment as it could increase their awareness of the relationship between their symptoms and environmental, cognitive, and interpersonal factors. In addition, referrals to appropriate clinical services (e.g., ABHC, FSU Psychology Clinic) will be provided for any participants seeking intervention after the study. Phone numbers for these clinical services will be provided within the debriefing form, which will be available for participants to read on Qualtrics after completing the follow-up questionnaires. Intervention risks: The perfectionism intervention is exposure-based, which means that it is expected to involve some discomfort for the subject. The intervention may lead to distress for subjects. They are told that they may feel psychologically uncomfortable, but that it is expected during this intervention. Participants will be able to stop intervention at any time. The benefits of exposure-based interventions have shown that though anxiety-provoking, the distress is temporary and there is often symptom-relief both in the short and long-term. For the stress management condition, similar tasks have been used in previous research (Cougle et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019) and are very unlikely to cause any significant distress or discomfort.  General Protection Against Risks:  At their request, participants will be referred to clinicians with whom they may speak about their discomfort or distress.  Safeguards for maintaining confidentiality:  The confidentiality of all participants in this study will be maintained. Each participant will be assigned an Identification Code with which all questionnaires will be labeled. This Identification Code will be used as the participant’s username [CONTACT_298518]. The information from the website will be secure and only accessible to study personnel. All answers to the participants’ questions will be identified by [CONTACT_298511]. Names will not appear on any of the results. No individual responses will be reported in any publications. All project staff and participants will be well informed about regulations pertaining to confidentiality. The link between subject and identification number will be destroyed following completion of the study. No records or assessment information will be released to any other person. No audio or videotapes will be used. Safeguards for maintaining patient safety: Persons who express high risk symptomatology (e.g., suicidal ideation or other forms of serious threat to themselves or others) at any time they are in contact [CONTACT_298512]. This would include assessment of seriousness of danger or disablement and referral for immediate crisis management (e.g., hotlines, crisis centers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or contact[CONTACT_298513]). Study personnel who have direct contact [CONTACT_52701] (e.g., scheduling staff) will be trained in methods of crisis

In view of the safeguards detailed above, the possibility of a medical or psychological incident arising is remote. 15.[ADDRESS_845265] unforeseeable risks. 16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects* 16.1 Potential individual benefits to subjects include decreasing their levels of perfectionism and/or decreasing levels of depression, anxiety, or eating disorder symptomatology. 17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality 17.1 The data analysis plan begins with univariate and multivariate outliers being identified and transformed via Winsorization (Tukey & McLaughlin, 1963). Skewness and kurtosis will also be evaluated. Baseline differences between groups will then be identified using Chi-squared tests and independent samples t-tests. To analyze main outcomes, hierarchical intent-to-treat regression models will be used. These models will control for baseline variables. Multiple imputation using [ADDRESS_845266] sizes will be calculated using R2 change values and were interpreted using Cohen’s guidelines: small = .01, medium = .09, large = .25 (Cohen, 1988).  Secondary analyses include intervention response on measures of depression, trait anxiety, social anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms. Baseline values will be covaried in the regression models. 17.[ADDRESS_845267] protected on an encrypted computer only accessible by [CONTACT_5051]. All identifying information will be removed and subjects will be referred to by [CONTACT_96593]. Consent forms that include subjects’ names will be stored on an encrypted computer only accessible to the research staff.  17.3 How data will be handled: • Information in the data will include an ID number, demographics and all self-report assessment responses. • Data will be stored in password-protected files on an encrypted computer that only the study team has access to. • Data will be stored for a minimum of 4 years after study completion. • Only members of the study team (i.e., those listed on the IRB submission) will have access to the data. • The investigator is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data. • If data needs to be transported, it will be done via password protected files on encrypted computers. 18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects* N/A 19.[ADDRESS_845268] the Privacy Interests of Subjects

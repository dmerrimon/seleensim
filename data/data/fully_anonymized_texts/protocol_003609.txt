The overall aim  of this study  is to conduct  a formal, real world test of the efficacy  of Family -centered function -
focused care (Fam -FFC) on patient and caregiver -centered outcomes  in community - dwelling,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772149].  
              Aim 1: Validate the efficacy of Fam -FFC on physical function (ADLs/ performance and physical activity),  
              delirium occurrence and severity, behavior, and mood.  
H1: Patients  exposed  to Fam -FFC will demonstrate more return to baseline ADL function  as compared  to those  in 
the control  condition.  
H2:  Patients  exposed  to Fam -FFC will demonstrate increased physical activity, improved chair rise  and less 
delirium  occurrence  and severity, less NPS, and less depression,  as compared  to those  in the control  condition.  
        Aim 2: Evaluate  the impact  of Fam -FFC on CG –centered outcomes.  
H3: CGs exposed  to Fam -FFC will demonstrate  improved  preparedness  for caregiving, and less  strain , burden, 
and desire  to institutionalize  as compared  to those  in the control  condition . 
               Aim 3: Evaluate the relative costs for Fam -FFC v. control condition, and calculate health care (post -  
               acute health care utilization) costs and total cost savings for Fam -FFC.   
               H4: Patients exposed to Fam -FFC will demonstrate higher intervention costs but lower post -discharge  
               cost for health care services (emergency room admissions, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], and long -term  
               nursing home admissions) as compared to those in the control condition.  
               H5: Patients exposed to Fam -FFC will demonstrate total cost savings overtime as compared to those  in the  
         control condition.

Describe the scientific background and gaps in current knowledge.  
Page 4 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6)  
 Persons  with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) account  for 3.[ADDRESS_1060039] are more likely to experience potentially preventable complications such 
as delirium,  neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), pressure ulcers, falls, and nutritional deficiencies.5-[ADDRESS_1060040] clinically 
significant functional decline resulting in increased risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], emergency department use, 
morbidity, earlier mortality,9-14 and long -term care placement .  15,16  
 Prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], approximately 75% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772150],2, 17,[ADDRESS_1060041] 
their relative return home.19,20  However, family caregivers (CGs) are limited in the amount of physical care they 
can provide in terms of lifting, moving and providing incontinence care.21  The additive  stress  of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
and the patient’s  increased  functional  dependency, often co -existing with persistent delirium,  compounds  the 
strain  of the family  CG,[ADDRESS_1060042]. Our 
team’s extensive preliminary work identified factors  associated with  negative outcomes, including:  1) non -dementia 
friendly care processes (i.e., inadequate  assessment of patient/CG needs and preferences),32,33 2) activity -restrictive 
policies and environments,34-39 3) staff under -prepared to care for persons with cognitive impairment,40,41 and 4) 
patient, staff, and CG attitudes regarding physical activity in the acute setting. 42,43 Another salient finding was that 
patients were more likely to be involved in function –promoting activities (e.g., walking, using the toilet) when family  
CGs encouraged them and advocated for them to do so.43-[ADDRESS_1060043]  identified that a social -
ecological approach (function -focused care; FFC) improves functional outcomes in long -term care residents with 
ADRD.49-53 FFC components include: 1) policy and environmental assessment; 2) staff education; and (3) mentoring 
and motivating nursing staff and patients. Our team has conducted a series of preliminary studies demonstrating the 
benefits of adapting this model for t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].42-44, 54 -58 In an intervention entitled, Family -centered 
function -focused care (Fam -FFC), we modified FFC components to the unique needs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772151].59   
Fam -FFC provides expert  dementia care  by [CONTACT_772237] (nursing staff) through adaptations to the physical 
and care environment but,  importantly,  incorporates  the additional  component  of the patient’s  family  CG. In our 
unique  family -centered  care  approach,  nurses  purposefully  engage  CGs in the assessment, decision -making,  care  
delivery,  and evaluation beginning at admission, continuing through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772152] [ADDRESS_1060044] -acute 
period . Fam -FFC emphasizes t he critical  role of CGs as often  the expert,  voice, and  advocate  of the patient’s  needs  
and desires. In non -randomized, feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409], Fam -FFC demonstrated moderate effect sizes in improving ADL 
function and reducing delirium as well as increasing family CG preparedness for caregiving, without increasing CG 
strain.59,60 These pi[INVESTIGATOR_772153] .   
 
2.2 Previous Data  
Describe any relevant preliminary data.  
 
• Understanding and documentation of functional decline in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84360] . From our longitudinal, 
descriptive studies, 36, 55 we concluded: (a) most patients (70 -80%) did not return to baseline function; (b) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772154] a decline in functional status (worse in situations of high family caregiver 
strain115); and (c) factors associated with failure to return to baseline by [CONTACT_772238], delirium, and cognitive impairment. We als o found that controlling for baseline/admission 
ADL function and cognition, the degree to which nurses encouraged self -care and physical activity in routine 
interactions with patients (FFC) was associated less functional (ADL) loss from admission to discharge , and baseline 
Page 5 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) to discharge .55  
• Barriers and facilitators to the engagement of older adults in functional and physical activities . Qualitative and 
mixed method approaches identified barriers: 42-44, 54, 56  (a) intrinsic patient factors including cognitive impairment, 
delirium, depression, fear of falling, and symptoms (emphasizing the need for individualized treatment plans); (b) 
inadequate staff knowledge regarding care of the patients with dementia includi ng behavioral manifestations of 
distress, techniques to motivate, and communication and collaboration with families; (c) family beliefs and attitudes 
toward physical activity; (d ) environmental impediments (e.g., inadequate bed/toilet height, seating, walking paths, 
lighting, access to assistive and sensory devices); (e) policy barriers such as inadequate assessment of physical and 
cognitive function; inadequate information of the  patient’s social profile and family roles; lack of a care planning 
process to address symptom management, delirium prevention, and function; and the need to incorporate plans for 
functional recovery into discharge planning and post -acute follow -up. The fa mily CG can provide motivation, 
support, and encouragement to promote physical activity but was rarely engaged to do so. 42-44, 54, 56 This work 
informed the development of Family -centered Function -focused Care (Fam -FFC).  
• Development and Feasibility Testing of Fam -FFC.  
       The first pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (24% of eligible recruited; attrition less than 5%, 28% of sample with ADRD) demonstrated 
feasibility of the staff training, nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772155], environmental and policy  assessments, systematic method of 
partnering with families in function -focused care, and post -acute follow -up.60 Treatment fidelity observations of care 
delivery by [CONTACT_772239] ≥ 90% agreement between the care plan and enactment of the plan. Qualitative 
data showed that families of persons with ADRD re ported the need for education, support, and engagement unique 
to managing their relative with ADRD.[ADDRESS_1060045] recruitment/ enrollment 
strategies and customization of Fam -FFC for persons with ADRD (including adapted communication, motivation 
techniques, behavioral support). The subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_772156].  
        The second pi[INVESTIGATOR_772157] 60  incorporated recruitment 
approaches to include: a) twice a day phone contact [CONTACT_772240],(b) 
incentives for unit managers to assist recruiting (free continuing education programs for staff unrelated to the study  
focus), and (c) the coordination of recruitment activity so as not to conflict with routine patient and staff activity 
(e.g., rounds, meals, peak personal care times) . Enrollment of eligible patients increased from 24% in the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 60 
to 41% of potential and 97% of eligible participants enrolled in the second study.59 Patients were able to participate 
in data collection and tasks. Attrition and missing data was less than 5% in both pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].59,[ADDRESS_1060046] 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], patients exposed to Fam -FFC demonstrated closer return to baseline ADL performance ( Χ2 p = .003) at two 
months post -discharge, less 30 -day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394] ( Χ2 = 5.8, p = .02), and le ss delirium ( Χ2 = 3.8, p = .05).  CGs 
who participated in Fam -FFC reported better preparedness for caregiving (F (2.6) = 3.0, p =.04, partial η2= .06 ), from 
admission to two months post -discharge, with no significant increases in strain or decreased mutuality (relationship 
with the patient). 59, [ADDRESS_1060047] demonstrated that Fam -FFC is feasible to implement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772158]’s disease and related dementias . We found that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772159].  
The next step  is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to further our understanding of mechanisms of functional 
decline.   This design will allow us to examine functional decline over a longer period of time, validate both the short 
and long term consequences of fun ctional decline as well as cost, and determine how a multi -component 
intervention can alter this course.   We are particularly interested in building caregiver science to understand 
whether and how caregivers become an essential part of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772160], and whether this is associated with 
better overall CG outcomes as well.

records in the facility. If the individual agrees, this data will be handled the same as all other research 
data.  Subjects will not be replaced.  
 
Page 8 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) 4.0 Recruitment Methods  
 
4.1 Identification of subjects  
Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects or the source of the subjects.  If not 
recruiting subjects directly (e.g., database query for eligible records or samples) state what will be 
queried, how and by [CONTACT_20898].  
 
The Project Manager, research evaluators and PI  [INVESTIGATOR_772162] 
a list of potentially eligible patients  and recruit 146  patient/family caregiver dyads per partici pating 
setting (total sample 438 dyads ). We are requesting a partial waiver  to allow identification and, as 
appropriate, contact [CONTACT_772242] .  A flyer 
posted in the nursing station will alert/remind nursing staff of the study and ask them to refer potential 
study participants. It is the study staff’s responsibility to ask permission of the patient to explain the 
study to the patient.  
 
4.2 Recruitment process  
Describe how, where and when potential subjects will be recruited (e.g., approaching or providing 
information to potential subjects for participation in this research study).  
 
The research evaluators will provide IRB-approved information about the study/invitation to participate 
will to all potentially eligible patients/legally authorized representative (LAR) admitted to the study units  
(six medical or medical/surgical units of three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772163]) . The  patient and LAR will be 
approached to visit and discuss the study, and if granted, will receive: 1) brief oral information about the 
study; and 2) a copy of the consent form. The requirement to have a family CG (defined as the primary 
person providing ove rsight and support on an ongoing basis) involved and consented is explained to the 
patient/LAR. The patient and LAR may decide that another person, a CG other than the LAR, is the best 
person to participate in the study. In that case, that CG is provided i nformation and if agreeable, 
engaged in the consent process.  
 
Additionally, for the exploratory aim of assessing the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, we 
will recruit family CGs  who self -identify as black, Latino, Asian and white, randomly selected from the 
Fam -FFC sample. Approximately 10 percent of families from each ethnic group represented in the study 
will be provided verbal information and approached for consent for participation in these interviews .   
Additionally, the six nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772164] /her 
particular unit/setting to provide their perspective on the cultural appropriateness of Fam -FFC.  At the 
conclusion of the intervention at each site, approximately 6-8 nurses  representing both shifts will be 
recruited to participate voluntarily in focus groups evaluating nurse -reported perceptions of: influence 
of nurse managers, organizational culture, likelihood of continuing to implement the intervention, and 
satisfaction.    The purpose, voluntary nature, confidentiality, setting, time, and duration of the focus 
group will be shared with staff nurses at a sta ff meeting.  If more than [ADDRESS_1060054] the materials that will be used to recruit subjects. Add recruitment documents to your study in CATS 
IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ) on the “Consent Forms and Recruitment Materials” page. For advertisements, 
upload the final copy of printed advertisements. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach 
the final audio/video tape. You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior to tapi[INVESTIGATOR_73153]-tapi[INVESTIGATOR_47223], provided the IRB reviews the final audio/video tape.  
  The data evaluator, responsible for recruitment, will provide information to all potential participants ,  
  using a flyer and verbal script .  This information will be provided in person, and in some cases over the  
  phone to family members who are not present .   
 
Page 9 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) 4.4 Eligibility/screening of subjects  
If potential subjects will be asked eligibility questions before obtaining informed consent, describe the 
process. Add the script documents and a list of the eligibility questions that will be used to your study in 
CATS IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ) on the “Consent Forms and Recruitment Materials” page.  
 
Both patient and CG (who may or may not be the LAR) consent are required for the study process to 
proceed to screening. The research evaluator will check CG eligibility  (able to recall at least two  words 
on the Three Word Recall ) in person or over the phone, and then screen the patient in person for 
dementia using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 123 and AD8.128 Patients who screen positive 
for dementia will then be assessed for severity of dementia using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). A 
diagnosis of very mild to moderate stage dementia as confirmed by a score of 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical 
Dementia Rating Sc ale will be required. Functional ability will be assessed with the Pfeffer  Functional 
Activities Questionnaire (F AQ) to discriminate MCI from dementia . 
 
5.0 Consent Process and Documentation  
Refer to “SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090)”, for information about the process of 
obtaining informed consent from subjects.  HRP -090 can be accessed by [CONTACT_109612] 
(http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
5.1 Consent Process  
  
5.1.1 Obtaining Informed Consent  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing and Location of Consent  
Describe where and when the consent process will take place.  
 
The consent process of patient/family caregiver dyads will occur within 48 hours of admission to the 
unit.  Patients will be consented in person. The family caregivers will also be consented in person unless 
they are unable to be present with the research staff within the 48 - hour timeframe, in which case they 
will be consented over the telephone.   Nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772165] , prior to patient/family caregiver enrollment .  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s taff nurses will be consented for post -
intervention focus groups at the conclusion  of the intervention.  All consenting will occur within a 
private setting .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Coercion or Undue Influence during Consent  
Describe the steps that will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or 
undue influence in the consent process.  
 
Patient/family caregivers will be informed about the study .  Research staff are trained to give sufficient 
time for answers and questions and to offer to come back/give extra time for consideration.  Because 
the focus of this study is partnership with the family caregiver to improve the care /outcomes of persons 
with dementia, we will inform patients/families that in order to be eligible to participate, both members 
of the dyad need to assent or consent.  If one member of the chooses not to participate, we don’t enroll 
the dyad, and assure them that there are no negative sequelae associated with this decision.   
 
Both patient/family caregivers will need to pass the Evaluation to Sign Consent to fully consent. This will 
assure that they understand what they are volunteering to participate in  the study.  Both patient and 
family caregivers will be informed that the decision to participate or not will have no bearing on the care 
and services provided by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_772166] .   
 
We will provide a $[ADDRESS_1060055] -discharge data collection,   and upon conclusion of the study. The two 
Page 10 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) different time -periods and modest nature of this honorarium offset the potential for undue 
influence.  
 
The inclusion of nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772167].  Those who volunteer 
will be consented.   All staff will be informed that their decision to participate or not will not in any way 
influence their working conditions or standing.  
 
5.1.2 Waiver or alteration of the informed consent requirement  
If you are requesting a waiver or alteration of consent (consent will not be obtained, required 
information will not be disclosed, or the research involves deception), describe the rationale 
for the request in this section.  If the alteration is because of deception or incomplete 
disclosure, explain whe ther and how subjects will be debriefed. Add any debriefing materials or 
document(s) to your study in CATS IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ) on the “ Supporting Documents” 
page.  NOTE: Review the “CHECKLIST: Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (HRP -410)” to 
ensure you have provided sufficient information for the IRB to make these determinations.

5.2 Consent Documentation  
 
5.2.1 Written Documentation of Consent  
Refer to “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” for information about the process 
to document the informed consent process in writing.  HRP -091 can be accessed by [CONTACT_396865] ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
If you will document consent in writing, describe how consent of the subject will be documented 
in writing. Add the consent document(s) to your study in CATS IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ) on the 
“Consent Forms and Recruitment Materials” page. Links to Penn State’s consent templates are 
available in the same location where they are uploaded and their use is required.  
   
The following participants will be consented: 1) patient and CG, 2) nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], and 3) nurses.  
 
Both patient and CG consent are required. After information is provided, and the patient and CG agree 
to participate, an evaluation of capacity to provide consent will be conducted, using the Evaluation to 
Sign Consent (ESC).131 If capacity is determined the patient may provide his or her own consent. If 
decisional capacity is impaired, and the patient provides assent , the LAR will complete the consent 
process. The legally authorized representative will be encouraged to try and determine what the patient 
would do if competent and base hi s/her decision upon what he/she thinks is in the patient’s best 
interest. The CG’s ability to sign consent will also be evaluated using the ESC. Only CGs answering all ESC 
questions correctly will be enrolled. Both patient and CG (who may or may not be the  LAR) consent are 
required for the study process to proceed to screening.  The consenting party is requested to sign the 
consent form.  If it is not possible to obtain written signature [CONTACT_772279], verbal consent may be 
documented. The research evaluator  will check CG eligibility  (including the ability to recall at least two 
words on the  Three Word Recall ) and then screen the patient for dementia using the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) 123 and AD8.128 Patients who screen positive for dementia will then be assessed for 
severity of dementia using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). A diagnosis of very mild to moderate 
stage dementia as confirmed by a score of 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sc ale will be 
required. Functional ability will be  assessed with the Pfeffer  Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) to 
discriminate MCI from dementia.132 
 
Prior to the study the PI [INVESTIGATOR_772168] (to cover both nursing  shifts). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_772169] 11 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) volunteers , in order to support the ir right to refuse  without losing any job standing, as well as  to support 
the success of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_772170] s in private , explain the 
purpose of the study, procedures, possible risks and benefits, time commitment, compensation, privacy/  
confidentiality, payment, PI [INVESTIGATOR_225988], and voluntary nature of the research, including the 
interview that will be conducted at the end of the study.  If the nurse declines to participat e as  
champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394],  another potential participant will be recruited and asked to provide an informed consent. A 
total of six nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772171].  
 
At the end of the study at each of the three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772172], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_629092] a staff meeting on the three 
intervention units.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_772173]’ feedback on the 
effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention . Staff nurses will receive information on the focus 
groups  and asked to participate. The nurses will receive information about the purpose, procedures, 
possible risks and benefits, time commitment, compensation, privacy/confidentiality, payment, PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_225988], and voluntary nature of the research  
 
  All participants will receive a copy of the consent to keep for future reference.  
 
 
5.2.2 Waiver of Documentation of Consent (Implied consent, Verbal consent, etc.)  
If you will obtain consent (verbal or implied), but not document consent in writing, describe how 
consent will be obtained. Add the consent script(s) and/or information sheet(s) to your study in 
CATS IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ) on the “Consent Forms and Recruitment Materials” page. Links to 
Penn State’s consent templates are available in the same location where they are uploaded and 
their use is required. Review “CHECKLIST: Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -
411)” to ensure that you have provided sufficient information. HRP -411 can be accessed by 
[CONTACT_109612] ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
If your research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no 
procedures for which written documentation of consent is normally required outside of the 
research context, the IRB will generally waive the requirement to obtain writt en documentation 
of consent.  
 
The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no 
procedures for which written documentation of consent is normally required in acute care 
settings .  There are patients who are unable to write  or unable to consent due to cognitive 
impairment (unable to pass the Evaluation to Sign Consent)  but would like to participate in the 
study or are willing to have us speak with their LAR. There are also situations in which the LAR 
would really like to have the patient participate but can't meet face -to-face to sign the consent 
or HIPPA form ; in this case the research staff will document verbal consent on the consent form.  
 
5.3 Consent – Other Considerations  
 
5.3.1 Non -English Speaking Subjects  
Indicate what language(s) other than English are understood by [CONTACT_32825].  
 
If subjects who do not speak English will be enrolled, describe the process to ensure that the 
oral and written information provided to those subjects will be in that language. Indicate the 
language that will be used by [CONTACT_53030].  
 
Indicate whether the consent process will be documented in writing with the long form of the 
consent documentation or with the short form of the consent documentation.  Review the 
“SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” and the “Investigator Manu al (HRP -103)” 
Page 12 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) to ensure that you have provided sufficient information. HRP -091 and HRP -103 can be accessed 
by [CONTACT_109612] ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
Study participants will speak English or Spanish.  The research  evaluators will speak both English 
and Spanish. Study information, consents, and interventional material will be available in both 
English and Spanish. The long form of the consent documentation will be used.  
  
5.3.2 Cognitively Impaired Adults  
Refer to “CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired Adults (HRP -417)” for information about research 
involving cognitively impaired adults as subjects. HRP -417 can be accessed by [CONTACT_503800] ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Capability of Providing Consent  
Describe the process to determine whether an individual is capable of consent.  
 
All potentially eligible patients  and family caregiver s (CGs) , defined as or by [CONTACT_102]/legally 
authorized person (LAR)  as the primary person providing oversight and support on an ongoing 
basis , will be approached to complete the Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC). The Evaluation to 
Sign Consent is a four item measure with an opening question that is not scored. The opening 
question is used to indicate if the individual is alert and able to communic ate. The five items 
reflect the participants’ ability to name [CONTACT_772280] a result of 
participating in the study; name [CONTACT_772281] s that will be expected of him/her related to 
participation; explain what he/she  would do if no longer interested in participating in the study; 
or if distress or discomfort was experienced associated with study participation. Evidence of 
ability to sign consent is based on correct responses to all five items on the ESC.  
 
Both patient and CG (who may or may not be the LAR) consent are required for the study 
process to proceed to screening.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adults Unable To Consent  
Describe whether and how informed consent will be obtained from the legally 
authorized representative.  Describe who will be allowed to provide informed 
consent. Describe the process used to determine these individual’s authority to 
consent to research.  
 
For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized 
Representatives, Children and Guardians (HRP -013)” to be aware of which 
individuals in the state meet the definition of “legally authorized 
representative”. HRP -013 can be accessed by [CONTACT_772243] 
(http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
For research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes 
which individuals are authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a 
prospective subject to their participation in the procedure(s) involved in this 
research.  One m ethod of obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or 
authority review your protocol along with the definition of “children” in “SOP: 
Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP -013).” HRP -
013 can be accessed by [CONTACT_772244] e Library link in CATS IRB ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
If capacity is determined , based upon the ESC,  the patient may provide his or her 
own consent. If decisional capacity is impaired, then assent, either verbal or 
written, will be obtained from the patient and the legally authorized representative 
Page 13 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) will be approached to complete the consent process. Therefore , we are requesting 
that Assent and Consent be either written or verbal. If the patient does not pass 
the Evaluation to Sign Consent and assents to participate the LAR will be 
approached. Many of the LARs live out of town and/or are unable to get to the 
facility to sign a face -to-face consent. We are therefore asking to be able to obtain 
verbal consent via phone communications if needed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assent of Adults Unable to Consent  
Describe the process for assent of the subjects.  Indicate whether assent will be 
required of all, some or none of the subjects.  If some, indicate which subjects will 
be required to assent and which will not.  
 
If assent will not be obtained from some or all subjects, provide an explanation of 
why not.  
 
Describe whether assent of the subjects will be documented and the process to 
document assent.  The IRB allows the person obtaining assent to document assent 
on the consent document and does not routinely require assent documents and 
does not routinely req uire subjects to sign assent documents.  
 
After information is provided, and the patient and CG agree to participate, an 
evaluation of capacity to provide consent will be conducted, using the Evaluation 
to Sign Consent (ESC).131 If capacity is determined the patient may provide his or 
her own consent. If decisional capacity is impaired, and the patient agrees to 
participate  (provides assent ), the legally authorized representative (LAR) will 
complete the consent process.  The LAR will be encouraged to try and determine 
what the patient would do if competent and base his/her decision upon what 
he/she thinks is in the patient’s best interest.  The assent will be documented on 
the consent form by [CONTACT_772245].  
 
5.3.3 Subjects who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Parental Permission  
Describe whether and how parental permission will be obtained. If permission  
will be obtained from individuals other than parents, describe who will be 
allowed to provide permission.  Describe the process used to determine these 
individual’s authority to consent to each child’s general medical care.  
 
For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized 
Representatives, Children and Guardians (HRP -013)” to be aware of which 
individuals in the state meet the definition of “children”. HRP -013 can be 
accessed by [CONTACT_772246] ( http://irb.psu.edu ). 
 
For research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes 
which persons have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or 
procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction 
in which research w ill be conducted.  One method of obtaining this information 
is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along with the 
definition of “children” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, 
and Guardians (HRP -013).” HRP -013 can be  accessed by [CONTACT_503801] ( http://irb.psu.edu ).

   and delirium.  
 
6.2.3 Explanation for why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or 
alteration of authorization  
Provide an explanation for why the research could not practicably be conducted without the 
waiver or alteration of authorization.  
 
We are only seeking HIPAA documents for recruitment purposes. We are trying to avoid 
unnecessary use of patient/caregiver and research staff time and resources.  This, we are asking 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]  (unit secretary or nurse)  to identify potentially eligible patient/caregiver dyads 
who meet inclusion/exclusion  (e.g., age, not admitted from a nursing home, dementia diagnosis 
not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]) criteria.  If necessary we will access the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772174]/exclusion 
criteria and a family caregiver telepho ne number for recruiting purposes . We will not be 
accessing records for protected information such as treatments and medications until after 
consent is  secured.  
 
6.3 Waiver or alteration of authorization statements of agreement  
By [CONTACT_163939] a waiver of authorization, you agree to the following statement 
– DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE unless this section is not applicable because the research does not involve a 
waiver or alteration of authorization. If the section is not applicable, remove the statement and ind icate 
as not applicable.  
 
Protected health information obtained as part of this research will not be reused or disclosed to any 
other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for 
other permitted uses and disclosures according t o federal regulations.  
 
The research team will collect only information essential to the study and in accord with the ‘Minimum 
Necessary’ standard (information reasonably necessary to accomplish the objectives of the research) 
per federal regulations.  
 
Page 16 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) Access to the information will be limited, to the greatest extent possible, within the research team. All 
disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and 
documented.

(time 1, time 2, time 3).   The statistician will assist with randomization .  There will be a  meeting with all three hospi [INVESTIGATOR_772176].  
 
SITE Procedures (These procedures are repeated for Sites 1, 2 and 3. )  
Pre-intervention : Baseline setting (census, ownership, etc.) as well as an environmental and policy information will be 
collected by [CONTACT_772248].  T he units will be randomized into treatment or control 
arm.  Nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (two per the intervention unit) will be recruited and consented.    
 
Month 1 -2 
INTERVENTION UNITS : 1) Component I: Nursing (nurses and nursing assistants) staff education  and 2) Component II : 
environmental and policy assessment  conducted by [CONTACT_54340]  (TBN).  
1) The staff education  will be provided though instructor -led power -point presentations.  Education in webinar 
format and one on one review will be provided for those unable to attend the training.  Staff are requested to 
take a post -test after the training.  The educational material and post -test have been uploaded in the supporting 
document section.  
2) The environmental and policy  assessment  will be conducted by [CONTACT_772249][INVESTIGATOR_5458]. The research nurse and champi[INVESTIGATOR_772177]. Possible  modifications include development of policies for: 1) labeling glasses/hearing aids, and 2) 
uninterrupted quiet times, and access to: 3) bedside white boards to promote family CG/patient communication 
Page 17 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) with the interdisciplinary team; and access to inexpensive hearing amplifiers, activity cart/supplies; mobility 
devices; and noise trackers . The site will be provided with up to $2000 to order supplies/equipment. The 
environmental and policy assessment has been uploaded in the supporting document section.  
CONTROL UNITS : 1) Staff education  (same content as in the intervention) conducted by a nurse member of the research 
team, who is not familiar with other components of the intervention.  
Data Collected:   Time spent in activity, recorded by [CONTACT_772250]. Post -tests (Knowledge of Fam -FFC) 
collected by [CONTACT_772251] -investigator.  
  
Month:  3-14 Twelve months of recruitment/enrollment and intervention (Component III and IV).  
I. Recruitment/enrollment  
The research evaluators will work with unit staff to identify potentially eligible patients/family caregivers.  A list of those 
who meet Information about the study/invitation to participate will be provided to all patients/legally authorized 
representative (LAR) admitted to the study units. The patient and LAR will be approached to visit and discuss the study, 
and if granted, will receive: 1) brief oral information about the study; and 2) a copy of the consent form. The 
requirement to have a family CG (defined as the primary person providing oversight and su pport on an ongoing basis) 
involved and consented is explained to the patient/LAR. The patient and LAR may decide that another person, a CG 
other than the LAR, is the best person to participate in the study. In that case, that CG is provided information an d if 
agreeable, engaged in the consent process. Both patient and CG consent are required. After information is provided, and 
the patient and CG agree to participate, an evaluation of capacity to provide consent will be conducted, using the 
Evaluation to Si gn Consent (ESC).131 If capacity is determined the patient may provide his or her own consent. If 
decisional capacity is impaired, and the patient provides assent, the LAR will complete the consent process. The legally 
authorized representative will be encouraged to try and d etermine what the patient would do if competent and base 
his/her decision upon what he/she thinks is in the patient’s best interest. The CG’s ability to sign consent will also be 
evaluated using the ESC. Only CGs answering all ESC quest ions correctly will be enrolled. Both patient and CG (who may 
or may not be the LAR) consent are required for the study process to proceed to screening.  
 
Upon consent, the research evaluator will check CG eligibility and then screen the patient for dementia using the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 123 and AD8.128 Patients who screen positive for dementia will then be assessed 
for severity of dementia using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). A diagnosis of very mild to moderate stage dementia 
as confirmed by a score of 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sc ale will be required. Functional ability will be 
assessed with the Pfeffer  Functional Acti vities Questionnaire (FAQ) to discriminate MCI from dementia.132                
THE RECRUITMENT/ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES ARE THE SAME ON THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL UNITS. 
 
II. Intervention  
FOR CONSENTED PATIENTS  ON THE INTERVENTION UNITS :   
The research nurse will provide Component III , the FamPath Care Pathway :  1) Information  to the patient and family 
caregiver on the admitting condition, diagnostics, and treatment; 2) Family/patient education : provided in lay terms 
(cueing and motivating techniques, support of physical activity, meals, cognitive stimulation, behavioral support, and 
safety, provided in written and CD format) linked to joint family CG/nurse assessment (baseline cognition, physical 
function and social profile); 3) Jointly  developed  bedside goals and treatment plans (updated daily); discharge checklist;  
and 4) Coaching of  primary nurse  to communicate and provide a copy of the FamPath plan to post -acute providers.  
The FamPath Care Pathway is initiated and continues throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; it will vary based upon 
the patient’s length of stay .  In addition, 5) post-acute follow -up will provide ongoing education and modification 
of the function -focused care plan  (phone contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours of discharge, weekly telephone calls for a total of 7 
additional weeks, then monthly for 4 months), coaching of CGs to communicate FFC goals and expectations to the post -
acute providers  as indicated.   
The research nurse  will also provide Component IV (mentoring  ) Assistance to champi[INVESTIGATOR_772178]: a) complete the Physical Capability Assessments*,118  b) establish and update FFC goals with input 
from CGs/patients (Goal Attainment Scale*)119 and c) develop a care plan with family CG/ patient addressing factors that 
impede FFC (e.g., acute illness, sedation, pain, fear/anxiety, pain, apathy, NPS, depression)  2) Support  to the unit 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_772179] (RN, LPN, nursi ng assistants) by: (a) role modeling; (b) highlighting staff 
role models and positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_46830]; (c) garnering support by [CONTACT_772252] 18 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) administration; (d) maintaining Fam -FFC bulletin board with updates /educational reinforcement; and (e) observing 
nursing staff during care interactions using the Function Focused Care Behavior Checklist*,120 providing feedback to staff 
(See Tools ).  
 
FOR CO NSENTED PATIENTS  ON THE CONTROL UNITS:  The CGs will receive information about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772180] (medications/treatments, medical follow -up). This will be provided by a nurse 
member of the research team who is not familiar with Component II, III, and IV of the intervention.   
 
III. Data Collection  
Patient data  will be collected based on chart review, observations, actigraphy, and staff proxy informant 
interviews. Family CG data  will be collected via electronic surveys on a tablet or by [CONTACT_772253] a participant chooses.  At all 
measurement time points, research evaluators  will end data collection with the patient if he/she observes signs of 
dissent from the patient which includes: verbal refusal to answer a question, closing eyes and refusing to respond, 
asking the evaluator to leave, and moving away from the evalua tor.  The training of evaluators will include interrater 
reliability (minimum of 90%).  Evaluators will not be informed of randomization results or provided with the details of 
the intervention. The research evaluators are fluent in Spanish and will use translat ed consents and study materials, in 
the event that Spanish is the primary language. The RedCap system will be used for screening of participants and data 
collection. The same data is collected on the intervention and control units .  Descriptive (one -time) and outcome 
(multiple time -points) data are collected.  
Upon enrollment, within 48 hours of admission to the unit, patient and family CG descriptive measures  will be 
collected. Patient characteristics will include age, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status, education, medical diagnoses, 
medications, the use of sensory and mobility devices, and disease burden. Comorbid conditions will be classified with 
the Charlson Comorbidity Index .133 Pre-admission function (ADL performance 2 weeks prior to admission) using the  
Barthel Index 134 (also an outcome measure) will be evaluated based on report from the family CG.  Evaluation of hearing 
loss will be assessed  using The Whisper Test.  Pain will be measured using  the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia 
and The Verbal Descriptor Scale.  Upon discharge, length of stay, use of tethers (IV lines, pulse oximetry, urinary 
catheters, etc.), physical restraint use, and discharge disposition will be acquired. Cognitive domains  affecte d by [CONTACT_772254]: executive function, orientation, memory, abstract thinking, and attention, 
evaluated by [CONTACT_772255]. [ADDRESS_1060059] delirium and validate its use. The content includes 2 new 
questions ( Ultra -brief CAM); the other questions are ones that we currently ask in the MoCA and CAM -Severity scale. 
We will test the app upon enrollment and each day until discharge. Thus, we will be extending our data collection time 
to less than one minute.    
Here is the following description of the App: The READI delirium assessment app uses the REDCap application 
programming interface (API) for use on the iPad Air® tablet. The app executes the adaptive testing of the [ADDRESS_1060060] accuracy of patient responses and automatically times each question.   A pause button is 
available for interruptions. On subsequent days, the app re trieves information from the previous day’s assessment to 
automatically assess for acute change. At the end of the assessment, the app reports the presence or absence of 
delirium, and uploads data into RedCAP, a HIPAA -compliant secure research database.    
        Family CG descriptive measures  will include age, race, gender, marital status, education, relation  to patient , 
employment status, other caregiving responsibilities, number of additional caregivers, and health literacy . General 
health and change in health compared to one year ago will be assessed using two widely used items from the SF -36.135  
Health Literacy  (reading) will be measured with the REALM -short form ). The REALM -short form is highly correlated with 
three other tests with a reported test -retest of 0.99.136 Anxiety will be evaluated with the seven -item Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56106] (HADS ) subscale for Anxiety (HADS -A) and depression with the seven -item Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58900] (HADS) subscale for Depression  (HADS -D).138 Suicidal ideation will be assessed using the Ask Suicide -

Nurse Champi[INVESTIGATOR_772184] : For the exploratory aim of assessing the cultural appropriateness of the intervention , 
the six nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (intervention units) will be consented and interviewed, using a semi -structured interview guide, 
after the study ends in his/her particular unit/setting  to provide their perspective. Qualitative content analysis of 
audiotaped, transcribed interviews will be conducted .  The research evaluators will be trained to conduct these 
interviews.  
 
Staff Nurse Interviews : Staff nurses will also be recruited at the end of the intervention at each study site , to participate 
in a focus group to determine their views on the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention. We anticipate 
having 6 -8 nurses per site (representing all three intervention units ). This number is based upon our past experience 
recruiting for focus groups in this type setting, and the expected number to reach data saturation. However, if more 
than nurses volunteer/ want to participate, an d/or the responses indicate the need to elicit more participation, we will 
add focus groups at the site.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a member of the research team will conduct these interviews.  
 
Family CG interviews:  For the exploratory aim of assessing the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, we will 
recruit family CGs  who self -identify as black, Latino, Asian and white, randomly selected from the Fam -FFC

acute health care utilization) and total cost savings for Fam -FFC.  We have developed cost-related data collection 
forms, specifically Activity Diaries, to help facilitate data collection for the champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], research nurse facilitators, and 
staff.   These include staff and research nurse time and hours worked, training time (including replace ment), supplies, 
and incentives.  Post –acute utilization will be evaluated with a cumulative count of emergency room visits, 
number/days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and long -term nursing home admissions six months after discharge, obtained from 
questioning of th e family at each point of data collection.   Health care unit charges and reimbursement rates will be

Page 24 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) 8.1 Number of Subjects  
Indicate the total number of subjects to be accrued.  
 
If applicable, distinguish between the number of subjects who are expected to be enrolled and 
screened, and the number of subjects needed to complete the research procedures (i.e., numbers of 
subjects excluding screen failures.)  
 
We expect to screen 1000 dyads (patients/caregivers) and enroll  458-468.  
We plan to enroll ten nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (2 per intervention unit , a high estimate with a plan for 
replacement if needed ).  
We plan to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_1060084] experience recruiting for focus groups in this type setting , and the expected number to reach 
data saturation. However, if more than nurses volunteer/ want to participate, and/or the responses 
indicate the need to elicit more participation, we will add focus groups at the site.   
 
We will oversample by  20- 30 patients in order to continue promoting diversity.   
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
If applicable, provide a justification of the sample size outlined in section 8.1 – to include reflections on, 
or calculations of, the power of the study.  
 
We target a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1060085] size in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], with 80% statistical power assuming a 
20% attrition rate.   
 
Our last site afforded us the opportunity to increase diversity; we will oversample by 20-30 patients in 
order to continue promoting diversity.   
 
8.3 Statistical methods  
Describe the statistical methods (or non-statistical methods of analysis) that will be employed.  
       Aim 1: Validate the efficacy of Fam -FFC on physical function (ADLs/ performance and physical activity), 
delirium occurrence and severity, behavior, and mood . For each  outcome, an appropriate mixed effects model 
(either a LME or a GLMM) will be identified for model fitting. For delirium occurrence (a binary variable) we will 
use generalized linear mixed models with a logistic link function. The primary independent variables will be 
GROUP (Fam FCC v. control), TIME (day of admission, day of discharge, 2-month  post discharge and 6-month  
post discharge ) and SITE (for the three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] ). The TIME x GROUP interaction will be tested for differential 
rate of change in the out come.  The GROUP x SITE interaction will be tested for heterogeneous center effects. 
Three -level models using an unstructured correlation will be fitted  for the repeated  measures within individuals 
who are nested within the same inpatient unit.181-184 Time will be modeled continuously using day since 
admission so that trajectories can vary across individuals depending on time spent in the inpatient unit. This also 
allows us to examine non -linear time functions (e.g., quadratic) that allow the rate of ch ange  to vary over the 
different intervals. Covariates identified from the baseline analyses will be included in the mixed model to adjust 
for their influences. We will also consider interactive effects among demographic variables of interest (e.g., age, 
gender  of patient and caregiver, ethnicity) and treatment condition to identify moderators of the treatment 
effects. Bootstrap methods will be applied to the mixed effects models in addition to the Wald test and the 
likelihood  ratio test within the mixed effect s models.185-[ADDRESS_1060086] level propensity score matching will be 
applied to improve the statistical power of the planned hypothesis tests.175 To address the multiple endpoints 
issue in this trial,  P<0.[ADDRESS_1060087] p values.188-190  
       Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of Fam -FFC on family CG -centered outcomes  (family CG preparedness for 
caregiving, strain, burden, and desire to institutionalize) . LME similar to Aim 1, will be used.  
Page 25 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6)       Aim 3: Evaluate the relative costs for Fam -FFC v. control condition, and calculate health care and total cost 
savings for Fam -FFC. Standard micro -costing methods will be used to estimate costs . Using the guidelines 
offered by [CONTACT_772265],191 total intervention costs will be based on expenditures/outlays for each of 
the following: (1) intervention; (2) consultant fees; (3) personnel costs, (4) incentives, meals, travel for study 
participants; (5) utilities, maintenance, security and other operating costs; and (6) administrative costs.  We will 
identify all of the “inputs” that go into the implementation and then assign unit costs to these inputs 
(wages/salaries acquired from the unit managers, cost of materials, etc.). Then, we will multiply the units of 
inputs by [CONTACT_772266] s um this across all of inputs to determine the total cost of implementat ion per 
setting. An average across all settings will then be calculated.  To estimate the cost of healthcare for each group , 
we will collect unit costs from existing literature including data published yearly by [CONTACT_75401], the American Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6863], the National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36669], and the American 
Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association .  Similarly, these unit cost estimates for each type of health care 
utilization ( emergency  room, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164155] -term  nursing  home  admissions)  will then be multiplied by [CONTACT_772267].  A variable will be created for total health care cost by 
[CONTACT_772268].  Health care and total 
cost savings  will be calculated for each treatment condition. Mean costs and savings will be computed and 
subsequently tested for statistical significances across conditions using a t -test. In calculating cost we will also 
take into account f ixed versus variable costs adjusting for variation over time in wages, benefits, and supplies 
using a standard micro -costing approach. We will then use multivariable regressions to determine whether Fam -
FCC is significantly related to lower costs of health care and total cost savings controlling for covariates.  
Moreover, we will compare health care costs in terms of changes over time with paired t -test (within group 
differences) and with parametric Analysis of Variance (between group differences).  
 
Assessment of the cultural appropriateness of Fam -FCC for diverse families in our sample : We employ the 
Ecological Model (EM) originally developed by [CONTACT_772269] a framework to assess the cultural 
appropriate ness of the Fam -CC intervention192,193 and to refine Fam -FCC for future studies. See below for 
analysis plan.   
EM Model Component  Sample/Data Source  Analysis  
I. Family -CG experiences of EM model 
constructs (categories 1,3,4,5,6,8)  
 Caregivers who self -identify as black, Latino, Asian and white 
will be randomly selected (Approximately 10% of families 
from each ethnic group; if theoretical saturation is not 
reached, interviews will continue until saturation is reached.)  
A draft s emi-structured interview guide will be refined with 
the input of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772186] /family council.  Qualitative content analysis of audiotaped, 
transcribed interviews conducted at the six -month 
post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772195] . Trustworthiness194 is 
enhanced by [CONTACT_50783]’s methodological expertise, 
random sampling, rigorous analytic approaches, 
member checking, and a detailed audit trail.  
II. Nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772196] (categories 
1,3,4,5,6,8)  The six champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (2 per setting) will be interviewed using a 
semi-structured interview guide.   Qualitative content analysis of audiotaped, 
transcribed interviews at conclusion of intervention at 
each site.  
III. Evaluation of measures for reliability 
and validity for the ethnic groups  
represented in the study (category 7)  1)The internal consistency  of the  caregiver outcome 
measures as well as relationships  with known correlates 
(e.g., educational level) will be evaluated in the first 20 
Spanish -speaking respondents  and 2) Both content and face 
validity of each measure will be discussed in participant 
interviews outlined in Component I above .  Cronbach ’s alphas for caregiver outcomes will be 
assessed.  
The participants will be asked to assess their 
perceptions of measures and identify potential 
cultu ral gaps in measurement content in Component I 
above.  
IV. Assessment of whether ethnic 
concordance  moderates the 
relationship between treatment group 
and patient/ family outcomes (category 
2). The ethnicities of nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772197].  
 Concordance will potentially be used as a covariate 
in analyses for specific aims 1, 2.

admission/discharge dates, etc.), medical record numbers, social secur ity numbers, health plan 
beneficiary numbers, etc.).   
 
If no identifiers will be included or associated with the data in any way, whether directly or 
indirectly, please indicate this instead.   
 
All data will be coded with an arbitrary subject number to allow for linking of data over time. 
The linkage to individual names will be kept in a locked file in the project office.  Additionally , we 
plan to follow up with post -acute visits after discharge. Thus we will collect information on the 
discharge date, discharge location/address, and family caregiver telephone number, and email.  
We will maintain a separate file of this information, which will include names and ID number, 
maintained in a separate file on RedCap  or HIPAA -secure BOX so research evaluators can access ,  
and a separate hard copy file in a locked cabinet in the research office.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Use of Codes, Master List  
If identifiers will be associated with the data and/or specimens (as indicated in 
section 9.1.1 above), describe whether a master record or list containing a code 
(i.e., code number, pseudonyms) will be used to separate the data collected 
from identifiable  information, where that master code list will be stored, who 
will have access to the master code list, and when it will be destroyed.  
 
If identifiers are included or associated with the data as described in section 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1060088] containing a code will be used, it will be 
assumed by [CONTACT_772270].    
 
    Identifying information (name, address, telephone number, email , discharge date )  
   along with the study ID number will be maintained in a separate master file  (on secure   
   server and locked file) , not linked to the data.  Only the project manager and research    
   evaluators will have access to this information.  Master files /codes will be deleted/ destroyed  
   three years after  the conclusion of the study.    
 
9.1.2 Storage of Data and/or Specimens

person’s desire to place limits on whom they interact with or to whom they provide personal information.  
 
Describe what steps you will take to make the subjects feel at ease with the research situation in terms 
of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to physical 
discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subj ect might experience in response to questions, 
examinations, and procedures.  
 
Data will be obtained in a private area within the setting and all data will entered into RedCap data 
collection system. The only way to access the RedCap database is to have permission from Penn State

10.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
This section is required when research involves more than Minimal Risk to subjects.  As defined in “SOP: 
Definitions (HRP -001)”, available in the Library in CATS IRB  (http://irb.psu.edu ), Minimal Risk is defined as the 
probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research that are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or 
psycholo gical examinations or tests.  For research involving prisoners, Minimal Risk is the probability and 
magnitude of physical or psychological harm that is normally encountered in the daily lives, or in the routine 
medical, dental, or psychological examination  of healthy persons. Please complete the sections below  if the 
research involves more than minimal risk to subjects OR indicate as not applicable.    
 
We will have a DSMB and this information is located in the supporting documents.  
 
10.1 Periodic evaluation of data  
Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to 
determine whether subjects remain safe.

11.[ADDRESS_1060091] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the subjects related the 
subjects’ participation in the research.  For each potential risk, describe the probability, magnitude, duration, 
and reversibility. Consider all types of risk including physical, psycholo gical, social, legal, and economic risks. If 
applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to the subjects that are currently unforeseeable. If 
applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to an embryo or fetus should the subject be or becom e 
pregnant. If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects.  
 
Please keep in mind that loss of confidentiality is a potential risk when conducting human subject research and 
should be addressed as such.  
 
Risks associated with survey and observational data collection for patients in this study includes some concerns 
about privacy and embarrassment. The collection of actigraphy data from the MotionWatch may be mildly 
uncomfortable for participants, similar t o the sensation of wearing a watch. Lastly, the patient  may experience 
some stress completing study -related activities while trying to participate optimally in treatments and 
assessments that occur as part of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  Research  evaluators will be mem bers of the research team, 
with health -related and/or research -related experience.  We will train the research evaluators on safety 
precautions, including fall prevention and signs of patient stress . We also will train them on communicating with 
persons with dementia and their family caregivers.  
 
Family CGs  may also experience embarrassment, emotional discomfort, and increased stress. We will train 
research evaluators on observing for signs of distress and preventive strategies (e.g., pacing, active listening, and 
flexibility in scheduling study activity).  The evaluators will be trained for to observe for, detect, and report signs 
of depression and suicidal ideation in both patients and family CGs .   
 
Page 30 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) There is also a potential risk of a loss in confidentiality since patients/family CGs  are sharing personal 
information with the study staff. Several measures will be taken to safeguard personal information: 1) All study 
documents will be coded with a special identifier number ; 2) study data will be stored on a secured electron ic 
system ( RedCap) which can be accessed only by  [CONTACT_941] s tudy team; and  3) study related interviews will take place 
in a private setting, away from others ; and 4 ) information provided by [CONTACT_772273].  
 
During interviews and focus groups, nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_772198], may experience stress, 
embarrassment, or the feeling that they need to offer only positive comments about the intervention. We will 
train evaluators on techniques to support the participants’ comfort and emphasize the need to identify any 
needed  improvements in the intervention. We will schedule interviews and focus groups at a time convenient.  
Releases for using audio recordings will be secured since such recordings cannot be entirely de -identified.  
Participants will be informed that the purpose of the interviews and focus groups  will be to evaluate the 
intervention, not the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655357] , and results will not be shared with the facility. Nurses who participate in 
focus groups and interviews that confidentiality cann ot be assured.  
 
We will protect the rights of the patients, family CGs and champi[INVESTIGATOR_772199], or withdraw 
from, the research without penalty and to have an opportunity to communicate directly with the researchers 
about their participation should they h ave any concerns.  The informed consent preamble will provide 
participants with a way to reach the researchers directly.  Participant data will not be shared with administrators 
except in the aggregate.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1060092] benefit to subjects, indicate as such. Compensation is not considered a benefit. 
Compensation should be addressed in section 14.0.  
 
Potential benefits to patients include improved functional performance, less delirium, less inappropriate 
psychotropic medication use, improved behavioral symptoms, and less hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772200] a nursing home for long -term stay. Family CGs may experience decreased burden/strain 
and improved skills in sharing information, making decisions, advocating, coordinating, and providing 
direct care related to function -promoting care, during and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Nursing staff wi ll learn 
skills in communicating and motivating patients with dementia and gain knowledge around alternatives 
to restrictive interventions when managing fall prevention and behavioral manifestations of distress. 
They will also learn how to promote function  and physical activity and how to support family CG 
effectiveness through sound communication, information -sharing, and partnership, including shared 
decision -making. In addition, the nurses will learn that providing Fam -FFC does not place patients at risk  
for adverse events (e.g., falls) and may save nurses time by [CONTACT_772274]. Our intervention also views the acute illness of 
the person with dementia across settings, offerin g approaches that may have long -term positive effects 
on the person with dementia.  
 
12.2 Potential Benefits to Others  
Include benefits to society or others.  
 
Fam -FFC has the potential to reduce poor health outcomes that are major sources of today’s spi[INVESTIGATOR_772201]. This study will have direct implications for clinical practice and informing policy 
related to effective care delivery for persons with dementia in acute care, a neglected area of research 
and program development. The societal implications of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_772202], adverse events, long -term nursing home admissions, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772203] 31 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) enormous in terms of aging in place, quality of life, cost, and caregiver burden. Further this study will 
provide information about the theoretical utility of using Social Ecological Models, Social Cognitive 
Theory to facilitate behavior change related to optimizing function and physical activity in real world 
clinical settings. These findings will be relevant for other areas of behavior change research in acute 
care.  
 
13.0 Sharing Results with Subjects  
Describe whether results (study results or individual subject results, such as results of investigational diagnostic 
tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings) will be shared with subjects or others (e.g., the subject’s primary care 
physicians) and if so, describe how it will be shared.  
 
Results will not be shared with individuals. We will share full study results with facility leadership and they can 
determine if they would like to disseminate findings to staff.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1060093] Stipend (Compensation) and/or Travel Reimbursements  
Describe the amount and timing of any subject stipend/payment or travel reimbursement here. If there is no 
subject stipend/payment or travel reimbursement, indicate as not applicable.  
 
If course credit or extra credit is offered to subjects, describe the amount of credit and the available alternatives. 
Alternatives should be equal in time and effort to the amount of course or extra credit offered.  
 
If an existing, approved student subject pool will be used to enroll subjects, please indicate as such and indicate 
that course credit will be given and alternatives will be offered as per the approved subject pool procedures.  
 
We will offer a modest honorarium  ($[ADDRESS_1060094])  to family caregivers at  discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  month 2 
and month 6.   
 
15.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
 
15.1 Costs  
Describe any costs that subjects may be responsible for because of participation in the research.  
 
Participants will not incur any additional costs for the intervention above what their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772204].  
15.2 Compensation for research -related injury  
If the research involves more than Minimal Risk to subjects, describe the available compensation in 
the event of research related injury.  
 
If there is no sponsor agreement that addresses compensation for medical care for research subjects 
with a research -related injury, include the following text as written - DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE:  
It is the policy of the institution to provide neither financial compensation nor free medical treatment 
for research -related injury. In the event of injury resulting from this research, medical treatment is 
available but will be provided at the usual char ge. Costs for the treatment of research -related injuries 
will be charged to subjects or their insurance carriers.  
 
For sponsored research studies with a research agreement with the sponsor that addresses 
compensation for medical care for research -related injuries, include the following text as written - DO 
NOT ALTER OR DELETE:  
It is the policy of the institution to provide neither financial compensation nor free medical treatment 
for research -related injury. In the event of injury resulting from this research, medical treatment is 
available but will be provided at the usual char ge. Such charges may be paid by [CONTACT_109632].

Those family caregivers who screen positive for suicide or demonstrate a high level of depression (score 
15–21) on the  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) subscale will be referred to psychiatry 
services at the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . This is in the consent form . 
 
16.[ADDRESS_1060097] to testing of patients in the proposed study, we will use a training manual that details how 
to safely complete each measure with cognitively impaired patients. The evaluators are trained to be particularly 
sensitive to any changes in mood/beha vior, evidence of fatigue, shortness of breath, acute pain or evidence of a 
desire to stop the assessment in which case the evaluators will stop testing. In the event that the research 
evaluator feels a participant has had an acute change in condition or b ehavior, all testing will be stopped and the 
evaluator will inform the patient’s nurse.  
Page 33 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) Training of evaluators for this study will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Boltz and the project manager. Throughout 
the study, [CONTACT_772283] will be available to provide additional support with training and "on call" availability to 
answer questions for evaluators should  they arise. All of the measures utilized have been developed for and/or 
used with cognitively impaired and physically frail older adults and allow for a broad range of function and 
activity. There are response options that include inability to perform an activity or performance of an activity 
with assistance. Thus, patients will not be required to perform an activity beyond his or her capability to safely 
do so. Cardiovascular events associated with performance of activities of daily living and physical ac tivity, 
including moderate intensity physical activity are extremely rare. To prevent and decrease any risk of injury or 
harm during physical activity the Fam -FFC research nurse will work closely with other members of the health 
care team (e. g., physician s, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) and investigative team members (Drs. Boltz and Resnick) to 
assure that patient goals involve only those activities that can be safely performed. [CONTACT_772283] will train the Fam -
FFC research nurse in her ability to continually reinforce  safety measures throughout the study period. We have 
integrated safety materials into Component II (staff training). Additionally, we have incorporated safety training 
into the family CG education, including fall prevention and general safety consideratio ns.

19.0 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
19.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
 
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:  
Adverse event  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related  
Adverse reaction  Any adverse event caused by a drug  
Suspected adverse 
reaction  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.  
• Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reaction  Serious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not r esult in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outco mes listed in this definition.  
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reaction  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected 
suspected adverse 
reaction.   An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical 
protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the 
specificity or  severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.  
 
 
 
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:  
Unanticipated 
adverse device 
effect  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Page 36 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) 19.[ADDRESS_1060102], e.g., 
“Research subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at study visits.”  
 
In the response, incorporate the following as written:  
All adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study 
team believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or 
its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves  or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.  
 
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria 
are met:  
• The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
NOTE:  Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does 
not constitute an adverse event.  
• The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject 
participation in the clinical research study  
• The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Based upon our past pi[INVESTIGATOR_772209] , we don’t expect serious adverse 
events , such as fall -related injury .   
Risks associated with survey and observational data collection for patients in this study includes 
some concerns about privacy and embarrassment. The collection of actigraphy data from the 
MotionWatch may be mildly uncomfortable for participants, similar t o the sensation of wearing a watch. 
Lastly, the patient may experience some stress completing study -related activities while trying to 
participate optimally in treatments and assessments that occur as part of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]. We will train 
evaluators on safe ty precautions, including fall prevention and signs of patient stress.  
Family CGs may also experience embarrassment, emotional discomfort, and increased stress. 
We will train research evaluators on observing for signs of distress and preventive strategies (e.g., 
pacing, active listening, and flexibility in scheduling study activity).  The evaluators will be trained for to 
observe for, detect, and report signs of depression and suicidal ideation in both patients and family CGs .   
During interviews, champi[INVESTIGATOR_772210], embarrassment, or the feeling 
that they need to offer only positive comments about the intervention. We will train evaluators on 
techniques to support the participants’ comfort, and emphasize t he need to identify any needed 
improvements in the intervention. We will schedule interviews a t a time convenient for the participants .  
HIPAA releases for using audio recordings will be secured since such recordings cannot be entirely de -
identified.  Part icipants will be informed that the purpose of the recordings will be to evaluate cultural 
competency and effectiveness of the intervention, not the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655357].  
 
19.3 Causality and Severity Assessments  
By [CONTACT_163948], you agree to the following statement – DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE:  
 
The investigator will promptly review documented adverse events and abnormal test findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the 
adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.  
 
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes .  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
Page 37 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) “unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.  
 
19.4 Reporting of Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the FDA   
 
19.4.1  Written IND /IDE  Safety Reports  
For a drug study under an IND, incorporate the following from 21 CFR 312.32 as written – DO 
NOT ALTER OR DELETE:  
The Sponsor -Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 
3500A) to the responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or volunteered 
adverse event that is determined to be a serious and unexpected, suspec ted adverse reaction.  
Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be 
provided to all participating investigators (if applicable) and sub -investigators.  
 
Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, 
later than 15 calendar days following the Sponsor -Investigator’s receipt of the respective 
adverse event information and determination that it meets the respectiv e criteria for reporting.  
 
For each written IND Safety Report, the Sponsor -Investigator will identify all previously 
submitted IND Safety Reports that addressed a similar suspected adverse reaction experience 
and will provide an analysis of the significance of newly reported, suspec ted adverse reaction in 
light of the previous, similar report(s) or any other relevant information.  
 
Relevant follow -up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable 
review division of the FDA as soon as the information is available and will be identified as such 
(i.e., “Follow -up IND Safety Report”).  
 
If the results of the Sponsor -Investigator’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event 
that was initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the 
requirements for reporting; the Sponsor -Investigator will submi t a written IND Safety Report as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.  
 
For a device study under an IDE, incorporate the following from 21 CFR 812.150 as written – 
DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE:   
The Sponsor -Investigator will submit a completed FDA Form 3500Ato the FDA’s Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health for any observed or volunteered adverse effect that is 
determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect.  A copy of this completed form will be 
provided to all participating sub -investigators.  
 
The completed FDA Form 3500Awill be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no 
event, later than [ADDRESS_1060103].  
 
If the results of the Sponsor -Investigator’s follow -up evaluation show that an adverse effect that 
was initially determined to not constitute an unanticipated adverse device effect does, in fact, 
meet the requirements for reporting; the Sponsor -Investigato r will submit a completed FDA 
Form 3500Aas soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1060104] in light of  the previous, similar 
report(s).  
Page 38 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6)  
Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed FDA Form 3500A, the Sponsor -Investigator 
will submit additional information concerning the reported adverse effect as requested by [CONTACT_1556].

20.1 Study Monitoring Plan    
 
20.1.1  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Include this section if FDA regulations apply to this study (see “WORKSHEET: Drugs (HRP -306)” 
and “WORKSHEET: Devices (HRP -307)”. HRP -306 and HRP -307 can be accessed by [CONTACT_396865] ( http://irb.psu.edu ).  
 
Describe how you will ensure that this study is conducted and that the data are generated, 
documented (recorded) and reported in compliance with this protocol, with institutional and 
IRB policies, with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and any other applic able regulatory 
requirements.  
 
Indicate who is responsible for monitoring the conduct of the study and specify how often the 
study will be monitored.  
 
For single -site studies with low risk, it may be appropriate for the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_396852].  
 
For multi -center studies or single site studies involving significant risk, an independent monitor 
may be required (e.g., monitoring by [CONTACT_772276](s) or 
by a clinical research organization).  
 
We plan the use a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  for this study. Upon review and  
approval by [CONTACT_772277] (PO) , we plan the DSMB to be chaired by a 
researcher who has extensive expertise in data safety and monitoring, clinical trials, and dementia 
caregiving research including bioethical considerations. The additional members of the DMSB will 
include two biostatis ticians who have experience on a DSMB and a nurse with extensive experience in 
behavior change research and care of older adults with dementia. Potential members who fulfill these 
qualifications include a dementia caregiving researcher (Meredeth Rowe, PhD), a statistician ( Shijun Zhu, 
PhD), and a dementia expert clinician and nurse researcher ( Elizabeth Galik, PhD, CRNP).  
The group will meet at least annually via web conferencing. Telephone conferencing and email 
may be used for additional interactions as needed. The first meeting of the DSMB will be prior to 
recruitment of participants and will focus on review of the study  protocol and recruitment plan, 
consideration of participant burden, a review of our plan for participant safety and comfort, and 
approval of monitoring and reporting forms and a plan for PI [INVESTIGATOR_772211].   The subsequent 
meetings will focus on the progress of the study with regard to data quality and timeliness, participant 
consent, accrual and retention of participants, participant risk versus benefit, performance of 
intervention units, and any adverse ev ents that occur during the course of the study to date. One or 
more major adverse events will also trigger a DSMB meeting.  At the end of each meeting the 
committee will make recommendations to NIH, institutional review board(s) and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_772212] e 
team concerning continuation or conclusion of the trial.  
 
20.1.2  Safety Monitoring  
Include this section if FDA regulations apply to this study (see “WORKSHEET: Drugs (HRP -306)” 
and “WORKSHEET: Devices (HRP -307)”. HRP -306 and HRP -307 can be accessed by [CONTACT_396865] ( http://irb.psu.edu ).  
 
Indicate the process for identifying, recording and reporting adverse events.  
 
Page 40 of 48 (V.06/27/201 6) Specify roles for adverse event recording and monitoring. Indicate each staff member’s role in 
the adverse event reporting process. Include the following if applicable:  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_74160] (AE) are correctly entered into the 
AE case report forms by [CONTACT_14676]; be available to answer any questions that the 
coordinators may have concerning AEs; and will notify the IRB, FDA, sponsor and/or DSMB of all 
applicable AEs as appropriate. All assessments of AEs will be made by a licensed medical 
professional who is an investigator on the research.  
 
The Research Coordinator  will complete the appropriate report form and logs; assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_302991], FDA and/or DSMB of all Unanticipated Problems/SAE’s.  
 
The Monitor  will confirm that the AEs are correctly entered into the case report forms. The 
Monitor  will also confirm that the adverse events are consistent with the source documents and 
are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies as required.

Study Design  and 
Description : This is a Phase [ADDRESS_565499] will be provided , requiring Medical Monitor 
approval prior to patient placement within a cohort.   
Following informed consent, patients will complete a Screening Period to 
d
etermine eligibility. After the preliminary screening assessment , patients 
who are otherwise eligible will undergo scheduled self -monitoring of 
blood glucose (SMBG) by [CONTACT_444645] (POC) glucometer as well as 
have a CGM sensor placed for completion of  a 10-day outpatient  CGM 
evaluation , to assess glycemic eligibility and establish a baseline. 
 
 
 
 
 
To 
meet glycemic qualification criteria, patients must have glucose values 
<70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) for ≥4 % of the overall monitored CGM time 
with at least 3 severe hypoglycemia  events  by [CONTACT_444646] <5 0 
mg/dL (2.8  mmol/L)  during the last 7 days of a 10-day CGM evaluation 
period AND  be experiencing ≥ 3 hypoglycemia events (<70 mg/dL) per 
week by [CONTACT_444647]/or according to the Investigator’s evaluation . A 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
During the Screening Period and throughout the study, patients will be 
requested to follow their usual diet (including enteral feeding, as 
applicable)  and activity level,  as evaluated and instructed by [CONTACT_444648]. 
At the conclusion of the CGM and glycemic evaluation, final eligibility 
will be determined, and eligible patients will check in to the inpatient 
facility on Day -1, to begin the Treatment Period. On Day -1 , patients 
will be required to start a 12h baseline fasting challenge evaluation, 
which will conclude prior to Day 1 dosing.  Re-screening may be 
permitted under certain extenuating circumstances (e.g. laboratory outlier 
suggesting result artifact, insufficient duration of CGM collection), only 
with pre -approval by [CONTACT_1034].  
Beginning at Day 1 of the Treatment Period, patients will receive study 
drug via IV infusion every two weeks  over a n 8 week total Treatment 
Period .

Day 1 will mark the beginning of the Treatment Period at Week 1, and 
“Day 1” relative to the nominal dose will also denote the beginning of 
each subsequent dosing week. At subsequent visits during  the Treatment 
Period , patients must check in to the inpatient facility the day prior to 
each dose at each dosing visit (Day - 1). On Day [ADDRESS_565501] for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, FFAs, and ketones (beta -hydroxybutarate), and 
again at [ADDRESS_565502] 48h following dosing on Wee k 1 and for 24h 
following dosing on Weeks 3, 5, and 7 , for completion of PK blood 
sampling and safety assessments.  
Samples for PK are to be taken within 1 hour  before and at 1 hour (±5 
min) after the start of infusion on each dosing day (Day 1), at 24h (±15 
min)  post- dose on inpatient Day 2 of each dosing week  (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 
and 7), at 48h (±30 min)  post- dose on inpatient Day  3 (at Week 1 only), 
and at each outpatient follow- up visit ( see PK Sampling Table ). The PK 
sampling timepoints may be modified as the study progresses, based on 
interim PK analyses. A t the discretion of the Investigator, patients may be 
asked to remain inpatient for  longer  than the specified times, as necessary 
for safety monitoring.  
Throughout the Treatment Period and through po
 st-treatment follow -up 
Day 42 (cumu lative study day 85 ), glucose levels will be assessed and 
recorded by [CONTACT_28047] . 
 
 
Patients will undergo CGM sensor p lacement or replacement at the

serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation;  
• Actual values and changes from baseline, and incidence of clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ), and vital sign assessments;  
• Physical examination findings, including infusion site reactions and tolerability.  
• The occurrence of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) to RZ358.  
Statistical Methods:  General Statistical Considerations:  
The sample size for this study was selected without statistical considerations. It has been determined adequate to meet the study objectives. Patients who withdraw from the study may be replaced on a 
case- by-case basis after discussion and agreement with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor.  
Detailed methodology for analyses and summary of the data will be 
documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) , which will supersede 
the protocol, where applicable  (see Section 7). However, any major 
modification of the outcome measures and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_92835]: mean, standard deviation (SD), number of 
observations, median, minimum, and maximum. The frequency and percent of observed levels will be reported for categorical measur es.  
In general, all data will be listed, sorted by [CONTACT_444653],  
when appropriate, by [CONTACT_444654].  
Analytical Methods:  
The p opulations used for this analysis will be further defined in the 
SAP. 
Safety Analysis:  The interpretation of the safety and tolerability of 
RZ358 will be made based on the assessment of safety parameters evaluated throughout the study, including AEs, vital  signs, ECGs, 
physical examinations results, infusion -site observations,  
 results, and clinical laboratory evaluations including glucose 
values.  The reporting of the safety data is descriptive, and  will include 
all patients who received at least one dose of RZ358.  Individual patient 
listings will be reviewed, and summary results with descriptive statistics will be provided, where appropriate. No statistical testing will be performed on safety data.

 primary PK data are considered to be sufficient and interpretable will 
be included in the PK analys es. Individual  and mean plasma 
concentration data will be plotted over time by [CONTACT_444655] , and 
summarized descriptively at the specified timepoints. Descriptive statistics will be presented for PK parameters, including , but not 
necessarily limited to : C
max, Tmax, t1/2, and AUC. The relationships 
between dose and C max and AUC  will be analyzed  for dose 
proportionality.  The PK results  of this study  may be  combined with 
those of other studies for analysis and modeling (e.g., population PK and PK -PD), and reported  separately.  
Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy:  CGM glucose data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_444625]. Actual data and change from baseline 
will be summarized descriptively for each continuous CGM parameter, as well as for POC glucometer SMBG, fasting glucose , and other 
biomarkers, at the protocol -specified timepoints and pre -specified 
evaluation periods. Incidence rates will be normalized to the daily (CGM) or weekly (SMBG) average. Categorical events will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_211261], as applicable. The requirement for 
rescue and the use of background SOC medication or supplemental 
nutrition will be listed by [CONTACT_111895], where appropriate.  
Statistical comparisons  may be performed as appropriate, and  will be 
described in the SAP and/or clinical study report.

CHI is the most common cause of recurrent hypoglycemia in neonates and infants. 
The i ncidence of CHI is estimated at 1  in 50,000 live births in the general population, 
but in certain populations with substantial consanguinity incidence may be as high as 1 in 2,500 (Arnoux et al., 2011) . Based on information from therapeutic area experts, 
global prevalence has been calculated to be approximately 1.87 in 10,000. There are now 11 identified genet ic loci underlying CHI. A genetic diagnosis is 
possible for up to 55% of patients with CHI (Mohamed et al., 2012) . For the majority 
of these mutations, the entire pancreas is affected, result ing in dysregulated, excess 
secre tion of insulin from beta- cells throughout the pancreas (i.e. diffuse disease). 
However, in the case of paternally inherited mutations of the potassium adenosine triphosphate channel (K
ATP) channel, there may be only a focal region of abnormal 
beta- cells and the remainder of the pancreas is normal (i.e. focal disease).  The 
specific genetic mutation not only affects the pattern and timing of disease expression 
and the clinical severity, but also guides medical and surgical therapy.  
CHI, despi[INVESTIGATOR_444626], can result in serious neurological and developmental complications, 
including persistent feeding problems (Banerjee et al. , 2016) , recurrent seizures, 
learning disabilities, and focal brain lesions (Avatapalle et al., 2013; Bahi -Buisson et 
al., 2008; de las Heras et al., 2 010; Gataullina et al., 2012; Mazor -Aronovitch et al., 
2007) . 
1.[ADDRESS_565520] commonly used long-term medications, diazoxide and octreotide, are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this condition, and often are ineffective or have intolerable side effects.    
Diazoxide is an oral K
ATP channel agonist that maintains the beta- cell K ATP channel in 
the open state. This prevents beta-cell depolarization and thus inhibits insulin 
secretion. Although it is the preferred and most widely used medical treatment for chronic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, the most common form of CHI results from mutations in the K
ATP channel, and so diazoxide is ineffective in this subset of 
patients. Even in individuals where diazoxide is effective, side effects are frequent and include fl uid retention, edema, hypertrichosis, and hirsutism resulting in abnormal 
facial features in children ( Mohamed et al. 2012 ). Less common side effects include 
bone marrow suppression, elevation of uric acid, and importantly, pulmonary hypertension, for which the FDA has issued a black box warning ( FDA, 2015).  
Octreotide or long -acting release (LAR) agents in the same class ( lanreotide) are 
subcutaneous somatostatin analogs, acting to prevent calciu m influx and resultant 
insulin secretion, downstream of the K
ATP channel. While somatostatin analogs have

 therapeutic potential in diazoxide -unresponsive patients ( Buraczewska et al., 2015 ; 
Guemes and Hussain, 2015), this class of medications is only modestly effective in some patients, and can lead to  tachyphylaxis. Due to the mechanism of action, 
somatostatin analogs may suppress other hormones including thyroid stimulating hormone and growth hormone, and have the potential to stunt growth when administered to children over long periods of time. Cholestasis and necrotizing enterocolitis are other less common but serious side effects.  
In cases of CHI that are unresponsive to medical management with diazoxide or somatostatin analogs, surgical removal of a portion or the entire pancreas is required. In those with focal pancreatic disease, surgical removal of the specific affected area often results in a cure. In those with diffuse pancreatic disease, a near -total 
pancreatectomy is undertaken, but residual hypoglycemia requiring adjuvant medical management remains in ~50% of patients ( Lord and De Leon, 2013).   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_444627], persistent hypoglycemia exists and can result in serious neurological and developmental complications, including persistent feeding problems ( Banerjee et al., 
2016), recurrent seizures, learning disabilities, and focal brain lesions ( Avatapalle et 
al., 2013; Gataullina et al., 2013; de las Heras et al., 2010; Bahi -Buisson et al., 2008 ; 
Mazor -Aronovitch et al., 2007).  Current medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444628]/or secretion from the beta -cell, however, they achieve sub- optimal glycemic control 
and/or have undesirable side effects. Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need to develop new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444629].

Current medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444630]/or secretion from the beta -cell. These current 
medications, however, achieve sub-optimal glycemic control and/or have undesira ble 
side effects.     
Diminution of insulin action at target tissues may represent a novel therapeutic 
approach for the treatment of conditions associated with hyperinsulinism. RZ358, previously referred to as XOMA-358 or XMetD, is a fully human immunoglobulin G, subclass 2 (IgG2) mAb that binds with high potency and selectivity to an allosteric site on the insulin receptor (INSR), acting as a negative modulator of insulin action on target cells by [CONTACT_444658] (Corbin et al., 2014; Issafras et al., 2014 ). This unique mechanism of action confers 
properties of reversibility and graded activity which are dependent on the extent of insulin elevation. Therefore, RZ358 is ideally suited as a potential therapy for hyperinsulinism, and it is being developed to trea t the hypoglycemia associated with 
diseases such as CHI.

1.6 Rationale 
There is a significant unmet medical need to develop new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444629]. C urrent medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444631]/or secretion from the beta- cell; these current medications achieve sub -
optimal glycemic control and/or have undesirable side effects ( Banerjee et al., 2016; 
Avatapalle et al., 2013 ; Gataul lina et al., 2013 ; de las Heras et al., 2010 ; Bahi -Buisson 
et al., 2008 ; Mazor -Aronovitch et al., 2007).     
Diminution of insulin action at targ et tissues may represent a novel therapeutic 
approach for the treatment of conditions associated with hyperinsulinism. RZ358, previously referred to as XOMA-358 or XMetD, is a fully human immunoglobulin G, subclass 2 (Ig G2) mAb that binds with high potency and selectivity to an allosteric 
site on the insulin receptor (INSR), acting as a negative modulator of insulin action on target cells by [CONTACT_444658] (Corbin et al., 2014; Issafras et al., 2014 ). This unique mechanism of action confers 
properties of reversibility and graded activity which are dependent on the extent of insulin el evation. Therefore, RZ358 is ideally suited as a potential therapy for 
hyperinsulinism, and it is being developed to treat the hypoglycemia associated with 
diseases such as CHI. The combined non-clinical and clinical programs conducted to 
date support continued clinical development of RZ358 for CHI, and the present study 
represents the progression of the clinical development plan into repeat- dose studies in 
younger patients with CHI, in a cohort-based dose- escalation manner.

Following informed consent, patients will complete a Screening Period to determine 
eligibility. After the preliminary screening assessment, patients who are otherwise eligible will undergo scheduled self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) by [CONTACT_444660] (POC) glucometer as well as have a CGM sensor placed  according to the 
instruction manual, for completion of a 10-day outpatient CGM evaluation to assess glycemic eligibility and establish a baseline.  
patients will use an SMBG for their POC

hroughout the trial.  Patients taking existing and stable doses of SOC medications or 
nutritional supplement ation  for CHI at the time of screening should continue the same 
regimen and doses throughout this period. 
 
o meet glycemic qualification criteria, patients must have 
glucose values <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) for ≥ 4% of the overall monitored CGM time 
with at least 3 severe hypoglycemia events by [CONTACT_444646] <50mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) during the last 7 days of a 10-day CGM evaluation period  AND be

During the Screening Period and throughout the study, patients will be requested to 
follow their usual diet (including enteral feeding, as applicable) and activity level, as evaluated and instructed by [CONTACT_9260]. 
At the conclusion of the CG M and glycemic eligibility evaluation, final eligibility 
will be determined, and fully eligible patients will check in to the inpatient facility on Day -1, to begin the Treatment Period. On Day -1, patients will begin a 12h baseline fasting challenge evalu ation, which will conclude prior to Day 1  dosing. Re-screening 
may be permitted under certain extenuating circumstances (e.g. laboratory outlier suggesting result artifact, insufficient duration of CGM collection), only with pre-approval by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Beginning at Day 1 of the Treatment Period, patients will receive study drug via IV 
infusion every 2 weeks over an 8 week total Treatment Period . Thus, patients who 
complete the entire Treatment Period will receive 4 doses of study drug over a total of 8 wee ks (Figure 1). Patients will remain under inpatient observation for at least 48h 
f
ollowing dosing on Week [ADDRESS_565525]- treatment follow -up Day 42 after the patient’s 
final dose in the study (cumulative study Day 85) , glucose levels will be assessed and 
recorded by [CONTACT_28047].
 
 
patients will continue to use an 
S
MBG as their POC throughout the trial.

 Otherwise, changes in the dose or regimen of background SOC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_444632], except in the event that hypo- or hyperglycemic rescue criteria are met (see 
Section 5.3.1), or changes are deemed medically necessary by [CONTACT_737]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of Week 7 dosing and discharge from the clinic, each patient will 
complete outpatient follow-up visits at Days 14 (EOT) , 28, and 42 ( each ±3 days), 
and a final End of Study (EOS) follow-up visit on Day 105 (±3 days), for purposes of evaluating extended PK and safety over a period of 5 half-lives of the study drug.

patient in the study.  
  
4.5 Patient Withdrawal and Replacement  
4.5.1 Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
An individual patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time,  for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of written informed consent (a patient has the right to withdraw from 
the study at their own request, at any time, without giving a reason [although whenever possible, the reason should be obtained], and without pre judice to their 
continued care ); 
• Required treatment with any concomitant medication known or suspected to interfere with the study drug or study evaluations or be prohibited/contraindicated. However, patients should not be automatically discontinued from the study if this occurs, unless it poses a significant risk to the patient in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]: otherwise, such instances should first be discussed between the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor; 
• Adverse events, where the Investigator or Medical Monitor feels that 
discontinuation from the study is in the best interest of the patient; 
• Patient becomes pregnant or begins breast -feeding ; 
• Lack of compliance with  the study protocol; 
• Lost to follow -up; 
• Study termination by [CONTACT_1034]; 
• Any other condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12182], no 
longer permits safe participation in the study. The investigator can stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if continuation could lead to disadvantages for the patient which cannot be justified by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator ;

4.5.[ADDRESS_565531] be taken if this occurs: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_444662]. 
• The site will counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain w hether or not the patient wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study. 
• If multiple attempts to regain contact [CONTACT_444663] (e.g. 
multiple phone calls at different dates/times, followed -by a certified letter to 
the patient’s last known mailing address), the patient may then be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of discontinuation as ‘Lost to Follow -up’. These contact [CONTACT_11395]’s study file.  
 
4.6 Patient  Randomization and Identification  
This is an open -label study, but the study will utilize a randomization and trial supply 
management (RTSM) application built within the ED C platform to unify 
randomization, trial supply and EDC. Each patient will be provided a unique 6- digit 
patient ID number. The first three digits will represent the site number and the last 
three digits will represent the patient number at the site. The patient ID number will remain the same for both S creening and randomization.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_565532] of the patient to withdraw from the study. Interruption of the study drug does not automatically and/or immediately require discontinuation from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690], until such time that the final disposition is determined. Once it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to resume study drug in a reasonable timeframe (final disposition), then the patient  should be 
withdrawn from the study, and undergo Early Termination (ET) procedures within [ADDRESS_565533] dose received , as outlined in Section 6.1.6 and the Schedule of 
Assessmen ts. After ET,  patients should also complete the Follow -up Period , if 
possible. Pa tients who terminate the study early (at any point during the study) will 
not be considered Study Completers, even if they complete ET procedures and the post- ET Follow -up Period. In the event an enrolled patient is withdrawn from the 
study, the Study Monitor and Sponsor should be informed immediately. Patients should be treated with SOC after ET, as appropriate. In the event of a withdrawal due 
to an AE, the event will be followed until resolution, or until it is deemed stable, in 
the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study 
drug or study procedure is made.

 The Investigator should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal or discontinuation.  Results of any evaluations and observations, together 
with a narrative describing the reason(s) for withdrawal, must be recorded in the source documents.  The eCRF must document the primary reason for withdrawal or discontinuation. 
4.8 Replacement of Patients  
Patients who discontinue the study before the Week 5 treatment and evaluation period 
may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor, if the reason for discontinuation was not a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT ). The allocation of a replacement patient  will be 
managed by [CONTACT_444664].

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation  Procedures  
In addition to ensuring an acceptable safety multiple for the Cohort [ADDRESS_565535] 4 weeks of treatment with 2 bi-weekly doses of study drug 
without safety concerns. A Dose Escalation Review Committee will be established to assess all av ailable and relevan t interim data from each cohort to determine the safety 
and appropriateness of dose escalation to  a new cohort. In the study, dose escalation 
will follow pre -specified criteria. If 2 or more  patients within the same dosing cohort 
experience DLTs, dose escalation to the planned dose will be stopped , or an 
intermediate dose may be tested. If dose escalation is stopped due to DLTs, the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) will be defined by [CONTACT_444665], 
unless an intermediate dose is subsequently tested by [CONTACT_444666]. Toxicity will be evaluated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Dose escalation may also be halted based on a review of drug PK (e.g., if exposures do not increase between successive dose cohorts).  
More conservative dose escalation  or evaluation of intermediate doses are permissible 
following discussions between the Sponsor and Investigator(s) if needed for patient 
safety or for a better understanding of the toxicity, exposure, or other properties of the study drug.   
Patients withdrawn from treatment before completing Week 5  dosing, for reasons 
other than a DLT, may be replaced within the cohort, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cohort Dose Advancement Criteria  
Upon review of pooled cohort data by [CONTACT_444667], dose 
escalation to the next highest cohort may proceed upon review, confirmation, and 
documentation of acceptable interim safety, PK, and pharmacology findings from all available interim data.

6.1 Study  Schedule  
A signed and dated IRB/IEC-approved informed consent must be obtained before any study- specific assessments are performed. Assessments that are part of routine care 
are not considered study- specific and may be used at S creening to determine 
eligibility. All patients will be screened for eligibility before enrollment. Only eligible patients will be enrolled into the study. The schedule of assessments to be performed during the study is provided in Appendix 1.    
6.1.[ADDRESS_565540] be performed within 35 days of Day 1. Study 
procedures to be performed during the S creening Period can be found in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Appendix 1).  Inclusion and exclusion criteria and other study 
assessments required in the screening period , including CGM, SMBG by [CONTACT_444670], and Central laboratory results , will be used to determine eligibility.  An 
RTSM  system will be utilized for this study.  All enrolled patients will be entered in 
the clinical database (EDC).  
6.1.2 8 Week Treatment  
The Treatment Period for this study is 8 weeks. Patients will receive bi-weekly dosing for Weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7. Therefore, patients who complete the study will receive a total of 4 doses of study drug (at the specified dose corresponding to the cohort to which the patient is assigned). Throughout the Treatment Period, safety will be monitored, and blood samples will be collected for the PK of RZ358. CGM, SMBG by [CONTACT_444651], fast ing challenges, and fasting blood samples will be performed 
to assess the  PD and glycemic efficacy of the study drug. Study procedures to be 
performed during the Treatment  Period can be found in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 1 ). 
6.1.3 Follow- up Period  and End of Study

Days 14 (EOT) , 28, 42, and Day 105 (EOS) , all ±3 days. 
During this period, safety will continue to be monitored, and blood samples will 
continue to be collected for the PK of RZ358. In addition to the scheduled follow-up visits, patients may be asked, at the Investigator’s discretion, to undergo additional 
safety procedures, additional PK and PD sample collection, or both. Various PD 
markers, including glucose, ketones (beta- hydroxybutyrate), insulin, glucagon, FFAs, 
and c- peptide, will be assessed.  
Under extenuating circumstances, home-health follow-up visits and/or virtual care  
may be conducted in lieu of on- site follow -up visits. 
A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases 
of the study including the last (EOS) visit and the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Assessments.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last scheduled procedure shown in

 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Efficacy 
Data collected regularly from patient diaries, dietary reviews/counseling, fasting 
glucose blood draws, concomitant medications and other assessments (see Schedule Appendix 1) will be utilized to assess  efficacy outcomes including, but not limited to: 
• IV or enteral nutrition (glucose/dextrose) supplementation;  
• Patient incidence and rate of SOC or rescue medication use for hypoglycemia (dextrose or other);
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_565544] 48 hours after each dose, all samples should be collected from the contralateral arm from infusion. Allowable deviation s from the nominal time 
points are described in the SOAs. In all cases, the actual time of blood collection should be accurately recorded. The Sponsor will supply complete written instructions for collection, handling, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_444636].  
The single and repeat-dose PK of RZ358 will be assessed by [CONTACT_444676], but not limited to: 
• AUC
ss: steady state area under the concentration -time curve  
• Cmaxss: steady state maximum concentration  
• Cavg ss: steady state average concentration  
• t1/2: effective half -life 
• CL: total drug clearance  
• V: volume of distribution of the central compartment 
6.3.3 Assessment of Pharmacodynamics  
Blood samples will be drawn throughout the Treatment and Follow-up Periods of the 
study to evaluate the PD  effects of the study drug, as specified in Appendix 1.  
Samples should be drawn as close to the scheduled time as possible, and in all cases 
the actual time of blood collection should be accurately recorded. The PD of RZ358 
compared to baseline will be assessed by :  
• Average levels of glucose, insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, FFAs, and ketones 
(beta -hydroxybutarate), at each of the specified collection timepoints ; 
• Incidence of fasting blood glucose values >200, >250, and >300 mg/dL 
(>11.1, >13.9, and >16.6 mmol/L, respect ively).  
6.3.4 Assessment of Demographics, Safety, and Other Procedures 
Safety assessments will adhere to all recommendations outlined in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) , GCP and the protection of human safety. The 
interpretation of the safety  and tolerability of RZ358 will be made based on the 
collection and assessment of safety parameters evaluated throughout the study, including vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations results, local (site) and systemic infusion observations, , clinical laboratory evaluations 
including glucose values, and AEs/SAEs.

 6.3.5 Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening and will include full CHI history , 
clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history, reproductive status or cardiovascular events. At the time of each follow -up physical examination, an interval 
medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and allergies should be recorded.  
6.3.6 Vital Signs (Including Height and Weight)  
Vital signs will be measured and recorded at the time points designated on the 
Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1). The following measurements must be performed: systolic/diastolic bloo d pressure, pulse, and or al temperature. Vital signs 
will be measured after the patient has been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_565545] be reported on 
the corresponding eCRF. When vital signs, ECGs, and/or blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before ECGs and/or blood sample collection.  
Vital signs may be measured at unscheduled timepoints, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].  
Body height will be measured in centimeters (cm) and body weight in kilograms (kg).  
6.3.7 Physical Examination 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical examination 
(genitourinary examination not required) and targeted abbreviated physical 
examinations as specified  in the SOA (see Appendix 1). All p re-dose abnormal 
findings will be reported on the medical history eCRF. Any adverse change from the basel ine physical examination will be document ed on the AE e CRF.  
A full physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose and throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal sy stem, neurological condition, blood and lymphatic systems, 
and the musculoskeletal system.  
An abbreviated physical examination is inclusive of neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary assessments.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_565546] include the following measurements: QRS, QT, corrected QT, RR, and PR intervals , as well as an overall interpretation.  
The Principal Investigator (PI) or designated site physician will review and sign all 
ECGs. Results must be summarized in writing and classified as normal; abnormal; 
abnormal, clinically significant; or abnormal, not clinically significant. Once signed, 
the original ECG tracing will be retained with the patient’s source documents. At the 
request of the Sponsor, a copy of the original ECG will be ma de available. 
Unscheduled ECGs may be performed if there is a change from baseline or as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_737].

6.3.11 Infusion Reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Local Infusion Site Reactions  
A local infusion site reaction is any local reaction occurring at the site of injection 
following study drug administration. A local infusion site reaction, including, but not 
limited to, erythema, induration, and pain, should be reported as an AE . If needed, 
local infusion site reactions should be treated, and any treatments should be reported 
on the eCRF and will be monitored closely. Detailed information regarding local 
infusion site reactions that occur during the study will be collected regardless of whether the events are serious or non-serious.

 reaction  and also be trained to accurately and appropriately report these events. I f a 
patient experiences a suspected mild and/or non-serious hypersensitivity reaction, the case should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to continued dosing. Patients who experience a moderate to  severe infusion- related anaphylactic, anaphylactoi d or 
hypersensitivity reaction should have their infusion stopped immediately and should be treated according to the SOC for management for these reactions.  In the case of 
any serious or severe infusion -related reaction, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. In these cases, the actual time and amount of study drug should be noted in the source and eCRF. Detailed information regarding anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or hypersensitivity reactions that occur during the study will be collected, regard less 
of whether the events are serious or non -serious.  
In the event of an infusion- related reaction, unscheduled ADA and PK serum samples 
should be collected at the following three timepoints, in addition to the pre- specified 
collection schedule : as close to investigator- determined onset of the event as feasible, 
at investigator-determined resolution of the event, and 30 days after the resolution of 
the event.  
6.3.12 Meals  
The patient will be requested to follow his/her usual standard diet. At Screening, a 
dietician or other qualified medical professional will discuss with the patient/parent 
the usual diet consumed by [CONTACT_444678], protein, and 
carbohydrate the patient typi[INVESTIGATOR_444637], along with the patient’s usual food choices and frequency and timing of the usual eating pattern.  
During the inpatient portions of the study, meals and snacks will be provided by [CONTACT_444679]’s usual standard diet.  
Meals will be served at the same time of day while patients are in the inpatient 
research facility.  
An afternoon and evening snack will be served. The evening snack must be consumed 
at a time that ensures at least 8 hours of fasting can occur before the following 
morning’s breakfast ( for patients for whom  fasting is feasible). Additional snacks may 
be served, if needed, at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Patients will be asked to try to consume their meal s in their entirety,  as often as 
possible. The date and time, content, and percent of the total not consumed of each 
meal and snack will be recorded.  
For outpatient days, the patient will be requested to follow the patient’s usual standard 
diet.

6.3.14 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_565549] medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign 
[including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a clinical study patient , which is either new in onset or pre-existing but worsened in severity or 
frequenc y, whether or not it has a causal relationship to the study investigational 
(medicinal) products or procedures. This includes events with onset from the time of providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit,  as defined in the protocol. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or 
causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
 
 
 
 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that su
ggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active 
management, (i.e., change of dose, discontinuation of study product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic i nvestigation).
 
 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any clinically significant event that is 
not present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after exposure to study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Adverse Drug Reaction 
AEs judged by [CONTACT_444680] a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the study medication qualify as adverse drug reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_565550] information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unauthorized investigational medicinal product or summary of product characteristics for an aut horized product). 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction

 (Note: The term “life -threatening” refers to an ev ent in which the patient is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event, not an event that might have caused death if it was more severe.)  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(Note: Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the 
event is serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444638], study- related, or social

from baseline, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444639]/SAE, under this criterion.) 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(Note: The term(s) disability/ incapacity means a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions [e.g., following the event or clinical investigation the patient  has significant, persistent or permanent 
change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life]. This definition is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental traum a (e.g. sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption);  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a biologic 
parent exposed to study drug;  
6. Is an important medical event, based on the Investigator’s medical judgement. (Note:  Other events that may not result in death, are not life threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a serious adverse 
reaction , the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or 
Summary of Product Characteristics for an approved product). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Collecting and Recording Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 General  
Collection of all AEs (serious AEs  and non- serious AEs ) will commence from the 
time the patient signs the informed consent to participate in the study, and continue 
through the End-of-Study follow-up visit, as specified in the study Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1). The occurrence of AEs must be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive 
questioning of the patient or the patient’s Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) at each visit during the stud y (e.g., “How are you feeling?”, “How has the patient been 
feeling?”) or may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102] (or LAR) during or 
between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or 
other assessments. All identified  AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed 
relationship to study drug, must be recorded and described in the patient’s source 
records and eCRF Events that occur after the conclusion of the study should also be 
reported and recorded in the source documentation if there is a reasonable likelihood

 [IP_ADDRESS].2 Adverse Event Severity Grading 
The severity of AE  will be assessed by [CONTACT_444681] (CTCAE). Event terms not listed in the NCI -CTCAE will be evaluated using the following grading scale (see Table 6 ).
 
Table 6:  Grading Scale (Terms Not Listed in NCI- CTCAE)  
Term  Definition 
Grade 1, Mild Signs or symptoms easily tolerated and 
generally not causing interference with 
normal activities; of little concern to the 
patient and of little or no clinical 
significance; is not expected to have any 
effect on the patient’s health or well-being; 
may or may not require medical intervention  
Grade 2, Moderate  Causes interference with some usual activities; experience is of some concern to 
the patient’s  health or well -being; may 
require medical intervention 
Grade 3, Severe  Causes interference with most regular activities; experience is of definite concern 
to the patient and/or poses substantial risk to the patient’s  health or well -being; likely to 
require medical intervention 
Grade 4, Life -threatening  The patient  was at immediate risk of death 
from the experience, as it occurred

or by a medically qualified designee, in accordance with the following criteria 
detailed i n Table  7. 
 
Table 7:  Causal Relationship of AE to Study Drug  
Term  Definition 
Related  There is a temporal relationship between administration of the study 
drug and the event, and:  
• The event is known to occur with the study drug or represents a 
known reaction to drugs in the same class, or is predicted by [CONTACT_444682] ;

RZ358- 606-US  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 79 Final v 5.0 (US) 15 March 2021 
 
 
 
 • The event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state or oth er factors (e.g. medical history, concurrent 
medications, or concomitant medications) ; 
• The event resolves with interruption of study drug (de -
challenge) and recurs with resumption of study drug (re -
challenge), as applicable. 
Not Related  There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
drug caused the event, there is no reasonable temporal relationship between the study drug and event onset, and/or the event can be 
explained by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state or other factors, i.e. an  alternate 
etiology has been  established (eg, disease under the study, concurrent 
diseases and concomitant medications) . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a study patient, either 
accidentally or intentionally, that exceeds the highest intended per dose amount or frequency for the assigned cohort, based on the protocol. Investigators should decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor.  Any occurrence of an overdose should be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of becoming aware, regardless of whether the event represents an AE. The event should also be recorded in the patient’s source file and the e CRF. Unless the 
overdose also meets AE definitions, it should not be reported as an AE.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Pregnant patients will not be allowed to participate in this study. If a patient becomes 
pregnant while on study, the patient will be discontinued and will complete end of study procedures for safety. The Sponsor must be notified if any patient becomes pregnant either while receiving study drug or within [ADDRESS_565553] stu dy drug dose. This includes any pregnancies in the partner of a male study 
patient, or if a patient’s sperm is used to impregnate a female during the study. The Investigator must inform the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later than [ADDRESS_565554] information about the pregnancy, delivery, and final outcome, including health of the baby, as required for regulatory reporting purposes. All reporte d pregnancies (even if a patient withdraws 
from the study) must be followed up by [CONTACT_444683], using the pregnancy and pregnancy follow-up forms. Follow-up and outcome, including any premature termination, must be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) in a timely manner. An evaluation after the birth of the child may also be conducted.  Pregnancy itself should not be recorded as an AE, although any complications ensuing from a pregnancy must be recorded as AE(s). If the infant has a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a SAE.

 6.3.15 Procedures fo r Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All new SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, should be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) in writing within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event. A copy of the initial SAE report must be received within 1 business day.  
The SAE report should provide as much of the required information as is available at the time. The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: patient  identification, reporting source, event term and a short description of the 
event, criterion for seriousness, and initial causality assessment. Supplemental information may be transmitted using a follow-up report and should not delay the initial report. The Sponsor (or designee) may contact [CONTACT_115996]-up on the event. The SAE Report Form should be completed by [CONTACT_444684]. If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information will be treat ed as an SAE for the purposes of this protocol. 
All relevant documentation pertaining to the SAE (additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, discharge summaries, post- mortem reports, etc.) will be provided 
by [CONTACT_444685] (or designee) in a timely manner. Investigators must respond to any request for follow-up information (e.g., additional information, outcome, final evaluation, other records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor (or designee) may have on the AE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor’ s initial receipt of the information, and no later 
than 15 da ys for all other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). 
The Sponsor must notify FDA and all participating Investigators in an Investigational New Drug Application safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all S[LOCATION_003]Rs and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, including the FDA, European Medicines Agency (according to Directive 2001/20/EC), and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. Any S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by [CONTACT_444686] (or designee) according to country requirements. Investigators should keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_444640], documentation of IRB/IEC notification, and acknowledgement of receipt in the site’s study file.

 7 STATISTICAL METHODS  
7.1 General Considerations 
This is a Phase 2 Proof of Concept study and is not powered for statistical significance. Detailed methodology for analyses and summary of the data will be documented in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will supersede the protocol, where applicable. However, any major modification of the outcome measures and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_92835]: mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV),  number of observations 
(N), median, minimum, and maximum. The frequency and percent of observed levels will be reported for categorical measures. In general, all data will be listed, sorted by [CONTACT_109796], when appropriate, by [CONTACT_444687]. 
Confidence intervals or p-values, without correction for multiplicity, may be produced 
for hypothesis generating purposes.  
Subgroup analyses may also be performed to further explore the study data. These analyses may include t -tests, Wilcoxon rank- sum tests, and Pearson 
correlation/Spearman correlation for continuous measures; for categorical variables, chi-square and Fis her’s exact tests may also be performed, as appropriate. Populations 
used for sub-analysis will be defined in the SAP. 
7.2 Disposition of Patients  
The disposition of patients will be described with summaries of the number of 
patients treated and discontinued from the study, including the primary reason for premature discontinuation by [CONTACT_9084]. 
7.3 Protocol Deviations 
See Section 9.3.4. 
7.4 Analysis Populations  
For the purposes of this study, the following populations will be identified:  
Safety population: all patients enrolled in the study who receive at least one dose of 
study drug.  
Per Protocol Population : All patients who receive at least 4 weeks of study drug (2 bi-
weekly doses), with no major protocol violations. 
PK population: all patients who receive study drug and have a sufficient number and 
quality (biologically plausible) of results.

 baseline will be summarized descriptively for the primary endpoint and each secondary or exploratory continuous CGM parameter, as well as for SMBG by [CONTACT_444651], fasting glucose, and other PD markers, at the protocol- specified 
timepoints and pre-specified evaluation periods. Corresponding mean (SD) and/or Box-plots will be produced for CGM parameters, to illustrate the descriptive statistics, 
as appropriate. Figures and graphs will be created to display mean and individual PD results, as appropriate. Incidence rates will be normalized to the daily  (CGM) or 
weekly (SMBG)  average. Categorical events will be summarized by [CONTACT_444688], as applicable. The requirement for rescue medications and the use of background SOC medication or supplemental nutrition will be listed by [CONTACT_111895], where appropriate. Statistical comparisons may be performed as appropriate, and will be described in the SAP and/or clinical study report.   
7.8 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will involve an examination of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, physical 
examinations results, infusion-site observations,  and 
clinical laboratory evaluations including glucose values. Individual patient listings will be reviewe d, and summary results with descriptive statistics will be provided, 
where appropriate. No statistical testing will be performed on safety data.  
A by -patient TEAE  data listing, including verbatim term, preferred term and SOC, 
treatment, severity, and relat ionship to cohort, will be provided. 
The number of patients experiencing AEs and number of AEs  will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_415598]. 
Safety data, including laboratory evaluations and vital signs assessments, will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_444689].  
The occurrence of immunogenicity will be assessed and if confirmed, titer values will be reported by [CONTACT_444690]. No formal statistical evaluation will be performed. Any patient in which ADAs are detected will be followed for further assessment.  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], sample size [N], median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_10140].   
A mean change- from -baseline table will be provided for vital signs, ECGs and 
clinical laboratory results, per cohort.  
A shift table describing out-of- normal range shifts will be provided for clinical 
laboratory results, as appropriate.  A normal- abnormal shift table will be presented for ECGs, as appropriate.  
Changes from baseline in physical examinations and  will be 
described in the text of the final report.  
AEs will be coded using the most current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory

reported as the observed concentration at the end of infusion (CEOI). Concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
 The study design and planned PK 
sample collection are not sui table for the calculation of PK parameters by 
[CONTACT_16788]. Specifically, the number of PK samples within dosing intervals is insufficient to support noncompartmental estimation of AUC; and due to the long half -life of RZ358, steady state is not expected to be achieved by [CONTACT_255141] 8- week Treatment Period. Therefore, the observed serum RZ358 concentration-
time data will be used to develop a population PK (popPK) model to describe the PK of RZ358 in patients with CHI. PopPK modeling will als o investigate the effects of 
selected covariates on RZ358 PK such as age, body weight, gender and race, as data permit.   The popPK model will be used to estimate PK parameters for each treatment cohort, 
including but not limited to the following: 
• AUC
ss: steady state area under the concentration -time curve ; 
• Cmax ss: steady state maximum concentration ; 
• Cavg ss: steady state average concentration ;  
• t1/2: effective half -life; 
• CL: total drug clearance ; 
• V: volume of distribution of the central compartment. 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for PK parameters, including but not limited to 
Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, and AUC. The relationships between dose and C max and AUC will be 
analyzed for dose proportionality. The PK results of this study may be combined with 
those of other studies for analysis and modeling (e.g., population PK and PK-PD), and 
reported separately Detailed methods for the PK modeling will be provided in a separate PK modeling analysis plan .   
7.10 Interi m Analyses 
This is an open label study. Safety, PD, and PK data will be examined on an ongoing basis to ensure safety of the study patients.  
7.11 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size chosen for this study was selected without statistical considerations. It has been determined adequate to meet the study objectives. Patients who withdraw from the study may be replaced on a case-by- case basis after discussion and 
agreement  with the M edical  Monitor.

 8 DATA MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Data Collection  
The trained investigator site staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_444692] (e.g., medical records and study -specific data capture 
tools as needed) , and will upload the CGM data into a [ADDRESS_565557] recording of the data in  the eCRF is not allowed for this study 
Responsible Monitor will rev iew eCRFs entered by [CONTACT_131367]. C heck s for data discrepancies in the e CRFs will be 
performed and the resulting queries will be notified to the investigational site. 
Designated investigator site staff are required t o respond to queries and make any 
necessary changes to the data.  
A validated, electronic database will be employed from the EDC system. An audit 
trail of all changes to this database, including the date, reason for the data change and who made the change, will be maintained within the same database. The audit trail 
will be part of the archived data at the end of the study. 
The complete data management process (data capture, data entry, data validation, 
checks on plausibility, query handling, data editing after entry, coding, data base closure, etc.) will be defined in advance within a data handling plan/ data management plan with a description of the personnel responsible for data entry. 
8.2 Data Correction 
Automatic and manual queries will be defined according to the data validation plan. 
These queries will be generated by [CONTACT_444693] (EDC) system for clarification. Corrections will be entered directly into the system. This procedure will be repeat ed until all queries are 
resolved. All query forms will be linked to the e CRF in the EDC system.  
8.3 Data Handling  
The final data will be transferred to the SAS -system for analyses in accordance with 
the SAP. The MedDRA dictionary will be used for coding of AEs and concomitant diseases. Concomitant medication will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary A (natomical) T (herapeutical ) C(hemical) code.  
8.4 Data Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor and/or thei r designee (i.e. Monitor engaged by [CONTACT_444694]) will 
conduct a site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect the site 
facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and the procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. All information recorded on the e CRFs for this st udy must be 
consistent with the patient’s source documentation (i.e. medical records). 
8.5 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
All available efficacy and safety data collected for the study will be included in data 
listings and/or summary tables. The handling of missing data will be described in the study SAP.

duties and functions. Furthermore, the i nvestigator will maintain a list of qualified 
persons to whom the investigator has delegated study- related duties.  
9.[ADDRESS_565559] of Patients (patient identification log)  
The I nvestigator will keep a confidential list of names of all patients participating in 
the study, so that the patients’ records can be identified if necessary.  
In addition, the Investigator will keep a list of all patients screened on a screening log 
to document identification of patients who were consented and entered study 
screening. If someone is not eligible to participate in the study, a reason should be provided. 
9.3.3 Source D ata 
Per ICH, source data are defined as all information in original records and cer tified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_34504], observations, or other activities in a 
clinical study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. Source data are contained in source documents which comprise clinical documentation,  data, 
and records (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patients’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_444642], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical study).

 The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess whether any represent a 
serious breach in G CP guidelines and require reporting to health authorities.  As per 
the Sponsor’s or authorized designee’s standard operating procedures, prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including request to waive protocol eligibility criteria are not allowed.  
Deviations from the protocol will be judged during the study and/or when an 
individual patient’s eCRF is com pleted (monitored) and will be recorded as either 
major or minor.  
Before analyzing the data, a data review meeting (DRM) will take place where 
protocol deviations will be classified (major/minor protocol deviations) for statistical analysis 
9.3.5 Investigator S ite File / Regulatory Binder  
Before site initiation , the CRO will provide an Investigator Site File (ISF) to each site. 
The ISF will include essential documents as defined by [CONTACT_444695]. 
From that point onwards, t he Investigator will be responsible for the update and 
maintenance of the ISF, which will be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_941] M onitor(s). These 
documents will be reviewed during an audit by [CONTACT_444696].  
All study -related documents are to be archived and stored according to the local 
regulatory requirements and agreement with the study Sponsor. 
Details pertaining to the retention and archiving of study documents are found in 
Section  10.4 . 
9.4 Monitoring  
The Monitor is responsible for checking the quality of data and ensuring that the investigative site is adhering to the study protocol. Additionally, the Monitor ensures that the site is following the legal and ethical requirements as stated in local laws and the principles of GCP. 
Following the site prequalification and/or initiation of the study  site, periodic 
monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_444697]. The interval between 
monitoring visits will depend on the recruitment rate and the complexity of the study. Source data verification is an essential part of the monitoring process and the 
investigator must grant direct access to the original patient’s source d ocuments. 
The extent and nature of monitoring will be described in detail in the monitoring plan. 
9.5 Audits  and Inspections  
Audits will be performed according to the corresponding audit program. The 
Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Department or designee may visit the investigative site to audit the performance of the study, as well as all study documents. Audits may also be performed by [CONTACT_384299]. In the event of an audit at the inve stigational site, the M onitor will 
usually accompany the auditor(s).  
Inspections by [CONTACT_139926]/IRBs are possible at 
any time, even after the end of the study. The Investigator is to notify the Sponsor immediately of any such inspection. The Investigator and institution will permit

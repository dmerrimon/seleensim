103 1. BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE:  
104 Insulin  degludec  (IDeg),  an ultra-long-acting  basal  insulin,  is increasingly  used to 
105 treat patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). IDeg has a half -life of 25 hours  and 
106 duration  of action  exceeding  42 hours  in patients  with T1D (1,2)  and as a result  does 
[ADDRESS_434747] a 4 -fold lower within -patient variability in its  pharmacodynamic response  
109 compared   to  insulin   glargine  over  the  24  hour  dose  interval   (3).  The  rate  of 
110 symptomatic  and severe  hypoglycemia  in T1D patients  has also been  shown  to be 
111 lower  with IDeg  than insulin  glargine  (4). A recently  published  systematic  review  
112 and meta -analysis of 15 clinical trials comparing IDeg to insulin  glargine showed  
113 lower  fasting  plasma  glucose  and less nocturnal  hypoglycemia  with IDeg  (5). The 
114 total basal  insulin  dose invariably  decreases  with the transition  to IDeg  (6,7).  The 
[ADDRESS_434748] savings  too (8). Moreover,  patients  have  expressed  more  satisfaction  
117 with their regimen and quality of life with IDeg compared to other agents in  one 
118 study that compared this  objectively using questionnaires, before and after transition  
119 (9). All of these factors give IDeg an advantage over other basal insulins currently  in 
120 the market.  However,  steady  state concentration  of IDeg  is not reached  until 2 to 3 
121 doses  are administered  daily,  and this may result  in greater  glycemic  variability  in 
122 the  24  to  72  hours  following the  initiation  of  therapy with  IDeg  (10).  There   is 
123 currently  no evidence -based  guidance  on how to minimize  glucose  excursions  when  
124 transitioning patients from their existing basal insulin to IDeg. The package insert  for 
125 IDeg  suggests  a 1:[ADDRESS_434749] 50% of their usual dose of insulin glargine  at bedtime  
[ADDRESS_434750] dose of IDeg. This leads to our hypothesis that a bridg ing therapy  
132 involving  the use of a reduced  amount  of patients’  prior  basal  insulin  at the time of 
[ADDRESS_434751] 24-72 hours  on 
134 IDeg,  minimizing  the morbidities  associated  with hyperglycemia  and the need  for 
135 correctional  insulin  and also avoiding  hypoglycemia  resulting  from  over-correction  
136 due to use of additional  rapid -acting  insulin.  Additionally,  we will follow  what  has 
137 been  done  in prior  clinical  trials  of conversion  from  other  basal  insulins  to IDeg  and 
138 hence,  convert  them  from  their insulin  glargine  total daily  dose to 80% of that dose 
139 as IDeg  (4). An improvement  in the safety  and ease of transitioning  from  the more  
[ADDRESS_434752]  conversion.

149 2. ENDPOINTS AND  OBJECTIVES:  
150 Primary  endpoint:  
151 Change  in percent  time spent  in target  glycemic  range  (TIR,  glucose  70-180 mg/dL,  both 
152 values included) in the [ADDRESS_434753] dose of  IDeg  
153 Primary  objective:  
154 To  compare  the  mean  change  in  percent  time  in  range  (as  defined  by  [CONTACT_349757]  
155 endpoint) between patients who transition directly to IDeg to the mean change in  patients  
[ADDRESS_434754] dose of IDeg. 
157 
158 Secondary end  points:  
[ADDRESS_434755] dose of IDeg  as measured  as a difference  compared  to the 48 hours  
161 preceding the  dose:  
162 1. Coefficient of variation of percent -time-in-range for each treatment  within  
163 each group  
164 2. Nocturnal time in range of 70 -180 mg/dL (between mid -night and 0600  hours,  
165 both values  included)  
166 3. Percent time above 180 mg/dL (TAR -1), percent time above 250  mg/dL  
167 (TAR -2) for each treatment within each  group  
168 4. Percent  time below  70 mg/dL  (TBR -1), percent  time below  54 mg/dL  (TBR - 
169 2) for each treatment within each  group  
170 5. Number of correction boluses for each treatment within each  group 
171 
172 Secondary objectives:  
173 To compare each of the secondary endpoints between patients who use a bridging dose to  
174 patients who transition directly to IDeg.  
175  
176 3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS  
 
177 3.1 Study  Hypothesis:  
[ADDRESS_434756]  less 
183 hypoglycemia,  less hyperglycemia  and need  fewer  correction  boluses  than the direc t- 
184 conversion patients during the transition  period.  
 
185 3.2 Study  type:  
186 186 
187 This   will   be   a   double -blind,   randomized,   single -center,   proof -of-concept   study.  
188 Randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_349758] 
189 baseline.  Randomization  will be conducted  using  permuted -block  design  with a block  
190 size of 4, ensuring  equal  numbers  of bridging  and non-bridging  patients  in each of the 2 
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
6 | P a g e   
 191 resultant  strata  after every  4th patient  is randomized  within  a stratum.  The 2 strata  with 
192 blocked randomization within each stratum will result in 4 groups as  follows:  
193 1. Bridging  Groups:  
[ADDRESS_434757] -Conversion  Groups:  
199 i. Patients transitioning from once daily insulin glargine  to once daily  IDeg  
200 without  a bridging dose of insulin glargine (but with a bridging dose  of 
201 placebo solution to preserve  blinding).  
202 ii. Patients transitioning from twice daily insulin glargine  to once daily  IDeg  
203 without  a bridging dose of insulin glargine (but with a bridging dose  of 
204 placebo solution to preserve blinding). 
[ADDRESS_434758]  to transition  to IDeg,  they will start using  
208 study drugs  for their basal  insulin  (see section  3.10.4).  Starting  with the 1st dose of IDeg,  
209 their basal insulin will be from study drug only, till visit #3 (see section 3.10.6), at  which  
[ADDRESS_434759]  dose of IDeg and along with this, they will  take 
213 a second  injection  from  a pre-filled  syringe  of a pre-specified  dose of insulin  glargine  or 
214 matched  placebo  (normal  saline),  that participants  will collect  from  Investigational  Drug  
215 Services  Pharmacy  (IDS)  on the same  day. The dose will be calculated  ahead  of time by 
216 study staff on  visit  2 (see under  section [IP_ADDRESS]). Neither  the patients, nor  the  research  
[ADDRESS_434760]  to  transition  patients  from  other  long -acting  insulins,  such  as 
227 glargine,  to IDeg.  The package  insert  recommends  1:1 dose conversion  from  other  basal  
228 insulins  to IDeg,  but this does not account  for the time taken  by [CONTACT_349759] e steady  
229 state (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 48 -72 hours). There  is no  guidance on  what  to do in  those [ADDRESS_434761] to avoid  or minimize  this and the option  of using  a 
233 small  dose of their original  long-acting  insulin  has anecdotal  evidence  of success  in our 
234 practice.

3.10.1  Screening Visit (Visit  1): 
Participants will be seen at the research wing of the Diabetes Care Center (DCC) at the 
University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Research staff will obtain informed consent after 
explaining study procedures. A detailed diabetes and medical history will be co llected from 
the subjects. Their current medication regimen will be verified from them, particularly the 
actual number of units of the different insulins they are using. Subjects will undergo 
assessment of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, weight, height , BMI) and a focused 
physical exam. If there is no available record of eGFR within the last year and/or 
hemoglobin A1c within the last 90 days, these will be obtained by [CONTACT_349762]. 
2 tubes of blood (1x 3cc lavender and 1x 4 cc lime green) wi ll be drawn and sent off to 
measure hemoglobin A1c (by [CONTACT_349763]) and basic metabolic panel to the UWMC 
clinical laboratory, if required. Subjects will be instructed to not alter their diet, alcohol 
consumption or exercise regimen from the time of study CGM insertion till [ADDRESS_434776] IDS. 
IDS will then randomize the participant to one of the two arms within the two stratified 
groups. (Refer to sections 3.5 and 8.5 for details). Research staff will then contact [CONTACT_349764] 2 for insertion of the study CGM.  
 
Important considerations for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_349745]:  
• We will ensure that all subjects on once daily insulin glargine are taking it at 
bedtime. Subjects who were taking it in the morning only at screening visit, will be 
switched to bedtime dosing at least 7 days prior to study CGM  insertion.  
• We will ensure that subjects on twice daily insulin glargine at screening visit are 
taking their 2nd dose of the day at  bedtime.

409 monitored  blood  glucose  values,  hypoglycemia  symptoms  and intervention  for each day 
410 they are in the study (from CGM insertion to removal) (See Appendix A and B). We  will 
411 inquire  about  any change  to concomitant  medications  and document  insulin  doses  being

415 [IP_ADDRESS] Insulin  Dosing:  
416 At visit 2, subjects will also be given written instructions on how to do the transition  from  
417 insulin glargine to  IDeg. 
418 
419 Calculation of IDeg  dose 
420 The dose of IDeg  that subjects  will be switched  to will equal  80% of the total daily  dose 
421 of insulin  glargine  they reported  using  at visit 1. This reduction  is what  was done  in the 
422 clinical  trials  of  conversion  from  any  basal  insulin  to  IDeg  with  lower  risk  of 
423 hypoglycemia (4). For example, if a subject was on 25 units of glargine at screening  visit,  
424 then they will need to switch to 20 units of IDeg (0.8 X 25 = 20). Number of units will  be 
425 rounded up to the next whole number if decimal points are ≥ 0.5 and rounded down if 
426 <0.5.

441 If randomized to bridging  dose:  
442 For  subjects  on  once -daily glargine,  up  to  day 2  after  study CGM  insertion  they will  
443 administer  their usual  insulin  glargine  dose at bedtime.  On day 3, they will administer  
444 50% of their usual glargine dose (using study drug) at [ADDRESS_434781]  IDeg  dose,  as calculated.  Thereafter,  they will not administer  insulin  glargine  till 
446 after the 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg  are completed. 
447 
448 For  subjects  on  twice -daily  glargine,  on  day  3  after  study  CGM  insertion  they  will 
449 administer  their AM glargine  dose as usual  (i.e. 100%).  On the same  night,  they will 
450 administer 50%  of their bedtime glargine dose  (using s tudy drug) at [ADDRESS_434782]  IDeg  dose  as  calculated  above.  Thereafter,  they  will  not 
452 administer insulin glargine till after the 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg are completed. 
[ADDRESS_434783]  conversion:  
[ADDRESS_434784] dose  of IDeg , as calculated  above,  at 2100  hours  and a placebo  solution  in a dose 
458 equivalent to 50% of their usual glargine dose. They will NOT  administer  any  insulin  
459 glargine from that night till after 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg are completed. 
460 
461 For  subjects  on  twice -daily  glargine,  on  day  3  after  study  CGM  insertion  th ey will 
462 administer  their AM glargine  dose as usual  (i.e. 100%).  On the same  night,  they will 
[ADDRESS_434785] dose  of IDeg , as calculated  above,  at 2100  hours  and a placebo  
464 solution  in a dose equivalent  to 50% of their bedtime  glargine  dose.  They  will NOT  
465 administer  any insulin  glargine  from  that night  till after 5 (±  2) days of IDeg  are 
466 completed. 
467 
468 Use of short -acting  insulin  
469 At the CGM  insertion  visit (visit  2), subjects  will be instructed  to use their prandial  
[ADDRESS_434786] dose 
472 of IDeg, however, all subjects will be instructed not to use any correctional insulin  unless  
473 their blood glucose is >250, both around meals and otherwise. While we understand  that 
474 subjects  might  be reluctant  to allow  their blood  glucose  to run in the 180-250 range  
475 without correction, we feel this is a necessary part of our study protocol. The main  reason  
476 for this is that our primary  study  end point  is time in range  (TIR).  If the change  from  
[ADDRESS_434787]  this aggressively  
479 with the use of correctional  insulin.  This would  dilute  any measurable  differences  in our 
480 primary end point (TIR). It would only potentially show differences in the  secondary end  
481 points of dose and number of correctional insulin  used. However, by [CONTACT_349765]  
482 bolusing till glucose rises above 250,  we  will be  able to discern  any differences in  TIR 
483 that might arise from the change of basal insulin, while at the same time, not being  unsafe  
484 for the patients over a 96 ho ur period of  time.

555 On the screening visit (visit 1), if there is no available record of eGFR within the last  year 
556 and/or  hemoglobin  A1c within  the last 3 months,  these  will be obtained  by [CONTACT_48571]  
557 at this visit.  The research  team  nurse  or physician  will perform  this. 2 tubes  of blood  (1x 
558 3cc lavender  and 1x 4 cc lime green)  will be drawn  and sent off to measure  hemoglobin  
559 A1c (by [CONTACT_349767])  and basic  metabolic  panel  to the UWMC  clinical  laboratory.  No 
560 extra  blood  will be collected  from  the subjects.  There  will be no other  instances  of blood  
561 collection  during  the study.  These  will help ensure  that appropriate  subjects  are enrolled  
562 in the  study.  
563 At the various telephone encounters, study staff will verify that the subjects are  following  
564 study  instructions  correctly.  Specifically,  on Telephone  Encounter  #2, only if adequate  
565 usable  CGM  data is available  on the data uploaded  by [CONTACT_349768]

 571 3.12 Assessments for  Safety  
572 The  primary safety concern  in  this  study is  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia  
573 management  will be revised  at screening  visit to ensure  appropriate  education  and all 
574 medications and supplies needed to manage hypoglycemia will be prescribed at  screening.  
575 Subjects  will be instructed  that if they see BG <70 mg/dL  on their personal  CGM  that 
576 persists  longer   than  15  minutes  or  notice  symptoms  of  hypoglycemia  regardless  of 
577 glucose  reading,  they need  to perform  a capi[INVESTIGATOR_290321]  (CBG)  measurement  to 
578 confirm  if the meter  shows  a reading  <70 mg/dL.  If it does,  they need  to complete  a 
579 hypoglycemia  epi[INVESTIGATOR_349746]  (Appendix  B).  Upon  onset  of  a  hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865],  
[ADDRESS_434804]  is recommended  to check  CBG  every  15 minutes  until the value  is ≥ 70 mg/dL  
581 and/or  symptoms   have   resolved.   Repeated  CBG  measurements   and/or   symptoms,  
582 occurring  within  a period  of 60 minutes  after onset  on a hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865],  will by 
583 default be considered as one hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_41106] a succeeding CBG value is ≥ 70 
584 mg/dL and/or symptoms have been resolved and should be reported as one  hypoglycemic  
585 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  CBG  measurements  <  70  mg/dL  or  hypoglycemic  symptoms  after  the  [ADDRESS_434805]  to fill out a new hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_349747] a succeedi ng measurement  is ≥ 
588 70  mg/dL and/or  symptoms  have  been  resolved.  In  case  of  several  low  CBG  values  
[ADDRESS_434806]  CBG  value  and/or  symptom.  Whenever  a  subject  completes  a 
592 hypoglycemia  epi[INVESTIGATOR_349746],  they should  notify  study  staff within  24 hours.  When  they 
593 notify study staff, details of the events around  the low blood glucose (activity, food  intake,  
594 insulin  administration)  will be collected  from  them  and then recommendations  will be 
595 made, as deemed necessary, by [CONTACT_7536].  
596 Hyperglycemia  is the other  risk of this study.  Subjects  will be instructed  at screening  to 
597 notify  study  staff  within  24  hours  of  a  blood  glucose  >250.  Study  staff  will  try  to 
[ADDRESS_434807]  if  any  investigations  are  needed  and  make  management  
599 recommendations, as deemed necessary, by  [CONTACT_7536].  
600 By [CONTACT_349769] a patient spends above or below range (>180  mg/dL or <70     601  
mg/dL) and assessing the frequency of use of correctional doses of short -acting insulin,   602 we 
are assessing how safe their glycemic managemen t regimen  is.

604 3.13 Patient Compliance  
605 Patient compliance to study procedures will be assessed during the telephone encounters. 606      
Compliance will be defined by [CONTACT_716] (all 3 need to be met to be considered      607 
compliant), assessed during the [ADDRESS_434808] dose of  IDeg:  
 
608 • No missed doses of basal insulin

 613 4. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS:  
614   The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_349748]    615    
BG is “in range” (TIR defined as 70 -180 mg/dL) in the [ADDRESS_434809] dose, and to compare the mean of this change between 617 patients 
who are randomized to receive bridging glargine and those who are randomized  618 to not  receive 
bridging glargine.  Randomization will  be str atified by [CONTACT_349770] (once 619   vs. twice daily). 
For each patient, the TIR  in the [ADDRESS_434810]  IDeg use. The difference of these   621    values will then be 
calculated, and the mean of the differences compared between the    622 randomized arms.  Our  
primary  hypothesis  will  assume  that  the  “bridging  effect”  is 623 similar between patients who 
take glargine once daily and twice daily. However, we plan 624 an exploratory look at this 
assumption as a secondary  objective.  
625 
626 If we assume the true change in TIR (before first  dose of  IDeg minus  after first dose of  627 
IDeg)  to be 0% for the  bridging group and  15%  for the  non -bridging group, and  if  we [ADDRESS_434811] deviation of 15% (meaning the distributions of change in TIR [ADDRESS_434812] -deviation unit), then 20 patients in each group will provide   630 87% 
power to observe a statistically significant (at the two-sided level of .05) difference  631 in mean 
change of  TIR. 
632 
633  As noted above, we’ll assess the magnitude of this difference as a function of once - vs.   634  
twice -daily glargine use.  With only 40 patients,  it’s highly unlikely that  a statisti cally   635    
significant interaction will be observed, but if the directions of the difference in mean    636     
changes  are the same in the once -daily vs. twice -daily groups we shall consider the      637 results 
to be consistent with each  other.  
638 
639 Secondary endpoints to be assessed in a descriptive manner include the following: 
640  1. Coefficient of variation of TIR for each treatment within each  group  
641 2. Nocturnal time in range of 70 -180 mg/dL (nTIR; both values included) (between 
642  mid-night and 0600  hours)  
643 3. Percent time above 180 mg/dL (TAR -1), percent time above 250 mg/dL (TAR -2) 
644  for each treatment within each  group  
645 4. Percent time below 70 mg/dL (TBR -1), percent time below 54 mg/dL (TBR -2)  
[ADDRESS_434813]  KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]:  
656 Study  information  will  be  collected  for  each  participant  by  [CONTACT_349771]  
657 standardized  Case  xReport  Forms  (CRFs).  CRFs  will not report  information  about

and unused products, and these will be documented on the accountability logs and  747 may be 
retained for  reconciliation.  
748 
749 All products will  be  stored  at  the  designated  temperature  (e.g.  refrigerated  or  room 750 
temperature) with temperature monitoring by [CONTACT_349777], TempTrak. This is 751 a 
continuous monitoring system  with  temperature time points  taken  every 15  minutes. 752 
Temperature  graphs  are  accessible  via  a  web -based  system.  TempTrak  sensors  are  753  
calibrated on a yearly basis. A second overlay is the use of Min/Max thermometers with  754  
manual recording of temperature daily on Mon - Fri. All Min/Max thermom eters have a  755 
calibration certificate and are replaced prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_78288].  
756 
757 Destruction of trial products are by [CONTACT_349778] 758 
the University of Washington Medical Center, currently by [CONTACT_349779] 759   
Services.  If  preferred,  trial  products  can  be  shipped  back  to  the   Novo  Nordisk.   760 
Destruction of returns  can be performed  on an on -going basis. At study closure, all trial  761 
products  are  accounted  for an d  any unused  remaining inventory can  be destroyed  or  762 
shipped back to Novo  Nordisk.  
763 
764 At the time of study drug prescription and dispensing, research staff will provide patients 765  
with instructions to store the study drug at room temperature (below 86oF), keepi[INVESTIGATOR_100025]   [ADDRESS_434823] heat and light.  Research staff will verify the conditions for  767  storage 
with patients on day 7±[ADDRESS_434824] the storage temperature of the  769 study drug 
because  of  the  short  duration  of  the  study intervention  period,  making  it 770 extremely 
unlikely for the  study  drug to  be  compromised  as  long as  patients  properly 771    follow the 
storage instructions.   There will be no trial medication(s) dispensed to any    772 person not 
enrolled in the study.  IDS  will store unused study drug separately from used  773   study drugs in 
the refrigerator  at 36°F to 46°F (2°C  to 8°C) until the drug’s  expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  774    date.   Patients 
will be instructed to return used/unused study drug, and  University of    775 Washington’s IDS 
will destroy the returned study drug per its standard protocol outlined  776  above.  
777 
 
778 8.4 Auxiliary Supply  
779  There  is  no additional  item  or equipment  needed other than the ones  listed under the   780  
section of Study medication(s) / devices(s).  Patients may continue to use the following   781 
medications and devices during the study  period:  
782 •  A  rapid -acting  insulin  analogue  that  patients  normally  take  following  the   783
  instructions of their clinicians, administered using either insulin pens or vials and 
784  syringes  
785 • Glucagon emergency kit, inject 1  mg/mL subcutaneously or  intramuscularl y as 786
  needed for treatment of severe  hypoglycemia  
GLIDE Study

 787 • Home glucose  meters  
788 • Home continuous glucose monitors 
789 
 
790 8.5 Randomization and Blinding  
791  We will perform a randomized, placebo -controlled intervention study to  minimi se bias.  792 
Study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms within 2 stratified 793  
groups groups (see Section 3.3).  After a participant has been randomized, a study drug   [ADDRESS_434825] this dose, directly to the research participant on  the day it needs to be  799   administered. 
Participants will then administer the study drug at home acc ording to the   800  instructions  
provided  to  them  by  [CONTACT_349780]/or  research  staff  801  according  to  
their  randomized  assignment  and  the  dosing  described  under  Section  802 [IP_ADDRESS].  
[ADDRESS_434826] the   809 time, date 
and reason, as well as his/her initials in the source documents.  All codes must  810   be kept 
throughout the study period.   Accountability of  all broken or unbroken codes    811 (hard copy 
or electronic) will be performed at or after trial  closure.

815 9.1 Definitions:  
816 Concomitant illness: any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the first visit). 817 
Concomitant medication:  any medication  other   than  the  trial  product(s)  that  is  taken [ADDRESS_434827] be recorded at trial entry (i.e. at  [ADDRESS_434828] visit). Any changes in concomi tant medication must be recorded at each visit. If  [ADDRESS_434829]’s eligibility to continue in the trial, Novo Nordisk must 822 be  
informed.  
823 The information collected for each concomitant medication includes, at a minimum, start  824 
date, stop date or continuing, and  indication.  
825 For  each  concomitant  illness,  date  of  onset,  date  of  resolution  or  continuing,  at  a  826 
minimum, should be  recorded.

872 10.  ADVERSE  EVENTS:  
10.1 Definitions  
The FDA approved version of the Prescribing Information or update thereof will be used  
for assessment of expectedness.  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  (AE):  
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or 
not related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related 
activity aft er the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow -
up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded as AEs, if 
recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  
• Pre-planned proced ure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 
consent  
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening  procedures  
 
Clinical Laboratory Advers e Event:  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically 
significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a 
severity, which requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, disc ontinuation of trial 
product, more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening*  experience  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349750]  
• A persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349751] c onsidered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition  
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_349752]  
*The t erm life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was 
more severe.  
 
Serious Adverse Drug Rea ction (SADR):  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship 
to the trial product is at least possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be 
dismissed. Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event w hich fulfils both the criteria 
for a Serious Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
24 | P a g e   
 873 An SAE which is unexpected and  regarded   as  possibly  or  probably  related  to  the  
874 trial/study product by [CONTACT_11168].  
[ADDRESS_434830]  (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g.  [ADDRESS_434831] ration)  or  (2)  a  suspected   [ADDRESS_434832]  
879 
880 Non-Serious Adverse  Event:  
881 A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 
882 
 
883 10.2 Severity Assessment  Definitions:  
884 • Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily  activities  
885 • Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities 
886 • Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities,  unacceptable  
887 
 
888 10.3 Relationship to study medication Assessment  Definitions:  
889 • Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal  relationship 
890 • Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be  dismissed  
891 • Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial  product 
892 
 
893 10.4 Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
894 • Recovered:  Fully recovered  or  by  [CONTACT_349781] [ADDRESS_434833] signed the 896 
informed  consent  
897 • Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the [ADDRESS_434834] has  completed the  trial 
899  • Recovered with sequelae:  As  a result  of the AE, the subject  suffered persistent  and   900   
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered 901 with 
sequelae should be rated as an  SAE 
902 • Not recovered 
903 • Fatal  
904 • Unknown  
[ADDRESS_434835] has signed the informed consent and until  909 the 
end of the posttreatment follow -up period as stated in the  protocol.  
910 
911 We intend to comply with all local legal, regulatory, and IRB  requirements. 
912 
913 All AEs will be reported on the Adverse Events form that will be completed by [CONTACT_1758] 
914 staff,  who are masked  as to study  treatment  assignment,  at each regular  follow -up visits.  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
25 | P a g e   
 915  This   will  ensure  that  AEs  are  ascertained  in  an  unbiased  manner  using  the  same  916  
standardized  methodology  for  patients  in  both  treatment  arms.  Forms  will  include  917  
standardized questions relating to specific events of import in d iabetic patients on either  918 of 
the  study treatment  arms,  as  well  as  any significantly abnormal  physical  findings  919  
identified on examination and any significantly abnormal laboratory results obtained on  920 the 
patient between visits or at  the time of the visit.  AEs reported or ascertained between 921  clinic 
visits will be captured and  reported  at the  time of the  next scheduled visit.  Pre -  922 existing 
conditions (that  is,  any condition  that  was  known  to  be  present  prior to   the 923  signing of 
informed consent or was identified during the screening procedures) will not   924  be considered 
or recorded as AEs unless the condition worsens in intensity or frequency  925  after the initiation 
of study intervention.  Likewise, c ontinuing AEs will not be reported   926 as AEs at subsequent 
visits unless they increase in severity or frequency between  visits,  927   they result in criteria for 
a SAE, and/or they resolve between visits.   The investigators   928  will report all adv erse events 
including SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs, serious adverse drug reactions   929  (SADRs) to the competent 
authority and independent ethics committee/IRB based upon  930  federal regulations and 
local/IRB policies.  The investigators will also  report all SAEs,   [ADDRESS_434836] the following information at minimum for each of these  
936 events:  
 
937 1. Study name  
938 2. Patient identification (e.g. initials, sex, age)  
939 3. Event (preferably a diagnosis)  
940 4. Drug  
941 5. Reporter identification (e.g. Name, or initials)

[ADDRESS_434837]’s participation in a clinical trial, the investigators and  
[ADDRESS_434838] for any study -related 
947 adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to  the  study. 
948 This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance status.

950 All adverse events classifi ed as serious or severe or possibly/probably related to the trial  [ADDRESS_434839] been      952  
resolved.  For  cases  of  chronic  conditions  follow -up  until  the  outcome  categor y  is  953 
“recovered” is not required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” 954 or 
“not recovered”.

been resolved.  
 
10.7 Pregnancy  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the investigators immediately if they become 
pregnant.  
 
The investigators will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the trial 
period. Reporting of pregnancy by [CONTACT_349782].  
 
Pregnancy complications should be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse 
event.  
 
10.8 Precautions/Over -dosage  
All patients enrolled in the study will have access to and be instructed to wear a CGM from 
day [ADDRESS_434842] of care for their diabetes beyond the study period. Use of a CGM 
has been shown to be effective in preventing hypoglycemia, which is a possible 
complication related to overdose of insulin, as well as morbidities and mortality related to 
hypoglycaemia (11). Clinician investigators and/or research staff will also provide patients 
with instructions on prompt recognition and proper treatment of hypoglycemia and 
prescribe pat ients with glucagon kit to be used for treatment of hypoglycemia as needed. 
Patients will have access to medical providers at the DCC by [CONTACT_14223] e -care 
communication if additional guidance is needed in the event of overdose by [CONTACT_349783]. 
 
 
11.  LIABILITY AND SUBJECT  INSURANCE:  
During and following a subject’s participation in the clinical trial, the investigators and 
their institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study - 
related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the 
study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 
status.  
 
The investigators will be responsible for the conduct of the study and agree to defend, 
indemnify, and hold harmless Novo Nordisk, any of its parent companies, affiliates, or 
subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, 
distributors, salespersons, customers, licensees, and end -users from and against any cla im, 
suit, demand, loss, damage, expense or liability imposed by [CONTACT_349784]: (a) any breach of Novo Nordisk -investigators’ obligations or representations; or 
(b) Novo Nordisk -investigators’ negligent or grossly negligent use or willful misuse of the 
study drug, the results, or services derived  therefrom. This  
GLIDE Study

 [ADDRESS_434843] of competent 
jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter determines that such losses or liability arose as a 
result of Novo Nordisk’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or material breach of 
its responsibilities.  
 
 
12.  EVALUABILITY OF  SUBJECTS:  
For all analyses, patients not meeting the compliance criteria of the study listed under 
Section 3.13 will not be included in the analyses. Clinician investigators will determine 
patients’ compliance with study drug based on patient’s recorded log and patients’ time 
spent wearing CGM after CGM data has been downloaded at the follow -up visit. We will 
includ e data from all randomized participants in our data analysis. The subjects or 
observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion will be documented and 
signed by [CONTACT_349785]. The documentatio n 
will be stored together with the remaining trial documentation.  
 
PK and/or PD Modelling  
PK and PD modelling is not planned for this study.  
 
 
13. PREMATURE TERMINATION OF  STUDY:  
All patients participating in the study will have already been taking insulin gla rgine prior 
to their enrolment in the study. Therefore, we do not anticipate patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_349753]. Similarly, 
we do not anticipate patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_349754] e effect associated with the 
administration of the placebo (normal  saline).  
 
IDeg will be discontinued if a patient:  
• Experiences an SAE related to IDeg (with the exception of hypo - or 
hyperglycemia) or an intolerable AE, such as a persistent allergy or  rash.  
• Becomes pregnant or  breastfeeding  
• Withdraws consent for participation in the  study  
 
Date and reason for drug discontinuation will be recorded on the relevant Case Report 
Form. Refer to Section 3.7 for Withdrawal Criteria.  All study discontinuations decided by 
[CONTACT_349786]’s IRB. Patients 
discontinued from the study will be placed back on their original home insulin regimen and 
asked to follow up with their outpatient endocrinologists within 2-[ADDRESS_434844] to 
follow -up during the course of the  study.  
 
Patients who dis continue study drug or withdraw consent from the study prior to 
completion of data collection will not be replaced.

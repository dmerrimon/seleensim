   Study Design  
This Phase 1/2 parallel -group, randomized, 2 stage observer -blind study is to be conducted in 
3 populations of healthy adults, aged 50 to 59, 60 to 64, and 65 years and older. Subje cts will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either VAX -31 at 1 of 3 dose levels or a single dose of 
PCV20, the active comparator.  
In Stage 1  of the study, 64 subjects (16 for each VAX -31 dose group and 16 for the comparator group) 
[ADDRESS_251757] screening procedures (physical examina tion, vital signs, urine pregnancy 
test for females of childbearing potential), and if eligible, will be enrolled into the study. All subjects 
will have a urine sample collected as well as blood samples drawn for immunogenicity analysis (OPA 
and IgG) and safety laboratory analysis at Day 1 (predose) and Month 1 (30 days after vaccination).  
Subjects will receive VAX -31 or PCV20 on Day 1. Solicited AE will be collected for 7 days after 
vaccina tion and unsolicited safety information for 30  days after  vaccination, with SAE, NOCI, and 
MAAE collected up to 6 months after vaccination.  
A defined safety review of data (solicited and unsolicited AE and SAE) through 7 days after vaccination 
of the 64 su bjects in Stage  1 will be conducted by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC) 
before proceeding with Stage  [ADDRESS_251758] screening 
procedures (physical examination, vital signs, urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing 
potential), and if eligible, will be enrolled into the study. All subjects will have  a urine sample collected 
as well as  blood samples drawn for immunogenicity analysis (OPA and IgG) and safety laboratory

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   2. Introduction  
2.1 Back ground and Rationale  
Streptococcus pneumoniae  (S. pneumoniae ) is the pathogen that causes pneumococcal disease 
(PD), classified as either noninvasive ( pneumonia, acute sinusitis, otitis media, and 
conjunctivitis ) or invasive (meningitis , sepsis, endocardit is, and pericarditis ). A persistent global 
incidence of PD, driven by [CONTACT_210679], has 
resulted in high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pneumococci cause over 50% of all cases of 
bacterial meningitis in  the US ( Gierke, 2021 ). Mortality rates for invasive pneumococcal disease 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US) range from 11% to 30% in adults ( CDC, 2019 ). The overall case -
fatality rate for pneumococcal  bacteremia is approximately 20% overall, increasing to 60% in 
older adults ( CDC, 2022 ). Pneumococcal pneumonia case fatality rates are also quite significant, 
estimated to be 5% to 7% overall with much higher rates also among o lder adults (Gierke, 2021). 
In a prospective population -based cohort study of adult residents in Louisville, Kentucky, from  
1 June 2014 to 31 May 2016, mortality during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210649] 6.5%, 
corresponding to an estimated 102,821 annual d eaths in the US ( Ramirez, 2017 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_210650] 
(PCV) as well as a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), due to the diversity of 
serotypes a nd the phenomenon of serotype replacement, a significant burden of PD remains 
which is currently not covered by [CONTACT_210680]13, 
PCV15, PCV20, and PPV23.  
For example, the invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD) incidence in 2017 in the population aged 
<5 years old was reported to be 1.7  cases per 100,000 due to PCV13 serotypes, while the 
incidence of IPD due to non -PCV13 serotypes was 5.3 cases per 100,000. Similarly, in the 
population aged 65 years and older IP D incidence in 2017 was reported to be 6.8 cases per 
100,000 due to PCV13 serotypes, while the incidence of IPD due to non -PCV13 serotypes was 
19 cases per 100,000 ( Varghese, 2020 ). In all age groups in 2017, approximately 28.3% of IPD 
in the US was due to serotypes in PCV13, 41.3% was due to serotypes in PCV15, 59.5% was due 
to serotypes in PCV20, 69.2% was due to serotypes in VAX -24, and 93.7% was due to serotypes 
in VAX -31 (calculated  from Table 1 in  Varghese, 2020).  
Addi tionally, it is important to note that PCV have been shown to elicit T -cell-dependent 
immune response, resulting in a more robust and longer -lasting immune response in both infants 
and the elderly compared to that elicited by [CONTACT_210681]23 ( Andrews, 2014 ; Matanock, 2019 ; Richter, 
2013 ). Based on this information, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended in October 2021 the use of PCV20 without  a subsequent dose of PPV23 or the use 
of Vaxneuvance™ (PCV15) followed by [CONTACT_210681]23 in adults at increased risk of pneumococcal

   disease, including all adults ≥[ADDRESS_251763] never received 
any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown  
(CDC,  2023 ). 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_210651] [ADDRESS_251764], data show that as more carrier protein/polysaccharide (PS) 
conjugates are added to existing PCV, immune responses to the PS often decrease due to the 
cumulative amount of car rier protein, which immunologically competes with the PS antigens 
(Dagan, 2010 ), as most recently seen with PCV20 ( [COMPANY_007], 2023 ). Second, conjugating additional 
PS to a carrier protein molecule may mask existing T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_210652]. In the PCV13 carrier protein CRM 197, approximately 20% of the 
39 lysine residues border relevant T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] ( Choe , 1992 ; Diethelm -Okita, 2000 ; 
Raju,  1995 ). Since conventional conjugation chemistry heterogeneously conjugates PS to lysine 
residues independent of their proximity to T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], a bo und PS may block the 
presentation of a T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_210653], thus preventing the induction of a T -cell 
response. Meanwhile, the B -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_210654], increasing B -cell competition for any available T -cell help. The masking 
of these critical epi[INVESTIGATOR_210655] a T -cell dependent immune response and 
negates the benefit of the carrier protein. This competition for T -cell help diminishes the immune 
response  to the PS antigen and is believed to result in the phenomenon known as carrier 
suppression (Dagan, 2010). To address this issue, Vaxcyte is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 24-valent  PCV 
(VAX -24), and a 31-valent PCV ( VAX -31) using a novel process that combines site -specific  
conjugation to the carrier protein and a highly efficient conjugation chemistry. Vaxcyte employs 
a cell -free protein synthesis platform to insert the non -native amino acid para -azidomethyl -L-
phenylalanine (pAMF) into eCRM, a recombinant version of CRM 197. These pAMF residues 
serve as PS conjugation sites and are inserted in place of purposefully selected lysines, such that 
critical T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_210656] T -cell 
dependent immune response.  
Vaxcyte’s PCV c linical development program comprises [ADDRESS_251765] S. pneumoniae : VAX -24 and VAX -31. VAX -24 has been administered as a single dose 
to adults in 2 completed Phase 1/[ADDRESS_251766] noninferiority criteria for all 20 serotypes shared with PCV20 and superiority 
criteria for the 4 serotypes not in PCV20. Additionally, VAX-24 reverses the historical trend of 
lower immune response with broader serotype coverage and elicits ~20% higher immune 
response across shared serotypes when compared with PCV20.  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251767] been 
completed: VAX24 -101, a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_251768] commonly reported solicited adverse event ( AE) 
in >10% of PCV20  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_210657] ( ~70%), muscle pain (~50%), fatigue 
(~40%), headache (~30%), and arthralgia (~20%). All solicited AE were similarly distributed 
among the study groups . These events were  typi[INVESTIGATOR_210658]-limiting.  
The safety profile of VAX -24 was consistent across study groups with no apparent dose 
dependence, and the incidence of events was similar to that for the PCV20 control. In the 
VAX -24 groups, 12 .3% of subjects experienced a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE ) 
within [ADDRESS_251769] -vaccination, 11 .3% experienced a MAAE, 1.9% experienced NOCI, and 
1.2% experienced SAE through [ADDRESS_251770] additional  serotypes not represented in currently approved PCV  or VAX -24, Vaxcyte has 
initiated development of VAX -31. 
VAX -31 vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension of capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens 
of S. pneumoniae  serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7C, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15A, 
15B, 16F, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20B, 22F, 23A, 23B, 23F, 31, 33F and 35B, each individually 
conjugated in a site -specific manner to a carrier protein referred to as eCRM, which is a n amino 
acid variant of the detoxified version of the diphtheria toxin known as CRM 197. 
VAX -31 contains the same 24 conjugated polysaccharides  as VAX  24, plus 7 additional 
serotypes . The same manufacturing processes are used for VAX -31 and VAX -24, and they  are 
supplied in the same formulation ( 295 mcg succinate, 4385 mcg sodium chloride, 1175 mcg 
sodium phosphate, 500 mcg  polysorbate 80 at pH 5.8, with 0.125  mg of aluminum phosphate 
added per 0.5 mL dose).  Each vial is filled to deliver a single 0.5  mL dose  of vaccine for IM 
administration, with no preservative.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   2.1.2 Rationale for Dosage and Route of Administration  
VAX -31 will be administered at 1 of 3 dose levels based on the amount of polysaccharide 
present: 1.1  mcg (Low), 2.2 mcg (M id), and 3.3 mcg (High) for all serotypes with the exception 
of serotypes 1, 5, and 22F , which will be 1.[ADDRESS_251771] 
immune responses in VAX24 -101. Site-specific conjugation to the eCRM protein carrier 
increases the PS -to-eCRM ratio, enhancing overall T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_210659]. Consequently, 
VAX -31 M id dose is consistent with current dosing of licensed PCV, such as PCV15 and 
PCV20. Vaxcyte implemented a Low dose and a High dose to characterize the dose res ponse to 
VAX -31. Safety data from  VAX -24 clinical studies  support  including the High  dose in the initial 
dose-finding study  for VAX -31.

6.6.2 Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Biological samples will be collected for the following clinical laboratory tests and shipped to the 
central laboratory for a nalysis:  
• Hematology:  Hemoglobin, White blood cell count (absolute), Neutrophils (absolute), 
Eosinophils (absolute), Platelet count , Blood Film Review, Manual Differential (Panel)  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   • Clinical Chemistry:  Albumin, Alkaline phosphatase, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase  (AST), Bilirubin (total and direct) , Blood urea nitrogen , 
Calcium, Carbon dioxide, Chloride, Cholesterol and triglycerides, Creatinine, Glucose 
(random), Gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) , Lactate dehydrogenase , Phosphate, 
Potassium, Sodium, Total serum protein, Uric acid  
• Urinalysis:  Specific gravity, pH, Glucose, Protein (Total), Ketones, Bilirubin, 
Urobilinogen, Hemoglobin, Leucocyte esterase, Nitrite  
Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted at the site using a dipstick  before vacc ination.  
Unscheduled laboratory tests will be performed if indicated by a change in medical condition 
(including clinically significant abnormal values). The volume to be collected will be appropriate 
to the tests performed. The toxicity grading sca les for clin ical laboratory values ( FDA , 2007 ) 
must be used when assigning severity to an out -of-range laboratory value ; however, not all out of 
range laboratory values are considered AE and need to be evaluated according to Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_251786] assays, OPA and multiplexed Meso Scale Discovery (MSD).  
The OPA assay has been developed and qual ified by [CONTACT_210692], a GCP -compliant central 
laboratory, to analyze the functional responses to [ADDRESS_251787] by 
[CONTACT_210693] (marking pneumococci for destruction) for phagocytosis 
(Burton,  2012 ). 
The MSD assay has been developed and qualified by [CONTACT_210694] [ADDRESS_251788] multiple antigens and has been used to evaluate responses to various PCV 
(Feyssaguet, 2019 ; Goldblatt, 2011 ; Marchese, 2009 ; Nolan, 2020 ). 
The immune  responses (as assessed by [CONTACT_210695]) against the 20 polysaccharide 
antigens common to PCV20 and VAX -31 (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F) will be compared in the various treatment groups (VAX -31 at 
3 different dose levels, and the comparator vaccine), and the 11 additional  polysaccharide 
antigens contained in VAX -31 (2, 7C, 9N, 15A, 16F,17F, 20B, 23A, 23B, 31 and 35B) will be 
evaluated separately.  
6.[ADDRESS_251789] also use an acceptable method of contraception 
from prior to Day 1 through Month 6 (throughout the study). The Investigator must confirm that 
contraception methods were initiated prior to Day 1 (e.g., hormonal contraception) to be 
considered fully effective.  
For reporting a pregnancy, refer to Section 8.7.[ADDRESS_251790].  
Blinded study staff will indicate on a Randomization electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) within 
the EDC system that they want to generate a randomiza tion number for the subject. When they 
indicate yes, a randomization number will be generated from EDC. The randomization number is 
separate from, and does not replace, the subject identification number which is assigned at 
Screening. The unblinded designe e will  receive information from the Zelta EDC  with treatment 
assigned for VAX -31 (1.1/1.65  mcg, 2.2/3.3  mcg, or 3.3/4.4  mcg dose ) or treatment assigned 
PCV2 0 PFS.  The unblinded designee may then prepare the treatment assigned for administration.  
Randomization will be 1:1:1:1 for the 4 treatment groups across the sample size (1000 subjects) . 
For Stage 1, there were  no stratification  factors . For Stage 2, randomizati on will be  stratified by 
[CONTACT_210696] [ADDRESS_251791] wil l be considered enrolled once a randomization number has been assigned within the 
EDC system. The study will be conducted as an observer -blind study. No one except specific 
predesignated unblinded staff (at sites and CRO) will know subjects ’ individual tre atment 
assignments until all subjects have completed their participation in the study and the database has 
been cleaned and locked.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   The following safeguards will be employed to reduce the risk of inadvertent unblinding:  
• Each clinical site is required to ha ve a blinding plan that outlines its process on blinding the 
subject in situations such as administration of IM injection with different syringe types, 
transport of study vaccine to the clinic room for administration, providing initial training 
and reminde rs to the subjects on how to maintain the study blind.  
• No Sponsor personnel other than the designated unblinded monitor(s), Sponsor unblinded 
Oversight Representative, third -party unblinded biostatistics and programming staff, and 
the Sponsor Medical Direc tor, if necessary, will have access to the randomization treatment 
assignments. If Sponsor personnel are unblinded, they will not provide input on data for the 
specific subject they were unblinded to.  
• Should any subject or blinded staff member become inadv ertently unblinded, the 
Investigator will promptly (within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the error) 
disclose the event to the Sponsor clinical study manager and medical monitor in a blinded 
fashion (disclosing only subject number, not treatme nt) so that corrective action can be 
initiated. The unblinding sequence of events will be documented as a protocol deviation and 
retained as source documents. See Section 6.15 for details on Emergency Unblinding.  
6.9 Study Vaccine Administration  
On Day 1 before randomization, the medical history, including physical exam (if indicated by 
[CONTACT_210697]) and vital signs, and concomitant medications will be collected, females 
of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy tes t, and information updated in 
the subject file to recheck subject eligibility. Immediately prior to study vaccine administration, 
the following biological samples will be collected: blood for hematology and chemistry, urine for 
urinalysis (and if applicabl e, pregnancy test) , and s erum  for immunogenicity. Once these 
procedures are performed, study vaccine will be administered. All doses of study vaccine are 
0.[ADDRESS_251792] 30 minutes after the injection.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   Allergic reactions to the study vaccine are possible; therefore, appropriate drugs and medical 
equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available and a medically 
qualified study tea m member trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis must be present in the 
clinic during the entire post -dosing monitoring period.  
6.11 Solicited Adverse Events  
Solicited AE will be collected for 7 days after vaccine administration, starting on Day 1. 
Solicited  AE for this study are local events of pain, erythema (redness) and edema (swelling) at 
the injection site, and systemic events of oral temperature ≥100.4ºF, fatigue, headache, muscle 
pain, and joint pain.  
Subjects will be trained to complete a n electronic  diary (eDiary)  via Zelta’s electronic Patient 
Reported Outcomes ( ePRO ) system. The eDiary collects the primary safety endpoint data.  This 
system is accessed via a secure URL and will be used to observe, measure, and record these 
solicited AE. A digital th ermometer will be provided to the subject to measure oral temperature 
each day, and it is to be recorded daily in the diary. To record injection site local reaction, a ruler 
will be provided to the subject to measure the diameter of redness and swelling at  the largest 
point of the reaction each day; it is to be recorded daily in the diary. Study staff will be provided 
with a Reference Guide for instructing subjects on accessing the Zelta ePRO system. Each user 
will be provided with login credentials and a t emporary password. The  Zelta ePRO system is 
web-based and accessed via a secure URL.  
Study staff will review the signs and symptoms recorded in the diary and the action taken for the 
event during the subject’s clinic visit. The electronic diary will serve as the primary source 
document and data will be automatically integrated into the subject visit Solicited AE form in the 
EDC platform for site staff view -only access. The Investigator will then assess all recorded 
solicited events for severity and relatedn ess. Severity will be graded according to the FDA 
Toxicity Grading Scale ( FDA, 2007 ). The results of the Investigator’s assessment, if different 
from the subject’s entry, will be recorded in a separate eCRF  specified for Investigators. For 
solicited injection site reactions, the relationship to study vaccine will be automatically recorde d 
to be probably related, however, the Investigator will determine the relationship for each 
systemic solicited reaction.  
Symptoms continuing beyond the solicited AE collection period (7 days following injection) will 
be collected and recorded as unsolicit ed AE in the source document.  The start date of unsolicited 
AE w ill be equal to the date  of onset  of the solicited AE.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   6.12 Unsolicited Adverse Events  
Unsolicited AE (any AE not listed in the diary) will be collected for this study. Details regarding 
definitions, evaluation, reporting periods, and documentation are outlined in Section 8.

categorizing protocol deviations.  
6.[ADDRESS_251796] report any error in the dosing of study vaccine to the 
site-assigned unblinded CRA and Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness of the error. Additional information regarding the dosing error may be 
provided as  a follow -up report. A dosing error without signs or symptoms is not considered an 
AE but may be determined to be an important protocol deviation and investigated further.  
6.[ADDRESS_251797] is considered to comp lete study participation after completion of the 
Month 6 visit (180 days after study vaccine administration) and completion of any required 
safety follow -up. 
6.[ADDRESS_251798] (but cannot require) such subjects to provide the  
reason(s) for withdrawal of consent and to undergo an Early Termination visit.  
In addition, the Investigator, at his or her discretion, may withdraw a subject from further 
participation in the study. Criteria for withdrawal by [CONTACT_11584]:

7.[ADDRESS_251802], regardless of the suspected causal 
relationship with study vaccine. The definition of an AE includes:  
• A new -onset symptom or disease  
• An exacerbation of a pre -existing symptom or disease  
• A new -onset clinical lab oratory abnormality considered by [CONTACT_210699]  
• A new -onset symptom or disease that occurs as a result of a protocol -specified procedure  
The definition of an AE does not include:  
• A pre -existing symptom or disease that does n ot worsen during the study (even if first 
disclosed by [CONTACT_210700])  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   • A medical or surgical intervention such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion (although the condition leading to the procedure or a complicat ion from the 
procedure may be an AE)  
• An uncomplicated pregnancy  
• A dosing error without any resulting signs or symptoms  
• Any other situation where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210662])  
The definition of a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an event that occurs after 
vaccination and within 30 days after vaccination (i.e., excluding those after a subject has given 
informed consent, but before vaccination).  
The definitio n of a medically attended adverse event (MAAE) includes:  
• A new onset or worsening of a condition that prompts the subject to seek unplanned 
medical advice at a physician’s office, urgent care center,  or Emergency Department  
The definition of a new onset of chronic illness (NOCI) includes:  
• A new onset of a disease or condition that requires ongoing medical attention and/or limits 
activity of daily living, e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes  
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis bas ed on signs, symptoms, and other 
clinical information. Whenever possible, the Investigator will report an AE as a diagnosis rather 
than [ADDRESS_251803] during a protocol -specified time period. Solicited AE for this study are local 
events of pain, erythema (redness), and edema (swelling) at the injection site, and systemic 
events of fever (oral temperature ≥100.4ºF), fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain.  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251804] or discovered by [CONTACT_3786]. New onset of chronic illness(es) would be recorded as part of the collection of 
unsolicited AE as specified in the visit procedures. Unsolicited AE will be collected separately 
from soli cited AE. Solicited AE occurring or persisting beyond the solicitation period  or which 
meet SAE/NOCI/MAAE criteria are also recorded as unsolicited AE.  
8.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE (either solicited or unsolicited) which meets any of the following  criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital ano maly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes  
The Investigator will evaluate all AE for seriousness using the above criteria.  
“Life -threatening” means that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_210663]. It does not mean that the event might have caused death 
had it occurred in a more severe form.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] o bservation or for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen during the study is not considered an SAE.  
Important medical events may be considered serious at the discretion of the Investigator.  
These seriousness criteria also apply to the Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_210664] 8.10. 
8.2 Severity Grading  
The Investigator will grade all AE for severity. AE listed in the Guidance for Industry,  Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine 
Clinical Trials ( FDA,  2007 ) will be graded according to the criteria in the table . AE not listed in 
the Toxicity Grading Scale will be graded as follows:  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   • Mild  (Grade 1):  No interference with activity  
• Moderate  (Grade 2):  Some interference with activity  
• Severe  (Grade 3):  Significant; prevents daily activity  
• Potentially Life -Threatening  (Grade 4):  ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
8.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator will assess all AE, including solicited AE, for causality (relationship to study 
vaccine), assigning 1 of these 3 categories: Not Related, Possibly Related, or Probably Related.  
An AE will be considered “Not Related” to study vaccine if any of the following conditions are 
met: 
• An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the study vaccine and the 
onset of the AE (e.g., the event occurred either before o r too long after administration of the 
study vaccine for it to be considered related) . 
• A causal relationship between the study vaccine and the AE is biologically implausible 
(e.g., injury as a passenger in an automobile accident).  
• A clear alternative causa lity for the AE is present (e.g., typi[INVESTIGATOR_56664] a 
concomitant medication).  
An AE will be considered “Possibly Related” if there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_106365].  
• A single occurrence of an event  that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with vaccine exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome).  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with vaccine 
exposure but is otherwise uncommon in  the population exposed to the vaccine (e.g., tendon 
rupture).  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of vaccine administration) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the vaccine treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group.  
An AE will be considered “Probably Related” if there is eviden ce that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_106957].  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251805] the Investigator (or 
designee) immediately. All subjects experiencing an SAE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_210701]. In the event of a 
fatal SAE, the Investigator must provide the Sponsor with any available post -mortem findings, 
including histopathology.  
Additionally, the Sponsor may request that the Investigator per form or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental investigations for 1 or more AE.  
8.5 Reporting of Adverse Events  
8.5.1 Reporting Periods  
The reporting period for solicited AE begin s immediately after study vaccine administration and 
continue s for 7 days after the in jection. The reporting period for unsolicited AE is immediately 
after study vaccine administration on Day 1, continuing through Month 1. AE that correspond to 
solicited AE terms but occur outside of (or continue past) the solicited AE collection periods ar e 
also collected through the unsolicited AE reporting periods. The reporting period for SAE begins 
at the time of informed consent and continues for the duration of study participation. A summary 
of the reporting periods is presented in Figure 3.

9. Data Handling  
9.1 Source Documentation  
Source documents and source data will meet elements of data quality and integrity (ALCOA -C: 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete).  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251815] identity information will be maintained for 15 years 
unless a longer period is required by [CONTACT_65855].  
These source data will be verified by [CONTACT_210704] h Associate (CRA) and the location of 
the source data documented before the start of the study. Remote monitoring of original source 
records may be performed, but on -site monitoring would occur for review of any paper source 
documents and their transcripti on into the system, etc.  
9.2 Data Monitoring  
The Sponsor or designee will monitor completed source documents at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to lo cal regulations on the conduct of clinical research. 
The Investigator must make source documentation accessible to the Sponsor or designee as 
needed to verify the information in the source documents. The Investigator agrees to cooperate 
with the Sponsor or  designee to ensure that any problems detected during data monitoring are 
resolved.  
9.[ADDRESS_251816] -vaccination within a validated system 
that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. The eDiary is integrated into the EDC (Zelta) system  and 
subject -reported outcome data are available as soon as the subject submits data. The eDiary is 
conside red source documentation and should be limited to the subject’s recording. The 
Investigator is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of data associated with severity and 
relationship to study vaccine, and this is recorded on a separate source document from the 
eDiary.  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251817] permit the Sponsor and/or designee, regulatory agencies, and/or the IRB 
direct access to facilities and study documentation for the purpose of auditing study conduct. 
Direct access includes examining,  analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports 
that are needed for the evaluation of the study.  
9.5 Laboratory Data  
This study will employ electronic transfers of external laboratory data generated from clinical 
specimens collected by [CONTACT_18413]. The Investigator is responsible for the adequacy and 
accuracy of these specimens, and for determining clinical significance for all out -of-range 
values.  
10. Statistical Analysis  
This Phase 1/2 study is designed to achieve both safety and immunogenicit y objectives.  
The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of a single injection of VAX -31 at 3  dose levels 
and to compare the safety of VAX -31 to that of PCV20 administered to 4 groups:  
• Subjects aged 50 to 59 years receiving PCV20  
• Subjects aged 50 y ears and older receiving PCV20  
• Subjects aged 60 years and older receiving PCV20  
• Subjects aged 65 years and older receiving PCV20  
The secondary immunogenicity objectives are to assess the induction of OPA and MSD antibody 
responses by [CONTACT_210705] -31 at 3 dose level s compared to the 20 PCV20 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 
7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F), as measured at 30 days 
after the injection (Month 1) and  11 non -PCV20 serotypes (2, 7C, 9N, 15A, 16F,17F, 20B, 23A, 
23B, 31 and 3 5B), as compared to the standard regulatory criteria for efficacy  (e.g., lower bound 
of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio GMR for a given serotype greater than 0.5 
for noninferiority of shared serotypes and the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the 
geometric mean ratio GMR for a given serotype greater than 2. 0 for superiority of the novel 
serotypes) , measured at 30  days after the  injection  (Month 1) for subjects aged 50 to 59 years, 
50 years and older, 60  years and older, and 65 years and older.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP)  will be generated and approved prior to the interim analysis and 
treatment group unblinding for the primary safety and secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
through Month [ADDRESS_251818] Month 6 visits and fin al database lock. A single completed Clinical Study Report 
(CSR) will summarize safety and immunogenicity findings through Month 6 for all 
1000  subjects.  
10.1 Sample Size Calculation  
For subjects enrolled in Stage  1 of the study, comprising 64 subjects 50 to 64 years of age, 
sample size is not driven by [CONTACT_210706]. With 16 subjects, events that occur at a frequency of 15% or 
more will be detected with at least 92% probability and events that occur at a frequency of 10% 
or more will be detected with 81% probability. Therefore [ADDRESS_251819] safety assessment.  
For subjects enrolled in Stage  2 of the study, comprising approximately 736 subjects aged 50 to 
64 years as well as a minimum of 200 subjects aged 65 years and older, sample size is not based 
on statistical justificatio n. A total of approximately  800 subjects aged 50 to 64 (with a minimum 
of 200 subjects aged 60 to 64), as well as a minimum of 200 subjects aged  65 years and older, 
should provide sufficient information to assess safety and immunogenicity in the older age 
groups . The sample size will also be adequate to plan future studies.  
10.2 Treatment Period  
The Treatment period begins at the time of study vaccine administration and extends through the 
Month 1 visit. The Follow -up period spans the time following the Month 1 visit through Month 6 
(180 days after study vaccine administration) . 
10.3 Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized into 4 treatment groups:  
• 250 subjects will receive VAX -31 Low Dose  
• 250 subjects will receive VAX -31 Mid Dose  
• 250 subjects will receive VAX -31 High Dose  
• 250 subjects will receive PCV20  
For Stage 1, there were  no stratification  factors . For Stage 2, randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_68566]. 
10.4 Populations for Analysis  
Randomized Population: All screened subjects who have informed consent,  provide 
demographic and other baseline measurements, are randomized, and are assigned a study subject 

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   ID (number). Each subject will be analyzed as randomized (i.e., according to the vaccine 
regimen to which the subject was randomized).  
Exposed Population : All subjects who receive 1 study vaccination.  
Safety Population: All subjects in the Exposed Population who provide safety assessment data. 
This generally includes any subject in the Exposed Population that is not lost to follow -up at 
Day 1, as they will  be at risk for reporting an SAE. Each subject will be analyzed as treated (i.e., 
according to the vaccine regimen a subject received, rather than the vaccine regimen to which the 
subject may have been randomized).  
Immunogenicity Evaluable Population: For this Phase 1/2 study, t he immunogenicity 
population will be analyzed as treated (i.e., according to the vaccine regimen a subject receives, 
which may be different from the vaccine regimen to which the subject is randomized in the case 
of treatment errors).  
The Immunogenicity Evaluable Population (IEP) includes all subjects in the Exposed Population 
who:  
• Have no major protocol deviation that would impact immunogenicity assessment or other 
reason to be excluded as defined prior to unblinding or analysis.  
• Have  not received a prohibited medication or vaccine.  
• Provide evaluable serum sample results for baseline, the relevant post -vaccination time 
points, and within the required time frames:  
− Baseline:  Day 1 or within 30 days before study vaccine administration  
− Mon th 1: 30 days after vaccination ± [ADDRESS_251820] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. 
The frequencies and percentages of subjects by [CONTACT_4321], race, and ethnicity will be presented.  
Demographic data will be tabula ted for the Randomized, Immunogenicity Evaluable, and Safety 
Populations.  
10.6 Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   10.6.1  Analysis of Extent of Exposure  
The frequencies and percentages of subjects with vaccinations will be summa rized by [CONTACT_210707].  
10.6.2  Solicited Adverse Events  
With the exception of redness and swelling, all solicited AE (local and systemic) will be 
summarized according to severity grading scales defined in Section 8.2, from “mild” to 
“potentially life -threatening.”  
Solicited AE will be recorded daily until [ADDRESS_251821] -injection within an e Diary. The analyses of 
solicited AE (any event, after any injection,  and after each injection) will be performed by 
[CONTACT_210708]. In addition, solicited AE ongoing after the 
solicitation period ( [ADDRESS_251822] -injection ) will also be recorded as unsolicited AE.  
Frequencies and percentages of subject s experiencing each solicited AE will be presented by 
[CONTACT_764]. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic solicited 
AE overall and at each time point will also be presented.  
The severity of redness and swelling recorded as diam eters (cm) will be summarized according 
to categories based on the largest diameter linear measurement when the local reaction is present:  
• Grade 0/absent:  0–2.4 cm . 
• Grade 1/mild:  >2.5–5.0 cm.  
• Grade 2/moderate:  >5.1–10.0 cm.  
• Grade 3/severe:  >10.0 cm.  
The fo llowing summaries of subjects will be performed:  
• Solicited events by [CONTACT_210709] -injection, for each event and for any event.  
• Time of first onset of solicited AE, after injection, for each event and any event.  
• Solicited AE by [CONTACT_210710], after inj ection, for each event and for any event.  
• Duration of solicited AE, after injection, for each event and maximum duration of any 
event.  
• Solicited AE, occurrence of at least 1 event by [CONTACT_17203] (local, systemic), after injection.  

Protocol VAX31 -[ADDRESS_251823] 1 observation (i.e., any non -missing values but excluding “Not done/unknown”) for the 
solicited AE will be summarized.  
10.6.3  Unsolicited Adverse Events  
All the unsolicited AE occurring dur ing the study will be recorded, regardless of their assessment 
of relatedness by [CONTACT_737].  
The original verbatim terms used by [CONTACT_210711]. The unsolicited AE will then be grouped by [CONTACT_29305] (SOC). All reported AE, as 
well as AE judged by [CONTACT_210712], will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570], according  to SOC and preferred term within SOC. When an 
unsolicited AE occurs more than once for a subject, the maximum severity reported and 
strongest reported relationship to the treatment group will be counted.  
Only TEAE will be summarized as defined in Section 8.1.1 . The selection of unsolicited AE and

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   10.6.5  Analysis of Other Safety Data  
The frequencies and percentages of concomitant medications will be tabulated by [CONTACT_551], 
treatment group, and overall. Medications will be coded using the WHODrug dictionary.  
10.7 Immun ogenicity Analysis  
10.7.1  Geometric Mean Titer, Geometric Mean Concentration, and Geometric Mean 
Titer  Fold  Rise 
Immunogenicity analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_551] (50 to 59, 60 years and older, 65 years 
and older) and overall (50 years and older). Analyses will be performed for both OPA titers 
(log 10) and IgG titers (mcg/mL). All immunogenicity analyses will be based on the IEP and 
Exposed Population.  
The Geometric Mean Titer ( GMT ) and Geometric Mean Concentration ( GMC ) will be analyzed 
via linear models. Th e primary model is an analysis of variance (ANOVA), with logarithmically -
transformed titers (log 10) as the dependent variable and treatment group and study site as the 
fixed effects in the model. The results included in the main tables of the report will b e based on 
this basic ANOVA model. As a secondary analysis, in order to remove the effect of baseline 
concentration on the GMT, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will also be performed. The 
ANCOVA includes treatment group and study site as the fixed effec ts and log [ADDRESS_251824] squares means and their 95% confiden ce intervals (CI) calculated based on the 
ANOVA and ANCOVA will be back transformed and reported as the group GMT and GMC 
values (adjusted for the mean baseline in the case of the ANCOVA). GMR will also be 
calculated from the ANCOVA and ANOVA models.  
Compa risons between relevant groups will be based on the estimated adjusted GMT measured at 
Month 1 for 31 serotypes in VAX -31 (of those 20 in PCV20), and mean square error calculated 
from the basic ANOVA model using contrast statements. The analysis of GMFR re lative to 
Day [ADDRESS_251825] will be the 3 VAX -31 dose level group s vs the PCV20 
(20 serotypes) group. However, the 3 VAX -31 dose level groups will also be compared in a 
pairwise fashion on a serotype -by-serotype basis. No adjustment for multiplicity will be applied, 
and missing data will not be imputed.  

Protocol VAX31 -101 Version 2.0 08 Dece mber 2023  
   10.7.2  Threshold Analyses  
For the 11 non -PCV20 serotypes that are in VAX -31, the % of subjects with a ≥4 -fold increase 
in OPA titer will be evaluated using a logistic regression model, with an indicator variable for 
achieving a ≥4 -fold increase in OPA titer as the dependent variable, and treatment group and 
study site as fixed effects and log 10 baseline titer as a covariate. The difference in proportions 
achieving a ≥4 -fold increase in OPA titer in each of the 3 VAX -31 dose levels group vs the 
PCV20 and the corresponding 95% CI will be calculated. If the lower bound of the 95% CI is 
>0.1, the VAX -31 dose will be deemed statistically superior to  PCV20.  
The percentage of subjects achieving specified thresholds (e.g., GMFR ≥[ADDRESS_251826] serotype -specific LLOQ of the assay), and 
associated Wilson (score) 95% CI, will be calculated for the Month 1 visit data for each 
treatment group. A reverse cumulative distribution curve will be provided. Differences between 
pair-wise treatment groups may be determined via Fisher’s exact tests.  
10.[ADDRESS_251827], the study will resume enrollment of the remaining subjects aged 50  to 64 years 
(approximately 736  subjects) as well as all subjects [ADDRESS_251828] level.

11.3 Informed Consent  
The Sponsor or designee will provide a master ICF template to each site for development of a 
site-specific ICF. At the Investigator’s discretion, the site may develop a separate ICF for 
prescreening as described in Section 6.2. 
All site -specific ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_210718], local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. The Sponsor 
or designee will advise the site of required changes to the master ICF template during the course 
of the study.  
The Investigator will ensure that each potential stu dy subject is fully informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. Before informed 
consent is obtained, the Investigator, or a qualified person designated by [CONTACT_737], will 
provide the potent ial study subject with ample time and opportunity to inquire about the details 
of the study, and will answer all relevant questions to the potential study subject’s satisfaction. 
The potential study subject will then decide whether or not to participate in  the study. The 
Investigator, or a qualified person designated by [CONTACT_737], will obtain written informed 
consent from each study subject before any study -specific activity is performed.  
The Investigator will retain the original and any amended sign ed and dated ICF at the study site 
and provide a copy to each study subject.  
11.[ADDRESS_251831]’s anonymity is maintained. In all documents 
submitted to the Sponsor and/or its designee, subjects can be id entified by [CONTACT_210719]. Documents not intended for submission to the Sponsor and/or its designee (e.g., signed 
ICF) must be maintained by [CONTACT_210720].

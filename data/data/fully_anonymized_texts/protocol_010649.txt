SmartHMD for improved mobility  
 
PROTOCOL  
 
I. BACKGROUND  
In 2015, 1.02 million individuals  were blind and 3.22 million were visually impaired in the US, with this 
prevalence expected to double by 2050.(Varma 2016)  The economic cost  of chronic care for individuals 
with vision impairment is significant,  expected to increase from $145 billion to $375 billion during this period 
(www.rpbusa.org ).  Ma ny patients with blindness or vision impairment are considered as low vision  (LV), 
which is defined functionally as chronic uncorrectable vision loss that impacts  daily living  or clinically by 
[CONTACT_770698] (VF) criteria  (www.who.int/blindness).  
 
Numerous studies show that reduced orientation and mobility  (O&M)  results in the loss of independence, 
increased depression, and an overall reduced quality of life (Salive 1994; Owsley 2004; Montarzino 2007; 
Paz 2001) . LV limits mobility, and therefore, the independence and health of afflicted individuals. Studies 
have shown that people with peripheral VF loss are especially impacted by [CONTACT_770699] O&M  (Geruschat 1998; 
Haymes 1996).  The role of peripheral vision in detecting and avoiding nearby [CONTACT_770700] a possible 
explanation for why people with peripheral vision loss experience greater O&M deficits than people with 
central vision loss  (Kuyk 1996)   
 The prevalence of LV due to peripheral vision loss is not fully known, but one study showed that 21% of individuals with LV had a diagnosis of glaucoma or early -onset retinal degeneration, which commonly lead 
to peripheral vision loss  (Owsley 2009). Another study showed that 14% of patients with LV had one of 
these diagnoses and stated the possible under -sampling of patients with peripheral VF loss (Goldstein 
2012; Brown  2014).  These studies underestimate the burden of peripheral VF loss since conditions suc h 
as non- glaucomatous optic neuropathies or a history of panretinal photocoagulation treatment for retinal 
ischemia may cause peripheral field loss, but do so less consistently or were not sufficiently captured in past studies.   
 Up to 85% of patients with LV may improve their vision- dependent function through low vision rehabilitation. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_770695], there has been limited research and few assistive devices for LV due to peripheral vision loss. These devices do not address functional impairments,  such as reduced 
O&M , from peripheral vision loss. Head- mounted display (HMD) technology has potential to benefit 
individuals with severe peripheral vision loss  (Ehrlich 2016) . Our team has developed a prototype 
smartHMD system that functions as a personalized navigation system to enhance vision- dependent 
functions, in particular O&M, for patients with LV.   
 
II. OBJECTIVES/ HYPOTHESIS  
Our objective is to assess the impact of smartHMD in several navigation scenarios that people with low 
vision find difficult to complete. We expect the smartHMD to increase the completion time for navigation task, vs. baseline mobility.  
 
III. STUDY DESIGN  
a. Patient Recruitment 
Participants will be enrolled at the Kellogg Eye Center (KEC) and participants will be recruited via mailings or will be identified by a vision care provider. Patients recruited via mailings will be given two weeks to opt -
out of the study prior to receivin g a phone call. To evaluate eligibility and clinical status, medical records of 
patients with conditions or treatments likely to result in PFL (glaucoma, retinal dystrophy  including Argus 2 
implants , optic neuropathy, pan- retinal photocoagulation) will be reviewed.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are summarized in Table 1.  Participants will be reimbursed $100 for their time.

b. Experimental Methods and Design  
SmartHMD  (described in section d) will be evaluated in participants  (n=30) with severe VF constriction.  
The study visit should take up to three hours  depending on which experiments are performed. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
we will focus on one or two of the five tests described below . For all experiments, the participant’s baseline 
mobility skills will serve as the control. We will first train the participant to ensure they can effectively use 
the smartHMD. Prior to each task, we will describe the task to them. If the participant does not think they can perform the task with their baseline mobility, they will not be forced to do so. For some experiments, we will blindf old the participants, to remove the variable of residual vision. This has been done in other 
studies of blind mobility (Rizzo 2018).  
 
1. Outdoor testing: crosswalk detection  
We will use crosswalks with signals near the North Campus Research Center.  These crosswalks are 
highly used by [CONTACT_770701], thus they have well -maintained signals, crosswalk stripi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and pavement.   
Testing will be done in with verbal, vibrational, and (for Argus II participants) modified video.  
 Subjects will stand [ADDRESS_1057972] based on their interpretation of the pedestrian signal display  (without smartHMD ) or by 
[CONTACT_770702] (smartHMD). . After an orientation period with the smartHMD (which 
will include practice mobility trials), subjects will repeat the crosswalk navigation task using smartHMD and, 
if possible, without smartHMD.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_1057973] navigation  
The participant will be guided by [CONTACT_770703]. The route will be on the same floor (no stairs or elevators), but may include ramps. A participant may complete up to 10 routes, each about 50 m, with 2- 3 turns.  The order of routes and smartHMD configurations will be varied 
across participants.  
 
4. Indoor testing: Door detection  
Subjects’ will use smartHMD technology guided computer vision to navigate toward a door sign located 
approximately [ADDRESS_1057974]. This testing will be done in a conference room. The participant’s  starting 
point will be at different orientations from the door. The subjects will be s topped to ensure that they are not 
hit by [CONTACT_770704]. We will conduct [ADDRESS_1057975] the navigation outcome measures (defined below).  For testing 
done in closed space, such as a conference room, one safety officer will walk with the participant and one experimenter will record data.  After every trial for the experiments listed above, the participant will be offered 
a seated break.  
 Prior to the navigation trials, each subject’s preferred walking speed (PWS) will be determined by [CONTACT_770705], along a ~[ADDRESS_1057976].  Subjects will wear their habitual spectacle correction, if normally worn for mobility activities and no assistive mobility devices (including the smartHMD) will be used when measuring subjects’ PWS.  Subjects’ PWS will be measured four times but only the last three PWS trials will be averaged to represent 
each subject’s PWS due to familiarity effects between the first and second PWS trial.  
 
The smartHMD will include automatic data logging to record video and user command and cue, all time-
stamped for later analysis.   
 For all experiments, time to the complete the route is the primary outcome measure. In contrast to reaction 
time in speed- critical tasks, time to completion is used here as a continuous measure of task difficulty that 
encompasses wrong responses and resulting error correction, slow walking due to confusion, and overall 
efficacy of travel. Our statistical analysis will account for differences in walking speed between participants. 
Secondary measures include Percentage of Preferred Walking Speed (Patel 2006) , # of un intended 
contacts with obstacles and walls, # of incorrect turns, # of requests for assistance, type of assistance requested,  and # of interventions by [CONTACT_194071]. Data collection will be facilitated by a wearable test system with redundant data collection via hard copy datasheets and a handheld (by [CONTACT_770706]) video camera. Post -test data processing will refine the measures.  
 
c. Subject Interviews and Surveys  
We will administer standard and custom surveys to the participant to obtain more information about their 
condition, difficulties they face due to visual impairment, and preference for the smartHMD design.  A copy 
of all 5 surveys are attached in the Additional Supporting Documents section.  The interviews will be 
recorded.  
 
MoCA -Blind (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is an adapted version of the original MoCA  
(www.mocatest.org) , a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive impairment.  We will use the 
recommended cutoff value of  ≥[ADDRESS_1057977] this survey on the pre- screening phone call.  
 
IVI-VLV (Impact of Visual Impairment – Very Low Vision) is a standard survey to assess vision- related 
quality of life in persons with severe vision loss (Finger 2014) . This survey will be administered prior to 
testing and may be administered over the phone as part of the pre- screening phone call.  
 
SmartHMD in- test questions. We will ask the participants to rate their trust in the system and to rate the 
mental energy required to use the system.  
 
SmartHMD post -test questions.  After testing, w e will ask the user follow up questions to obtain their 
impressions from testing.  
 
SmartHMD follow up phone call. We will contact [CONTACT_2299] 1- [ADDRESS_1057978] more thoughts on the system design.   
 
d
. Data Analysis  
Data analysis will be done to determine which configuration of the smartHMD device improves O&M in 
study participants who have LV, and if improvements  are significantly better than baseline mobility.  
 The peer -reviewed literature provides estimates of mean PPWS and variability within groups of LV subjects. 
PPWS can be viewed as a surrogate measure for completion time, and its reported variability among LV subjects is useful for sample size estimation. Other groups (Soong, 2004) have  reported on two visually 
impaired groups (n=19 & n=18); the mean (SD) PPWS values for the two groups were 40.1% (12.7%) and 40.8% (13.1%). Thus, we estimate the SD to be 33% (~13/41) of the mean completion times for both baseline  and smartHMD conditions. Our prior work (Adebiyi  2017) compar ed guided mobility (with verbal 
or vibrational feedback) versus no guidance and found significant differences in completion time with n=[ADDRESS_1057979] disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, extent of exposure and study termination/withdrawal information,  as well as efficacy information. Descriptive statistics (number and 
percentage for categorical data; mean, median, standard deviation, inter -quartile range, min/max, and 
number for continuous data) will be presented for each evaluable for differences in outcomes control vs. smartHMD condition. For discrete variables, descriptive analyses will be based on numbers of subjects and related percentages.  
 Interviews will be audio- recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using inductive qualitative analysis. 
Additionally, mixed methods analyses, such as joint display tables, will be used to integrate qualitative findings with vision -related quality of life data from the IVI -VLV. These analytic approaches will provide 
insights on how user preferences vary based on vision -related quality of life across various domains.  
 Data from the IVI- VLV correspond to two domains: Activities of Daily Living, Mobility and Safety and 
Emotional Wellbeing. Survey response data will be scored using classical approaches (e.g. Likert scoring). Modern psychometric approaches are preferred, however. Thus, if a Rasch- analysis produces stable items 
calibrations (e.g. +/ - ½ logit with 95% confidence), IVI -VLV response data will be Rasch- adjusted.  
 A score of 18 (out of 22) on MoCA -Blind is considered normal. This is not used for statistical analysis but 
as a screening tool.  
 
All data listings, summaries, figures, and statistical analyses will be generated using SAS Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), or other validated statistical software.  
 
e. HMD descriptions  
i). ODG R -7 Smartglasses  
The ODG R -7 Smartglasses (ODG, San Francisco) uses the camera on the R -[ADDRESS_1057980] in a scene while tracking and detecting any changes. The guidance module plans an optimal path, based on the detected objects, and guides the user to the destination using audio and/ or vibration feedback.  
 
ii). Manually operated auditory feedback and tactile stimulator array  
This device allows an operator to control the timing, type, and frequency of feedback provided to the participant. It consists of a custom app, a mobile device (such as  a smart phone), an electronics module to 
communicate with the mobile device and control the user interface, and the user interface, which includes headphones for verbal feedback and a tactile stimulator array for vibrational feedback. The tactile stimulat or 
array  will be worn on the head,  like a headband,  around the waist like a belt, or on the handle of a long 
cane (used for obstacle detection by [CONTACT_770707]). The tactile stimulator array will have 3- 5 
vibration motors.  The entire system is battery powered.   
 iii). Computer Vision Navigation prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_770696]. The system consists of two components: The Intel RealSense D435i camera and a computer (either an Alienware M15 laptop or a Jetson Mobile Computer) . 
Novel software for detection, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], guidance, and recording will be developed and run on the computer . 
A separate camera for patient tracking may be included. The cameras are connected to the computer  via 
USB cables. The computer  is in a backpack or satchel worn by [CONTACT_28024]. All devices are powered through 
a battery making this system fully portable. The camera is mounted on the user’s head with a head strap. 
The camera’s video is sent to the computer  where the computer vision algorithms analyze the scene and 
decide on a path for the user to follow. The guidance algorithm will send commands to one of several 
outputs, depending on the experiment. The output devices are 1) the tactile stimulator array 2) audio output 
of the computer , for verbal guidance commands 3) video output of the device for display on a head- mounted 
display or as input to the Argus II Video Processing Unit. In the case of the output device being the VPU, the VPU will accept standard video format of NTSC and will stimulate the retina of the patient via the implanted retinal stimulator, according to the received video signal.

Summary of Study 
Design : This is a phase 2, open label, maximal usage PK and safety study of 
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% in pediatric subjects (ages 6 to 11  years  old) 
with plaque psoriasis : 
• At entry, subjects will have at least 2% BSA involvement 
(excluding the scalp, palms, soles), except for a subset of 
evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e for maximal usage 
evaluation that will have at least 3% BSA involvement (excluding 
the scalp,  palms, soles), and both groups of subjects will have a 
minimum IGA of Mild (‘2’).  
• Subjects who discontinue the study may be replaced.   
• Subjects /caregivers will apply ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD for 
28 days to all affected areas of plaque psoriasis and any newly 
appearing plaque psoriasis lesions that arise during the study, 
except on the scalp.  
• Subjects /caregivers should maintain treatment of these areas with 
study drug for the duration of the study regardless of whether 
treatable areas of psoriasis clear prior to Week 4.

results will be utilized.  
c Height will be measured at every visit (see Section 7.1.3  for the recommended procedure). Weight will be 
collected on every visit. Weight should be obtained using a calibrated weight scale  and t he same scale should be 
used for a subject throughout the duration of the study.  The subject should remove shoes and heavy clothing 
(sweaters or jackets ), and empty pockets . The subject should  stand with both feet in the center of the scale with 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523882] decimal fraction (for example, 55.5 pounds 
or 25.1 kilograms) . Measure the weight in triplicate and report  the average weight in EDC.  
d BSA, IGA affected by [CONTACT_415599] (Screening and Baseline) 
and will be measured at the Week 2 and Week 4 visits.  Scalp, palms and soles should be excluded from 
consideration in these assessments.  Additionally, Intertriginous Area -IGA (I -IGA) , PASI, and WI -NRS will be 
evaluated.   WI-NRS p ruritus  assessment will  be completed by [CONTACT_1766] ≥ 8 years old, or by [CONTACT_7078]/caregiver  for 
subjects < 8 years old. All other assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_80476], as appropriate.

of skin irritation (Berger and Bowman skin irritation score) and [ADDRESS_523883]’s ‘0 -3’ burning/stingin g assessment (subject -rating completed by [CONTACT_11867]/caregiver). At the 
Week 4 visit, only the Investigator assessment of skin irritation will be performed.  Note for investigator 
tolerability assessments: reactions at the site of product IP application, which may occur post -Baseline, should be 
differentiated from the preexisting inflammation associated with the subject’s psoriasis . 
f For females that have started menstruation, a serum pregnancy test will be performed during Screening. A urine 
pregnancy test will be administered to all females of child -bearing potential. A negative result is required for 
continued participation in the study, and results must be available prior to dispensing of study drug  
g All enrolled subjects will have a trough PK sample collected at the Week 4 visit. A subset of 6 subjects who 
consent will provide  an additional PK sample pre -dose (within 1 hour) at the Week 2 visit.  
h Subjects/caregiver  to apply assigned IP in clinic at Baseline and Week 2. All Investigator assessments should be 
completed prior to IP application.  
I The number of kits to be dispensed is based on %BSA affected. See IP Handling Manual for details. Site should review IP kit to ensure sufficient IP is available until the next visit and only dispense additional IP if needed.
 
j Every tube should be weighed and recorded when dispensed and returned.  
k Any emergent AEs will be followed in the clinic for up to [ADDRESS_523884] igator’s discretion until resolved 
or otherwise judged as clinically stable.  
l Photography is planned to be performed at selected investigational sites.  Photography will be optional.  All efforts will be made to de -identify the subjects.

Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523887] is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved globally to reduce the risk of 
exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) associated 
with chronic bronchitis.  Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N -oxide, are high 
affinity selective inhibitors of PDE -4 (a major cyclic -3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate 
(cyclic AMP) -metabolizing enzyme), whose activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic 
AMP.  There are four different subtypes  of PDE -4: PDE -4a, PDE-4b, PDE-4c, and PDE-4d, 
each with several isoforms (splicing variants).  IC [ADDRESS_523888] 
N-oxide for the different PDE-4 isoforms and subtypes are mostly sub-nanomolar and single 
digit nanomolar ( Hatzelmann 2010).   The PDE- [ADDRESS_523889] suggested a deficiency of  cyclic 
AMP -dependent protein kinases in human psoriatic skin ( Brion  1986).  More recently, various 
cytokines produced by [CONTACT_78443]1 and Th17 cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  It has been postulated that the anti -inflammatory effects of PDE -4 
inhibitors may provide a beneficial therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis , and Otezla

Accordingly, a phase 3 program is ongoing evaluating ARQ-151 cream 0.3% for the treatment of plaque p soriasis in subjects 2 years of age and older .  The present study is a 
maximal use pharmacokinetic trial with the to -be-marketed formulation.  The study is designed 
to ensure that the expected target patient population for ARQ-151 is properly represented, as well as to ensure that a suitable number of subjects with plaque psoriasis are evaluated and that PK is adequately characterized.

This is a phase  2, open label, maximal usage PK and safety study of ARQ-151 cream 0.3% in 
pediatric subjects (ages 6 to 11  years  old, inclusive) with plaque psoriasis.   
At entry, subjects will have at least 2% BSA involvement (excluding the scalp, palms, soles), 
except for a subset  of evaluable subjects who consent to a PK sampl e for maximal usage 
evaluation that will have at least 3% BSA involvement (excluding the scalp, palms, soles), and 
both groups of subjects will have a minimum IGA of Mild (‘2’).  
Subjects who discontinue the study may be r eplaced.   
Subjects /caregivers will apply ARQ-151 cream 0. 3% QD for 28 days to all plaque psoriasis 
affected areas and any newly appearing plaque psoriasis lesions that arise during the study, 
except on the scalp.  
Subjects /caregivers should maintain treatment of areas with study drug for the duration of the 
study regardless of whether treatable areas clear prior to Week 4.  The palms and soles will be 
treated but will not be counted towards any measurements of efficacy (PA SI, IGA, I- IGA, BSA).  
Approximately 20 male and female subjects ages 6 to 11 years old with plaque psoriasis: 
• All subjects must have at least 2% BSA psoriasis involvement at Baseline  
• However, a subset  of [ADDRESS_523891] 3% BSA involvement at Baseline (excluding  the scalp,  
palms, soles ).  
o PK evaluable subjects (in the maximal usage subset) are defined as those that have PK results at Week 2. Unevaluable subjects may be replaced.  
• All subjects must have at least Mild (‘2’) psoriasis severity based on IGA at Baseline  
6.[ADDRESS_523892] Participation  
All subjects will participate in s creening (up to 3 weeks) and a  Treatment phase (4 weeks).  
Upon completion of this study, participants may have the opportunity, subject to research site 
participation , to enroll in an open-label extension study of up to 24 weeks, receiving ARQ -151 
cream 0.3% concentration ( study ARQ-151-306). 
• For subjects who enr oll in ARQ-151-306, the Week 4 visit will complete this study 
(ARQ-151-215).  
• Subjects who do not enroll in ARQ-151- 306 will complete this study (ARQ-151-215) 
with the Week [ADDRESS_523893] digit 
will be “5” while the next two  digits correspond to the site number (assigned by [CONTACT_1034],

6.9 Treatment  
6.9.1 Drug Supplies, Packaging and Labeling  
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% will be in 45 gram ( weight of cream) squeeze tubes. The tubes will be 
packaged  in kits, containing multiple tubes of investigational product.  The number of kits 
dispensed to a subject will be based on the BSA involvement of plaque psoriasis. The kits will be labeled in an open-label manner. The kit(s) dispensed to a subject will be labeled with a unique number. 
The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of the investigational product to each site to allow 
for completion of this study. 
Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the investigational products supplied.  
At the conclusion of the study, any unused investigational products will be returned to the 
Sponsor or designee, or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions. 
Refer  to the current version of the IP Handling Manual for details on the accountability, storage, 
and management of the IP. 
6.9.2 Treatment Administration  
ARQ-151 cream 0.3% is administered once daily as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_415591] 2 mg/cm
2. Each site and each subject will be provided a 
digital scale to accurately measure the proper amount of cream to be applied to the psoriatic lesions. Each site will be provided a calculation program that uses the subject’s height, weight, and %BSA of plaque psoriasis involvement to calculate the correct amount of ARQ -151 to be 
applied once a day to the psoriatic lesions. 
At the Baseline visit, the Investigator will calculate daily IP to be applied in grams using the 
calculation tool.  
• IP tubes will be weighed prior to and immediately after IP application (Cap On)  
• IP will be weighed into a plastic dish using the digital scale  
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523902] and/ or parent/caregiver how 
to use the digital scale to measure the proper amount of ARQ -151 cream to apply. ARQ-151 
cream  is applied to psoriasis lesions as a thin film and rubbed in using the index and middle 
finger, thoroughly but gently, until the ‘white’ has disappeared. The subject or parent/ caregiver 
will then apply the weighed amount of ARQ-151 to the psoriasis lesions once a day .  
If a parent/guardian /caregiver helps apply the study medication, they should wash their hands 
with soap and water when finished.   For days that are a clinic visit, the IP will be applied in the clinic and the subject does not apply 
any furt her IP that day. All psoria sis lesions should be treated using the IP amount as noted in the 
Subject Body Diagram (see Appendix 1) , except for the scalp.  
Re-training will be conducted at subsequent visits as needed (i.e., if the returned tube(s) weighs 
substantially different than the expected weight).  
Note : 
• All subjects should apply medication each evening (except on clinic visit d ays) at least 
15 minutes after showering or bathing (if they take an evening shower/bath) and then not wash areas where ARQ -[ADDRESS_523903] 20 minutes before going to bed. 
• Subjects should maintain treatment of areas with study drug for the duration of the study regardless of whether treatable areas of psoriasis clear prior to Week 4 visit . 
New lesi ons that develop during the study should be treated (except scalp) . An unscheduled visit 
is not required for starting treatment of new lesions.  
Each investigational product tube will be weighed prior to dispensing at the B aseline visit and at 
subsequent visits. Investigational product tubes must be returned by [CONTACT_180398], 
both empty and full, and will be weighed. If the subject’s actual use is substantially different than the expected use for the subject’s BSA, the subject /parent/ caregiver  will be retrained on the 
study drug application technique.  
At the final clinic visit, the subject should return all IP (used or unused), the digital scale, 
and any remaining plastic dishes.  
Refer to the Investigational Product (IP) Handling Plan for detailed instructions.  
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523904] tubes will be weighed at each clinic visit.  
Subjects /caregivers will complete a daily diary recording the date and time of each dose applied, 
any missed doses, and a comment section should the subjects have a comment, e.g., record 
potential AEs.  Site personnel will review the diaries and use the information to question the subject regarding compliance and AEs and then record appropriate information in source documents and complete Case Report Forms (CRFs). If a subject misses a dose, they should be instructed to return to the protocol investigational product administr ation schedule (i.e. if subject 
forgets a dose they should wait until that evening and apply as usual). 
A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
80% of the expected applications during the study drug application period and does not miss more than [ADDRESS_523905] applied (via dispensed and returned tube weights) will be measured for reporting purposes.  
If the diary shows less than 80% of expected use, the subject is using too little study drug and retraining must be conducted and documented. 
Compliance will be documented in source and in eCRF.  
7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section  2) summarizes the clinical procedures to be 
performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. Additional

7.1.8 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected starting at Screening after the parent/ legal guardian and, as appropriate, the subject has provided assent/informed consent. TEAEs should be recorded starting from the beginning of the treatment period.  
Any treatment emergent AEs will be followed in the clinic for up to one month at the 
Investigator’s discretion until resolved or otherwise judged as clinically stable.  
For further details on Adverse Events please see Section 7.7.

Baseline (using the IGA scale shown above but evaluating intertriginous ar eas ONLY and NOT 
whole body involvement), an IGA for the intertriginous region alone (I- IGA) will be recorded at 
Screening, Baselin e, Week 2, and Week 4. 
This ‘intertriginous area IGA’ (I -IGA) should be done AFTER the ‘standard whole body 
IGA’ in subjects who qualify. 
7.2.2 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  
Assessments will be performed as single assessments from which PASIs will be calculated.  
PASI assessment will be performed at Screening,  Baseline/D ay 1, Week 2, and Week 4  visit s.  
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is used for the measurement of severity of psoriasis.  
PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score 
in the range 0 (no dise ase) to 72 (maximal disease).  
The body is divided into four (head (h) (10% of a person's skin); arms (a) (20%); trunk  (t) (30%); 
legs (l) (40%)). Each of these areas is scored by [CONTACT_5071], and then the four scores are combined into the final PASI/mPASI. For each section, the percent of area (A) of skin involved is estimated and then transformed into a grade from 0 to 6 (A):  
0. 0% of involved area 
1. < 10% of involved area 
2. 10–29% of involved area 
3. 30–49% of involved area 
4. 50–69% of involved area 
5. 70–89% of involved area 
6. 90–100% of involved area 
Within each area, the severity is estimated by [CONTACT_78452]: erythema (‘E’; redness), 
induration (‘T’; thickness) and desquamation (‘S’; scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, from none to maximum severity possible. 
To calculate the PASI, the sum of the severity rating for the three main signs are multiplied with 
the numerical value of the area affected and with the various percentages of the four body areas. These values are then added to complete the formula as follows:  
PASI = 0.1 (Eh + Th + Sh) Ah + 0.2 (Ea + Ta + Sa) Aa + 0.3 (Et + Tt + St)  
At + 0.4 (El  + Tl + Sl) Al 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523910] Itch -Numerical Rating Scale (WI -NRS)  
WI-NRS Assessments will be performed as follows:  
• Screening, Baseline, Week 2, a nd Week [ADDRESS_523911] intensity during the previous 24-hour period ( Naegeli  2015). 
The WI-NRS will be determined by [CONTACT_63397]’s assessment of worst itch over the past 
24 hours. The scale i s from ‘0 to 10’ (“no itch” to “worst imaginable itch”). WI -NRS pruritus 
assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_1766] ≥ 8 years old, or by [CONTACT_7078]/caregiver for subjects

The definitions and reporting requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/ 
ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management,  Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to.  If any AEs are serious, as defined by [CONTACT_78454], required  procedures will be followed.  All SAEs  will be reported to the 
Sponsor via fax or e- mail w ithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, whether or not the 
serious events are deemed drug -related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to ICH E6: 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and ICH E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Stan dards for Expedited Reporting.  The IRB will be notified of the Alert 
Reports as per FDA,  ICH and the IRB ’s policies and procedures. 
An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  I mportant medical events 
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE that in the view of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78428] (e.g. caregiver relief)  
• Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities  
• Emergency room visits  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)  
• <24 hour admissions for observation or evaluation 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is 
not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social, and/or convenience adm issions 
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the individual subject. 
Protocol ARQ-151-215 Arcutis  Biotherapeutics, Inc . 
Amendment 1 
 
22 Jan 2021 Confidential Page 47 of 74  • Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs; 
however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meet s the definition of an AE.  
For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be 
reported as an AE, and the resulting appende ctomy should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE. 
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the  IND . 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact [CONTACT_415601] (provided separately)  within one business day of knowledge of event.  
7.7.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
This is defined as a serious adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the known study treatment information. A serious event or reaction is not defined as a S[LOCATION_003]R when: ‘it is serious but expected’ or it does n ot fit the definition of an SAE, whether 
expected or not.  
7.7.[ADDRESS_523917]  
At each follow -up visit, subjects and/or caregivers will be queried with an open- ended question 
such as: ‘How have you been feeling since your last visit?’  Additionally, the study staff will 
review subject diaries and, if it appears that a potential AE was recorded, study staff will query 
the subject and determine if an AE occurred.   
AEs (whether serious or non- serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s) 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78430]/or followed up for up to one month after end of treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acc eptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_1600]. 
Where appropriate, medical  test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document 
resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, im proved, unchanged, worse, 
fatal or unknown (lost to follow- up). 
7.7.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_78431] (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, likely). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on the NIH NCI CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5 -point severity sc ale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The date and time 
of onset, time relationship to drug dosing, duration, and outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow-up) of each event will be noted. 
• The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:

Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523945] of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to develop, Paidion Research Inc. and Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc. have collated the following guidelines for study sites participating in the ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523946] data from subjects remotely via telephone and/or by [CONTACT_415605]. T he method 
used for data collection must be clearly documented in the source. Whenever possible, sites 
should adhere to the protocol visit window
 for remote data collection. Screening and Baseline 
(Day 1) visits/assessments must be performed in the clinic and must NOT  be completed 
remotely. If necessary, these visits can be delayed ensuring they are conducted in the clinic and 
not remotely . 
 Data collection by [CONTACT_415606]. Subjects are contact[CONTACT_415607]. Subject responses should be 
recorded in the site source documents. Data collected remotely should be entered into the EDC system.  
 Data collection by [CONTACT_415608]. Site staff 
will contact [CONTACT_415609].   Investigator assessments and subject questionnaires normally completed during on- site visits 
should be completed on the appropriate paper source documents and entered in the EDC. The following subject assessments/questionnaires are approved to be collected via telemedicine/remotely : 
• WI-NRS  
• CDLQI  
• CDI-2 
• Subject Local Tolerability  
• Adverse Events 
• Concomitant medication  
• Review of  Subject Diary

22 Jan 2021 Confidential  Page 73 of 74 The following Investigator assessments cannot be completed  via telemedicine/remotely: 
• IGA, I- IGA 
• PASI  
• BSA  
• Investigator Local Tolerability  
• Subject Weight 
 
GUIDELINES FOR REMOTE DATA COLLECTION 
1. Highest priorities: the subject safety  and preserving integrity of data are critical  
2. Study visits  and procedures must be followed per protocol whenever possible. Any 
specific changes in study conduct that deviate from the protocol should be communicated to the IRB and Sponsor (via reporting to your site assigned CRA). All protocol deviations 
which occurred as a result of COVID -19 disruptions (e.g., visits out of window, missed 
assessments, etc.) should be differentiated from other PDs. It is prudent to rece ive IRB 
guidance or approval if a deviation is known to occur in advance (i.e., extending IP application or changing assessment windows, etc.).  
3. If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], a planned clinic visit is absolutely not possible due to a COVID -19 
related issue (e.g. , site has closed, subject prohibited from coming to clinic, etc.), 
sponsor’s strong preference is a delayed clinic visit. If the subject can come to clinic within a reasonable amount of time considering the protocol allowed visit window. If a delayed clin ic visit cannot be completed within [ADDRESS_523947] enough IP in the event timely clinic visit(s) is/are not possible. It is also critical to ensure subjects are instructed to continue to apply IP per 
protocol for the duration of their participation in the study. Subjects should also be reminded to complete their daily diaries and IP compliance should be assessed via phone if clinic visits are not possible or are delayed.  
5. 
It is critical for preserving data integrity to make every effort possible to have a subject 
return to clinic for the Week 4  visit.  For visits conducted in the clinic, it is critical to 
ensure Rater consistency for all efficacy assessments (e.g., IGA, etc.). If absolutely necessary, it is preferred to have several missed visits and a delayed Week [ADDRESS_523948] to return on-site within window for the Week 4 visit, sites should:
 
a. Ensure the subject has signed the most current IRB approved ICF with the ICF Addendum. 
b. Contact [CONTACT_415610].  
c. Subjects are approved to continue applying IP post Week [ADDRESS_523949]:  
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_523950] has no AEs that would warrant discontinuation of the IP.  
- Site should discuss any new or ongoing conmed(s) and determine if the use of any 
warrant having the subject stop IP application  or not. 
- For any female subject of childbearing potential that site should discuss and confirm the subject has continued her methods of ensuring pregnancy does not occur. Any deviation from these methods should be discussed further and the site should determine if IP should be halted or contact [CONTACT_415611].  A pregnancy test can be performed at the next onsite visit (this is applicable to prior visits being missed due to COVID -19 as well).  
- Subjects are approved to continue dosing for up to [ADDRESS_523951] W eek 4 until they 
return the clinic for the Week 4 visit. After this , sites should reach out to the 
Medical Monitor and/or Arcutis directly for approval to have subjects continue dosing. 
- All the above discussions must be documented in the source. 
d. If available, home health nurse visits could be considered for collection of Vital Signs and Clinical Labs. 
e. In the event a subject is quarantined, has symptoms, or is confirmed positive for COVID-19, it is the Sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_415596], assuming no other contraindications.

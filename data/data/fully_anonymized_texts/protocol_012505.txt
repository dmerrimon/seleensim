NCT Number: NCT03256 851 
Document Date: February 8, 2018  
 
  

Study Protocol  
The specific objectives of this study were to determine: a) the feasibility and acceptability of a telephone -
delivered exercise intervention to target fatigue in persons with MS; and b) how the telephone -based 
exercise intervention compared in absolute ter ms to an otherwise identical in -person -delivered exercise 
intervention in pre - to post -treatment changes in fatigue and secondary outcomes.   
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. A trained research coordinator completed a telephone screening form with 
each partic ipant. The study PIs then determined whether the individual met the study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Participants were included if they had a diagnosis of MS, were independently 
ambulatory with or without an assistive device for at least 5 minutes a t a time, had significant fatigue as 
indicated by a score of > 36 (of 63 possible points, for an average fatigue score of 4/7 points) on the 
Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and were able to follow study related commands. Participants were 
excluded if they we re experiencing any of the following: MS exacerbation within the past 30 days, an 
additional neurological condition that affected walking, or pregnancy.  
Randomization and Allocation Concealment. Eligible participants were consented and randomly assigned 
into the telephone -delivered exercise group (telephone; n=10) or the in -person -delivered exercise group 
(in-person; n=10). Simple randomization (i.e., single random number sequence) using SPSS was 
performed by [CONTACT_729152], who were not involved in part icipant testing or training. To ensure 
concealed allocation, sealed envelopes with group assignment were given to the study team at WSU and 
pulled sequentially at the time of randomization.  
Testing Sessions.  At baseline visit 1, participants completed info rmed consent procedures and surveys 
using Qualtrics, a free online research tool licensed by [CONTACT_729153] -specific 
websites for securely entering and storing participant data. Gait speed was assessed and resting heart rate 
(HR) w as obtained for calculation of target HR for week 1. Participants were outfitted with a PRO -Diary 
accelerometer and asked to continue their usual activities for the next week. One week after visit 1, 
participants returned to the lab for baseline visit [ADDRESS_995782] -treatment testing session, which included Qualtrics surveys, gait 
speed assessment, and donning of a PRO -Diary to wear for the next week. Participants returned PRO -
Diaries to the lab in a pre -paid box.  
In-person Training. Participants in the in -person group received 1x/wk training with a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_729151] (e.g., doctoral physical therapy student). Training sessions 
consisted of 30 minutes of endurance training and 30 minutes of strength training, focusing on 
progression of exercises and review of weekly module. Participants followed a home exercise program 
for the remainder of the week.  
Telephone Training. Participants in the telephone group received a 1x/week telephone call from a 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Participants reviewed the weekly module, reported their progress from the prior week, 
discussed any issues or problems, and received progressions of exercises for the upcoming week.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
All analyses were performed using Stata (version 15.1, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Normally 
distributed continuous variables  were described by [CONTACT_557526] (SD), non -normally 
distributed variables by [CONTACT_35773] (IQR), and categorical variables by [CONTACT_729154]. Mean change scores (SD) (pre -post intervention) were calculated for ea ch variable by 
[CONTACT_729155]’s d effect sizes were computed (mean change divided by [CONTACT_729156]). Effect sizes for fatigue -related outcome measures were used to calculate a minimum 
sample size for a two -tailed t -test study with a probability level of 0.[ADDRESS_995783] to generate mean differences and 
95% confidence intervals. Pre - and post -intervention fatigue scores (fatigue i ntensity, interference) were 
plotted by [CONTACT_19313], for each participant and for the group mean.

INTRODUCTION
 
The global incidence of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
s
 
peaked in 
the mid
-
1990s
. The incidence of new infections 
in 201
4
 
is reported by 
[CONTACT_125539]/AIDS
 
(
UNAIDS
)
 
as [ADDRESS_141085] of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_125508]
. The 
wider availability of 
anti
retroviral
 
(AR
V
)
 
treatment
, 
mother to child transmission prevention 
programs, and
 
a diverse array of
 
other prevention programs have all contributed to turning the t
ide 
of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]
 
[
1
]
.
 
Each effective form of prevention and treatment is a welcome public health 
measure.
 
 
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) is committed
 
to the development of safe, effective methods to prevent and treat HIV 
in
fection and AIDS worldwide. 
In this regard, the Vacci
ne Research Center (VRC), NIAID, 
Division of AIDS (DAIDS), NIAID,
 
and AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
 
are collaborating to 
eval
uate the potential clinical uses of HIV
-
specific broadly neutralizing human monoclonal 
antibodies (MAb) 
[
2
, 
3
, 
4
]
. 
 
The VRC, NIAID, NIH developed 
VRC01LS
 
and VRC07
-
523LS
, highly potent and broadly 
neutralizing HIV
-
[ADDRESS_141086] the HIV
-
1 CD4
+
 
binding site
 
[
5
]
. 
The predecessor 
of VRC01LS and VRC07
-
523LS, V
RC01, is in clinical trials under IND [ADDRESS_141087] infected with HIV
-
1 for more than 15 years and whose immune 
system controlle
d the virus without anti
-
retroviral therapy 
[
6
]
. 
The VRC01 sequence was modifie
d 
by [CONTACT_3725]
-
directed mutagenesis to increase its binding affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and 
the resulting antibody was designated VRC01LS. The LS designation specifies methionine to 
leucine (L) and asparagine to serine (S) 
(M428L/N434S, referre
d to as LS) 
changes within the C
-
terminus of the heavy chain constant region far outside of the antigen
-
binding site 
[
7
]
. Other than 
the two amino acid difference, VRC01LS is identical to VRC01. VRC01LS has an extended ha
lf
-
life in both serum and mucosal tissue compared to VRC01, persists at higher concentrations in 
mucosal tissues, and has demonstrated improved protection against primate 
simian
-
human 
immunodeficiency virus (
SHIV
)
 
infection 
[
5
]
. 
VRC01LS is currently in clinical trials
 
in HIV 
uninfected adults
 
under IND 125494 for 
its HIV 
prevention indication. 
The VRC07 (wild
-
type) 
heavy chain was identified by 454 deep sequencing based on its similarity to the VRC01 MAb and 
paired with the V

Generation and testing of VRC07
-
523LS is briefly described
.
 
The VRC07 (wild
-
type) heavy chain 
was identified by 454 deep sequencing based on its similarity to the VRC01 MAb and paired with 
the VRC
01 (wild
-
type) light chain. The mutations that together define the [ADDRESS_141120] amino 
acid residue of the light chain. The LS designation specifies methionine to leucine (L) and 
asparagine to serine (S) (M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) changes within the C
-
terminus of the 
heavy chain constant region. The 
LS mutation was introduced by [CONTACT_3725]
-
directed mutagenesis to 
increase the binding affinity for the neonatal Fc
-
receptor (FcRn), resulting in increased recirculation 
of functional IgG, thus increasing plasma half
-
life.
 
The bulk lot of the drug substance was m
anufactured 
under cGMP
 
using a stably transfected 
CHO
 
DG44 cell line and purified. The drug product was filled into glass vials and labeled at the VRC 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_125513]. Each 10 mL glass vial contains 6.25 ± 0.10 mL at a concentration of 100 mg/mL ± 10

Purpose
 
Determine if VRC07

523LS could protect male 
Rhesus Macaques against SHIV infection compared 
to VRC01LS after IV administration of low sub
-
optimal protective dose (0.3 mg/kg) of MAb
 
7/12 animals were protected after receiving 
VRC01LS at 0.3 mg/kg 
IV, 3/4 animals were 
protected after receiving VRC07
-
523LS at 0.2 
mg/kg IV and 0/4 were protected after receiving 
VRC07
-
523LS at 0.05 mg/kg IV. VRC07
-
523LS 
showed >5
-
fold increase in potency compared to 
VRC01LS, consistent with its ability to better 
neutra
lize viruses 
in vitro
 
Determine serum and rectal tissue concentrations in 
female rhesus macaques administered 10 mg/kg of 
VRC01 (WT) or VRC01LS IV
 
Introduction of the LS mutation increased the half
-
life of VRC01LS 2.5
-
fold and reduced clearance 3
-
fold compared to VRC01 (WT). VRC01LS 
remained detectable in rectal tissue for more than 70 
days and persisted at significantly higher levels, 
while the VRC0
1 (WT) could not be measured after 
28 days

523LS 
IV or 10 mg/mL of VRC01LS IV
 
When administered 
IV at a single dose of 10 mg/mL 
in cynomolgus macaques, the half
-
life 
of VRC01LS 
was about 30 days, a 3
-
fold increase compared to 
VRC01 (WT). Increased levels of VRC01LS were 
noted in rectal tissue, rectal secretions
,
 
and vaginal 
tissue at [ADDRESS_141122] ant
ibody infusion compared to 
VRC01 
[

]
. When administered IV at a single dose 
of 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus macaques, the half
-
life 
of VRC07
-
523LS was about 12 days. In all 4 
animals, plasma concentrations of VRC07
-
523LS 
exceeded 1
0 µg/mL at day 14 and were greater than 
3 µg/mL at day 28. Detectable concentrations of 
VRC07
-
523LS were found in rectal and vaginal 
secretions and tissues for at least 28 days (last 
collection point).

VRC01LS SC
 
When administered SC at a single dose of 10 mg/kg 
to rhesus macaques, the half
-
life of VRC01LS was 
about [ADDRESS_141123] 
administration (last day of testing). 
When 
administered SC at a single dose of 10 mg/kg in 
rhesus macaques, the half
-
life of VRC07

Schedule of Evaluations 
 
Refer to the table in 
Appendix III
 
for details on the Schedule of Evaluations and the windows 
permitted for completion of each visit
. After enrollment, deviations from the visit windows are 
discouraged and will be recorded as protocol deviations,
 
but will be permitted at the discretion of 
the PI (or designee). 
 
Additional visits and diagnostic tests may be scheduled during the study if needed to assess 
participant
 
safety or for sample collection for immunological testing.
 
Any evaluation for an adverse event or possible exacerbation of a pre
-
existing condition may be 
evaluated at study team discretion as a “protocol related” evaluation
 
(contact [CONTACT_125558] 
[EMAIL_2495]
)

SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
 
 
A
DVERSE 
E
VENTS
 
An adverse event 
(AE) 
is any 
untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence
 
in a human 
participant
, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease 
temporally 
associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to 
the study treatment. 
In the event of 
proteinuria 
Grade 
2 or higher, a nephrology consultation will be 
arranged, as well as other clinically necessary investigations. 
 
Severity of AEs will be assessed using the 
Version 2.0 of the
 
DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adve
rse Events
 
[November 2014].

(SAE)
 
The term “Serious Adverse 
Event
”
 
(SAE)
 
is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as 
follows: “
An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
the sponsor, it
 
results in
 
any of the following outcomes:
 
Death, a life
-
threatening adverse 
event
, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125518], a persistent or significant 
incapacity
 
or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions
, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life
-
th
reatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the 
patient or 
subject 
and may
 
require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment
 
in an emergency room or at home
, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions
 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.”
 
“Life
-
threatening” refers to an adverse event that at occurrence represents an immediate risk of 
death to the 
participant
. An event that may cause death
 
if it occurs in a more severe form is not 
considered life
-
threatening. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125519]

In Section 5.3 the term “Expedited Adverse Event” (EAE) encompasses the 
events that would be conside
red an SAE by [CONTACT_941] 21 CFR 312.32

Clinically insignificant physical findings at births including those regarded as normal variants do NOT meet reporting 
criteria. If a clinically significant anomaly is reported, all findings (including those of no individual significance) 
should b
e includ
ed in the same report. 
For example, do NOT report an isolated finding of polydactyly (extra fingers 
or toes) or Mongolian spot in an infant. But if either finding occurred with a major cardiac defect, report all findings 
in the SAE Report.

Attribution Cat
egories
 
Attribution categories used (i.e.

terms used for assessment of 
relationship of AE to study produc
t) 
for this study 
are
 
consistent with those described in the DAIDS EAE Manual, Version 2.0 (January 
2010), as follows:
 
•
 
Related
 
–
 
There is a reasonable
 
possibility that the AE 
may be related to the study 
produc
t(s).
 
•
 
Not Related
 
–
 
There is not a reasonable possibility that the
 
AE is related to the study 
produc
t(s).
 
If circumstances arise where other attribution categories are used in describing an adverse
 
event
, 
the 
attribution terms “Definitely”, “Probably” and “Possibly” related will be mapped to the “Related” 
category while the terms “Unlikely”
,
 
“Probably Not Related” and “Not Related” will be mapped to 
the “Not Related” category under EAE Manual, Version 2.0.

places 
participants
 
or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.
 
Non
-
serious UP: 
An UP
 
that is n
ot an Adverse Event (UPnonAE) is a
n unanticipated problem that 
does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
involve risk to the 
participant
, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the 
integrity of research data. S
uch events would be considered a non

targeted to a viral antigen and 
are
 
human
 
MAbs, they are
 
expected to have

low risk of such side 
effects. 
 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
the side eff

s are 
mild but may include 
reactions at injection site (pain, 
redness, bruising, swelling), 
fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, d

shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, 
pruritus

diarrhea, tachycardia
,
 
or chest pain
. Clinical use of

that are

antigens 
associated with human cells 
may be 
associated with an increased risk of infections
 
[

this is not expected to be a risk for 
MAbs
 
like VRC01LS

o a viral 
antigen.
 
It is known from published experience with human MAbs directed against the cell surface targets on 
lymphocytes, that infusion o
f a MAb may be associated with 
cytokine release, causing a reaction 
known as “cytokine release syndrome” (CRS)
 
[

and hypoxia, are infrequent and more often associated with MAbs 
targeted to human proteins or 
when
 
non
-
human MAbs, such as a murine MAb, is used 
[
22
]
. 
Specifically, with
 
regard to CRS reactions, these most commonly occur within the first few hours of 
beginning the infusion and are more common with th
e first MAb infusion received. 
This is because 
the cytokine release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted by [CONTACT_125567]
b and the burden of 
target cells is greatest at the ti
me of the first MAb treatment. 
With licensed therapeutic MAbs, CRS 
is managed by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_51119], administering histamine blockers
,
 
and restarting 
the infusion at a slower rate 
[

]
.
 
Delayed allergic reactions to 
other 
MAb
s
 
may include a serum sickness type of reaction
, which 
may 
include rash
, fever, lymph nod
e enlargement, and joint pains.
 
These symptoms may not appear until 
several days after the exposure to the 
MAb
 
and
 
is noted to be more common with chimeric types of 
MAb
s
 
rather than with human 
MAbs
 
such as VRC01LS
 
and VRC07

[

]
.
 
There are several FDA
-
licensed 
MAb
s
 
for which reactions related to the rate of 
IV 
infusion have 
been described.
 
Some symptoms may be treated by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_51119]. Supportive 
treatment may also be indicated for some signs and symptoms.  
 
Part

Risks of Blood Drawing:
 
Blood drawing may cause pain and
 
bruising
 
and
 
may
,
 
infrequently
,
 
cause 
a feeling of lightheadedness or fai
n
ting. R
arely,
 
it 
may cause
 
infect
ion at the site where the blood is 
taken.
 
In this study
, an IV
 
line that can be used for the collection of blood 
may be placed 
and left in 
place for several hours on the days 
when there are fr
equent 
PK 
blood draws.
 
Problems
 
from use of 
an IV for blood drawing 
are generally mild and
 
may include pain, bruising, minor 
swelling or 
bleeding 
at the 
IV
 
site 
and rarely, infection, 
vein irritation (called phlebitis),
 
or blood clot.

This study is a 
collaboration between the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH and the AIDS 
Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).
 
First, we want you to know that:
 
•
 
Taking part
 
in 
this study
 
is entirely voluntary.
 
•
 
You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time. In 
either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 
You will 
be treated the same no matter what. 
 
•
 
If you 
are at the NIH and would like to
 
receive care at the NIH, you must be taking part 
in a study or be under evaluation for study participation.
 
•
 
You may receive no benefit from taking part. The research may give us knowledge that 
may help people in the future.
 
•
 
We will tell you about new information from this study or other studies that may affect 
your health, welfare, or willingness to stay in this study. If you want the results of the 
study, let the study staff know.

PURPOSE AND PLAN OF THE STUDY
 
In this study, we are testing two experimental products or drugs called “VRC01LS” and “VRC07
-
523LS”. Experimental means that these products have not been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), 
but the FDA
 
has 
allowed us to test them in research studies. VRC01LS 
and VRC07
-
523LS are antibodies directed against HIV virus. The main purpose of this study is to 
see if these antibodies are safe and how your body will respond to them. 
(An antibody is a 
type of 
protein that helps protect the body against foreign matter, such as bacteria and viruses; it can be 
either produced by [CONTACT_125578] a laboratory.)
 
There are two different parts in this study (Part A and Part B). In Part A, 7 people got VRC0
1LS. In 
Part B, 7 people (up to 10 people) will get VRC07
-
523LS. People were put in Part A first and now 
Part A of the study is done. People will now be put in Part B. If you agree to take part in this study
 
(Part B)
,
 
you will get VRC07
-
523LS only and
 
we will measure the amount of the drug in your body 
and how much stays in your body over time. We will check to see if your immune system makes 
antibodies against the product you get.
 
About 14 to 20 people (7 to 10 people in each part) will take part in t
his study at the NIH Clinical 
Center in Bethesda, Maryland and sites within the 
ACTG
 
Network. The study will include a total of 
23 clinic visits per person over a period of about 11 months. 
 
You will be able to 
start

STUDY PRODUCTS
 
VRC01LS and VRC07
-
523LS a
re study products that contain monoclonal antibodies. 
“Monoclonal” means that all antibodies in each product are exactly the same. These antibodies 
target the virus that causes HIV infection. 
As of May 10, 2018, approximately [ADDRESS_141185] found in an HIV
-
infected 
person. Both of these study products were developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC), NIH 
and made in a drug manufacturing laboratory. There are currently research s
tudies of these products 
in adults without HIV infection. This is the first study to give VRC01LS or VRC07
-
523LS to 
people with HIV infection.
 
There is currently no cure for HIV. We do not expect the products in this study to 
cure or 
control
 
your
 
HIV.

523LS will be given to you by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion. This means we will place a thin 
tube or IV li
ne into a vein in your arm. The IV line will be attached to a bag that contains the study 
product mixed with a liquid called “normal saline” or salt water. It will flow into your vein for 
about [ADDRESS_141188] to a secure website to enter this information on an electronic form or “diary”. If 
you do not have a computer, you may use a paper diary instead. 
 
If you have any side effects after you get the study product, you should tell a study nurse or doctor 
as soon as possible. You can reach the clinic staff by [CONTACT_648] [ADDRESS_141189] symptoms, 
you may be asked to come into the clinic for an examina
tion before your next scheduled visit. It is 
very important that you follow the instructions you get from the clinic staff. 
 
Follow
-
up visits: After you get the study product, you will need to come back to the clinic [ADDRESS_141190] taken any medications. 
We will also provide 
pregnancy prevention 
counseling (counseling to prevent pregnancy) and positive prevention counseling (counseling to 
prevent 
illness and promote good health in p
eople who know they are HIV
-
positive) while you are 
in the study.

HIV TESTING AND MANAGEMENT 
 
As you take part in this study, you will have frequent testing of your HIV viral load and CD4
+
 
T cell 
coun
t for research purposes. These test results will be given to you and sent to your primary care 
provider. You should discuss these results and any questions about management of your HIV 
infection with your primary care provider. 
 
This study does not include
 
standard medical care or management of your HIV infection. The U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services and the clinical research team recommend that all HIV
-
infected individuals take (ARV) medication to reduce the chance of getting sick from HIV, inc
rease 
life expectancy with HIV infection
,
 
and prevent the spread of HIV to others.
 
We will not give you ARV medications as part of this research study. 
You must have a primary 
health care provider for HIV to take part in this study. If you 
do not
 
have one 
and need help finding 
one or getting ARV medications, please tell a study doctor or nurse. We will help you find a 
qualified HIV doctor and ARV medications. 
You and your primary health care provider will make 
all decisions about starting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or chan
ging ARV medications. 
However
,
 
we 
strongly advise
 
that you start ARV medications after you have compl
eted the day [ADDRESS_141193]:

VRC clinic only: HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_125527]. 
If performed at the NIH Clinical Ce

STORED SAMPLES
 
We will collect blood samples from you during the study. We will keep these samples for future 
research to learn more about monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, the immune system, and/or 
other 
medical conditions. Results from research done with your stored samples will not be in your 
medical record or reported to you.
 
Some of your blood samples that are left over after all required study testing are done may be stored 
and used for VRC

appr
oved and ACTG
-
approved HIV

related research.
 
 
Labeling of Stored Samples: We will label your stored samples by a code (like a number). Only the 
study team can link this code to you. Any identifying information about you will be kept 
confidential as much as
 
the law allows. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_125528], there is a small chance that information 
identifying you will be given to someone who should not get it.
 
Risks from Stored Samples: There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your medical 
records. The cha
nce that this information will be given to an unauthorized person without your 
permission is very small. Possible problems with the unplanned release of information include 
discrimination when applying for insurance and employment. Similar problems may occ
ur if you 
give information about yourself or agree to have your medical records released.
 
Future studies: In the future, other investigators (at NIH or outside of NIH
; in the ACTG or outside 
of the ACTG
) may wish to study your stored samples. When your sto
red samples are shared, they 
will be marked with a code. Your samples will not have any identifying information on them. Some 
information about you, such as your gender, age, health history, or ethnicity may also be shared 
with other researchers.

POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS
 
Risks of Blood Drawing and IV insertion:
 
The 
risks of drawing blood from a vein and having an IV 
include
 
pain, bruising, bleedi
ng, lightheadedness and fainting. Rarely, infection or inflammation can 
occur in the skin or vein.
 
Blood clots are possible risks when using an IV for blood draw.
 
Risks of VRC07
-
523LS:
 
This study is the first time that VRC07
-
523LS is being given to people 
with HIV infection. 
As of 
January [ADDRESS_141196] HIV. 
 
General risks of monoclonal antibodies:
 
Side effects to infusions of monoclonal antibodies may
 
include 
fever, chills, shaking, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, trouble breathing, hi
gh or 
low blood pressure, itchiness, rash, hives, lip or face swelling, diarrhea, racing heart or chest pain
. 
These 
reactions may be related to how fast the product is infused. If you have symptoms while you 
get VRC07
-
523LS, tell the nurse right away. Slow
ing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_125529].
 
Side effects may also include reactions at the injection site, such as redness, 
bruising, and swelling.
 
 
Some antibody products have a risk of serious allergic reactions 
or cytokine release syndrome 
that 
can be life
 
threatening.  
 
•
 
Anaphylaxis is one type of allergic reaction that may happen soon after an antibody product 
is given. This reaction can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives or rash, 
swelling in the mouth and face.    
 
•
 
Serum sickness is a delayed type of
 
allergic reaction that may happen several days to three 
weeks after an antibody product is given. This reaction can include hives or rash, fever, 
enlarged lymph nodes, muscle pains, joint pains, chest discomfort
,
 
and shortness of breath.
 
•
 
Cytokine release 
syndrome can happen when an antibody targets a cell protein that triggers 
immune cells to release cytokine (proinflammatory molecules in your body).
  
 
All of these reactions are very unlikely because VRC07
-
523LS is a fully human antibody that 
attacks the H
IV virus, and not your cells.

SCHEDULE OF EVALUATIONS (continued):
 
1
 
Physical exam
: Screening includes 
complete physical exam with vital signs, height and weight. Day 0 
physical exam includes vital signs (blood pressure, temperature and pulse) and weight (
used for ordering 
the study produc
t which is based on a “mg/kg” dose). At other visits if medically ind
icated, a targeted 
exam is performed. Otherwise only blood pressure (BP), pulse and temperature are required.
 
2
 
Medical history
: Screening, 01R and Day 0 evaluations include a complete medical history to evaluate 
eligibility criteria as defined in 
Section 4.1
. At other visits, an interim medical history will be done. 
 
3
 
Concomitant medications
: Concomitant medications must be entered in the database at enrollment and 
updated as required in 
Section 4.2.[ADDRESS_141207]
: ARVs will be reviewed with the 
participant
 
throughout the study, however 
the ARV medication record will be documented in the research chart and database as indicated and 
whenever changes are reported.

review
:
 
Participants
 
will begin to record [ADDRESS_141209]
: Negative pregnancy test results must be confirmed 
for women of reproductive p
otential 
prior to study produc
t administration.
 
Visit Windows:
 
Screening
: evaluations for eligi
bility must be completed 
within 
28
 
days of enrollment as noted in 
Section 4.1
.
 
Visit 01R and Day 0
: Visit 01R m
ay be done on the same day as Day 0. Day 0 = day of product 
administration. Day 0 is preferably scheduled within 14 days after enrollment at “Visit 01R”, but 
may be scheduled up to 
28
 
days after enrollment. Day 0 evaluations prior to VRC01LS
 
administration
 
are the baseline for assessing subsequent AEs.  
 
EOI

INTRODUCTION
We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This study is a collaboration 
between the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).
First, we want you to know that:
 
Taking part in this study is entirely voluntary.
 
You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time.  In either case, you 
will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You will be treated the same no matter 
what.
 
If you are at the NIH and would like to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking part in a study or be 
under evaluation for study participation. 
 
You may receive no benefit from taking part. The research may give us knowledge that may help people 
in the future.
 
We will tell you about new information from this study or other studies that may affect your health, 
welfare, or willingness to stay in this study. If you want the results of the study, let the study staff know. 
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research treatments 
they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH 
doctors or research team before you agree to the study.
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask 
any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other 
health professional.

PURPOSE AND PLAN OF THE STUDY
In this study, we are testing two experimental products 
or drugs called “VRC01LS” and “VRC07-523LS”.  Experimental 
means that these products have not been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the FDA has
allowed us to test them in research studies.  VRC01LS and
 VRC07-523LS are antibodies directed against HIV virus. The 
main purpose of this study is to see if these antibodies ar
e safe and how your body will resp
ond to them. (An antibody is 
a type of protein that helps protect the body against foreign matter such as bacteria and viruses; it can be either 
produced by [CONTACT_125578] a laboratory.)
There are two different parts in this study (Part A and Part B). In Part A, 7 people got VRC01LS. In Part B, 7 people (up 
to 10 people) will get VRC07-523LS. People were put in Part A first and now Part A of the study is done. People will now 
be put in Part B. If you agree to take part in this study (Part B), you will get VRC07-523LS only and we will measure the 
amount of the drug in your body and how much stays in your body over time. We will check to see if your immune 
system makes antibodies against the product you get. 
About 14 to 20 people (7 to 10 people in each part) will take part in this study at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, 
Maryland and sites within in the ACTG Network. The study will include a total of 23 clinic visits per person over a period 
of about 11 months. 
After you complete the day 14 study procedures, we strongly ad
vise that you start the antiviral therapy prescribed by 
[CONTACT_125585] (not study-provided).
STUDY PRODUCTS
VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS are study products that contain m
onoclonal antibodies. “Monoclonal” means that all the 
antibodies in each product are the same. These antibodies target 
the virus that causes HIV infection. As of May 10, 2018, 
approximately [ADDRESS_141234] found in an HIV infected person. Both of these study 
products were developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC), NIH and made in a drug manufacturing laboratory.  
There are currently research studies of these products in adults without HIV infection. This is the first study to give 
VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS people with HIV infection.
There is currently no cure for HIV. We do not expect the products in this study to cure or control your HIV. 
In laboratory and animal studies, VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS we
re shown to attach to and inactivate many types of HIV 
viruses. It is not known if the products will act the same way when given to humans.  It will take many studies to learn if 
the products are useful for preventing or treating HIV.  This study alone will not answer this question.

This study does not include standard medical care or the management of your HIV infection. The U.S. Department of 
Human Services and the clinical research team recommend that all HIV-infected individuals take (ARV) medication to 
reduce the chance of getting sick from HIV, increase life expectancy with HIV infection and prevent the spread of HIV to 
others. 
We will not give you ARV medications as part of this research study.  You must have a primary health care provider for 
HIV to take part in this study.  If you do not have one and need help finding one or getting ARV medications, please tell 
a study doctor or nurse. We will help you find a qualified HIV doctor and ARV medications. You and your primary health

GENETIC TESTING
In the future, genetic research tests may be done on your stored samples to help understand how VRC07-523LS works 
and interacts with your body. In research studies, genetic tests are done to see if different types of immune response are 
related to genetic differences in people; this includes testing your antibody genes. Genetic tests done in a research lab 
from your stored samples will not be recorded in your medical record and will not have your name [CONTACT_125590]. The 
performance of these tests is not for health care purposes.
HLA type is a genetic test. People with certain HLA types migh
t be more likely to develop certain diseases.  Simply having 
those HLA types does not mean they will develop those diseases. HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_125532]. It is our 
policy not to discuss your HLA results unless they have direct medical or reproductive implications for you or your family.  
Genetic information about you will not be revealed to others, including your relatives, without your permission.  We will 
not release any information about you or your family to any insurance company or employer unless you sign a document 
allowing release of information.

P.A.: 09-25-[ADDRESS_141241] blood samples from you during the study.  We will keep these samples for future research to learn more 
about monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, the immune system, and/or other medical conditions.  Results from research 
done with your stored samples will not be in your medical record or reported to you.
Some of your blood samples that are left over after all required study testing are done may be stored and used for VRC-
approved and ACTG-approved HIV-related research.
Labeling of Stored Samples: 
We will label your stored samples by a code (like a number).  Only the study team can 
link this code to you.  Any identifying information about you will be kept confidential as much as the law allows.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_125533], there is a small chance that information identifying you will be given to someone who should not get it.
Risks from Stored Samples: 
There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your medical records. The 
chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person without your permission is very small. Possible 
problems with the unplanned release of information include discrimination when applying for insurance and employment. 
Similar problems may occur if you give information about yourself or agree to have your medical records released.
Future studies: 
In the future, other investigators (at NIH or outside of NIH; in the ACTG or outside of the ACTG) may 
wish to study your stored samples. When your stored samples are shared, they will be marked with a code.  Your 
samples will not have any identifying information on them.  Some information about you, such as your gender, age, 
health history, or ethnicity may also be shared with other researchers.
Any future research studies using your samples will be conducted in a way that protects the rights and privacy of study 
participants.
Your stored samples will be used only for research and will not be sold.  The research done with your materials may be 
used to develop new products in the future but you will not receive payment for such products.
Making your Choice: 
You can only take part in this study if you agree to let us collect, store, and use your blood 
samples in future unspecified research.  If you decide not to take part in this study, you may still take part in other 
studies at NIH.    
POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS
Risks of Blood Drawing and IV insertion: The risks of drawing from a vein and having an IV include pain, bruising, 
bleeding, lightheadedness and fainting. Rarely, infection or inflammation can occur in the skin or vein. Blood clots are 
possible risks when using an IV for blood draw.
Risks of VRC07-523LS:  This study is the first time that VRC07-523LS is being given to people with HIV infection. As of 
January 2018, the people who have received at least one do
se of VRC07-523LS had no concerning reactions to the

General risks of monoclonal antibodies: Side effects to infusions of monoclonal antibodies may include fever, chills, 
shaking, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, trouble 
breathing, high or low blood pressure, itchiness, rash, 
hives, lip or face swelling, diarrhea, racing heart or chest pain
. These reactions may be related to how fast the product is 
infused. If you have symptoms while you get VRC07-523LS, tell the nurse right away. Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_125534]. Side effects may also include reactions at the injection site, such as redness, 
bruising, and swelling. 
Some antibody products have a risk of serious allergic reactions or cytokine release syndrome that can be life-
threatening.  
 
Anaphylaxis is one type of allergic reaction that may happen soon after an antibody product is given.  This 
reaction can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives or rash, swelling in the mouth and face.   
 
Serum sickness is a delayed type of allergic reaction that may happen several days to three weeks after an 
antibody product is given.  This reaction can include hives or rash, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, muscle pains, 
joint pains, chest discomfort and shortness of breath. 
 
Cytokine release syndrome can happen when an antibody targets a cell protein that triggers immune cells to 
release cytokine (proinflammatory molecules in your body).
All of these reactions are very unlikely because VRC07-523LS 
is a fully human antibody that attacks the HIV virus, and 
not your cells. 
In addition to the possible risks that are listed above, the study products may have other side effects that we do not 
know about yet.  Taking part in this study may affect your eligibility for future studies of other investigational monoclonal 
antibodies, antibody mixtures
 and other similar products.
We will give you any new information about risks or other information that becomes available that may affect your 
decision to continue in the study.
Risks during Pregnancy: We do not know what effects the study products may have on a fetus or nursing infant.  
Women must agree not to get pregnant during the study. We will discuss effective birth control methods with you. If 
you are able to become pregnant, you 
and your partner must use reliable birth control from the time you start the 
study until you complete the last study visit. 
If you can become pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test before you enter this study. The test must show that you 
are not pregnant. You must tell the clinic staff right away if you become pregnant during this study or think that you 
might be pregnant. If you become pregnant after getting the study product, we will not collect any more blood for 
research.  However, you will be asked to continue with study follow-up visits to check on your health and to report the 
outcome of the pregnancy to us, which will be reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry

CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The research staff are reviewed at least yearly for conflicts of interest.  You may ask the research team for additional 
information.
The National Institutes of Health, including some members of the Vaccine Research Center scientific staff, developed the 
experimental product in this research study. The results of this study could play a role in whether the FDA will approve 
the experimental product for sale at some time in the future.  If approved, the future sale of the vaccine could lead to 
payments to NIH and some NIH scientists. By U.S. law, government scientists are required to receive such payments for 
their inventions.
You will not get any money from the development or sale of the product.
This protocol may have investigators who are not NIH employees.  Non-NIH investigators are expected to follow the 
principles of the Protocol Review Guide but are not required to report their personal financial holdings to the NIH.

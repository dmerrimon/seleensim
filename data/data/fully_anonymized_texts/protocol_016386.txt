HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118393] of these clinical trials. The HIV 
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has addressed ethical concerns in the following 
ways:  
• HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base 
necessary to find a preventive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically 
rigorous and valid, and in accordance with International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH) and/or other Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
• HVTN scientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies underlying 
major codes (1-3), declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to 
human subjects research into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical 
trials.  
• HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
[CONTACT_106800].  
• HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are 
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infectio n 
according to local guidelines. Staff members will also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
• Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential clinical 
trials they may want to join. If a program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
provision is not available at a site and ART is needed, a privately established 
fund will be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent p ossible.  
• The HVTN provides training so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the fullest extent possible, their privacy 
protected. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
• Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by [CONTACT_106801].  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 6 of 281 • HVTN trials are reviewed by [CONTACT_106802].  
• The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both 
study participants and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols 
provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, 
as well as counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social impacts that 
may result from research participat ion. HVTN protocols also include careful 
medical review of each research participant’s health conditions and reactions 
to study products while in the study.  
• HVTN research aims to benefit local communities by [CONTACT_106803] n needs of those communities and by [CONTACT_106804], support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Researchers involved in HVTN trials are able to conduct other 
critical research in their local research settings.  
• The HVTN values the role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), 
Ethics Committees (ECs), and other Regulatory Entities (REs) as custodians 
responsible for ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 137 Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 7 of 281 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR  56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of these research requirements. Each HVTN 
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR  46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing a nd reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c) performing direct observation of participants postvaccination and 
collecting information regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) 
having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause 
physical harm or psychological distress, such as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV 
testing and counseling and HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk 
reduction counseling and checking on contraceptio n use (for persons assigned 
female at birth ); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.111(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protoco ls, where a study participant may be ill and may have 
exhausted all conventional treatment options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowle dge it is designed to generate.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 8 of 281 2.3 Equitable participant selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants ar e selected 
because of these criteria and not because of positions of vulnerability or privilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 and 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 and 5: Informed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46.116 and 
21 CFR Part 50; informed consent  is appropriately documented as 
required by [ADDRESS_118394] be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Each 
site is provided training in informed consent by [CONTACT_106805]. The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in 
addition  to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in  place (see Section 11). Safety is 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_106806] 137  Protocol Safety 
Review Team (PSRT). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) 
periodically reviews study data.  
2.[ADDRESS_118395] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of s ubjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unauthorized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable information about him/he r. The term “privacy” concerns 
research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 9 of 281 term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of partic ipants by [CONTACT_106807] (see 
Appendix A , Appendix B  and Appendix C ). The privacy of participants is 
protected by [CONTACT_106808]’s name [CONTACT_106999]. In the [LOCATION_002], research participants in HVTN 
protocols are protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the US NIH, 
which can prevent disclosure of study participation even when that informa tion is 
requested by [CONTACT_106809]. Participants are told of the use and limits of the certificate 
in the study consent form. In addition, each staff member at each study site in this 
protocol signs an Agreement on Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens 
with the HVTN. In some cases , a comparable confidentiality agreement process 
may be acceptable. Each study site participating in  the protocol is required to have 
a standard operating procedure on how the staff members will protect the 
confidentiality of st udy participants.

HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 16 of 281 4 Background  
4.1 Rationale for trial concept  
An estimated 1.8 million people with new HIV -1 infections were reported 
worldwide in 2017 (4). Based on models predicting the future rate of decline in 
new infections, the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_106710] (5). The development of a safe, highly 
effective HIV vaccine remains the utmost priority to induce long -lived immunity 
against HIV -1 infection. Such a vaccine implemented glo bally, alone or in 
combination with novel prevention strategies such as monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) for immunoprophylaxis or pre -exposure prophylaxis with antiretrovirals, 
holds the greatest promise to halt the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  
To confer protection, an effi cacious HIV vaccine, like most licensed viral 
vaccines, is thought to require the induction of antibodies  (Ab)  that can recognize 
circulating strains of HIV upon encounter and prevent infection. One of the  major 
goals in new HIV immunogen development is to  activate B cells whose receptors 
can recognize and bind to antigens resembling functional components on the 
envelope glycoprotein spi[INVESTIGATOR_106711], and thereby [CONTACT_106813] (nAbs) that prevent HIV entry and infection of a 
susceptible CD4 -expressing host target cell.  
This phase [ADDRESS_118404] clinically produced, stabilized soluble 
Env trimer exposing multiple HIV -1 broadly neutral izing antibody (bnAb) 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (6, 7) . The soluble native -like trimer design is a recent advance in the 
HIV vaccine field, and it is envisioned that the trimer platform will have wide 
applicability in tailoring immunogens as components of a neutralizing antibody -
based HIV vaccine regimen.  
Second, t his protocol wil l evaluate BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 separately combined 
with four different adjuvant formulations that activate different innate immune 
pathways; a separate placebo group will receive Tris -buffered saline. Three 
adjuvants are newly developed in this decade (G LA-LSQ, 3M -052-AF, and C pG 
1018) and the fourth is the licensed Alum  adjuvant (Alhydrogel) as an active 
control. The study aims to identify at least one novel trimer -adjuvant formulation 
that induces more potent, durable neutralizing antibodies to the tier [ADDRESS_118405] in human studies.  For example, 
building on infor mation obtained in Part A of this protocol, we will evaluate a 
stabil ized Env SOSIP trimer (Trimer 4571) in combination with 3M -052-AF to 
see if neutralization activity in human sera can be improved by [CONTACT_106814] a 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118406] whether a n intermediate dose (3 mcg)  of the 3M -052 AF plus Alum  leads 
to equivalent neutralization  to the high dose (5 mcg , evaluated in Parts A and B ) 
when combined with the original BG505 SOSIP.[ADDRESS_118407] similar immune responses and therefore 
will be important for clinical development of this adjuvant.  
4.1.1  BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140: a native -like soluble Env trimer  
Because of t he remarkable sequence and antigenic diversity of HIV -1 Env 
worldwide, vaccine -induced antibodies will likely need to neutralize a high 
percentage of circulating strains and with high potency to provide protection. 
Such broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnA bs) emerge in >  15% of persons within 
two years of HIV -1 infection, indicating that humans are capable of making these 
functional Abs (8-13). Nevertheless, no preventive vaccine candidate and regimen 
has elicited human bnAbs after three decades of evaluation. The failures can be 
explained in large part by [CONTACT_106815], discussed below.  
First, the Env immunogens tested thus far in clinical trials, while often highly 
immunogenic in the induction of Abs to immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], fail to 
adequately display the neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_106712] e, with rare exceptions, only induce neutralizing 
antibodies to easily neutralized tier 1 HIV -1 strains, a panel primarily composed 
of lab -adapted strains (14, 15) . Thus, one of the greatest challenges in HIV 
vaccine development has been to design Env immunogens that resemble the 
native Env trimeric structure of the virion -associated spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], affording B cells 
access to conformationally correct neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and to feasibly 
manufacture the trimer in sufficient amounts with long -term stability for clinical 
testing. Over the past decade, John Moore and colleagues described and improved 
a cleaved SOSIP trimer design platform to successfully produce a stable 
recom binant Env gp140 trimer that structurally mimics the native HIV -1 Env 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (16-20). The prototype, BG505 SOSIP.[ADDRESS_118408] of this class 
now manufactured for clinical use and will be evaluated in this phase 1 HVTN 
protocol. The gp140 sequence is modified from a tier 2 HIV -1 subtype A, CCR5 -
dependent, transmitted founder virus isolated from a 6 -week -old Kenyan infant 
infected at birth (21, 22) . 
Second, analysis of the molecular and structural properties of bnAbs reveal 
unusual features and complex maturation pathways, including high levels of 
somat ic mutation in the variable domains, long heavy chain complementarity 
determining regions, and autoreactivity with host antigens. The bnAbs induced in 
natural infection only occur in a fraction of people after the initial autologous nAb 
response, and this is driven by [CONTACT_106816] -1 variation within the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_106713]. Thus, it is unlikely that a single Env immunogen, including the 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118409] that a stable trimer such as BG505 
SOSIP.664 gp140 may induce nAbs in some proportion (up to 50%) of vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106714] -[ADDRESS_118410] contributed a wealth of insight into improved 
designs of Env immunogens as well as the identification of potent bnAbs as mAbs 
for HIV immune prophylaxis and possibly treatment (23). Since its construction, 
several other trimers have been successfu lly engineered and are being evaluated 
in animal models now and as clinical germline -targeting immunogens and boosts 
for lineage and epi[INVESTIGATOR_106715] -based designs in the near future. While the 
soluble cleaved SOSIP.664 design platform is the current lead  strategy for 
stabilized cleaved trimer immunogens, others include the native flexibly -linked 
(NFL) and uncleaved prefusion optimized (UFO) platforms. It is anticipated that 
the native -like soluble Env trimers will be important designs in the prime -boost 
sequential bnAb pathway regimens, and they will offer the advantage of 
presenting more than one bnAb epi[INVESTIGATOR_106716].  
The BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer has now been evaluated as an immunogen in 
a variety of animal model s, including wild -type and bnAb unmutate d common 
ancestor (UCA ) knock -in mice, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rats, rabbits, rhesus macaques, and 
cows. One key rationale for this study will be to define the immunogenicity of 
this trimer in humans in comparison to the various animal species. The preclinical 
studies supporting this proto col’s IND (see Section 4.4) were designed to use 
appropriate trimer -adjuvant formulations, dose levels, and schedule as planned in 
this study, while oth er reported studies have used primarily research grade BG505 
SOSIP.[ADDRESS_118411] that will be tested here. These approaches are aimed at 
reducing the induction of tier 1 nAbs directed at the Env V3 immunodomi nant 
and non -neutralizing CD4 binding site ( CD4bs ) epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_106717], no increases in Ab breadth 
or autologous neutralization were observed in mice or rabbits (24) following 
immunization with these modified trimers.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 19 of 281 The recent review by [CONTACT_106817] (23) nicely summarizes many of the key 
animal studies using BG505 SOSIP.664 as an immunogen, and a few other recent 
studies in rhesus macaques and cows are presented  in Table 4-1. 
Table 4-1 Assessment of antibody responses in rabbits, nonhuman primates, and cows 
following BG505 SOSIP gp140  immunization  
• Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_106718]505 autologous nAbs: defined by [CONTACT_95559][INVESTIGATOR_106719] a nd rhesus macaques previously immunized with the 
BG505 SOSIP.664  gp140 . Those observed were epi[INVESTIGATOR_106720] 1) a glycan hole at either residue 241 or 289 
in gp120, 2) an area at residue 465 near the junction of the gp120 V5 loop and beta 24 strand and 
influenc ed by [CONTACT_106818] C3 region ( the C3/465 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and 3) in the 
V1 region of gp120 (25). 
• Induction of autologous tier 2 nAbs:  nine of twelve rhesus macaques developed autologous tier 2 
nAbs after BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 with adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX or R848 (a TLR7/[ADDRESS_118412]) and  
monophosphoryl lipid A  (MPL ) (a TLR4 agonist) encapsulated in Poly(lactic -co-glycolic acid) (PLGA ) 
immunization. The best correlate of tier 2 nAb induction was lymph node germinal center B cell 
magnitude and  T follicular helper  (Tfh) properties of Env -specific CD4+ T cells (26). 
• Protection against SHIVBG505 challenge : 78 rhesus macaques were immunized three times with 
BG505 SOSIP .664 gp140 . 12 animals with either low or high titers received a fourth immunization and 
subsequently were repeatedly challenged with homologous SHIVBG505 intrarectally. Animals with 
high-titers of autologous nAbs were protected (no infection or lowered peak viremia ) until the titers 
waned. An autologous serum ID50 nAb titer of ~1:500 was consistent with >90% protection from the 
median challenge dose (27). 
• Immune response kinetics : Rhesus macaques receiving bilateral, adjuvanted, subcutaneous (SC) 
immunization with BG505 SOSIP .[ADDRESS_118413] immunization with BG505 SOSIP .664 gp140 . 
Neutralizing Abs were strongly associated with germinal center reactions, as assessed by [CONTACT_106819] B 
and T ce lls obtained by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (28). 
• bnAb induction by [CONTACT_106810]505 SOSIP.664 vaccination in cows : Four cows immunized with a single 
injection of BG505 SOSIP.[ADDRESS_118414] a 117 cross -clade HIV -1 panel developed 20% breadth within 42 
days, and this increased  to 96% breadth at 381 days. A mAb isolated from this cow neutralized 72% of 
isolates and was found to have an ultra-long heavy chain complementarity -determining region 3  
(HCDR3 ) (60 amino acids) (29). 
4.1.2  Trimer 4571 ( BG505 DS -SOSIP.664 gp140 ): A Stabilized  Soluble 
Trimer  
The prototype, BG505 SOSIP.[ADDRESS_118415] multiple conformations. Since HIV can assume multiple conformations, it is 
not known which conformation is optimal to target  for inducing tier 2 neutralizing 
antibodies.  The rationale for engineering the two cysteine  residue  changes  into 
Trimer  4571  was to fix the antigen into the mature, pre -fusion closed form (a 
“vulnerable” state ) (Figure 4-1). This “ DS” form of the BG505 SOSIP.664 
demonstrates substantial binding to canonical broadly neutralizing antibodies and 
virtually no binding to poorly neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_106721] (30).

macaques immunized via IM injection with research -grade Trimer 4571 produced 
neutralizing antibodies to BG505.W6M.C2.T332N (see the Investigator’s 
Brochure [IB] for more det ail on these BG505 variants).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_118417] been evaluated with HIV -1 Env protein or peptide 
immunogens (31-35). Alum  and MF59 have been the most frequently used in 
formulation with subunit Env immunogens, but others have been evaluated in 
phase 1 trials, including emulsions, saponins, surfactants, particles, and TLR4 
agonists. Among these are QS -21, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), muramyl 
dipeptide (MDP), muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP -PE), 
liposome -encapsulated lipid A, Montanide ISA -51, AS02A, AS01B, AS01E, and 
more recently glucop yranosyl lipid A (GLA). One adjuvant, Montanide ISA -51, 
was highly reactogenic at doses delivered (32, 36) . Newer formulations elicited 
mild-to-moderate increased antibody and T  cell responses (eg, QS -21, AS01B, 
and liposome -encapsulated lipid A) (37), and these components are now in us e in 
a number of new vaccine formulations for malaria, HIV, and other viral 
pathogens. Unfortunately, specimens needed for retrospective analysis were not 
archived from these trials and, until recently, the immunologic tools to explore at 
Figure 4-[ADDRESS_118418] two desirable properties: 1) it was conformationally stable and 2) it was not 
“triggered”  by [CONTACT_106820]4 which can lead to exposure of non -neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 21 of 281 the molecular lev el patterns of innate and adaptive vaccine/adjuvant –induced 
immune responses were unavailable.  
The development of new generation adjuvants beyond Alum inum and emulsion 
formulations, together with a deeper understanding of the mechanistic role of 
adjuvant formulations in stimulating innate immunity, offer opportunities to 
improve candidate vaccine designs intended to prevent HIV infection. In addition, 
renewed interest in novel adjuvants for use in clinical HIV subunit vaccines has 
emerged with the findings  from the RV144 trial (38-42) that more pote nt and 
durable antibodies with distinct effector functions may be important to elicit . In 
addition, the potenti al utility of improved adjuvants is well recognized for use  
with Env immunogens designed to induce immune responses along the pathway 
to bnAbs. Thus, we seek to combine a novel new class of HIV Env immunogen 
with three novel adjuvant formulations signaling  through specific TLR s, either 
TLR4 (GLA -LSQ), TLR7/8 (3M -052-AF), or TLR9 (C pG 1018 ), all of which 
show promise in altering the potency and quality of antibody responses in 
preclinical studies.  
Several recent reviews highlight the role of adjuvants in mod ern vaccines, present 
their mechanisms of action when known, and attest to the need to develop more 
clinically effective adjuvant/immunogen combinations for HIV and other disease 
targets (35, 43 -47). Novel adjuvants have been shown to increase the magnitude 
and breadth of vaccine -induced antibodies in animal models (48-52) and, le ss 
frequently, in humans (53). Nevertheless, while the past several years have  seen 
much progress in understanding immunologic effects of adjuvants and their 
underlying signaling mechanisms in in vitro and animal models, only a few 
studies have been performed in humans, particularly head -to-head adjuvant 
comparisons , in HIV vaccine clinical trials (54).  
Molecular immunostimulants and carrier systems comprise the two main adjuvant 
categories (55). Most immunostimulants act as l igands for pattern recognition 
receptors. These in clude toll -like receptors , nucleotide -binding oligomerization 
domain  (NOD) -like receptors, helicases and C -type lectin receptors. Current 
novel adjuvants primarily act as agonists targeting TLR3, 4, 7/[ADDRESS_118419] advanced to licensure. In some cases,  
enhanced adjuvant potency has been  accompanied by [CONTACT_106821].  This may be due to irritant effects at the site of injection or 
release of proinflammatory mediators and vasoactive substances (56, 57) , and 
infrequently to the breakdown of self -tolerance, possibly leadin g to autoimmune 
disorders (58). Rappouli et al described vaccine adjuvant development as “one of 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118420] processes in the history of medicine” (59). This highlights the need to 
develop standardized predictive models to assess safety, including adverse events  
(AE) , pre-existing genetic variations in innate immunity and the application of 
systems approaches to define early bio markers of adjuvant activity and safety 
signals, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. This 
study offers a unique opportunity to systematically assess the safety of multiple 
adjuvants with one vaccine antigen and contribute a pote ntial expanded safety 
marker panel. While discordant adjuvant effects may be seen when formulated 
with different antigens, a safety marker panel that can be used in future studies of 
novel HIV and non -HIV vaccine adjuvants could be beneficial  in preventing  
infections of major public health importance . 
4.1.4  Recent preclinical investigations with HIV vaccine -adjuvant and 
delivery formulations  
One challenge in understanding adjuvant effects in humans relates to species 
differences in innate cell receptor expression  and tissue distribution, and the 
regulation of innate signaling responses, which may limit translation of preclinical 
experimental findings to clinical applications. TLR expression o n antigen 
presenting cells (APCs) varies between mouse and human. In inbr ed mice, 
functional TLR8 is not expressed on APCs, whereas in humans, myeloid dendritic 
cells (mDCs) express both TLR4 and TLR8. Human plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) 
and B cells express intracellular TLR7 and TLR9, which recognize viral and 
bacterial nucleic acid s and mediate the production of type I interferon s (IFNs ). 
However , in mice, TLR7 is primarily expressed by [CONTACT_398]8 - mDCs (43) and TLR9 in 
CD8 - mDCs and in B cells (60). Less is known about how responses to TLR 
ligand stimulation compare between rhesus macaques and humans. In vitro 
stimulation studies (61) indicate that the response pattern of human and rhesus 
macaque pDCs and B cells to TRL7/8 and TLR9 is comparable, despi[INVESTIGATOR_106722]. A comprehensive evaluation 
of rhesus macaque innate responses in bloo d and draining lymph node (LN) 
following TLR agonist intradermal injection highlights the distinct signatures of 
early innate responses both locally and systemically, and provides a major step 
toward addressing species differences in recognizing TLR agonis ts now being 
used in non -human primate vaccine models and advanced to clinical studies (62). 
These insights into species differences in innate responses can influence the 
selection of suitable animal models for preclinical immunogenicity and toxicity 
studies in developi[INVESTIGATOR_106723].  
Francica and Seder performed a longitudinal analysis of adjuvant effects and HIV 
Env-specific B cell receptor (BCR) responses in rhesus macaques following Env 
protein vaccination with eight different adjuvants (63). The immunogens were 
HIV subtype  C Env gp140 ([COMPANY_001]) alone or formulated with Alum  or MF59 
with or without agonists of TLR4 or 7, or with poly IC:LC or immune stimulating 
complexes (ISCOMs ). Increased anti -Env binding titers and neutralization titers 
to tier 1A viruses were observed among the adjuvanted groups in contrast to the 
un-adjuvanted group after four immunizations; notably the Alum /TLR7, MF59 
and ANE/TLR4 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106724]. 
Moreover, the MF59, poly IC:LC and ISCOM formulations elicited marked 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 23 of 281 increases in Env -specific memory B cells after two or four immunizations, 
although these contracted by 12 weeks after the fourth immunization. Various 
adjuvant formulations did not modulate changes in overall somatic hypermutation 
levels and HCDR3  length, properties consistent with but not sufficient for 
development of bnAbs. This investigation provides an important  framework for 
assessing B cell and antibody responses with HIV vaccines that can be applied in 
preclinical and clinical models.  
An additional study by [CONTACT_106822] (64) assessed eight adjuvants 
combined with an Env gp140 immunogen to examine and compare innate 
transcriptional effects with the potency and quality of Env -specific immune 
responses  in rhesus macaques . Among the adjuvant groups assessed, the 
Alum /TLR7 and poly IC:LC adjuvants were the most potent in assays 
characterizing both Ab and cellular responses. This hierarchy of potency was 
sustained throughout the longitudinal follow up. Of note, antiviral int erferon gene 
signatures during innate timepoint s post vaccination correlated with Fc -receptor 
binding across all adjuvant groups. The study also described the impact of adding 
a TLR7 agonist to Alum , finding that the TLR7 agonist suppressed expression of 
inflammatory genes commonly seen with Alum  alone, and the combination 
enhanced upregulation of antiviral and interferon genes; the overall effect of the 
Alum /TLR combination was to boost Env binding Ab titers 3 -10-fold compared 
to Alum  alone.  
Franchini and collaborators (65-67) conducted exte nsive investigations in a rhesus 
macaque simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine challenge model to 
elucidate and validate correlates of protection associated with the mildly 
efficacious RV144 Thai trial regimen that used a recombinant canarypox vector  
(ALVAC) -SIV and gp120 formulated either in Alum  or MF59. Vaccine efficacy 
against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge was associated with Alum -induced, but 
not with MF59 -induced, Env -dependent mucosal innate lymphoid cells producing 
interleukin (IL)-17, gp120  V2-specific mucosal IgG, and activation of the R as 
pathway (65). Follow -up studies have pointed to the potential importance of 
mucosal anti -V2 antibodi es at the site of virus challenge (67) and the ability of 
vaccine -induced antibodies to inhibit infectivity of virus that it binds and captures 
(66). An additional study from the Franchini and Sekaly laboratories (68) 
evaluated various priming vectors (ALVAC, DNA, Ad26) with SIV inserts 
follow ed by [CONTACT_106823] . They  used a systems biology approach to 
determine innate and adaptive respo nses associated with protection. The authors 
found that the activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14+16 - 
monocytes, CD4 + Th2 cells with gut -homing markers and anti -V2 Abs correlated 
with reduced risk of SIV acquisition. Larger confirmatory studie s are in progress 
to understand the impact of these adjuvants and vectors on SIV protection, 
particularly at mucosal sites, which may inform future human trials with similar 
regimens. In addition, it will be important to assess some of these effects with t he 
adjuvant responses in this protocol.  
Examination of early events in vaccine antigen -adjuvant priming in animal 
models are lending insight into new methods to induce desired immunity (26, 69 -
71). Irvine and colleagues reported heightened antibody responses by [CONTACT_106824] 137  Version 5.0  / Septembe r 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 24 of 281 delivery of HIV antigens through either repeated injections or osmotic pumps 
over 1 -2 weeks (71). Exponentially increasing dosing was superior to a single full 
dose priming; findings were consistent with antigen retention in draining lymph 
nodes and expanded germinal center B and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell 
responses.  Thus, regulating the kinetics of antigen and adjuvant delivery may 
stimulate increased vaccine potency. Monitoring germinal center reactivities in 
this protocol  potentially would be useful in understanding the qualitative effects 
of various adjuvants and the potential for inducing tier [ADDRESS_118421] probing of 
germinal center responses by [CONTACT_106825][INVESTIGATOR_106725] (NHP ) studies and found that induction of neutralizing an tibodies against 
tier [ADDRESS_118422] correlated with germinal center B cell 
magnitude and Env -specific CD4+ Tfh cells (26). Furthermore, based on murine, 
NHP and human data, Havenar -Daughton and Crotty (70) found that significantly 
higher levels of plasma CXCL13 were associated with heightened germinal center 
reactivity, attesting to the potential use of CXCL13 as a biomarker  in blood to 
follow germinal center activities promoting functional antibody respons es and 
persistence. Similar sampling strategies are under evaluation in licensed vaccine 
and early phase human HIV vaccine studies and are planned in this protocol (72).  
Taken together, these animal studies support the further study of novel adjuvanted 
vaccines and their potential for advanced evaluation in clinical trials . Clearly new 
HIV vaccine -adjuvant formulations are needed to induce Abs with greater 
potency and persistence. Probing the dynamic and molecular effects of complex 
adjuvant formulations with novel HIV Env immunogens is critical for advancing 
candidate adju vanted vaccine regime ns that induce desired immune response 
profiles.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_118423] regimens, particularly as more native -like Envs may 
be re quired as booster immunogens , and they will offer the advantage of 
presenting more than one bnAb epi[INVESTIGATOR_106716]. Additional designs will include 
stabilized Env trimers expressed as DNA and in viral vectors (73). Two clinical 
trials with stabilized soluble trimers will be underway when this protocol begins, 
IAVI W001 evaluating the same BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 v accine as in this 
protocol but formulated with AS01 B, and a NIH Vaccine Research Center (VRC ) 
phase 1 study with HIVRGP096 -00-VP with Alum , a DS -SOSIP trimer.  
IAVI W001 (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) is a randomized 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation phase 1 clinical trial

diseases, no deaths, no pregnancies, no incident HIV infections, and no Grade [ADDRESS_118426] 
been discontinued from the trial.  This trial is completely enrolled and near 
completion.  
The NIH VRC has manufactured Trimer 4571, a CHO -cell line derived DS -
SOSIP.664 trimer design, and its ligand -free crystal structure reveals a soluble 
stabilized prefusion -closed Env trimer (30, 74) . This new HIV vaccine, 
designated HIVRGP096 -00-VP with Alum , is being  evaluated for safety and 
immunogenicity in [ADDRESS_118427] in human phase 1 trial 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) that began in March 2019 . The 
clinical trial evaluate d two doses of the trimer, 100 and 500 mcg, each delivered 
either IM or subcutaneous (SC).  
For HIV vaccines, MF59, a squalene -based  oil-in-water emulsion, has been 
formulated with several HIV -1 envelope proteins for extensive clinical testing and 
is presently in phase 2b efficacy evaluation (HVTN 702) in South Africa as part 
of an ALVAC/HIV vector prime and adjuvanted bivalent gp120 b oost regimen. In 
addition to AS03 and AS04, the Adjuvant System family ([COMPANY_004]) (75, 76)  includes 
two adjuvants containing monophosphoryl lipid A  (MPL ) and Quillaja saponaria  
fraction 21  (QS-21), AS01 and AS02, both of which have been evaluated in phase 
1 HIV vaccine studies (33, 77, 78) . AS01 has been formulated  with various new 
Env immunogens for clinical testing , including  the eOD -GT8 Env immunogen 
(IAVI G001) and BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140  in the IAVI W001 trial described 
above. Table 4-2 summarizes novel adjuvant formulations in HIV vaccine clinical

4.2 Trial design rationale  
4.2.1  Dose (amount and number)  
Part A: BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 admixed with adjuvants will be administered 
two times.   
• BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140: 100 mcg  
• 3M-052-AF adjuvant: 1 mcg and 5 mcg  
• Alum  adjuvant: 500 mcg ( Alum inum content)  
Part A  optional second  boost: a third administration of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp 140 
admixed with 3M-052-AF and Alum  (see below for rationale) . 
• BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140: 100 mcg  
• 3M-052-AF adjuvant: 1 mcg and 5 mcg  
• Alum  adjuvant: 500 mcg ( Alum inum content)  
HVTN studies have tested HIV Env antigen doses ranging from 20 to 600 mcg. 
The effects of adjuvants may be less pronounced  at high antigen doses , based on 
data from HVTN 041 (79) and animal studies. Therefore, 100 mcg is chosen as an 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118428] 1 and 5 mcg of 3M -052 in aqueous formulation 
(3M-052-AF) to ensure that the adjuvant is safe.  
Alum  has been used safely as an adjuvant in licensed va ccines up to 850 mcg per 
dose. The dose of 500 mcg is sufficient for adsorption of 3M -052-AF and BG505 
SOSIP.664.  
Part B: BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 admixed with adjuvants will be administered 
three times.  
• BG50 5 SOSIP.664 gp140: 100 mcg dose  
• 3M-052-AF adjuvant : 5 mcg dose  
• CpG 1018 adjuvant: 300 mcg dose  
• GLA -LSQ adjuvant: 5 mcg GLA and 2 mcg QS -21 
• Alum  adjuvant: 500 mcg ( Alum inum content)  
In the licensed HEPLISAV -B hepatitis B vaccine, 3 mg dose of CpG 1018 is 
used. The dose of 300 mcg will be used in this study, based on formulation data 
with Alum  and BG505 SOSIP.664.  
The same dose of GLA -LSQ was used in a TB vaccine study and the safety d ata 
were acceptable  (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) .  
Part C:  BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 admixed with adjuvant (Group 7) and Trimer 
4571 admixed with adjuvant  (Group 8)  will be administered [ADDRESS_118429] comparisons with the part icipants who 
were given the 100  mcg dose of the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer  in Parts A 
and B . 
• BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140: 100 -mcg dose  
• Trimer 4571 : 100 mcg -dose 
• 3M-052-AF adjuvant: 3- and 5-mcg dose  
• Alum  adjuvant: 500 mcg ( Alum inum content)

vaccination – Part A optional second boost – will be administered to participants 
who received two vaccinations at 0 and 2 months in Part  A and consent to one 
additional (third) immunization  with the same dose of protein and adjuvant .  
The schedule of vaccinations in Part B and Part C is 0, 2, and 6 months. This 
second schedule and a similar schedule 0, 1, 6 months are commonly used for 
subunit recombinant vaccines. This is the same  schedule as licensed HPV 
vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9. Hepatitis B vaccines Engerix -B and 
Recombivax HB use 0, 1, 6 month schedule. In addition, recent studies from the 
Crotty laboratory showed that immune responses in lymph nodes escalate over 3 
week s after immunization in rhesus macaques (26), suggesting that the second 
dose may better activate desirable immune responses if it is given at a later 
timepoint such as month [ADDRESS_118431] Dose to Participants in Part A : 
There are two major justifi cations for offering all participants who received two 
doses in Part A the opportunity to  receive  a third dose of the same products they 
have already received, which is also one of  the same three dose  regimen s included 
in Part B.  
First, disruptions from the  ongoing COVID -19 pandemic  allowed for an 
unanticipated  opportunity  to take a preliminary look at the immunologic response 
in participants in Part A . These data are  now available and look  extremely 
promising . Serum from 1  out of 5 participants in t he low dose adjuvant group and 
3 out of  10 participants in the high dose adjuvant group neutralized 
BG505/T332N, albeit with low titers  (see Figure 4-2 below). This  is the first 
example of vaccine elicited autologous tier [ADDRESS_118432]. 
Indeed,  3/5 participants  in the 5 -mcg dose group had high autologous tier-2 
neutralization. The 1 -mcg dose group had 1 participant (out of 3) with low -level 
neutralization, suggesting that the dose of adjuvant may matter . 
Second, delays associated with the ongoing COVID -[ADDRESS_118433] s containing 3M -052 AF.  Waiting until Part 
B is fully enrolled and data is available will take substantially more time (~18 
months) as compared to offering participants an additional boost in Part A. The 
additional boost dose was added to Part A due to a need to evaluate the 3M -052-
AF for planned future studies.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 29 of 281 Rationale for Adding  Part C: Optimization of 3M -052-AF 
A third dose of BG505  SOSIP.664  and 3M -052-AF + Alum  was offered to 
participants in Part A  (see above) . Data from participants who provided additional 
informed consent are now available and are presented in  Figure 4-2. 
 
Figure 4-[ADDRESS_118434] the autologous tier 2 
virus BG505/T332N [ADDRESS_118435] vaccination  in HVTN 137 Part A.  
The high neutralization (with maximum ID50 titers of ~8 ,000) seen in some of the 
participants in Part A  is the first time such high titers have been observed 
following vaccination  in humans  (to our knowledge) . 
The protocol team therefore desires to build on these exciting results with a goal 
of optimizing the 3M -052 AF  + Alum  for advancement of this product . 
Using the same schedule , we propose to determin e whether a 3 -mcg dose of 3M -
052 AF  + Alum  is sufficient to drive tier [ADDRESS_118436] whether the VRC trimer 4571 adjuvanted with 
3M-052 AF leads to the development of tier 2 (both autologous and heterologous)  
neutralizing  antibodies. The VRC [ADDRESS_118437] whether there is a conceptual issue with trimer 
design or, alternatively, whether the adjuvant is a critical mediator for 
neutralization, we proposed to add an arm testing whether VRC 4571 leads to 

HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 30 of 281 neutralization  of the autologous and other tier 2 viruses . This is a critical question 
for the field because it will determine whether the conceptual framework (that 
alterations in the stabilization of a trimer will lead to improved neutralization ) is 
accurate.

in rats (Covance study 8394847)  
The objective of this IND-enabling study was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 + adjuvants in rats. The study was 
conducted in rats because two adjuvants (3M -052-AF and CpG 1018) were 
deemed unlikely to enhance the immune response to the antigen in rabbits. We  
have demonstrated an active immune response in rats in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_106728]. Likewise, rats historically have been used in safety 
evaluation studies and are recommended by [CONTACT_106827].  
The animals were dosed by [CONTACT_106828] 0, 3, 6, and 9. Ten animals per 
sex per group were assigned to the main study. Five animals per sex per group 
were in the [ADDRESS_118440] comparison of the 
toxicity of each investigational vaccine , the dosing interval and recovery periods 
were identical across all adjuvanted vaccines evaluated. This also facilitated 
management of study logistics and interpretation of the study data. Repetition of 
dosing once every three weeks ensured that the animal s had sufficient time in 
between doses to recover from any potential toxic effects.  
The mixing proportion of the various experimental vaccines were identical to that 
proposed in the clinical trial in terms of concentration of BG505 SOSIP.664 
gp140 and adju vant levels used. However, the dose volume in the nonclinical 
study was limited to the maximum tolerated volume for IM injections in rats of 
0.25 mL, whereas the clinical dose volume is 0.5 mL.  
In a pre-IND technical consultation, the FDA concurred with th e study design and 
proposed in -life activities (see  Table 4-4).

HBsAg/dose and 600 mcg CpG 1018 +  4 mcg HBsAg/dose when administered by 
[CONTACT_106836] -Dawley rats once every 2  weeks over a 6 -week period 
(total of 4 doses). The studies all demonstrated acceptable safety profile of CpG

4.3.3  GLP repeat dose toxicity study of TB vaccine ID93 with adjuvant 
GLA -LSQ in rabbits (study 2416 -001) 
The objective of this study by [CONTACT_106837]93 ± GLA -LSQ adjuvant  in male and female New Zealand White 
rabbits following repeated IM administrations, and to evaluate the reversibility of 
effects after a four -week recovery period.  
Eighty rabbits were administered control article or test article for four bi -weekly 
doses, as described in Table 4-6. Half of the animals of each sex from each dose 
group were euthanized for terminal postmortem examinations approximately 48 
hours after the final dos e. The remaining animals from each dose group were 
retained and observed for a postdosing recovery period of four weeks following 
the final dose, followed by [CONTACT_106838].

All study rabbits survived to the scheduled necropsies. No treatment -related 
clinical findings or injection site reactogenicity were observed. No treatment -
related or toxicologically significant effects were observed for body weights, 
body weight changes, food consumption, body temperatures, ophthalmology, 
serum protein electrophoresis, and organ weights.  
Alterations in various clinical  pathology parameters were noted throughout the 
study and were likely attributed to treatment with the GLA -LSQ adjuvant 
component of the vaccine (with or without ID93); however, these findings were 
reversible and no longer observed near the end of the reco very period suggesting 
that these adjuvant -related findings may be of minimal toxicological significance, 
and none of these findings resulted in any limiting toxicity.

crust; mixed cell infiltrates in the subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle), right 
administrati on site (mixed cell infiltrates in the subcutaneous tissue and skeletal 
muscle), and testes (multinucleated giant cells) on Study Day 45 in groups 
receiving GLA -LSQ, ID93, and/or ID93 + GLA -LSQ. At the end of the 28 -day 
recovery period (on Study Day 71), m ost of these microscopic findings were no 
longer present or were generally decreased. Additional findings (previously not 
seen on Study Day 45) were noted in the lungs (mixed cell infiltrates), mandibular 
lymph nodes (erythrophagocytosis), stomach (mononuc lear cell infiltrates), and 
testes (multinucleated giant cells) in groups receiving GLA -LSQ, ID93, and/or 
ID93 + GLA -LSQ; these additional findings were limited to a single gender and 
were generally seen in only one treatment group.  
Repeated administration  of the ID93 + GLA -LSQ vaccine, or its components, by 
[CONTACT_106839] -tolerated as there were no treatment -related and/or 
toxicologically -significant findings noted throughout the study for most of the 
endpoints evaluated except for clinical patholog y and microscopic pathology. The 
increases in globulin, fibrinogen, blood cells (WBCs, heterophils, and 
monocytes), and microscopic findings of mixed or mononuclear cell infiltrates are 
consistent with the administration of immunogenic substances (ie, the ID93 
antigen and the GLA -LSQ adjuvant). As most of these findings were reversible 
and no longer seen near or at the end of the 28 -day recovery period (on Study Day 
71) and/or were limited to a single gender, these findings are considered to be of 
less toxi cological significance than if these findings persisted until the end of the 
recovery period and/or were seen in both sexes.  
Administration of the ID93 + GLA -LSQ vaccine or the ID93 antigen component 
alone produced appropriate IgG titers following repeated  administration. 
Immunogenicity analyses also demonstrated that total IgG titers were 
approximately 10 times  higher in rabbits receiving ID93 + GLA -LSQ compared 
to total IgG titers in rabbits receiving ID93 alone.  
4.3.4  GLP repeat dose toxicity study of flu vacc ine H5-VLP + 3M -052-SE 
adjuvant  in rats (study [ZIP_CODE])  
This study in rats was based on the intent to use 3M -052-SE adjuvant with flu 
antigen as a flu vaccine by [CONTACT_106840] . The repeat dose toxicity study in Sprague 
Dawley rats was sponsored by [CONTACT_106841] 3M -052-SE (SE – 
Stable Emulsion) was evaluated in combination with an influenza hemagglutinin 
antigen.  The highest dose of 3M -052 in the study is four times as high as the high 
dose in our tox icity study ( Covance study 8394847 ). AAHI ’s IND [ADDRESS_118454] influenza received a safe to 
proceed notification on November 29, 2017.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 39 of 281 The objective of the study was to evaluate the toxicity of influenza H5 virus like 
particle (H5 -VLP) antigen adjuvanted with 3M -052-SE, an oil -in-water emulsion 
formulation. A single dose of the H5 -VLP antigen at 20 mcg was evaluated in 
combination with 0, 2 , or 10 mcg of 3M -052-SE. Rats were dosed three times 21 
days apart. Ten rats/sex/group were allocated to the main study group an d were 
necropsied on Day 45. Five  rats/sex/group that were dosed identically were 
assigned to a [ADDRESS_118455] dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. 
In a majority of animals, the average increase in body temperature was <  1°C. 
The absolute WBC and neutrophil counts were increased while the platelets count 
was decreased in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups consequent to the 
inflammatory response at the injection site. These changes resolved by [CONTACT_106842]. Coagulation parameter changes attributed to the adjuvanted 
vaccine included increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT ) and 
fibrinogen levels that resolved by [CONTACT_106843]. 
Clinical chemistry cha nges included increases in serum globulin and total protein 
levels and decreases in albumin/globulin ( A/G) ratio which are consistent with an 
immune response to an antigen. Increased alanine aminotransferase  (ALT ) and 
aspartate aminotransferase  (AST ) levels correlated with vacuolation in the liver  
and was considered to be of minimal toxicological significance. C-reactive 
protein  (CRP) was increased in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups and was 
consistent with an acute phase respon se following vaccination.  
At Day 45 , the adjuvanted vaccine groups had antigen -specific IgG titers that 
were 10 times higher  that the group receiving the antigen alone. On a log10 scale 
the mean total IgG titer in the antigen alone and the antigen adjuvan ted groups 
were 5 and 6 respectively. An increase in spleen weight was identified in both 
sexes and correlated with increased myelopoiesis. Microscopic changes were 
noted in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. The injection site showed inflammatory 
cell infiltr ation, degeneration/necrosis and hemorrhage. An increased myeloid to 
erythroid ratio was noted in the bone marrow and was interpreted as a secondary 
response to the inflammation at the injection site. The incidence and severity of 
liver vacuolation was inc reased in the [ADDRESS_118456] was se en in one female 
administered 10 mcg of 3M -052-SE. With the exception of the mononuclear 
inflammatory cell infiltration at the injection site , all other microscopic changes 
resolved by [CONTACT_52366]. None of the toxicological findings 
were considered significant with the exception of injection site findings.

for cancer treatment  in mice  
This study was preparatory to testing 3M -052 for use in intratumoral therapy by 
3M. The m ouse was chosen as the rodent species because the antitumor efficacy 
of 3M -052 was demonstrated in mouse models. 3M -052 in a sesame oil/ethanol 
formulation was administered to mice SC once weekly over a 22 -day period (4 
total doses) at doses of 0, 1.25, 3. 75, and 6.25 mg/kg body weight. (The dose 
tested was significantly higher than the dose planned in the current BG505 
SOSIP.664 gp140 + Adjuvants study.)  In comparison, the 3M -052 dose in the 
IND-enabling rat study ( Covance 8394847 ) is in the range of 0.008  mg/kg body 
weight, more than 100-fold lower than the low dose in the mice study.   
Dose sites were rotated weekly among left and right dorsoscapular and 
dorsolumbar sites. Necropsies were performed the day following the last dose. 
Additional animals were i ncluded in the 0 and 6.25 mg/kg dose groups to assess 
reversibility of treatment effects; these animals were necropsied [ADDRESS_118457] dose.  
Effects at the injection site were observed in mice following SC administration. 
Scabbing occurred at a sim ilar incidence in all groups, as did the microscopic 
finding of granulomatous inflammation. Microscopic findings of epi[INVESTIGATOR_106730], necrosis, exudate, and ulceration occurred exclusively or at much 
greater incidence in the 3M -052–treated mouse grou ps versus the control group.  
One female in the 6.25 mg/kg group was found dead [ADDRESS_118458] article -relate d changes occurred in serum protein, 
RBC, and WBC parameters in all 3M -052–treated male groups. Changes in these 
parameters were consistent with 3M -[ADDRESS_118459] article -related effects on organ weights at the end of treatment included 
higher liver and spleen weights or weight ratios in all 3M -052–treated male and 
female groups. The increased spleen weights correlated to microscopic findings of 
extramed ullary hematopoiesis (EMH) and mild lymphoid hyperplasia. Both EMH 
and lymphoid hyperplasia were consistent with the pharmacologic effects of 
3M-052. The degree of EMH and lymphoid hyperplasia were not considered 
adverse. There were no histologic correlate s to the liver weight changes.  
At necropsy at the end of treatment, grossly enlarged lymph nodes were noted in 
all 3M -052–treated male and female groups. The lymphoid hypercellularity was 
consistent with 3M -052 pharmacologic activity and was not considered  adverse.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 41 of 281 There were no 3M -052–related changes in body weights, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, or coagulation parameters either at the end of treatment or at the 
end of the 14 -day recovery period.  
Many of the toxicities reported in this repeat dose stud y might not be relevant 
from a clinical perspective since the 3M -052 in this study will be given much 
lower dose levels (1 or 5  mcg total dose; maximum approximately 0.000025 to 
0.000125mg/kg for a 40 kg participant or ~1/10,[ADDRESS_118460] dose administere d 
in this mouse study)  and at greater intervals . 
4.3.6  GLP repeat dose toxicity study of 3M -052 in sesame oil formulation 
for cancer treatment  in cynomolgus monkeys  
This study was preparatory to testing 3M -052 for use in intratumoral therapy by 
3M. 3M-052 in a sesame oil/ethanol formulation was administered to cynomolgus 
monkeys (5/sex/group) by [CONTACT_106844] a 22 -day period (4 total 
doses) at doses of 0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg body weight. The dose s tested w ere 
significantly higher than the dose planned in the current BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 
+ Adjuvants study.  In comparison, the 3M -052 dose in the IND -enabling rat study 
(Covance 8394847 ) is in the range of 0.008 mg/kg body weight, more than 100-
fold lower than the  low dose (1.25 mg/kg) in the cynomolgus monkey study.   
There were no deaths during the study. Compared with the control group, 
inappetence was noted more frequently in the 3M -052 groups and was noted in 
the recovery phase as well as the treatment phase. D uring the recovery period, all 
3M-052–treated groups gained weight. Body temperatures measured [ADDRESS_118461] 
dose were statistically significantly increased in all 3M -052 male groups (but not 
in females), and in most individual animals  the temperatures exceed ed laboratory 
historical control values. Body temperatures were within normal range when 
measured during the recovery period.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, clinical signs of swelling and sores, and microscopic 
findings of ulceration occurred at greater incidence and/or severity at the injection 
sites of the 3M -052–treated groups versus the control group. The control and 3M -
052 groups showed similar incidence of adipose tissue necrosis, ulceration, and 
(at recovery) dermal scar tissue formation. Clinical signs of d ischarge, and 
microscopic findings of inflammatory cells at the injection site, occ urred 
exclusively in the 3M -052–treated cynomolgus monkey groups. The discharge 
was usually described as purulent and persisted into the recovery phase. The 
inflammatory cel l population changed over time, being primarily neutrophils at 
the end of dosing and predominantly lymphocytes at the end of the recovery 
period. These findings were considered adverse.  
Test article -related hematology changes occurred in all 3M -052 groups.  These 
changes were frequently statistically significant and/or outside of laboratory 
historic control values. Generally, the severity of effects was similar in the mid 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 42 of 281 and high doses, which in turn were slightly more severe than the low dose effects. 
None  of the hematology changes were considered adverse.  
Serum protein changes occurred in all 3M -052 groups. These changes were 
frequently statistically significant and/or outside of laboratory historic control 
values. Generally, the severity of effects was si milar in the mid and high doses, 
which in turn were slightly more severe than the low dose effects. The changes in 
serum proteins were not considered adverse.  
Changes in serum chemistry parameters were observed only in the 3M -052 male 
groups. At the end of  the recovery period, all of these parameters were 
comparable to the vehicle control. Based on reversibility of the findings, these 
changes were not considered adverse.  
At necropsy at the end of treatment, there were multiple organ changes in all 3M -
052 tr eated male and female groups, manifested as changes in organ weights 
and/or histology. None of the inflammatory/mononuclear infiltrates were 
considered to cause injury or functional impairment. Thymus changes were 
considered to be related to an indirect, s tress-related effect of 3M -052. At the 
recovery necropsy, the histologic changes appeared to be resolving.

SOSOP.664 gp140 -specific binding antibody titers were measured on day 43. The 
results indicated th at BG505 SOSOP.664 gp140 were immunogenic in rats, and 
the magnitude of the binding antibody responses varied depending on the 
adjuvants ( Figure 4-7). Little  neutralizing antibody response to the autologous tier 
2 virus BG505 T332N  was observed but t he binding antibody results assured us 
that rat is the appropriate model for toxicity study.

been reported extensively in the literature. However, it was considered  that rabbits 
may not respond to adjuvants that are TLR7/8 or TLR9 agonists (3M -052 and 
CpG 1018). This study will bridge past studies and will also compare several 
additional TLR4 agonists ( Table 4-10).

The obje ctive of this study, CAVD 641, was to assess the immunogenicity of 
BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 with 3M -052-Alum  adjuvant by [CONTACT_106851], in 
comparison to GLA -LSQ adjuvant, in rhesus macaques. The study was conducted 
by [CONTACT_106852]’s lab at Emory Universit y. 3M-052-Alum  was prepared by 
[CONTACT_44647] 3M -052-AF with Alum  and vialed.  
The groups are specified in Table 4-11. At each immunization, two sites (left and 
right leg quadrice ps) were injected, 30 mcg of 3M -052-Alum  at each site for a 
total dose of 60 mcg. Animals were immunized at weeks 0, 8, and 24.

In the VRC01 8 trial, Trimer -4571 –specific antibody titers in serum samples were 
measured by [CONTACT_106853] (ECLIA) using a Meso Scale Discovery 
(MSD) platform at baseline and at [ADDRESS_118475] admin istration. 
Both the 100 -mcg (n = 3) and 500 -mcg (n = 5)  IM and SC  doses elicited Trimer -
4571 –specific antibodies, with geometric mean AUCs 8 - fold and 40 -fold over 
background, respectively. No tier -2 neutralizing activity was observed.

derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and CpG 1018. HEPLISAV is a 
sterile liquid dosage form that is administered as an IM injection.  The CpG 1018 
in HEPLISAV is a synthetic 22 -mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (PS 
ODN) containing an immunostimulatory sequence that is an agonist for Toll -like 
receptor 9. The desired biological activity of CpG 1018 is to enhance the 
generation of antibodies to HBsAg by [CONTACT_106854] -stranded viral and bacterial DNA. HEPLISAV is administered as a 
single dose of 0.5 mL, containing 20 mcg HBsAg and 3000 mcg CpG 1018.  
Cumulatively, 10,049 subjects (10,038 subjects 18 years of age  and older and 11 
subjects below 18 years old) and [ADDRESS_118477] received  HEPLISAV in clinical trials . Before it 
was approved by [CONTACT_1622], that vaccine was tested in more than 9500 people . 
HEPLISAV appeared to be well tolerated in clinical trials in healthy adults. The 
reactogenicity profile of HEPLISAV is similar to Engerix -B (a non -adjuvanted 
HBV vaccine) in time course and severity. Compared with Engerix -B, 
HEPLISAV caused more local reac tions and fewer systemic reactions. Common 
adverse events (AEs) determined by [CONTACT_106855], headache, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, fatigue, 
diarrhea, nausea, injection site swelling, back pain, injec tion site hematoma, 
injection site pain, pain in extremity, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, 
postprocedural hematoma, arthralgia, injection site pruritus , and increased white 
blood cell count. SAEs, autoimmune adverse events, and deaths have been 
infrequent in the HEPLISAV clinical program. One SAE of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis (also called granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA]) has been 
reported in a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106734]; this event was considered by [CONTACT_106856] (82). In one randomized, observer -
blind, active -controlled, multicenter study in the [LOCATION_002] in which [ADDRESS_118478] 1 dose of En gerix -B, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was 
reported in 0.25% (n  = 14) of HEPLISAV -B recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 0.04% (n  = 1) of 
Engerix -B recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Additional evidence, including information on temporal 
relationship and baseline risk factors, does not support a causal relationship 
between HEPLISAV -B administration and AMI.  No deaths have been considered 
by [CONTACT_106857].

pyrexia, fatigue, decreased lymphocyte count, chills, nausea, arthralgia, and 
injection site pain (83). Based on this safety record,  the 37 mcg dose of 3M -052 
was defined as the maximum tolerated dose for this study.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 53 of 281 One patient with Stage IV recurrent anal squamous cell carcinoma died following 
a second round of int rahepatic tumoral injection of 12mcg 3M -052 plus IV 
durvAlum ab. Two weeks prior, per -protocol liver biopsy performed demonstrated 
necrotic metastatic lesions. This death could not be attributed to a specific cause 
(autopsy and post -mortem CT scan were not performed). However, the study 
investigator considered the event to be related to 3M -052 and the study procedure. 
Medimmune, the trial sponsor, informed the FDA that this event was potentially 
related to hemorrhagic shock due to a ruptured liver metastasis . The FDA 
required protocol alterations prohibiting injection of deep -seated lesions before 
allowing continuation of the clinical trial.

SOSIP.664 gp140 with 3M -052-AF at 2 doses, including 1 mcg (Group 1) and 5 
mcg (Group 2), both combined with 500 -mcg Alum . The study is ongoing and 
remains blinded to within -group treatment assignment. As of October 18, 2021, 
both the 1 -mcg 3M -052-AF group (6 participants total ; 5 receiving 
protein/adjuvant, 1 receiving placebo) and the 5 -mcg 3M -052-AF group (11 
participants total ; 10 receiving protein/adjuvant, 1 receiving placebo) completed 
enrollment. Part A of the initial protocol specified that participants in Groups 1 
and 2 would receive 2 total doses, 1 at month zero and the other at month two.  
Five out of 6 participants received 2 doses of the 1 -mcg dose ( 1 participant 
discontinued for reasons unrelated  to vaccination) and 10 out of 11 participants 
received 2 doses of the 5 -mcg dose. One participant in the 5 -mcg dose group 
(Group 2) decided to discontinue vaccination due to Grade -3 induration/erythema 
first noted on Day 8 postvaccination. The maximum size of both the induration 
and erythema was measured at 17 x 17 cm on Day 8 (Grade 3). The erythema 
resolved over 3 days and the induration subsided to less than 5 cm on Day 11 
(Grade  1). The induration was measured at [ADDRESS_118489]  injection. At no point was the 
pain/tenderness greater than mild , and the participant continued to work. It is 
unknown at present whether this particip ant received placebo or study product. 
Another participant in Group [ADDRESS_118490] dose for 3 total doses. Nine  (out of 17) participants 
elected to receive a third dose. There were no unsolicited Grade -[ADDRESS_118491] dose . Both local 
and systemic reactogenicity were similar between all 3 doses in participants who 
received 3 doses  in Part A .

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 66 of 281 6 Statisti cal considerations  
6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target enrolling 127 healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants; 
115 vaccinees and 12 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Part A is a dose -escalation study; two doses of the 3M -052-AF adjuvant will be 
studied in 17 participants (5 vaccinees and 1 placebo in the low -dose group; 10 
vaccinees and 1 placebo in the higher dose group). Enrollment to the higher dose 
group will be tr iggered when safety in the lower dose group is deemed acceptable . 
Part B is the adjuvant comparison study; 88 participants will be randomized to 
one of four groups, with 20 participants randomized to vaccine and 2 to placebo 
within each group. Section 11.3.2  of the protocol describes the criteria for 
advancing to Part B based on the Part A data.  Part C augments Part B with data on 
a “medium ” dose of the 3M-052 adjuvant (3  mcg as compared to 5  mcg studied in 
Part B)  and with data on a next -generation BG505 trimer (Trimer 4571 v ersus  
BG505 SOSIP.664 studied in Part B ). The s ample -size rationale is described 
separately for Parts A, B, and C.  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first study vaccination, all 
participants will provide some safety data. However, for immunogenicity 
analyses, it is possible that data may be missing for various reasons, such as 
participants terminating from the study early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], 
low cell viability of proces sed PBMCs or high assay background. 
Immunogenicity data from 17 phase 1 and 2 phase 2a HVTN vaccine trials, which 
began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of September 2014), indicate that 10% is 
a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data at Month 2.5 and 6.5, and 15% 
is a reasonable estimate at Month 18. For this reason, the sample size calculations 
in Section 6.1.3  account for 10% and 15% of en rolled participants having missing 
data for the primary immunogenicity and durability endpoints, respectively.  
6.1.1  Sample size calculations for safety (Part A)  
The purpose of Part A is to select the 3M -052-AF adjuvant dose, by [CONTACT_106860]. The ability of 
the study to detect SAEs (see Section 11.2.3 ) can be expressed by [CONTACT_106861] 1 SAE would likely be observed and the true event rate 
below which no events would likely be observed. Specifically, for the low -dose 
vaccine arm (n = 5), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true 
rate of suc h an event is 37% or more; and there is a t least a  90% chance of 
observing no events if the true rate is 1% or less. For the high -dose vaccine arm (n 
= 10), there is a t least a  90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of 
such an event is 2 1% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if 
the true rate is 1% or less. For the two vaccine arms combined (n = 15), there is a t 
least a  90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 67 of 281 14.3% or more; there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 
0.5% or less. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials from April  2008 through 
March  2018 , about 1.74% of participants who received placebos experienced an 
SAE.  
Binomial probabilities of observing 0,  1 or more, and 2 or more events among 
arms of size 5 and 10 are presented in Table 6-1 for a range of possible true 
adverse event rates. These calculations provide a more  complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_106740] A study design to identify potential safety problems with 
the 3M -052-AF–adjuvanted vaccine.

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for safety (Part B)  
The goal of the safety evaluation for Part B of this study is to identify safety 
concerns associated with administration of one or more vaccine regimens. 
Specifically, for each vaccine arm of Part B  (n = 20), there is a 90% chance of 
observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 11% or  more; and 
there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.5% or less. For 
the four vaccine arms combined (n = 80), there is a 90% chance of observing at 
least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 2.9% or more; and there is a 90%  
chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.1% or less.  
Binomial probabilities of observing 0, 1 or more, and 2 or more events among 
arms of size 20 and 80 are presented in Table 6-2 for a range of possible true 
adverse event rates. These calculations provide a more complet e pi[INVESTIGATOR_106740] B study design to identify potential safety problems with the 
four vaccine regimens.

[ADDRESS_118514] of describing the statistical properties of the study design is in 
terms of the 95% confidence interval for the true rate of an adverse event based 
on the observed data. Table 6-3 shows the 2 -sided 9 5% confidence intervals for 
the probability of an event based on a particular observed rate. Calculations are 
done using the score test method (84). If none of the 80 participants receiving a 
vaccine regimen experience a safety event, the 95% 2 -sided upper confidence 
bound for the true rate of such events in the total vaccinated population is 4.6%. 
For each individual vaccine arm (n = 20), the 2 -sided upper confidence bound for 
this rate is 16.1%.

6.1.3  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity (Part B)  
Immunogenicity sample size calculations allow for a 10% rate of missing 
immunogenicity data at Month 2.5 and 6.5 (n = 18 for analysis) and 15% rate of 
missing immunogenicity data at Months 12 and 18 (n = 17 for analysis).  
The first goal  is to evaluate  immune response rates based on data from the 
primary TZM -bl neutralizing antibody assay  among vaccinees. The precision with 
which the true response rate can be estimated from the observed data depends on 
the true underlying response rate and the sample size. Two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals for the response rate based on observing a particular rate of responses in 
the vaccinees is shown in Table 6-4. Calculat ions are done using the score test 
method (84).

As shown in  Table 6-5, there is limited power for a formal comparison of 
immunogenicity r esponse rates between vaccine arms of size n = 20. For either 
80% or 90% power, the sizes of differences that the trial is powered to detect are 
large. These calculations use a Fisher’s exact [ADDRESS_118515] the differences seen 
in the CAVD 641  study in rhesus macaques led by [CONTACT_106852]. Rates of 
autologous tier 2 neutralizing antibody responses at week 26 (the peak timepoint ) 
were compared between arms with Alum -3M-052 or  GLA -LSQ adjuvant, both 
with BG505 -SOSIP protein. The large difference in response rates —50% vs. 
100%—could be detected with 9 7% power.

detect the difference in geometric mean immune response seen in the HEPLISAV 
study at Week 28 (the peak timepoint ) (79.7 mIU /mL vs. 206.1  mIU/mL),

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 70 of 281 In addition, “generic” power calculations inform the power of the study to 
compare immune response magnitudes between arms. These presume a 
continuous immune response, transformed to a [ADDRESS_118519] deviation scale, and a 
mean shift in scaled immune response between arms. Table 6-6 shows the power 
for comparing immune responses between pairs of arms with different adjuvants, 
separately at Months 2.5 and 6.5 (n = 18 per arm) and Months 12 or 18 (durability

1-standard deviation differences in immune responses between adjuvants at the 
early timepoints and 1.[ADDRESS_118520] deviation in the 
two arms. To allow for missing immunogenicity data, analyses include 17 or 18 subjects in each

The goal of the safety evaluation for Part C of this study is to identify safety 
concerns associated with administration of 1 or more vaccine regimens  studied in 
Part C . Specifically, for each vaccine arm of Part C (n = 10), there is a 90% 
chance of observ ing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 20.6% or 
more and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 1% or 
less. 
Binomial probabilities of observing 0  events , 1 or more  events , and 2 or more 
events among arms of size  10 are presented in Table 6-8 for a range of possible 
true adverse event rates. These calculations provide a more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_106741] C study design to identify potential safety problems with

6.2 Randomization  
A participant’s randomization assignment will be computer generated and 
provided to the HVTN CRS pharmacist through a Web -based randomization 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118526] with primary responsibility for dispensing study products is charged 
with maintaining security of the treatment assignments (except in emergency 
situations as specified in the HVTN Manual of Operations [MOP ]). 
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to 
treatment arm assignments (ie, vaccine vs placebo) throughout the trial. In 
addition , in Part B , participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be 
blinded to partic ipant group assignments as well . Study product assignments are 
accessible to those HVTN CRS  pharmacists, DAIDS protocol pharmacists and 
contract monitors, and SDMC staff who are required to know this information in 
order to ensure proper trial conduct. Any  discussion of study product assignment 
between pharmacy staff and any other HVTN CRS staff is prohibited. The HVTN 
SMB members also are unblinded to treatment assignment in order to conduct 
review of trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prio r to study completion, the participant will 
be told he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her 
treatment assignment.  
In some cases, the CRS, PSRT, or study sponsor may believe unblinding of the 
site Principal Investigator  (PI) and participant would be appropriate to facilitate 
the clinical management of an AE or SAE. The HVTN Unblinding MOP specifies 
procedures for emergency unblinding, and for early unblinding for medical 
reasons.  
6.4 Statistical analyses  
This section describ es the final study analyses, unblinded as to treatment arm 
assignment. All data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according to the 
initial randomization assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a par ticipant receives the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccination time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. Analyses are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enroll ed do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because of blinding and the brief length of time between 
randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 working days —very 
few such individuals are expected.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022

No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity 
assays, as discussed below, when the assay endpoint is viewed as a collection of 
hypotheses (eg, testing multiple peptide pools to d etermine a positive response).

immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106862]. For a given sign o r symptom, 
each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum 
severity for all injection visits. In addition, to the individual types of events, the 
maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, and of 
systemic  symptoms will be calculated. Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to test for 
differences in severity between arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ) System Organ Class and preferred terms. Tables  will show by 
[CONTACT_106863] a System Organ Class or within preferred term category by [CONTACT_106864]. For the calculations in these tables, a participant 
with multiple AEs within a category will be counted once under the maximum 
severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship to study product. Formal 
statistical testing comparing arms is not planned since interpretation of the 
magnitude of differences mu st rely heavily upon clinical judgment.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 75 of 281 A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study product, time between onset and last vaccination, and  number of 
vaccinations received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local laboratory values  
Box plots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for 
values measured during the course of the study by [CONTACT_31703]. Each 
box plot will show the first quar tile, the median, and the third quartile. Outliers 
(values outside the box plot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines 
representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by 
[CONTACT_106865], as well as changes from baseline for postenrollment 
values. In addition, the number (percentage) of participants with local laboratory 
values recorded as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as specified in the 
Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events (see Section 11.2.2 ) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106866] e ach 
postvaccination timepoint. Reportable clinical laboratory abnormalities without an 
associated clinical diagnosis will also be included in the tabulation of AEs 
described above.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The num ber and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106867].  
6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enr olled 
participants will be used according to the initial randomization assignment 
regardless of how many injections they received. Additional analyses may be 
performed, limited to participants who received all scheduled injections per 
protocol. Assay resul ts that are unreliable, from specimens collected outside of 
the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants postinfection are excluded. 
Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay data from blood 
draws 4 weeks prior to an infected parti cipant’s last seronegative sample and 
thereafter may be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a 
seronegative sample postenrollment, then all data from that participant may be 
excluded from the analysis.  
Data from placebo arms will be poole d across groups (n = 8 for analysis  in Part 
B). For analyses of immunogenicity after the second vaccination, data on the 3M-
052-AF from Part A (with the MTD of the 3M-052-AF) and Part B will be 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 76 of 281 pooled. Otherwise, analyses of immunogenicity will be performed separately for 
Part A and Part B participants.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints (eg, response rates) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_106868]. Crude 
response rates will be presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interval 
estimates calculated using the score test method (84). Because of the small 
numbers of control participants in each group, no adjustment will be made to the 
vaccine arm estimates for the false positive rates  (FPRs)  in the control arms. 
Barnard or Fisher’s exact tests, as specified in the SAP, will be used to compare 
the response rates of any  2 vaccine arms, with a significant difference declared if 
the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 0.05. In general Barnard’s is preferred since under most 
circumstances it is more powerful than Fisher’s (85).  
For quantitative assay data (eg, percentage of positive cells from ICS assay), 
graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions by [CONTACT_488], treatment arm, 
and timepoint will be made. For all primary and secondary immunogenicity 
endpoint s, box plots and plots of estimated reverse cumulative distribution curves 
will be used for graphical display of all of the study arms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the results 
will be shown for each vaccine arm and for the pooled placebo group.  
The difference between arms  at a specific timepoint will be tested with a 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test if the data are not normally distributed and 
with a [ADDRESS_118529] Hodges -
Lehmann point estimates and 2 -sided (1 -0.05/6) × 100% confidence intervals  
(CIs) about the differences in location centers of the 6 pair -wise comparisons of 
vaccine arms. If actual -value tests are used then the Dunnett’s procedure will be 
used to construct simultaneous confidence intervals about the pairs of mean 
differences for the many -to-one comparisons (86) when multiple vaccine arms are 
each compared with the  pooled placebo group. Given that all pair -wise 
comparisons between the multiple vaccine arms are of interest, the Tukey 
procedure (87) will be used. An appropriate data transformation (eg, log 10 
transformation) may be applied to better satisfy assumptions of symmetry and 
homoscedasticity (constant variance). Significan ce of the differences between 
pairs will be evaluated using two procedures, first based on whether the 
simultaneous 95% CIs exclude zero and secondly based on whether the nominal 
(unadjusted) 95% CIs exclude zero.  
Some immunologic assays have underlying c ontinuous or count -type readout that 
are dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categories (eg, intracellular 
cytokine staining). If treatment arm differences for these assays are best 
summarized by a mixture model, then either Lachenbruch’s test statist ic (88) or 
an alterna tive two -part test (89) (as defined in the SAP) will be used to evaluate 
the composite null hypothesis of equa l response rates in the 2 arms and equal 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 77 of 281 response distributions. Lachenbruch’s test statistic equals the square of a binomial 
Z-statistic for comparing the response rates plus the square of a Wilcoxon statistic 
for comparing the response distributions in t he subgroup of responders. A 
permutation procedure is used to obtain a 2 -sided p -value. For estimation, 
differences in response rates between arms will be estimated using the methods 
described above, and in the subgroup of positive responders, differences in 
location parameters between arms will be estimated using the methods described 
above.  
More sophisticated analyses employing repeated measures methodology (for 
example, linear mixed models or marginal mean models fit by [CONTACT_106869])  will be utilized to incorporate immune responses over 
several timepoints and to test for differences over time  and differences in 
trajectories across treatment arms . For example, repeated measures analyses will 
be conducted to evaluate trajectories in innate immune responses over Days 1, 3, 
7 relative to responses measured at Day 0. However, inference from such analyses 
would be limited by [CONTACT_106870]. All statistical tests will be 
2-sided and will be considered statistically significant if p   0.05.  
Based upon previous HVTN trials, missing 10% of immunogenicity results for a 
specific assay is common due to study participants terminating from the  study 
early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], or low cell viability of processed PBMCs. 
To achieve unbiased statistical estimation and inferences with standard methods 
applied in a complete -case manner (only including participants with observed data 
in the  analysis), missing data need to be missing completely at random (MCAR). 
Following the most commonly used definition, MCAR assumes that the 
probability of an observation being missing does not depend on any participant 
characteristics (observed or unobserv ed). When missing data are minimal 
(specifically if no more than 20% of participants are missing any values), then 
standard complete -case methods will be used, because violations of the MCAR 
assumption will have little impact on the estimates and hypothesi s tests.  
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data are missing for an endpoint (at 
least 1 value missing from more than 20% of participants), then using the methods 
that require the MCAR assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, 
analyses of the immunogenicity endpoints at a specific timepoint will be 
performed using parametric generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_54683]. 
These methods provide unbiased estimation and inferences under the parametric 
modeling assumptions and the assumption that the missing data are missing at 
random (MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an observation being 
missing may depend upon the observed responses and upon observed covariates, 
but not upon any unobserved factors. Generalized linear mode ls for response rates 
will use a binomial error distribution and for quantitative endpoints, a normal 
error distribution. For evaluating  repeated immunogenicity measurement s over 
time, linear mixed effects models will be used.  If the immunological outcomes  are 
left- and/or right - censored, then the linear mixed effects models of Hughes (90) 
will be used, because they accommodate the censoring . In addition, secondary 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 78 of 281 analyses of repeated immunogenicity measurements may be done using weighted 
generalized estimating equation (GEE ) (91) methods, which are valid under 
MAR. All of the models described above in this paragraph will include as 
covariates all available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes.  
Some immunogenicity endpoints are only measured in subset of participants. For 
example, fine needle lymph node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], and 
leukapheresis will be performed only on participants consenting to these optional 
procedures , and immunogenici ty endpoints based on these samples will only exist 
for those participants. For such endpoints, exploratory analyses will be conducted 
to assess the correlation of participant characteristics measured in (nearly) all 
participants with the resource -intensiv e endpoints. For example, if the same assay 
is performed on blood and fine needle lymph node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26594], then a 
scatterplot and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r) will be used to assess the 
correlation of responses. If at least moderate correl ations exist (eg, r ≥ 0.3), then 
the semiparametric efficient analysis method of Rotnitzky and Robins (92) will be 
used (described in Gilbert, Sato et al. for application to vaccine studies (93)) to 
estimate the mean of the resource -intensive endpoint for each group and to 
compare means between groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multivariate display of immunogenicity endpoints  
Data visualization techniques may be used to explore the relationship among 
immunogenicity readouts  across assays, and across readouts for assays that 
produce high dimensional data . The  set of readouts may be based on one of the 
primary endpoints (eg, neut ralizing Abs), on the set of primary endpoints, or on 
immunogenicity endpoints that also include secondary or exploratory endpoints. 
To understand the relationship between pairs of readouts, scatter plots may be 
used when the number of readouts is small or  for a larger number of readouts, a 
heatmap showing the degree of correlation between any two pairs. Principal 
component analysis (PCA) and associated ‘biplots’ of the scores and loadings are 
particularly useful to understand associations between readouts,  especially when 
readouts are correlated (94). PCA is a method to reduce the dimensionality of the 
number of readouts to a smaller set of values (principal components) that are 
norm alized linear combinations of the readouts in such a way that the first 
principal component accounts for the most variability in the data and subsequent 
components, while maximizing variability, are uncorrelated with each other. A 
‘biplot’ displays the fir st and second principal component scores and principal 
component loadings. The x -axis is the value from the first principal component 
and the y -axis is the second principal component, where each axis label includes 
the percentage of variation in the total set of readouts captured by [CONTACT_106871]. The top axis is the first principal component loadings and the right 
axis is the second principal component loadings. An arrow is drawn for each 
immunogenicity readout (eg, Env -specific CD4+ T cell polyf unctionality score) 
from the origin to the point defined by [CONTACT_106872]. 
The length of the arrow represents the amount of total variation of the set of 
readouts captured by [CONTACT_106873]. The direction of an arrow conveys  the 
extent to which the variation of a readout is in the direction of the first or second 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118530] 
correlatio n and a 90 degree angle denoting no correlation. Each arrow on the 
biplot is labeled by [CONTACT_106874]. A biplot is 
annotated with key meta -information such as the treatment arm (most common 
application) or a demographic category.  Depending on the application, K -means 
clustering and hierarchical clustering may also be applied for multivariate 
graphical display of immunogenicity readouts.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary analyses of neutralization data  
The primary measure of antibody neutralization is the response to the vaccine -
matched BG505.T332N isolate. As well, responses to a single highly 
neutralization -sensitive tier 1 virus (MW965.26) will be assessed. The mean 
magnitude of the response to the vaccine -matched isolate will be estimated for 
each arm a nd compared to the pooled placebo group. As well, the ratio of the 
response to the vaccine -matched antigen, relative to that to the neutralization -
sensitive isolate, will be estimated for each arm.  
If a tier 2 panel of viral isolates is used to assess the breadth of neutralizing 
antibody responses, the area -under -the-magnitude -breadth curve (AUC -MB) to a 
global panel of viral isolates (14) will be computed for each participant with 
evaluable neutralization data, as described in (95). 95% CIs about the four 
differences in mean AUC -MB for each vaccine regimen versus the pooled 
placebo groups (vaccine – placebo), will be calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of CD4+ T  cell response s as measured by [CONTACT_106875]4+ T  cell response rates as measured by [CONTACT_106876]. For each T  cell 
subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool will include a multiple comparison 
adjustment for the number of peptide pools used in the assay. In general, the 
Mixture Models for Single -cell Assays (MIMOSA) statistical framework (96) 
and/or the Fisher’s exact test -based positivity criteria will be used. Details of the 
positivity criteria will be discussed in the SAP. The magnitude of marginal 
response will be analyzed as described for quantitative data in the general 
approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will be used to display the 
background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant b y protein, treatment arm 
and timepoint. When 3 or more cytokines are being measured by [CONTACT_106877], 
the polyfunctionality of ICS responses may also be analyzed as an exploratory 
endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional respo nses, 
the COMPASS ( Com binatorial Polyfunctionality analysis of Antigen -Specific T -
cell Subsets) statistical framework (97) may also be used to perform joint 
modelling of multiple T -cell subsets of different cytoki ne combinations. For 
example, the functionality score (FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) may 
be used to summarize the multi -parameter ICS responses.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of multiplexed immunoassay data  
When a small panel of analytes (eg, ≤ 5) is being assessed in a multiplexed 
immunoassay, the analysis of response rates and response magnitudes will be 
evaluated and c ompared as described under the general approach. Details for 
calculating a positive response and response magnitude will be provided in the 
SAP. When a larger panel is being assessed, [ADDRESS_118531], Magnitude –Breadth 
(M-B) curves maybe employed to display individual - and group -level response 
breadth as a function of magnitude. Applied to tier 2 virus neutralizing antibody 
data, response breadth is defined as the number of isola tes with magnitude above 
a positivity threshold. Two choices are to compare the M -B curves among vaccine 
arms, as follows: a non -parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test on the subject -specific 
AUC -MB or a Kolmogorov -Smirnov type test on the [ADDRESS_118532], machine -learning approaches such as super -
learning (98) will be employed which achieve the goal of reducing the 
dimensionality of the assay readouts an d simultaneously identifying individual 
responses and groups of responses that differ between treatment groups or over 
time. Details of either approach will be described in the SAP .  
6.4.5  Analyses and data sharing prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by [CONTACT_106880] a need to know basis in accordance with Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Interim blinded safety and immunogenicity data should not be shared outside of

designee(s) for their regulatory reporting unless approved by [CONTACT_106881].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety ana lyses  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every [ADDRESS_118534] of the HVTN 137  PSRT. Refer to the process described in the 
HVTN Unblinding MOP for any requests for unblinded  safety data prior to the 
end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunogenicity analyses  
An unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a primary 
immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all participants have 
completed the corresponding primary immunogenicity visit and data are available 
for analysis from at least 80% of these participants. Similarly, an unblinded 
statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a secondary or exploratory 
immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all p articipants have 
completed the corresponding immunogenicity visit and data are available for 
analysis from at least 80% of these participants. However, such analyses for a 
secondary or exploratory immunogenicity endpoint will only take place after the 
prim ary immunogenicity endpoint (neutralizing antibody response) reaches the 
aforementioned threshold. The Laboratory Center  will review the analysis report 
prior to distribution to the protocol chairs, DAIDS, study product developer, and 
other key HVTN member s and investigators. Reports for distribution or 
presentation should use PubIDs and not participant ID (PTIDs ) for individual 
responses. Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a need to know for 
the purpose of informing future trial -related decisions. The HVTN leadership 
must approve any other requests for HVTN immunogenicity analyses prior to the 
end of the scheduled follow -up visits.

7.3 Eligibility  for optional procedures  
Eligibility  requirements for optional procedures  are listed in Section 9.5. 
7.4 Participant departure from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the study product 
administration schedule. Pause rules for the t rial are described in Section 11.4. 
7.4.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not 
limited to the following:  
• Within 45 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin  
• Within 30 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of live a ttenuated vaccines  
▪ Receipt of allergy treatment with antigen injections

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 90 of 281 • Prevaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask 
assessment of vaccine reaction.  
Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period  (see 
Appendix W ). 
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who 
plan to rece ive licensed vaccines or allergy treatments should be counseled to 
schedule receipt of these substances, when possible, outside the intervals 
indicated above. The effects of these substances on safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions w ith study vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if 
circumstances allow, these substances should also be avoided in the interval 
between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 or 3 -week postvaccination 
follow -up visit.  
7.4.2  Participant departure from vaccination  schedule  
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. 
If a participant misses a vaccination and the visit window period for the 
vaccination has passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should 
be asked t o continue study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination 
schedule with the next vaccination unless there are circumstances that require 
further delay or permanent discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.4.1  and 
7.4.3 ).  
7.4.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain circ umstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be 
permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
• Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
exception s allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 137  PSRT)  
• Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system 
or for which continued vaccinations and/or blood draws may pose additional 
risk), including but not limited to the following:  
▪ Pregnancy (regardless of outcome)  Vaccinations will be stopped while a 
participant is pregnant. If the participant is no longer pregnant and can be 
vacci nated within an appropriate visit window, vaccinations may resume  
▪ HIV infection  
▪ Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or 
AE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 91 of 281 ▪ Any grade 3 lab abnormality that is su bsequently considered to be related 
to vaccination  
▪ Other grade 3 clinical AE that is subsequently considered to be related to 
vaccination with the exception of fever, and subjective local and systemic 
symptoms. For grade 3 injection site erythema and/or i nduration, upon 
review, the PSRT may allow continuation of vaccination  
▪ SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
▪ Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associated with 
study vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 137  PSRT is required 
prior to subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity 
reaction associated with study vaccination  
• Investigator determination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, 
for repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions)  
Participants discontinuing study product for reasons other than HIV infection 
should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the study and strongly 
encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protoc ol-related procedures per 
the protocol for the remainder of the trial, unless medically contraindicated ( see 
HVTN 137  Study Specific Procedures (SSP) ). 
Participants diagnosed with HIV infection during the study should be encouraged 
to participate in follow -up visits as indicated in Section 9.14. 
7.4.4  Participant termin ation from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant may be terminated from 
participation in this study. Specific events that will result in early termination 
include:  
• Participant refuses further participation,  
• Participant relocates and remote follow -up or transfer to another HVTN CRS 
is not possible,  
• HVTN CRS determines that the participant is lost to follow -up,  
• Investigator decides, in consultation with Protocol Team leadership, to 
terminate participation (eg, if participant exhibi ts inappropriate behavior 
toward clinic staff), or  
• Any condition where termination from the study is required by [CONTACT_106887].

The schedules of clinical procedures are shown in Appendix Q , Appendix R  
Appendix S , and Appendix T . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them  while participating in a research 
study. The HVTN informed consent form documents that a participant (1) has 
been informed about the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, 
and (2) is willing to participate in an HVTN study. Informed  consent 
encompasses all written or verbal study information HVTN CRS staff provide to 
the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff will obtain informed 
consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent  process continues throughout the study. Key study concepts 
should be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be 
documented. At each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that vis it and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any new information is learned that might affect the participants’ 
decisions to stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign r evised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants mu st 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent before any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to their IRB/EC and any applicable Regulatory Entity ( RE) for human 
subjects protect ion review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “ Any 
entity/body that has the power to regulate which includes authorities that review 
submitted clinical data and those that conduct inspections. These are somet imes 
referred to as competent authorities. These are entities/bodies whose 
approval/authorization/acknowledgment of a clinical trial is required for 
conducting a clinical trial. Any organization whose approval is required prior to a 
CRS’s participation in DAIDS funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trial. Includes 
but not limited to approvals from state/national health systems and administrative 
bodies, drug agencies etc. ” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requirements of 
their applicable REs.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118584] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable R E to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
enrollment consent . Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any applicable RE may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in th e eligibility criteria.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_118585] is located in 
Appendix D  (Sample addendum to informed consent form for Part A with 
Optional Third Vaccination participants only ). 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent 
form(s) for local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent forms in 
Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C , Appendix D  and Appendix G . The 
consent form(s) must be developed in accordance with requirements of the 
following:  
• CRS’s IRB/EC and any applicable REs,  
• CRS’s instituti on, and  
• Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 
21 CFR, Part 50, and in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -
specific  consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, 
issues of cultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed consent forms include instructions for developi[INVESTIGATOR_106751].

the procedures and issues presented, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understand ing is used to document the participant’s 
understanding of key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must 
complete the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide 
assistance in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
Participants must verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. 
This process and the participant’s understanding of the key concepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable  RE may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained th oroughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE, whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must 
be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the 
eligibility criteria (or below in this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are perf ormed:  
• Medical history, documented in the case history record  
• Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection (see  
Appendix U ) 
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neu rological function; skin  (and pelvic 
and/or rectal exam  for volunteers agreeing to provide mucosal  samples)  
• Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186],

supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots  
• Laboratory tests, including:  
▪ Screening HIV test  
▪ HBsAg  
▪ Anti-HCV Abs  
▪ CBC with differential and platelets  
▪ Chemistry panel (ALT, creatini ne) 
▪ Urine dipstick  
▪ Urine or serum pregnancy test (volunteers who were assigned female sex 
at birth); Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by 
[CONTACT_30219]), are not r equired to undergo pregnancy testing.  
• Administration of behavioral risk assessment (BRA) questionnaire  
• Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 
2001 ( available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-
053.html)  
• Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelin es for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section 9.7 
• Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was assigned 
female sex at birth and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead 
to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin ad equate birth 
control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the participant 
becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming 
pregnant.  
• Assessment of volunteer eligibility for optional procedures  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN study  
If a participant screens for an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does 
not join that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under  participant

study, and the tests were conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.3 Enrollment and vaccination visits  
Once a volunteer has consented to trial partici pation and is found to meet all 
eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2), the HVTN CRS requests the 
randomization assignment via a Web -based randomization system. Enrollment is 
simultaneous with first vaccination. In general, the time interval between 
randomization and enrollment should not e xceed 4 working days. However, 
circumstances may require a participant’s enrollment visit to be changed. This 
may exceed the 4 -day randomization time limit.  
At all vaccination visits , the following procedures are performed before 
vaccination:  
• Abbreviated p hysical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation by [CONTACT_106903]/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
• Assessment of baseline reactogenicity parameters;  
• Assessment of con comitant medications (as described in Section 9.2); 
• Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses; and  
• Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were assigned female sex 
at birth). Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by [CONTACT_106904]), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. For pregnant 
participants, see Section 9.13. 
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list, and if results 
indicat e that vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered 
(see Sections 8.3 and 8.4).  
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for 
observation. An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of [ADDRESS_118587] with the pa rticipant 
during the reactogenicity period (as described in Section 9.10). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits . The se 
procedures may be performed prior to or following vaccination:

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118599]. These contacts are reported as interim visits.  
9.7 HIV counseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm f ollowing 
enrollment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive 
due to the vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV a ntibody 
testing outside of the HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during 
study participation and/or during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood 
of routine HIV testing being offered or performed outside the study CRS at 
emergency rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more 
likely due to the CDC’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well 
as policy changes in man y countries to make HIV testing more frequent and 
routine. CRS staff should inform participants of their right to opt out of HIV 
testing outside the study site. CRS staff should inform study participants if local 
and/or state policies and regulations permi t medical providers to perform HIV 
testing without first informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS staff should 
advise study participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff 
should also inform participants if positive results must  be reported to local public 
health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of the need to 
maintain study blinding by [CONTACT_106913]. CRS staff 
should provide participants with CRS contact [CONTACT_106914]. The CRS can verify that 
the participant is in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the 
study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV -infected during screeni ng are not 
enrolled. Potential and enrolled participants identified as being HIV -infected will 
be referred for medical treatment, counseling, and management of the HIV 
infection. Participants who are found to be HIV -infected after enrollment will not 
recei ve any additional study product but will continue to be followed in the study 
for safety assessments. These individuals may also be referred to appropriate 
ongoing clinical trials or observational studies.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118600] may elicit an antibody response to HIV proteins. Therefore, 
vaccine -induced positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection f rom vaccine -
induced positive serology. These precautionary measures include:  
• Participants will have physical examinations at visits specified in  Appendix Q , 
Appendix R , and Appendix T . Signs or symptoms of an acute HIV infection 
syndrome, an intercurrent illness consistent with HIV -1 infection, or probable 
HIV exposure would prompt a diagnostic workup per the HVTN algorithm for 
Recent Exposure/Acute Infection Testing to determine HIV infection.  
• HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study 
(see Appendix J , Appendix K , Appendix L , Appendix M , Appendix N , 
Appendix O , and Appendix P ). The Laboratory Program (or approved 
diagnostic laboratory) will follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm (see 
HVTN 137  Study Specific Procedures (SSP)), which is able to distinguish 
vaccine -induced antibody responses from actual HIV infections.  
• All participants can receive HIV -[ADDRESS_118601] vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
• All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as measured by [CONTACT_106915] -
HIV antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be offered 
poststudy HIV -1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing 
algorithm) periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated 
(approximately every 6 months) unless or  until HIV Ab testing is no longer 
the standard test in clinical settings.  
9.7.[ADDRESS_118602] kits. This is called 
“vaccine -induced seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.7.2 ). In order to provide 
poststudy HIV testing to distinguish between VISP and HIV infection, and to 
mitigate potential social harms resulting from VISP in HIV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106759], the HVTN has created a VISP registry. Following 
study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff to verify that an individual 
has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Information in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry 
exists to support provision of poststudy testing and counseling services to HIV 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The registry contains the names o f all study participants, 
unless they request that their names be removed.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118603] that could cause that participant to become 
pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of 
using contraception and should be referred to specific counseling, information, 
and advice as needed.  (Specific contraception requirements are listed in Section 
7.1). This reminder should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
Self-report ed infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 
year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal 
ligation —must be documented in the participant’s study record.  
9.9 Urine testing  
Dipstick testing may be performed in th e clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (protein and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is performed on 
urine obtained by [CONTACT_106916].  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to non -urinary bleeding (eg, 
menstruation) or infection, document this issue in the participant’s source 
documentation. For infection, provide appropriate treatment and/or referral and 
document this in the participant's chart. Following resolution, repeat the dipstick 
and, if within t he eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the participant may be 
enrolled.  
Follow -up visit dipstick testing should be deferred if a participant is experiencing 
non-urinary bleeding (eg, menstruation), but should be performed as soon as 
possible. If a follow -up visit dipstick is abnormal due to a participant’s non -
urinary bleeding (eg, menstruation), document in the comment section of the case 
report form (CRF ) and  repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer 
experiencing non -urinary bleeding . A micro -urinalysis is not required. If a follow -
up visit dipstick or micro -urinalysis is abnormal due to infection, provide 
appropriate treatment and/or referral and document this in the participant's source 
documentation. See the Urine Testing MOP for f urther details.  
9.10 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed before and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms 
are followed until resolution and graded accordin g to the Division of AIDS Table 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118604] once between 1 -3 days postvaccination. In general, a partic ipant 
who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is seen by a 
clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving and/or has 
completely resolved. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved reactogenicity 
symptoms pr esent at day 7 (Parts A & B) or day 14 (Part C) to resolution.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of 
assessment in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of 
systemic and local symptoms, and vaccine -related lesions. Events not listed on a 
CRF, or with an onset after the reactogenicity assessment p eriod (day of 
vaccination and 7 full days after  for Part A and Part B and 14 full days after  for 
Part C ), or those meeting SAE/adverse events requiring expedited reporting 
according to DAIDS criteria, are recorded on an adverse event  log form.

Systemic symptoms include increased body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, 
myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, and nausea. Local symptoms include pain 
and/or tenderness at the injection site. The daily maximum severity reached for 
each symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_106917]. All temperatures 
must be measured by [CONTACT_105] -axillary thermometry. This includes temperatures taken 
in the clinic, as well as temperatures take n by [CONTACT_106918].  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 121 of 281 Temperature is reported in degrees Celsius. If temperature is measured in 
Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be documented in the participant’s 
chart note. A measurement is taken once daily duri ng the assessment period and 
should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
Participants with evidence of moderate to severe reactogenicity may be asked to 
come to the clinic for additional assessment and/or blood sampling.  
9.10.2  Assessment of injection site 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_106760]/redness and induration/swelling. The 
maximum diameter for all injection site reactions is recorded.  
All injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Reactions with 
diameters greater than 5 cm a re followed daily; otherwise, the frequency of 
follow -up is based on clinician judgment. See HVTN 137 SSP for detail.  
9.11 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are included  in  Appendix W . The procedures for documenting 
missed visits and out of window visits  are described in the HVTN 137  SSP. If the 
missed visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN 
CRS staff should attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as 
possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV tes ting. Except for HIV testing, these 
procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if 
clinically indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_28023]. Blood samples for immunogenicity assays are not t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_106761].  Detail will be provided in the HVTN 137  SSP.  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section 7.4.2  and Section 
7.4.3  for resolution.  
9.12 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff sho uld consider if the 
following assessments are appropriate: a final physical examination, clinical 
laboratory tests (including urine dipstick, CBC with differential, and chemistry 
panel), pregnancy testing (note: for persons who are confirmed pregnant, 
pregnancy testing is not required, unless clinically indicated), social impact 
assessment, and HIV test. For participants who have a confirmed diagnosis of 
HIV infection, see Section 9.14. 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118605] will be given . During pregnancy, no more STI testing, 
mucosal collections or additional optional collections will be conducted.  
Remaining visits and study procedures should be completed unless medically 
contraindicated or applicable regulations require termination from the study. 
During follow -up in persons who are confirmed pregnant, pregnancy testin g is not 
required, unless clinically indicated. If the participant terminates from the study 
prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should make every effort to keep in touch 
with the participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancies an d 
pregnancy outcomes will be reported  as described in the HVTN 137  SSP section 
on Pregnancy Management and Reporting . If the participant is no longer 
pregnant, refer to Section 7.4.3 . 
If the participant is no longer pregnant (as defined by [CONTACT_106919]) or breast -feeding and study product administration and mucosal and 
additional optional collections can be performed within an appropriate visit 
window, these may resume with unanimous consent of the HVTN [ADDRESS_118606] administration. Follow -up duration for participants diagnosed with HIV 
infection may be adjusted in consultation with the CRS investigator and the 
HVTN 137  PSRT (eg, to avoid interference with participant initiatio n of HIV 
treatment). At postinfection follow -up visits, only specimens required for  
protocol -specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis , and pregnancy tests will be 
collected (note: for persons who are confirmed pregnant, pregnancy testing is not 
requir ed, unless clinically indicated); in addition, some clinic procedures may be 
modified or discontinued (see  Appendix Q , Appendix R , and Appendix T ).

10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN 137  Site Lab Instructions and SSP provide further guidelines for 
operational issues concerning the clinical and processing laboratories. These 
documents include guidelines for general specimen collection, special 
considerations for phlebotomy, specimen labeling, whole blood processing, HIV 
screening/diagnostic testing, and general screening and safety testing.  
Tube types for blood collection are specified in  Appendix J , Appendix K , 
Appendix L , Appendix M , Appendix N , Appendix O , and Appendix P . For tests 
performed locally, the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood collection tubes may be redirected to another 
laboratory or may require study -specific processing techniques. In these cases, 
laboratory special instructions will be posted on the protocol -specific section of 
the HVTN website.  
Of note, all assays described below are performed as research assays to evaluate 
the ability of the vaccine to induce immune responses in the context of the 
participants’ genetic background and are not approved for use in medical care. 
Results from these assays are not made available to participants or medical 
professionals to guide treatment decisions.

blood volume would likely be minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each 
participan t will not exceed 500 mL in any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
The preferred laboratory specimen tube types for research samples are shown in  
Append ix J, Appendix K , Appendix L , Appendix M , Appendix N , Appendix O , 
and Appendix P . Alternate tube types may be used under certain circumstances 
(eg, ACD tube shortages) up on approval of the HVTN Laboratory Center. Refer 
to the HVTN [ADDRESS_118608]  vaccinations for the groups receiving 3 vaccinations. For the

Endpoint assays for humoral and cellular responses are performed on specimens 
collected from participants at the primary immunogenicity timepoint and may be 
performed on samples collected at baseline. Depending on the initial result s, 
assays for humoral, cellular, innate immunity, and inflammatory responses may 
be performed on samples collected from participants at other timepoints; the 
schedules are shown in Appendix J , Appendix K , Appendix L , Appendix M , 
Appendix N , Appendix O , and Appendix P . 
10.4 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.4.1  Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay  
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+  T-cell responses 
following stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic HIV peptides that span the HIV -1 
envelope protein. ICS parameters will include cytokines such as interferon 
gamma (IFN -γ), interleukin (IL) -2, and TNF -α, and may include o ther cytokines 
(such as cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses) to identify T cells of 
specific functionality. Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ T cells 
responding to a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, 
or functional markers may also be analyzed.  
10.4.2  CD4+ T follicular helper cells (Tfh /pTfh )  
Multicolor flow cytometry may be used to identify, phenotype and isolate 
circulating CD3+ T cells in the peripheral blood (PBMC)  and LN FNA s. 
Peripheral Tfh may be characte rized based on expression of lineage markers 
including CXCR5, PD -1, and ICOS on CD4+ T cells. Functionality of Tfh cells 
might be tested by [CONTACT_106920] -[ADDRESS_118610] phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_106762]-1 Env -specific B cells and plasmablasts induced by [CONTACT_106921] -labeled recombinant Env proteins 
(including BG505  SOSIP .664) in combination with a flow cytometry antibody 
panel. In particular, Env -reactive B cells and plasmablasts will be enumerated and 
may be further characterized for expression of memory, activation, inhibitory or 
other markers of i nterest .  
10.4.4  BCR repertoire analysis  
Single or bulk populations of memory B cells and plasmablasts may be sorted for 
BCR sequencing and gene expression analysis. Env -specific B cells may instead

10.5.1  Binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA)  
HIV-1–specific total binding IgG antibodies will be assessed on serum samples 
from study participants taken  at the primary immunogenicity timepoints and 
baseline. In addition, HIV -1–specific total binding IgA antibodies and binding to 
IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) may also be assessed. Specimens 
from other timepoints may also be assayed based on t he results of the initial 
assay.  
10.5.2  Antibody avidity  
Antibody avidity may be measured using  BAMA  with the addition of a 
dissociation step to calculate the antibody avidity index (BAMA -AI). Biolayer 
Interferometry (BLI) and/or Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technologies may 
also be used to define antibody avidity . 
10.5.3  Antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxic ity assay (ADCC)  
ADCC activity may be assessed using serum samples from study participants 
taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoints. Specimens from the baseline 
and other timepoints may also be analyzed at the discretion of the HVTN 
Laboratory Cente r, which may be contingent on the results of the primary 
immunogenicity timepoints. For the Luciferase -based cytotoxicity assay, 
participant sera are incubated with infectious molecular clone (IMC) -infected 
cells and percent killing is measured through the  use of Viviren luminescence.  
10.5.4  Antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)  
To assess the ability of vaccine -elicited antibodies to engage cellular FcR for 
potential antiviral function, ADCP may be measured using serum samples from

antibodies to recognize HIV envelope on the surface of infected cells ( ie, the first 
step in mediating antibody Fc effector function) with a readout by [CONTACT_8315].  
10.5.8  Fc receptor b inding  
The ability of vaccine elicited antibodies to bind to cellular Fc receptors enables 
characterization of the antibody Fc profile that results in antiviral function (ie, 
includes subclass and glycans). HIV-specific antibody  binding to FcγR proteins 
will be assessed  by [CONTACT_941] F cR BAMA. The FCR BAMA is a modification of the 
binding assay where fluorescently labeled FcR proteins are utilized as the 
detection reagent for serum antibodies bound to HIV proteins on microspheres.

to assess heterologous tier 2 neutralization (14, 15) . 
10.5.11  Polyclonal serum Ab (Fab) binding  
A comprehensive probe of polyclonal antibody responses will be performed on 
sera. Single particle electron microscopy will be conducted on IgGs that have 
been isolated and digested into Fabs and made into complexes  with immunogens. 
This technique will be applied to reveal the epi[INVESTIGATOR_106767], prefusion conformation HIV -1 envelope 
glycoprotein BG505 SOSIP gp140  in the presence of different adjuvants. If 
neutralization bre adth is detected, then complexes will also be made with SOSIP 
trimers with corresponding sequences to map the cross -reactive antibody 
responses.  
10.6 Innate immunity  and inflammation  assays  
10.6.1  Soluble factors in serum or plasma  
Multiplex cytokine detection assays (such as meso -scale discovery [MSD]) or

Bulk PBMC or whole blood will be cryopreserved in an RN A protection reagent. 
RNA may be isolated and used for analysis by [CONTACT_106924]/or real -time 
PCR. Signatures of gene expression changes will be analyzed over time after 
vaccination.  
10.6.[ADDRESS_118613] may be performed on serum 
during innate responses. Liquid chromatography –mass spectrometry (LC -MS) 
analysis will be performed and mass spectral data will be collected using reversed 
phase chromatography with both positive and negative electrospray ion ization. 
Metabolite confirmation will be performed with tandem MS -MS experiments 
with additional mass spectrometers. To identify vaccine -derived metabolites, the 
vaccine will be analyzed with the same metabolomics protocol as for serum.  
10.6.[ADDRESS_118614] may be performed on serum or 
plasma to identify and quantify peptides in human subjects. The proteomics 
method uses a modified higher -energy collisional dissociation (HCD) Liquid

10.9 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be used for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved 
samples may be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and 
validation of existing or newly developed methods.  
10.10  Specimen storage and other use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by [CONTACT_106927] (see  Appendix A , Appendix B  and 
Appendix C ).  
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed 
consent for m, or as otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research on 
specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the CRS’s 
IRBs/ECs/REs if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens , and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.

PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section 11.1.2 ); 
11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
• Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 137  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section  11.4); 
• Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds 
are instituted and lifted (see Section 11.4); 
• Querying HVTN CRSs for additional information regarding reported clinical 
data; and  
• Providing support to the HVTN [ADDRESS_118619] submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, adverse experience, 
urinalysis, local lab results, and concomitant medications) before the end of the 
next business day, excluding federal or bank holidays. The forms should not be 
held in anticipatio n of additional information at a later date. If additional 
information is received at a later date, the forms should be updated and 
resubmitted before the end of the next business day after receiving the new 
information. For the case of a longer site holid ay closure, site staff must submit 
the data by [CONTACT_2671] 5th day (local time) after receiving the information even 
if this day is a holiday.  
For example: If the site becomes aware of an AE on Thursday (Day 0), the site 
must submit the data by [CONTACT_106930], on Friday. If there is a 
longer site holiday closure, then this AE must be reported no later than the end of

In addition, site investigators are required to submit AE information in accordance 
with IRB/EC and any applicable RE requirements.  
11.2.3  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (DAI DS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC 
website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -
reporting -adverse -events -daids. The SAE Reporting Category will be used for this 
study.  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS) must 
be used for expedited AE (EAE) reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system 
outages or technical difficulties, expedited AE reports may be submitted via the 
DAIDS EAE Form. This form is available on the DAIDS RSC website at 
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting.

For Part B  and C  participants, after completion of scheduled study visits, only 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to DAIDS, if the study staff become aware of the 
events.  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial t o the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports). However, because safety is a primary study endpoint, the study

triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 137  PSRT reviews safety dat a and decides 
whether the pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core notifies the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the d ecision regarding resumption or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 137  PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifies the FDA as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 137  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 137  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 137  PSRT as soon as possible 
during working hours (local time) —or, if the information was receiv ed during off 
hours, by [CONTACT_106934]. If a prompt HVTN 137  PSRT AE 
review cannot be completed within 72 hours of notification (excluding weekends 
and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or oth ers, and notification of other unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
Key information  
These are some of the things you should know about this study:  
The purpose of the study is to test an experimental HIV vaccine. The study 
vaccine is made from two parts: a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106780] a 
protein found on the outside of HIV and an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance 
that helps the immune system respond better. The study will see if the protein and 
two different amounts of the same  adjuvant are safe and if people c an get them 
without being too uncomfortable. The study will also test how people’s immune 
systems respond to the vaccine made with two different amounts of the same 
adjuvant. This is the first stud y to give this vaccine to people.  
If you join the study, y ou will have about 5 clinic visits over about 8 months. 
Clinic visits will involve physical exams, collection of blood and urine for routine 
laboratory tests (including pregnancy tests if you can get  pregnant), HIV testing at 
some visits, and collection of  blood samples to look at your immune responses to 
the vaccine. Some visits will involve questionnaires, some of which ask very 
personal questions. You will get vaccine injections at two visits. After your clinic 
visits are over, you will get a phone call to check on your health about [ADDRESS_118663] an autoimmune disease or makes an autoimmune disease worse.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 164 of 281 Because this vaccine has not been given to people yet, we do not know  what all of 
the risks may be.  We think the risks will be similar to these general risks. There 
may be other side effects that we don’t yet know, even serious ones.  
We do not expect the study vaccine to benefit you in any wa y. You do not have to 
join, and  you are free to leave at any time.  
The rest of this form provides a more complete description of the study. Please 
read it carefully.

vaccine is made from two parts:  a protein and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are 
substances that help the immune system respond bette r. (Your immune system 
protects you from disease.)  In this study we will test one protein  with different 
adjuvants.  
About 105 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
This study is divided into two parts, part A and part B. About [ADDRESS_118664] 2 different doses (amounts) of the same  adjuvant. 
The study vaccine we give to the first people to join will contain a low dose of the 
adjuvant. We will only give the study vaccine which contains the higher dose of 
the adjuvant after we know that there were no serious health problems in people 
who got the lower dose.  
After we see the results from part A, we will decide what dose of the adjuvant to 
include in the study vaccine in part B. In part B, 88 more people will join. In part 
B, the study vaccine will include either the adjuvant tested in par t A or 1 of 3 
other adjuvants.   
You are being invited to join part A of the study.  
1. We are doing part A of this study to answer several questions.  
• Is the study vaccine safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccine without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccine?  
• Does the study vaccine have different effects at different doses?

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 165 of 281 2. The study vaccine cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccine is not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the stud y 
vaccine to give you HIV. Also, it cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else.  
3. We do not know if the study vaccine will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.

Several studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people who got th e vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one 
study, people who got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV 
than people who did not get the vaccine. In studies with a different vaccine, s ome 
people who got the vaccine had a higher  risk of getting HIV than people who did 
not get the vaccine.  
This study differs from the studies in which people who got the vaccine had a 
higher or lower  risk of getting HIV. We can tell you about the differences.  
We do not know whether the vaccine in this study will affect your risk of getting 
HIV from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. This study vaccine is experimental.  
The study vaccine in Part A of this study is BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 + 3M -052-
AF. It includes two parts. BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 is a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106781] a protein found on the outside of HIV. From here on we 
will call it “the protein.” The second part of the study vaccine is the adjuvant 
called 3M -052-AF + Alum . (An adjuvant is something that helps the immune 
system respond better.) From here on, we will call it “the adjuvant.” We will use 
the term “the study vaccine” to refer to the combination of the protein and the 
adjuvant. The study vaccine is an experimental HIV vaccine. That means we do 
not k now if it will be safe to use in people, or if it will work to prevent HIV 
infection. This study vaccine is used only in research studies.  
The protein  (BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140) : 
The protein was designed to look like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_106782]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_106783] a shape much like that in HIV. In this way 
it is different from proteins in some other HIV study vaccines. The protein was

study, the 3M -052 is dissolved in water and this mixture is being provided by [CONTACT_106949]  (AAHI) in Seattle, Washington, [LOCATION_003]. The 
Alum  was manufac tured by [CONTACT_106950], Denmark. It is 
being provided by [CONTACT_106951] (DAIDS) at the US National Institutes of 
Health in Rockville, Maryland, [LOCATION_003].  
The 3M-[ADDRESS_118666] cause of death could not 
be determined but was felt to be related to the 3M-052 adjuvant and the injection 
procedure. Two other participan ts in the cancer study developed a condition 
called cytokine release syndrome, which can be severe and require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Both participants recovered with medical care. We don’t expect to 
see these outcomes due to the many differences described above . We can discuss 
this more with you if you would like.  
Risks of the protein and adjuvant : 
The protein has been tested for safety and for immune responses in rats, rabbits, 
monkeys, and cows. It  is currently being tested with a different  adjuvant in a 
study with people  in Seattle, [LOCATION_003]. The study is planned to include [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_003] 
and Kenya. As of August 9, 2019, [ADDRESS_118667] not been any serious 
health problems.  
This combination of protein and adjuvant has been tested for safety and/or 
immune response in mice, rats, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, and monkeys. The adjuvant 
has also been tested for safety in animal stud ies of other vaccines, such as an 
experimental vaccine against influenza. In these studies, animals that got these 
products had symptoms consistent with the general risks of other vaccines (as 
described below).  This combination of protein and adjuvant has not been tested in 
humans before. Even if something looks like it is safe or works in animals, it may 
not be true for people.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 167 of 281 General risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling t ired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activities after getting a vaccine. Rarely, people have side effects that limit their 
normal activities or make them go to  the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vac cine causes an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system  attacks your own body, instead of attacking an infection.  
Joining the study  
5. It is completely up to you whether or not  to join the study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your 
doctor, friends or family. If you decide not to join this study, or if you leave it 
after you have joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits o r rights you 
would normally have will not be affected.  
If you join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV vaccine or HIV 
prevention studies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you are 
in another study where you get a study  product. Being in more than one study 
may not be safe.  
Also,  during the study, you should not donate blood or tissue.  
If you choose not to join this study, you may be able to join another study.

you for your Social Security number for tax reasons.  
You do not have to pay anything to be in this study.  
11. We will give you either the study vaccine or a placebo.  
Not everyone in this study w ill get the study vaccine. Some people will get a 
placebo, a substance that does not contain vaccine. In this study, the placebo is a 
combination of salt water and a preservative (to keep the solution from becoming 
too acidic).  
You have a [ADDRESS_118671] a serious medical problem and need to know what you got 
before the end of the study, we can tell you.  
12. We will give you the study products on a schedule.  
You will be in one of 2 groups. Group 1 will get a low dose of the study vacci ne. 
If there are no serious health problems with Group 1, then Group 2 will get a 
higher dose (with more adjuvant in it). You will get 2 injections during the study 
into the muscle of your upper arm.

• Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your  results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV  
• Do physical exams  
• Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned female sex at birth  
• Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking  
• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may ha ve from 
being in the study  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 20 mL and 200 mL (a little more than 1 tablespoon 
to a little less than 1 cup). Your body wil l make new blood to replace the blood 
we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in  an 8-week period.”). Modify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.

We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests wit h you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. We will counsel you about protecting yourself from HIV . 
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low.  
15. The HVTN will test your samples to see how your immune system responds 
to the study products.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_106952], which are located in the [LOCATION_002] and in South Africa.  In rare 
cases, some of your samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_106953].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help exp lain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study product(s).  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your  samples and grow more of 
them over time, so  that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their te sts 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.

them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only all ow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign  this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: R evise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and 
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional re view board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers , or with anyone 
else who does not need to know your name. Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, some information that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We

What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, va ccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them un derstand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to l ook at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimina tion or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and informat ion for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews clinical trials

Other Risks  
20. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. The se procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
or infection where you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume tha t you have HIV or at high risk and treat 
you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study took too 
much time away from work, or because their employer thought they had HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection.  Most vaccines cause the 
body to make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make 
antibodies to HIV because you received an HIV study vaccine. The study vaccine 
may cause you to test positive on some types of HIV antibody tests, even if  you 
HVTN 1 37 Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118677] HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP 
means that after you get the study vaccine, a routine HIV test done outside this 
clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should plan 
to get HIV te sts only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result that is caused by [CONTACT_106957].  
If you have a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_106958], we can 
arrange fre e HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will test positive due to the study vaccine. If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: M odify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you have 
HIV even if you do not, you could face discrimination and other problems. For 
example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental care, 
employment, insurance, a visa, o r entry into the military. If you do have a positive 
HIV antibody test caused by [CONTACT_106365], you will not be able to donate 
blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We will give 
you a brochure that tells you more about tes ting HIV positive because of an HIV 
vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with 
other va ccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away over time. For most babies antibodies from 
the mother last for about six months.  
You should always tell the delivery staff if you have VISP. Howev er, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your 
test is positive and the delivery staff believes you have HIV, your baby [CONTACT_106959]. If this happens, we c an 
arrange for you and the baby [CONTACT_106960] a test that can tell the difference between 
true HIV infection and a VISP result. If you or the baby [CONTACT_106961], 
we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you have HIV . If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to 
help you.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 178 of 281 Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your per sonal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimina tion Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccine will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if exposed. If you get HIV, we do not know how the study 
vaccine might affe ct your HIV infection or how long it takes to develop AIDS.  
We do not know if getting this study vaccine will affect how you respond to any 
future approved HIV vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved for 
use. 
We do not know how the study vacci ne will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784].  
Benefits  
21. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not expect the study vaccine to benefit you in any wa y. However, being in 
the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling that you get as part of 
the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests and physical exams that 
you get while in this study might detect health problems you don’t yet know 
about.

to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the stud y, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or m edical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
Key information  
These are some of the things you should know about this study:  
The purpose of the study is to test 4 experimental HIV vaccines. The study 
vaccines are made from  two parts: a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106780] a 
protein found on the outside of HIV and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are substances 
that help the immune system respond better. The study vaccines all have the same 
protein but different adjuvants. The st udy will see if the study vaccines are safe 
for people and how people’s immune systems respond to them. This is the first 
study to give these study vaccines to people.  
If you join the study, you will have about 15 clinic visits over about a year and a 
half. Clinic visits will involve physical exams, collection of blood and urine for 
routine laboratory tests (including pregnancy tests if you are capable of getting 
pregnant), HIV testing at some visits, and collection of blood samples to look at 
your immune r esponses to the study vaccines. Some visits will involve 
questionnaires, some of which ask very personal questions. You will get 
injections at three visits.  
Some of the risks of getting vaccines are fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, 
nausea, headache, dizziness, feeling tired, and pain, redness, swelling, or itching 
where you get the injection. On rare occasions, a vaccine can cause an allergic 
reaction. Th ese can even be life threatening. Very rarely, a vaccine causes a 
person to have an autoimmune disease or makes an autoimmune disease worse. 
Because this protein  and these  adjuvant s have not been given to many people yet, 
we do not know what all of the ris ks may be.  We think the risks will be similar to 
these general risks. There may be other side effects that we don’t yet know, even 
serious ones.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118682] of this form provides a more complete description of the study. Please 
read it carefully.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a 
study to test HIV vaccines. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The study vaccines 
are made from two parts:  a protein and an adjuvant.  Adjuvants are substances that 
help the immune system respond better. (Your immune system protects you from 
disease.)  In this study we will t est one protein  with different adjuvants.   
About 105 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH)  is paying for the study.  
This study is divided into two parts, part A and part B. About 17 people will be in 
part A. In part A, we tested 2 different doses (amounts) of [ADDRESS_118683] 4 study vaccines. In each of them, the protein  will be the same but the 
adjuvant will be different.  
1. You are being invited to join part B of the study. We are doing part B of this 
study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccines?  
2. The study vaccines cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are not made from actual HIV. I t is impossible for the study 
vaccines to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone 
else. 
3. We do not know if the study vaccines will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Site: Any  change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at [EMAIL_2105]. You can remove the box around the text.

HIV from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. These study vaccines are experimental.  
We are testing 4 study vaccines. The study vaccines are made up of two parts, the 
protein and the adjuvant. (An adjuvant is something that helps the immune system 
respond bett er.) The protein is BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140. This is a man -made 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_106780] a protein found on the outside of HIV. From here 
on we will call it “the protein.” The protein will be included in all 4 study 
vaccines. The second part of the s tudy vaccine, the adjuvant, will be different in 
each study vaccine. The adjuvants are Alum , CpG 1018 + Alum , 3M -052-AF + 
Alum , and GLA -LSQ.  
We are calling each of these combinations of protein and adjuvant “a study 
vaccine.” These are experimental HIV vaccines. That means we do not know if 
the vaccines will be safe to use in people, or if they will work to prevent HIV 
infection. These vaccines are used only in research studies.  
The prote in (BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140) : 
The protein was design ed to look like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_106782]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_106783] a shape much like that in HIV. In this way 
it is different from proteins in some other HIV study vaccines. The protein was 
developed by [CONTACT_106970], New 
York, [LOCATION_003]. It is being provided for this study by [CONTACT_106948] (IAVI) in [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_003].

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 186 of 281 The adjuvants:  
Alum : 
Alum  alerts the immune system and attracts immune cells to the injection site. It 
is being provided for this study by [CONTACT_106951] (DAIDS) at the US 
National Institutes of Health in Rockville, Maryland, [LOCATION_003].  
CpG 1018 + Alum : 
The CpG [ADDRESS_118685] hepatitis B. The heart attacks were rare. After careful 
review by  [CONTACT_106971], no relationship between heart attack and the vaccine with CpG 
1018 was found.  In this study, CpG 1018 is mixed with Alum . The FDA -
approved vaccine does not contain Alum . 
3M-052-AF + Alum : 
The 3M -[ADDRESS_118686]. Paul, Minnesota, [LOCATION_003] . In this 
study, the 3M -052 is dissolved in water and this mixture is being provided by [CONTACT_106949]  (AAHI) in Seattle, Washington, [LOCATION_003].  
The 3M-[ADDRESS_118687] cause of death could not 
be determined but was felt to be related to the 3M-052 adjuvant and the injection 
procedure. Two other participants in the cancer study developed a condition 
called cytokine release syndrome, which can be severe and require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Both participants recovered with medical care. We don’t expect to 
see these outcomes due to the many differences described above. We can discuss 
this more with you if you would like.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 187 of 281 HVTN 137 Part A tested 2 different doses (amounts) of the 3M-052-AF + Alum  
adjuvant. As there were no serious health problems in Part A parti cipants, the 
decision was made to use the higher dose of adjuvant in the study vaccine in Part 
B of the study.  
Two participants in Part A did have reactions to their study injections that we 
want to tell you about. Both  had redness and swelling over a larg e area on their 
arm where they got the injection that started about [ADDRESS_118688] acebo.  
 
GLA -LSQ:  
The GLA -LSQ adjuvant was developed by [CONTACT_106972]. It simulates parts of the immune system that recognize the cell 
walls of invading bacteria. GLA -LSQ has been tested in clinical trials of vaccines

general risks of other vaccin es (as described below) . The study vaccines have not 
been tested in humans before. Even if something looks like it is safe or works in 
animals, it may not be true for people.  
General risks of vaccines:

11. We will give you either the study vaccines or a placebo.  
Not everyone in this study will get the s tudy vaccines. Some people will get a 
placebo, a substance that does not contain vaccine. In this study, the placebo is a 
combination of salt water and a preservative (to keep the solution from becoming 
too acidic). We will compare the results from people who got the different study 
vaccines. We will also compare results from people who got the placebo with 
results from people who got the study vaccines.  
You have a 10 -in-11 chance of getting the study vaccines. Site: Modify the 
randomization metaphor in th e next sentence as appropriate to your local culture . 
Whether you get one of the study vaccines or the placebo is completely random, 
like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  
We have no say in whether you get the study vaccines or the placebo. We will not 
know which one you a re getting, and neither will you. Only the pharmacist at this 
clinic will have this information while the study is going on.  
You will have to wait until everyone completes their final study visits to find out 
whether you got the study vaccines or the place bo. This could be several years. 
But, if you have a serious medical problem and need to know what you got before 
the end of the study, we can tell you.

• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 17 mL and 325 mL (about 1½ tablespoon to a little

and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. If you agree, we may collect other samples to test your immune responses.  
Immune responses to vaccines involve different parts of the body. These include 
the cells in blood, in lymph nodes near the injection site, and in bone marrow. We 
would like to collect samples from t hese parts of the body to learn more about 
how the immune system responds to the study vaccines. Every additional sample 
provides more information. Not every type of sample will be collected by [CONTACT_106974]. Some of the sample co llection will be done at 
other locations. Those institutions may require additional forms of consent.  
At the end of this form, we will ask if you agree to each of these sampling 
procedures. You can agree now and change your mind later. Even if you agree to 
give these samples, you may not be eligible to do so but you will remain in the 
study. You can decide  not to give any of these samples and still be in the study.

Leukapheresis  procedure:  
This procedure  collect s large amounts of white blood cells. Blood is made up of 
red cells that carry oxygen, white cells that fight infection, platelets that help form 
clots, and plasma, the fluid left over when all the cells are removed. During 
leukapheresis, white blood cells are removed and the rest of the blood is put back 
into the body .  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 193 of 281 The leukapheresis procedure will be done at [site: insert location] . Your 
eligibility to have this procedure will be assessed by [CONTACT_106975] c and at the 
procedure facility .  
For the procedure,  a clinician will insert a sterile needle into a vein in each of 
your arms. The needles are attached to tubes. Your blood will go out of your body 
through one tube and into a machine that separates the blood and takes out the 
white blood cells. When the white blood cells are taken out , the rest of the blood 
will go back into your body through the tube going into your other arm. 
Sometimes the fluid lost during the procedure is replaced by a sterile salt solution 
or a solution containing a protein  called albumin. This protein is  normally  found 
in human blood. An anticoagulant called ACD -A may be  added to your blood 
during the procedure. Anticoagulants prevent blood from clotting.  
It is normal to feel tired for up to [ADDRESS_118697] leukapheresis, it wil l happen about 2 weeks after your second 
injection. It will take about [site insert timeframe] for the procedure.  
We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for having leukapheresis. This 
amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text] . 
Risks of leukapheresis  
Generally, th e risks of leukapheresis include nausea, vomiting, fainting or 
dizziness, pain, bruising or swelling at the needle sites, low blood pressure, 
increased pulse rate, seizures, blood loss, and infection. Rarely, a lbumin  can cause  
an allergic reaction. If the leukapheresis procedure  has to be stopped , it could 
result in the loss of as muc h as [ADDRESS_118698] cells from a lymph node ne ar the 
injection site.

Your eligibility to have this procedure will be assessed by [CONTACT_106976] .  
For the procedure, a clinician will lo cate the appropriate lymph node by [CONTACT_2931] 
a cold gel and pressing a hand -held ultrasound device against your skin. If 
necessary, a small area near the lymph node may be shaved. A cleaning solution 
will be applied to the skin in that area. The area will b e numbed by [CONTACT_106977] 
a local anesthetic, such as Lidocaine, which is like Novocaine. The doctor will 
insert a very thin needle and use the images from the ultrasound to guide it into 
the lymph node. The needle may be moved up and down to collect cel ls from the 
lymph node. Fluid may also be collected through the needle into a syringe or 
bottle. Each cell collection lasts about [ADDRESS_118699] lymph node cell collection, it will happen about 3 weeks after 
your second injection. It will take about [site insert timeframe] for the procedure.  
We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for having a lymph node cell 
collection. This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text] . 
Risks of lymph node cell collection  
The main risks of this procedure include pain and bruising where the needle is 
inserted and infection at that spot. The cleaning solution, or shaving the area, may 
cause irritation. Injecting the local anesthetic may sting or burn for a little while 
until the numbing takes effec t. Very rarely, damage to tissues, nerves, or blood 
vessels may happen.  Examining the lymph node area may be uncomfortable or 
cause embarrassment. There may be bleeding during or after the procedure. If 
there is an infection, antibiotic treatment may be ne eded.  
If discomfort , problems, or side effects happen during or after  lymph node cell 
collection , the staff will use the appropriate medical procedures to  treat you. 
Bone marrow cell collection procedure  
This procedure collects  cells that make antibodies for a long time and cells that 
remember immune responses to the vaccine. Cell collection involves removing 
some marrow from your hip bone. The bone marrow cell collection procedure 
will be done at [site: insert location] . Your eligibility t o have this procedure will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_106978].   
For the procedure, a clinician will locate the back of your hip bone just below 
your waist near your spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A cleaning solution will be applied to the skin in tha t 
area. The area will be numbed by [CONTACT_106977] a local anesthetic, such as

uncomfortable. The doctor will insert a single needle into your hip bone to get up 
to 20 cc ( up to ¾ of an ounc e or a little less than 1 ½  tablespoons) of bone 
marrow.  
Once the bone marrow has been removed, a sterile dressing will be applied. A 
nurse will instruct you on how to care for this area. Your hip bone may be sore for 
a few days. You may feel tired for s everal days until your body can replace the 
bone marrow that was taken out.  
If you agree to bone marrow cell collection, it will happen about a year after your 
last injection.  
We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for having bone marrow cell 
collection. This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text] . 
Risks of bone marrow cell collection  
Removing bone marrow may cause pain and bruising that may last [ADDRESS_118700] the parts of the body where people 
may be exposed to HIV: their rectum and vagina.  We would like to c ollect rectal 
fluid and tissue from all participants and vaginal fluid and tissue from participants 
assigned female sex at birth. We will collect these samples at our clinic.   
At the end of this form we will ask if you agree to provide these samples. You c an 
agree now and change your mind later. Even if you agree to give these samples, 
you may not be eligible to do so but you will remain in the study. You can decide 
not to give any of these samples and still be in the study.  
We will ask you to avoid some a ctivities before we collect these samples. This 
will help make sure your samples give accurate lab readings.

Rectal tissue collection (for all participants)  
We will perform a rectal exam to make sure it is safe to collect rectal tissue 
samples. We will collect small samples of tissue about the size of half a grain of 
rice from the lining of your rectum. These are called rectal biopsies. We will 
collect up to [ADDRESS_118703] a plastic 
tube about 2 cm wide (a little less than an inch) into the anus to view the lower 
part of the rectum. You may feel some discomfort, but the biopsies are almost 
always painless. It will take 5 to 10  minutes.

Vaginal  fluid collection (for participants  assigned female  sex at birth ) 
We will perform a pelvic exam to make sure it is safe to collect vaginal fluids. To 
collect vaginal fluid, a disposable menstrual cup will be inserted into your vagina. 
You will wear the cup for [ADDRESS_118706] your  vaginal fluid, we will ask you to follow 
these instructions:  
• Do not have vaginal sex or insert anything into your vagina, including 
tampons.  
• Do not douche or use anything in or around your vagina with spermicide, 
lubricants, or medication (such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l yeast infection treatments).  
We will not collect vaginal fluid if you are menstruating or pregnant or if we 
think you may have a cervical or vaginal infection. If you are menstruating, we 
may ask you to return to collect this sample.

Vaginal tissue collection (for participants  assigned female sex at birth)  
We will perform a pelvic exam to make sure it is safe to collect vaginal tissue 
samples. We will collect small samples of tissue about the size of half a grain of 
rice from your vagina . These are called vaginal biopsies. We will collect up to [ADDRESS_118707]’s beak. It is used to help open your 
vagina a few inches. After the sp eculum is put into your vagina, the vaginal wall 
will be cleaned with a clean cotton ball or swab.  
Biopsies will be taken with clean forceps. Forceps are a metal tool to help get the 
tissue from inside your vagina. You may feel crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], pain , or discomfo rt. We 
will check to make sure that there is no bleeding from where the biopsies are 
taken. If there is bleeding, we will use a medication to stop it. One type of 
medication, silver nitrate, has a gray color. You may see gray flecks in your 
vaginal dischar ge after the biopsy. This is normal. The procedure will take about 
[ADDRESS_118708] your vaginal tissue, we will 
ask you to follow these instructions:

Risks of rectal  and vaginal fluid and tissue collection  
We will ask you to stop some activities before and after we collect these samples. 
You may find this inconvenient. These sample collections may cause some 
anxiety, temporary discomfort, and embarrassment. We will try to make you as 
comfortable as possible.  
All biopsies may cause a small amount of bleeding, which usually stops on its 
own. In rare cases, excess bleeding or infection may occur from a biopsy. If you 
need care, we will tell you about the care we can give you here. We will also tell 
you about care  we can help you get elsewhere. Until the areas where the biopsies

transmitted infection (STI) infection if you are exposed. Most people heal within 
[ADDRESS_118709] your samples to see how your immune system responds 
to the study products.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_106952], which are located in the [LOCATION_002] and South Africa. In rare 
cases, some of your  samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_106980].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how yo u look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV  
and the study product(s).  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so  that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN w ill continue 
to store them.

them in other studies and share them with other rese archers.  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to a gree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples w ill be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples . If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research pu rposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and 
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and info rmation? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106981]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is share d with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers , or with anyone 
else who does not need to know your name. Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, some information that we share may be personal, such as

What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other dise ases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used fo r genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put th e information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is v ery small. There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies th at fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews clinical trials  
• The people who work with the researcher

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118713] HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seroposi tivity (VISP). 
VISP means that after you get the study vaccines, a routine HIV test done outside 
this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell  the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result that is caused by [CONTACT_106983].  
If you have a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_106984], we can 
arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens,  we do not 
know how long you will test positive due to the study vaccines. If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end o f the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone b elieves you have 
HIV even if you do not, you could face discrimination and other problems. For 
example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental care, 
employment, insurance, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do have a positive 
HIV antibody test caused by [CONTACT_106985], you will not be able to donate 
blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We will give 
you a brochure that tells you more about testing HIV positive because of an HIV 
vaccine, and how you  can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away over time. For most babies, antibodies from 
the mother last for about six months.  
You should always tell the delivery staff if you have VISP. However, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your 
test is positive and the delivery staff believes you have HIV, your baby [CONTACT_106959]. If this happens, we can 
arrange for you and the baby [CONTACT_106960] a test that can  tell the difference between 
true HIV infection and a VISP result. If you or the baby [CONTACT_106961], 
we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 206 of 281 Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks,  such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you have HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us an d we will try to 
help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health in surance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccines will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if exposed. If you get HIV, we do not know how the study 
vaccines might affect your HIV infection or how long it takes to develop  AIDS.  
We do not know if getting these study vaccines will affect how you respond to 
any future approved HIV vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines will affect a pregnant participant or a 
develop ing baby.

This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccines later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money with you . 
Your rights and responsibilities  
24. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill  of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
25. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let us 
know.  
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples . We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have exper ienced from being in the study. We 
believe these steps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injuries

previously approved by [CONTACT_106963]) to the boxed text. You can remove 
the box around the text.  
26. If you get sick or injured during the study, contact [CONTACT_106986].  
Your health is imp ortant to us. (Sites: adjust the following 2 sentences if

will help you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, the HVTN has  a process to decide if it 
is related to the study products  and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related 
injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain 
conditions are met.  
Some of  the study product  providers may  pay medical  costs for study -related 
injuries that are determined to be caused by [CONTACT_106964]. If provider 
funds are not available or are not enough, or if the injury is determined to be 
caused by [CONTACT_57219], the HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs 
that it determines are reasonable. (Sites: insert locale - appropriate medical 
insurance language in the following sentence)  If the injury is not study related, 
then you and/or your  health insurance will be responsible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_106965]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the  same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
Key information  
These are some of the things you should know about this study:  
The purpose of the study is to test 2 experimental HIV vaccine s. The study 
vaccines are made from two parts: a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106789] a 
protein found on the outside of HIV and an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance 
that help s the immune system respond better. The study wil l see if the study 
vaccines  are safe  and if people can get them without being too uncomfortable. 
The study will also test  how people’s immune systems respond to the  study 
vaccine s. This is the first stud y to give th ese study vaccines to people. If you join 
the study, you will have about 15 clinic visits over about a year and a half. Clinic 
visits will involve physical exams, collection of blood and urine for routine 
laboratory tests (including pregnancy tests if you are capable of getting pregnant), 
HIV testing at some visits, and collection of blood samples to look at your 
immune responses to the study vaccines. Some visits will involve questionnaires, 
some of which ask very personal questions. You will get injection s at three visits.  
Some of the risks of getting vaccines are fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, 
nausea, headache, dizziness, feeling tired, and pain, redness, swelling, or itching 
where you get the injection. On rare occasions, a vaccine can cause an al lergic 
reaction. These can even be life threatening. Very rarely, a vaccine causes a 
person to have an autoimmune disease or makes an autoimmune disease worse. 
Because th ese protein s and these  doses (amounts) of the adjuvant have not been 
given to many peo ple yet, we do not know what all of the risks may be.  We think 
the risks will be similar to these general risks. There may be other side effects that 
we don’t yet know, even serious ones.  
We do not expect the study vaccine to benefit you in any way. You d o not have to 
join, and you are free to leave at any time.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118717] of this form provides a more complete description of the study. Please 
read it carefully.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]  are doing a 
study to test HIV vaccines. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The study vaccines  
are made from two parts: a protein and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are substances that 
help the immune system respond better. (Your immune system protects you from 
disease.)  
About 127 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
This stu dy is divided into three  parts : part A , part B , and part C.  In part A, we 
tested 2 different doses (amounts) of the adjuvant  with a protein . In part B, we 
tested the  same pro tein as part A  but with different adjuvants.  [ADDRESS_118718] two proteins with 2 different 
doses of an adjuvant.  About 22 people will be enrolled in part C. You are being 
invited to join part C of the study.  
1. We are doing part C of this study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vacc ines?  
2. The study vaccines cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study 
vaccines to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone 
else. 
3. We do not know if the study vaccines will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Site: Any change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at [EMAIL_2105]. You can remove the box around the text.  
Severa l studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118719] your risk of getting 
HIV from another person. The risk cou ld be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. These study vaccines are experimental.  
The study vaccines are made up of two parts, the protein and the adjuvant . (An 
adjuvant is something that helps the immune system respond better .) We are 
testing [ADDRESS_118720] study vaccine  is BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 + 3M -052-AF + Alum . It 
includes two parts. BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 is a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106790] a protein found on the outside of HIV. From here on we will call it 
“protein 1.” The second part of this study vaccine is the adjuvant called 3M -052-
AF + Alum . From here on, we will call it “the adjuvant.”  
The second study vaccine is Trimer 4571 + 3M-052-AF + Alum . It also includes 
two part s. Trimer 4571 is a man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_106780] a protein 
found on the outside of HIV. From here on we will call it “ protein 2.”  The second 
part of this study vaccine is the same adjuvant used in the first study vaccine  but a 
different dose (amount) of it . This is the first study to give this study vaccine to 
people.  
These study vaccine s are experimental HIV vaccine s. That means we do not know 
if they will be safe to use in people, or if they will work to prevent HIV infection. 
These study vaccine s are used only in research studies.  
Protein  1 (BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140):  
Protein  [ADDRESS_118721] it is different from proteins in some other HIV study vaccines. The protein 
was developed by [CONTACT_106987] r in [LOCATION_001],

compared to proteins that don’t have these changes.  The protein was developed 
and is being provided by [CONTACT_106989] 
(VRC) at the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  
The adjuvant:

study, the 3M -052 is dissolved in water and this mixture is being provided by [CONTACT_106990] I nstitute  (AAHI) in Seattle, Washington, [LOCATION_003].  
The 3M-[ADDRESS_118724] cause of dea th could not 
be determined but was felt to be related to the 3M-052 adjuvant and the injection 
procedure. Two other participants in the cancer study developed a condition 
called cytokine release syndrome, which can be severe and require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Bo th participants recovered with medical care. We don’t expect to 
see these outcomes due to the many differences described above. We can discuss 
this more with you if you would like.  
HVTN 137 Part A tested a high dose (amount) and a low dose  of the 3M -052-AF 
+ Alum  adjuvant. As there were no serious health problems in Part A participants, 
the decision was made to use the high dose of adjuvant in the study vaccine s in 
part B of the study.  There have been no serious health problems in Part B 
participants. In Part C, we will be testing the high dose and a medium dose of the 
adjuva nt with two different proteins.  We want to see if the medium dose can 
produce the same response as the high dose.

Protein 1  + the a djuvant  (at a higher and lower dose) have been tested in Part A 
and Part B  of this study  and there have been no serious health problems . Two 
participants in Part A who received the higher dose did have reactions to their 
study injections that we want to te ll you about. Both  had redness and swelling

of one type of white blood cell  at 7 days after their second injection . However, 
their count went back up to normal levels by [CONTACT_941] 8th day without any health 
concerns.   
In the second study, 3 people got a single dose of this protein vaccine combined 
with Alum  at a higher dose than the on e we will use in this study. These injections 
did not cause any serious health problems. Because this protein vaccine has only 
been given to a small number of people, we do not know all the side effects.

These injections have not caused any serious health problems.  
HVTN [ADDRESS_118730] common side effects experienced by 
[CONTACT_106991].  
All people had some side effects that they described as mild to moderate.  One (1) 
person  had severe pain/tenderness in both the right and left injection si tes 3 days 
following the fourth vaccination, though it lasted only one day.  Five (5)  people 
had severe side effects, including chills, headache, muscle aches, and generally 
feeling unwell. These severe side effects went away within 2 days.  Of the 5 
people who had severe side effects, 2  decided to stop getting study injections 
because they felt generally unwell after injections, and it was affecting their daily 
lives.  Another 2 of the 5 people who had severe side effects got more injections; 
one of them had more severe side effects while the other did not. And one (1) of 
the [ADDRESS_118731] would be similar to th ose listed in the General risks of vaccines  section 
below. 
These are the side effects we know about. There may be others that we don’t 
know about. We will tell you if we learn about new side effects that could affect 
your willingness to stay in the study . 
General risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause feve r, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activities after getting a vaccine. Rarely, pe ople have side effects that limit their 
normal activities or make them go to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vaccine causes an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system attacks your own body, instead of attacki ng an infection.

Not e veryone i n part C of this  study will get the study vaccine s. Some people will 
get a placebo, a substance that does not contain vacc ine. In this study, the placebo 
is a combination of salt water and a preservative (to keep the solution from 
becoming too acidic).  We will compare the results from people who got the 
different study vaccines. We will also compare results from people who got th e 
placebo with results from people who got the study vaccines .

13. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
• Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV  
• Do physical exams  
• Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned female sex at birth  
• Ask questions about you r health, including medications you may be taking  
• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 17 mL and 325 mL (about 1½ tablespoon to a little 
more than ⅔ of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]). Your body will make new blood to replace the blood we 
take out.

consent form) in this section or distribute i t as a  separate sheet if it is helpful to your 
study participants. You are not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. We will counsel you about protecting yourself from HIV.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you abou t ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low.  
15. The HVTN will test your samples to see how your immune system responds 
to the study products.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_106952], which are located in the U nited States and South Africa. In rare 
cases, some of your samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_106980].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are  passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not al l of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The res earchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study product(s).  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so  that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on you r samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When yo ur samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 223 of 281 16. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants t o use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this f orm. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in  this study or have any negative 
consequences here.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and 
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, th eir research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be la beled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers , or with anyone 
else who does not need to know your name. Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, some informatio n that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118741].  
What kind of studies migh t be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and gr ow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the ge nomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compar e the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or  Ethics Committee  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews clinical trials  
• The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name [CONTACT_107005].

In the unlikely event that you get a bad reaction to a study injection we may stop 
your injections.  
If we stop your injections, we may ask you to stay in the st udy to complete other 
study procedures.  
19. We may take you out of the study at any time.  
We may take you out of the study if : 
• you do not follow instructions,  
• we think that staying in the study might harm you, or  
• the study is stopped for any reason.  
Other Risks 
20. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay i n the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bl eeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
or infection where you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join H VTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you have HIV or at high risk and treat 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118744] HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). 
VISP means that after  you get the study vaccines, a routine HIV test done outside 
this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV inf ection and a positive result that is caused by [CONTACT_106983].  
If you have a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_106984], we can 
arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will te st positive due to the study vaccines. If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you have 
HIV even if y ou do not, you could face discrimination and other problems. For 
example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental care, 
employment, insurance, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do have a positive 
HIV antibody test caused by [CONTACT_106994], you will not be able to donate 
blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We will give 
you a brochure that tells you more about testing HIV positive because of an HIV 
vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these probl ems. 
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the  baby, and they go away over time. For most babies, antibodies from 
the mother last for about six months.  
You should always tell the delivery staff if you have VISP. However, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your bab y. If your 
test is positive and the delivery staff believes you have HIV, your baby [CONTACT_106959]. If this happens, we can 
arrange for you and the baby [CONTACT_106960] a test that can tell the difference between 
true HIV infection and a VISP result. If you or the baby [CONTACT_106961], 
we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 229 of 281 Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you have HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to 
help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened,  you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you ma y be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records  
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employer s from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We d o not know if the study vaccines will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if exposed. If you get HIV, we do not know how the study 
vaccines might affect your HIV infection or how long it takes to develop AIDS.  
We do not know if getti ng these study vaccines will affect how you respond to 
any future approved HIV vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784].

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118745] health problems you don’t yet know 
about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccines later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money  with you . 
Your rights and responsibilities  
22. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We w ill give you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
23. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let u s 
know.  
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples . We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from being in the study. We 
believe the se steps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injuries  
Sites: Approval from HVTN Regulatory Affairs (at [EMAIL_2105]) is needed 
for any change (other than those that the instructions specifically request or those 
previously approved by [CONTACT_106963]) to the boxed text. You can remove 
the box around the text.  
24. If you get sick or injured during the study, contact [CONTACT_106986].  
Your health is important to us. (Sites: adjust the  following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the care that 
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 231 of 281 we can give here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we 
will help you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in t his study, the HVTN has  a process to decide if it 
is related to the study products  and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related 
injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain 
conditions are met.  
Some of  the study product  providers may  pay medical  costs for study -related 
injuries that are determined to be caused by [CONTACT_106964]. If provider 
funds are not available or are not enough, or if the injury is determined to be 
caused by [CONTACT_57219], the HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs 
that it determines are reasonable. (Sites: insert locale - appropriate medical 
insurance language in the following sentence)  If the injury is not study related, 
then you and/or your health insurance will be respon sible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_106965]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries,  even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not sati sfied.

1.Key information  
• Enrollment in Part A is complete with [ADDRESS_118748] study 
injection is optional.  
• Participants who do not agree to have a third injection will not sign this 
consent form. They will continue on in the study according to the consent form 
they signed when they joined it.  
• Participants who agree to have a t hird injection will need to sign this consent 
form. They will have the same study procedures as were described in the 
original consent form but their schedule of study visits will change. Their study 
duration will also change. They will be in the study for  [ADDRESS_118749] injection  
• Because this is the first study to give this study vaccine to people, the risks of a 
third injection of study vaccine are unknown at this time.  However, we expect 
the risks will be the same as we told you in th e main study informed consent 
form . 
1. Study progress update  
In HVTN 137 Part A, we are testing 2 different doses (amounts) of the same 
adjuvant. Enrollment in Part A is complete with [ADDRESS_118750] people who later joined the study the 
vaccine with the higher dose of the adjuvant. As there were no serious health 
problems in those people either, the decision was made to use the higher dose of 
adjuvant in the study vaccine in Part B of the study, which is now open and 
enrolling participants.

HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page [ADDRESS_118751] before the COVID -19 pandemic started and is 
taking longer than planned because of it. The delay allowed the researchers to 
take an early look at Part A participants’ immune response s to their study 
injections and they found that some were very good. The researchers would like 
to see if these responses can be improved with one more injection. The 
researchers would also like  to make up for th e delay and quickly learn more about 
the adj uvant given in Part A.  
Getting a third study injection is optional. Participants who agree to it will follow 
a revised study visit schedule. We are calling the third injection and revised study 
visit schedule ‘the Part A Optional Third Vaccination’. The op tional third 
injection will be about [ADDRESS_118752] your risk of getti ng HIV from another 
person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very important to 
avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you how to avoid 
HIV.  If you get HIV, we do not know how the study vaccine might affect your 
HIV infection or how long it takes to develop AIDS. We do not know if getting 
this study vaccine will affect how you respond to any future approved HIV 
vaccine.  
Please review this information carefully. You are free to ask questions at any 
time.  
3. You are fre e to choose whether or not to join the Part A Optional Third 
Vaccination .

Title: A phase [ADDRESS_118757] and/or Alum  adjuvants and VRC 
HIV Env Trimer 4571 and 3M -052-AF with Alum  in healthy, HIV uninfected 
adults  
 
HVTN protocol number: HVTN 137  
Site: [Insert site name]  
When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use them 
in other studies and share them with other researchers. The HVTN calls these 
samples “extra samples .” The HVTN will only allow your extra samples to be 
used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end 
of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Key information  
These are some of the things you should know about the use of your samples and 
information for other studies:  
• The extra samples will be labeled with a code number and some personal 
information. They will not be labeled with your name. The extra samples are 
stored in a secure place.  At your request, the HVTN will destroy all your 
extra samples. You can still join the main study even if you do not agree to 
use of your extra samples in other studies.  
• Researchers may do genetic testing on your samples, which could include 
genome wide studies. It is unlik ely, but these tests could show you may be at 
risk for certain diseases. In the very unlikely event that others found out, this 
could lead to discrimination or other problems.  
• You will not be paid or otherwise benefit from allowing your extra samples to 
be used in other studies.   
The rest of this form gives more information about use of your extra samples for 
other studies. Please read it carefully.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affect your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 244 of 281 2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repositor y. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
3. How l ong will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory author ity imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the  use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with 
you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my sampl es to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies ar e only being 
done for research purposes.  
6. Will the HVTN s ell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with HVTN or other researchers. 
Once we share your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them 
back.  
7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board 
(IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will re view their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs 
protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
8. What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the 
code will stay at this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other 
researchers , or with  anyone else who does not need to know your name. Your 
name [CONTACT_107030]. However, some information that we 
share may be personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information 
from the study, and HIV status. We may share information about the study 
product you received and how your body responded to the study product.  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 245 of 281 9. What kind of studies might be done with my  extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the im mune system and other 
diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for gen ome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the inf ormation 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person.  However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very s mall. There may be other unknown risks.  
10. What ar e the risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but t he genetic test s done on your samples  could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other prob lems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to  your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disabili ty or long -term care insurance.  
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Resea rchers who use your extra  samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your  extra  
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022  
HVTN137_v5.0_Final_26Sep22  / Page 246 of 281 • Any regulatory agency that r eviews clinical trials  
• The peop le who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name [CONTACT_107005].  
Questions  
12. If you have questions or problems about allowing your samples and 
information to be used in other studies, use the following important contacts.

The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to help identify 
potential vaccine trial participants at “low ri sk” for HIV infection. These 
guidelines are based on behaviors within the last 6 -12 months prior to enrollment; 
however, it may be appropriate to consider a person’s behavior over a longer 
period of time than specified to assess the person’s likelihood of maintaining low 
risk behavior. Some volunteers may not be appropriate for enrollment even if they 
meet these guidelines. These guidelines should be supplemented and interpreted 
with local epi[INVESTIGATOR_106794]. The investigator may review the risk level of any volunteer 
with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Protocol Safety Review Team.  
A volunteer may be appropriate for inclusion if he/she/they meets these guidelines:  
 
A. For US volunteers NOT on stable Pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP)  
[ADDRESS_118841] 12 months  did not: 
• Have oral, vaginal or anal intercourse with an HIV -infected partner, or a 
partner who uses injection drugs   
• Give or receive money, drugs, gifts or services in exchange for oral , vaginal or 
anal sex  
 
AND  
 
In the last 6 months  has abstained from penile/anal or penile/vaginal intercourse, OR  
 
In the last 6 months : 
• Had 4 or fewer partners of the opposite birth sex for vaginal and/or anal 
intercourse, OR  
 
Is an MSM (person born male with partner(s) born male) who, in the last 12 months : 
• Had 2 or fewer MSM partners for anal intercourse and had no unprotected 
anal sex with MSM, OR  
•  Had unprotected anal intercourse with only [ADDRESS_118842] 12 months (during which neither 
partner had any other partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, the 
volunteer may then have had protected anal intercourse with 1 other MSM 
partner (total [ADDRESS_118843] 12 months).  
 
Is a transgender person, regardless of the point on the transition spectrum, having sex 
with men (born male) and/or other transgender persons, who in the  last 12 months : 
• Had 2 or fewer partners for anal or vaginal intercourse, and had no 
unprotected anal or vaginal sex, OR  
HVTN 137  Version 5.0  / September 26, 2022

partner had any other partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, ma y 
then have had protected anal or vaginal sex with 1 other partner (total [ADDRESS_118845] 12 months).  
 
AND  
 
Uses or intends to use condoms in situations which may include penile/anal or  
penile/vaginal intercourse with new partners of unknown HIV status, occasional 
partners,  
partners outside a primary relationship, and/or partners known to have other partners.  
 
[ADDRESS_118846] 12 months  did not: 
• Inject drugs or other substances without a prescription  
• Use cocaine, methamphetamine, or excessive alcohol, which in the 
investigator’s judgment, rendered the participant at greater than low risk for 
acquiring HIV infection.  
The investigator’s judgment should consider local epi[INVESTIGATOR_106795].  
 
A volunteer is NOT appropriate for inclusion if he/she:  
 
Acquired an STI ( ie new infection) in the last 12 months : 
 
• Syphilis  
• Gonorrhea  
• Non-gonococcal urethritis  
• Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV2)

• Reports 6 months (180 days) or more of protective PrEP use  
• For daily oral PrEP use:  
▪ For persons AMAB who have sex with persons AMAB: Reports equal 
to or greater than 70% when asked the following: “ Thinking about the 
past 4 weeks, what percent of the time were you able to take all your 
PrEP medications?”  
▪ For people with a vagina having intravaginal intercourse: Reports 
equal to or greater than 90% when asked the following: “ Thinking 
about the past 4 weeks, what percent of the time were you able to take 
all your PrEP medications?”  
• For event -driven (on -demand or “2 -1-1”) PrEP use1 in persons AMAB 
who have sex with persons AMAB : Reports use consistent with the 
guidance of the professional education organ ization, the International 
Antiviral Society –[LOCATION_003]  (IAS -[LOCATION_003]):  
▪ For individuals with frequent use (> 15 pi[INVESTIGATOR_106796]): At least 80% 
of condomless sex acts are covered with on -demand PrEP at the 
recommended dose schedule  
▪ For individuals with less frequent us e (≤ 15 pi[INVESTIGATOR_106796]):  
o A past history of high adherence (> 90%)  
o Commitment to use on -demand PrEP for all condomless sex acts at 
the recommended dose schedule  
• Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, Descovy)  and 
emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  (FTC/TDF, Truvada)  when 
taken as PrEP do no t interfere with pseudoneutralization assays. However, 
other antiretroviral medications may potentially interfere with 
immunogenicity assays. For PrEP medications other than FTC /TAF  or 
FTC/TDF , refer to the SSP for details .

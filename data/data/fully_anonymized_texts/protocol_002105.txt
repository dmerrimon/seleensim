greatly impacting therapy options for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Extending beyond the initial option of balloo n 
angioplasty, the advent  of bare metal stents in the 1990s improved the safety and the effectiveness of percutane ous coronary 
intervention  compared to balloon angioplasty alone.9,10,11,12 However, there were limitations with bare metal stents. With  
restenosis still occurring with su ch rates as  20-40% of coronary lesions after implantation of a standard bare metal stent13, 
frequent repeat revascularization procedures  were required which, in turn,  negatively impact ed patient s’ quality of life as well 
as society’s health care expenditure s.  
 
The introduction of first-generation drug-eluting stents  (DES) , as marked by [CONTACT_749124] [ADDRESS_1024458] resulted in  significantly reduced restenosis and 
need for repeat revascularization.14,15 However, as with many early generation devices, early drug -eluting stents were also not 
without their limitations. Due to concerns that these early generation DES  may be at risk of  increased rates of late (30 days to 
one year) and very late (beyond one year) stent thrombosis, and due to the fact that there was limited clinical evidence  to 
demonstrate safety otherwise,  guidelines initially recommend ed at least a full year of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) 
regimen after DES implantation1617.  This drug regimen was meant to reduce the risk for thrombotic complications after stent 
implantation, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_749098] a thienopyridine. It was only after the technol ogical advancement in 
design and manufacture of newer generation drug -eluting stents, combined with the now available abundance of supportive 
long-term safety data, that clinical practice guidelines have very recently been updated.18,19 Current guidelines ha ve shortened 
the minimum dual -antiplatelet therapy for much  of the DES -treated population from o ne year to six months, with  provisions 
for even shorter dual antiplatelet therapy  for patients at high risk for bleeding. These “ high-bleeding risk ” patie nts are 
estimated to be approximately 15% of those treated, although up to 53%20 of those treated for percutaneous coronary

  intervention may be excluded from all -comer studies. These include  patients previously excluded from DES procedures due 
to age, under lying comorbidities , (i.e., low ejection fraction, chronic renal insufficiency)  and other reasons , who are not able 
to be subjected to  longer term dual antiplatelet therapy use .  
 
In the face of increasingly challenging coronary lesion and vessel anatomies, and with newer generation  drug-eluting stents 
that have established long term safety and effectiveness and are considered to be the  current choice of treatment, Medtronic 
developed the Resolute Onyx  Zotarolimus -Eluting Coronary  Stent  system (Res olute Onyx stent)  to answer the demand for 
more flexible, and highly deliverable devices with enhanced radiopacity  while maintaining the structural integrity needed to  
safely and efficaciously  treat complex disease.  
 
The Resolute Onyx  stent represents Medt ronic’s fourth generation  drug-eluting stent which incorporates thinner stent struts , 
reduced strut lengths, increased strut width to thickness ratio, change to the number of crowns for certain designs,  and 
increased radiopacity over predicate stents,  while retaining the proven characteristics of the Resolute stent. The thinner stent 
struts are expected to  improve acute deliverability performance by [CONTACT_749125]. The increased  
radiopacity improves the acute performance by [CONTACT_749126]. The  zotarolimus drug and 
drug concentration of approximately 1.6 μg/mm2 of stent surface area remain the same  as the predicate Resolute products . 
The BioLinx  polymer,  polymer thickness and drug coating formulatio n also remain the same.  Additional non -clinical data 
may be found in the Resolute Onyx  IFU and Investigator’s Brochure , if applicable .  
 
The RESOLUTE Clinical  Program  provides  clinical evidence on the Resolute Onyx stent  and include s the following:  the 
RESOLUTE ONYX  Core (2.25 mm – 4.0 mm)  Clinical Study and the RESOLUTE Onyx 2.0 mm Clinical Study designed to 
assess the safety and  efficacy of the Resolute Onyx  stent for the treatment  of lesions,  amenable to treatment with a Resolute 
Onyx  2.0 mm stent ( RESOLUTE ONYX  2.0 mm Clinical  Study) and Resolute Onyx  2.25 mm – 4.0 mm stent s (RESOLUTE 
ONYX  Core (2.25 mm – 4.0 mm)  Clinical Study).  
 
The RESOLUTE ONYX Core (2.25 mm – 4.0 mm) Clinical Study outcomes  validated the established safety and 
effectiveness of the predicate Resolute stents. The study met the  primary endpoint of in -stent late lumen loss  (LL) at [ADDRESS_1024459] -procedure as measured by  [CONTACT_263510] (QCA), demonstrating non -inferiority (p < 0.001) 
when compared to  the historical control in -stent late loss value from the RESOLUTE US Angio/IVUS Sub -study .  
 
The RESOLUTE  ONYX  2.0 mm Clinical Study assess es the safety and efficacy of the Resolute Onyx  stent  for the treatment 
of de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with RVD allowing the use of a 2.0 mm diameter stent.  The primary endpoint 
of target lesion failure at 12 months was 5.0%, fulfilling the pre -specified performance criteria.  
 
The RESOLUTE ONYX  Post Approval Study (PAS) will augment the body of evidence supporting the safety  and 
effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx  stent and extend this evidence in a wider global patient population with  the full-size 
matrix of Resolute Onyx (2.0 mm - 5.0 mm diameter sizes).  The study is currently enrolling subjects in the United State s and 
Europe.  
 
Assurance of long term safety and effectiveness data on the Resolute stents is demonstrated in  a post hoc pooled analysis of 
patient -level data from the RESOLUTE Clinical Trial Program , designed to collect robust clinical evidence on the Resolute 
stent in both simple and complex clinical presentations. The p ooled analysis of [ADDRESS_1024460]-
procedural  dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is equally  important , especially when considering the optimal duration of DAPT . 
Prior  ESC recommendation s which were supported by [CONTACT_749127], had 
suggested that DAPT duration  for most patients be 6-[ADDRESS_1024461] a bare metal stent23. 
Also applicable are t he 2016 ACC/AHA guidelines which indicate that in patients at higher risk of bleeding, DAPT

an individual basis and should integrate clinical judgment, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and patient preference.[ADDRESS_1024463] -DES implantati on may be complicated by [CONTACT_749128]’ safety 
(i.e., clinical status, bleeding) or unplanned surgical interventions. For the patient, in addition to a priority of safety a nd well -
being, concerns may stem from individualized preference as w ell as affordability.[ADDRESS_1024464] focused on the terms under which longer -term DAPT may benefit the patient, there is a 
limited selection of clinical research on short DAPT in the contemporary DES. Contemporary evidence from publishe d 
studies that i dentified  patients with high-bleeding risk  from  the LEADERS FREE study, ZEUS study, SENIOR study, and 
the RUDI -Free Registry. These studies included a high -bleeding risk patient population that was reflective of real world use 
and included complex patients such as STEMI. For the Resolute Onyx stent , Medtronic has also conducted detailed analysis 
of the RESOLUTE Clinical Trial P rogram data to better understand the safety outcomes of the Resolute Onyx stent  with one -

  The LEADERS FREE Study compared the Biosensors BioFreedom BA9 DES  with the Biosensors Gazelle Bare Metal 
Coronary Stent in a 1:[ADDRESS_1024466] ug that is crimped on to a rapid exchange delivery catheter system. This prospective, 
blinded trial randomized 2466 high-bleeding risk  (HBR) PCI patients and mandated DAPT for one month  only, followed by 
[CONTACT_7419]-term single anti -platelet therapy. LEADERS FREE  demonstrated that  BioFreedom was superior to a bare -metal stent 
with respect to the primary safety endpoint of cardiac death, MI, definite/probable stent thrombosis and the primary 
effectiveness endpoint  of clinically -driven (CD) target lesion revasculari zation (TLR)  at one year.  
 
At one year, with respect to the primary safety endpoint of cardiac death, MI, and definite/probable ST, the BioFreedom  stent 
had a reported rate of 9.4% vs. the bare metal stent (BMS) rate of 12.9% (p=0.005 for superiority). Individual components of 
safety include the cardiac death rate of 4.2% vs. 5.3%, MI rate of 6.1% vs. 8.9% (p=0.01), and definite/probable ST rate of 
2.0% vs. 2.2% (p=0.70) for the BioFreedom  stent and BMS stent respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint o f CD -TLR 
was reported at 5.1% for the BioFreedom  stent and 9.8% for the BMS comparator  arm (p<0.001 for superiority).   Additional 
secondary efficacy endpoints included urgent TLR rate, 3.3% vs. 5.8% (p=0.004), CD-TLR rate, 5.7% vs. 10.5% (p<0.001), 
any TVR  rate 5.8% vs. 10.9% (p<0.001) and any revasc ularization  rate 9.4% vs. 12.9% (p<0.005) for the BioFreedom  stent 
vs. the BMS arm respectively.27 
 
The ZEUS study compared BMS to the Endeavor zotarolimus eluting stent (ZES).  One of the study’s findings showed  that 
in patients at high-bleeding risk , a treatment strategy of the Endeavor stent followed by a personalized course of DAPT, 
including a 1-month  DAPT therapy, resulted in a lower risk of MACE compared with BMS.28,29  CD/MI rates from the ZEUS 
study  reflected rates expected from a high -bleeding risk population that included stable as well as acute coronary syndrome 
subjects.  
 
The SENIOR trial is a randomized single -blind trial that compared outcomes between BMS and DES in elderly patients with 
a shor t duration of DAPT.30 Results showed that for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular 
events at 1 year, events occurred in 68 (12%) patients in the DES group and 98 (16%) in the BMS. Bleeding complications 
occurred in 26 (5%) in th e DES group and 29 (5%) in the BMS group, and stent thrombosis occurred in 3 (1%) in the DES 
group and 8 (1%) in the BMS group. The authors concluded that among elderly patients who have PCI, a DES and a short 
duration of DAPT is better than BMS and a simi lar duration of DAPT with respect to the occurrent of all -cause mortality, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, and ischemia -driven target lesion revascularization.

  Recently, outcomes from the RUDI -FREE Registry (an observational, single -arm registry of 1103 subjects at 16 Italian 
centers) were presented at the E uroPCR conference in 2017. RUDI -FREE  aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of polymer -
free biolimus -eluting BioFreedom  stent in a real -world , all-comer population, evaluating subjects different from LEADERS 
FREE, ie, not only focusing on high-bleeding risk  patients , and assessing DAPT use . The primary safety endpoint, a 
composite of cardiac death, MI, and definite/probable stent thrombosis at 12 months was 4.1%.  Additionally, at 12 months 
the TLR rate was 1.4%, TVR rate was 1.8%, TVMI rate was 1.0%, def/prob ST rate was 1.1% and a definite ST rate was 
reported at 0.4%. Patient -oriented outcomes included a BARC ≥3 bleed rate of 1.2% and all -cause death of 3.9%. Although 
this study was not a head -to-head comparison, high-bleeding risk  subjects from the RUDI -Free Registry evaluated against the 
LEADERS FREE population for the primary endpoint showed no difference  in the risk of the composite of cardia c death, 
MI, and stent thrombosis (p=0.28). 31 
 
To investigate whether early interruption and/or discontinuation of DAPT after implantation of current -generation DES is 
associated with a higher risk of stent thrombosis, Silber et al., performed a post hoc pooled analy sis of [ADDRESS_1024468] one month of DAPT therapy and stud y a population that includes stable and a cute 
coronary syndrome subjects, including subjects with STEMI, multivessel disease, left main, bifurcations. The trial has 
enrolled over 900 patients as of June 2018 and is expected to complete enrollment by [CONTACT_749129] 2018.  
 
3.2. Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx  stent  in subjects deemed at 
high risk for bleeding and/or medically unsuitable for more than one-month DAPT treatment receiving reduced duration ( one 
month) of DAPT following stent implantation.

  the Resolute Onyx stent receiving DAPT through one month , before transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) 
thereafter .  
 
A total of 700  subjects will be enrolled in the [LOCATION_002],  and 100 subjects may additionally be enrolled in Japan. 
Subjects will be enrolled in up to 70 centers  over a n approximate  10-month  period or until study enrollment is completed. 
Subjects may receive treatment of one or more lesions. Planned s taged procedures within 30 days  of procedure are allowed . 
Subjects who  are enrolled will be considered part of the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population  and followed through for two years  
if they receive Resolute Onyx stent only or exit after one year if they receive other non -study device (e.g. non-Resolute 
Onyx stent, POBA and drug -coated balloon) .  
 
As this study examines the use of the study devices with one-month DAPT , the medication regimen described in this 
protocol should  be strictly adhered to.  Longer or shorter duration of DAPT  use outside the protocol mandated duration  has 
potential impact on the outcomes of the study and will be marked as a study deviation. To prevent or mitigate slow 
enrollment, selection of actively participating study centers and adjusting to a n adequate number  of study centers  will be 
considered . Additionally, e nrollment parameters are included in the study to avoid introduction of bias to the study results.  
 
Key measures taken to minimize potential sources of bias:  
• Enrollment of subjects is limited by i nclusion and exclusion criteria  
• An external, independent Clinical Events Committee  (CEC)  will review and adjudicate, at  minimum, all deaths and 
safety -endpoint related adverse events. Endpoint results will be  based on CEC adjudications  
• An external, indepen dent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB ) will evaluate safety data and advise the 
Sponsor regarding  continued safety of the study to ensure  the well -being of the subjects  
• An independent Angiographic  Core Lab will evaluate baseline and all event angiogr ams 
• Statistical analyses will be independently validated  
• Study centers  are to  follow their institutional procedures for maintenance of angiography and  laboratory equipment 
used for assessing the study variables  
• Study monitors will verify subject  data and ensure compliance with this Clinical Investigation  Plan and other study 
requirements , (e.g., informed consenting processes , event reporting, etc.)  
 
5.1. Duration  
Screening and implant (index) procedures are estimated to take  [ADDRESS_1024470] of care following DES  implantation ; however , the duration of DAPT remains widely debated. 
Whereas patients treated with bare metal stents (BMS) were given one month  of DAPT, following safety concerns with first 
generation DES over increased risk of very late stent thrombosis, the recommended duration was lengthened. However, with 
the technical advancement  of newer generation DES, some of the original concerns, specif ically around polymer 
biocompatibility which formed the basis of these longer DAPT recommendations, are no longer relevant.

incorporates the recent DAPT clinical data to recommend 6 months of DAPT after DES implantation, while shorter DAPT

recommendation ) may be considered in stable patients at  high-bleeding risk  (HBR).[ADDRESS_1024472] 6 months, but current data suggests that 
DAPT discontinuation after 3 months may be reasonable in patients who are at high risk of bleeding (e .g. patients on oral 
anticoagulant therapy) or who are at high risk of severe bleeding complication or who develop significant overt bleeding 
(class IIb).[ADDRESS_1024473] excluded HBR patien ts a population that is estimated at around 15% of PCI patients. 
Studies that enrolled HBR patients specifically have been limited to the ZEUS trial and more recently, the LEADERS -FREE 
Trial. The ZEUS study compared BMS to the Endeavor zotarolimus eluting stent ( DES).  One of the study’s findings showed 
that in patients at high-bleeding risk , a treatment strategy of the Endeavor stent followed by a personalized course of DAPT, 
including a 1-month  DAPT therapy, resulted in a lower risk of MACE compared  with BMS .[ADDRESS_1024474] recent study that 
focused on HBR patients is the LEADERS -FREE trial, which compared the BioFreedom drug -coated stent (DCS) to a bare 
metal stent platform.36 The trial showed superior outcomes with the BioFreedom stent compared to BMS treatmen t in HBR 
patients on a 1-month  DAPT course.   
 
The Resolute Onyx  Zotarolimus -Eluting Coronary S tent System (Resolute Onyx stent)  is the latest iteration of the Resolute 
DES platform . The safety and effectiveness of the Resolute DES product family has been demonstrated in over 17,000 
patients that were studied in the RESOLUTE Global Clinical Program, including over 10 clinical studies and non -
randomized registries. Specifically, in an analysis of 7,618 patients, the Resolute stent demonstrated a low rate of cardiac 
events and a 1.2% stent thrombosis rate through five years  follow -up.[ADDRESS_1024475] and adverse cardiac outcomes. Based on this analysis, the instructions for 
use has the following language approved by [CONTACT_749130]é Européenne (CE mark)  authorities:

  ACC/AHA/SCAI Guidelines for PCI, patients who interrupt or discontinue DAPT medication one month or more 
after stent implantation are considered at low risk and showed no increased risk for stent thrombosis.  
 
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is an accepted high -resolution m ethod to evaluate stent strut coverage a nd 
malapposition once a stent has been implanted. Since incomplete endothelization and positive remodeling has been correlated 
to the incidence of stent thrombosis ,[ADDRESS_1024477] after Resolute stent implantation from the ORION study showed improved early rapid healing with Resolute 
Integrity DES at 2 months (92.2% strut coverage with Resolute compared to 86.5% with BioMatrix, P=0.06), a nd at 3 
months (95.4% vs 86.6%; P=0.004).[ADDRESS_1024478] Study, patients implanted with the Resolute Onyx DES 
demonstrated an excellent early healing profile with an average of 88 % of struts covered by [CONTACT_749131] (new cell 
growth over s tent struts) and 92.3 % of the total stented area showing complete strut coverage at one month41. 
 
Both ESC and ACC guidelines acknowledge that there is limited clinical evidence of dedicated DAPT studies in HBR 
patients, especially with existing stents. The refore, there is a strong need for additional  trials that evaluate the optimal DAPT 
duration in HBR patients undergoing implantation of current generation DES.  
 
The Onyx ONE Clear Study  is a single -arm study that compares the Resolute Onyx stent with a performance goal . The 
purpose of this study is to demonstrate that DAPT can be discontinued at one month  in HBR patients treated with the 
Resolute Onyx stent .  As certain events occurring within the first month after procedure would prevent the subject fro m 
having the option to be treated with one -month DAPT, and since we have seen historically that most events occur within the 
first month42, to help assess for events relevant to the objectives of this study, the primary analysis focuses on a “one -month 
clear” population. To be deemed  one-month clear , subjects need to be event -free of any the following within one month after 
stenting: MI, repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable), and death. Subject must be  
adherent to DAPT for the total 1-month  period, where adherence means without interruption of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] /or P2Y12

Resolute Onyx Stent  
The Onyx stent is similar in design to the Integrity stent and utilizes the same continuous sinusoid manufacturing technology . 
The stent design has been modified to introduce reduced strut dimensions relative to the Integrity stent. The thinner struts 
result in a lower crossing profile which may facilitate easier tracking and crossing to the lesion site, increasing the 
deliverability of the device over the predicate stents. The Onyx stent also has an increased strut width to thickness ratio 
relative to both Integrity and the Driver/MicroDriver stent platform utilized by [CONTACT_749132]. The Onyx  
stent has a strut to width  ratio that allows it to better maintain radial strength. The stent is manufactured from a composite 
wire which has an outer shell of the identical cobalt alloy as used for the Integrity stent and an inner core of a 
platinum/iridium alloy an alternate, mor e radiopaque material.  
 
Resolute Onyx  Delivery System  
The Resolute Onyx  stent is mounted on a Rapid Exchange  or Over -the-Wire delivery system which incorporates design and 
process improvements to provide enhanced deliverability. Additionally, the Resolute  Onyx  delivery system offers an increase  
(from the predicate)  in nominal burst pressure from 9atm to 12atm and an increase in rated burst pressure, from 16atm to 
18atm for the 2.0 mm – 4.[ADDRESS_1024480] pre ssure.  
 
Graphic representation s of the Resolute Onyx R apid Exchange  and Over -the-Wire  delivery system s are presented in Figure 1  
and Figure 2, respectively .

BioLinx Polymer System  
The Resolute Onyx stent polymer coating is identical to its predicates, Resolute Integrity and Endeavor Resolute, and 
consists of an inactive Parylene C primer coa ting and drug -polymer layer containing BioLinx. BioLinx is a blend of the 
proprietary components C10 and C19, and PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone). Collectively, these polymer components do the 
following:  
 
• The Parylene C aids in adhesion of the subsequent drug -polymer layer onto the stent surface  
• The BioLinx controls the elution of zotarolimus from the device.  
 
Zotarolimus Drug Substance  
The therapeutic agent utilized in the Resolute Onyx stent is zotarolimus , a proprietary chemical entity identical to the 
therapeutic agent utilized on the predicate Endeavor Resolute and Resolute Integrity products. It is a tetrazole -containing 
macrocyclic immunosuppressant, and potent antiproliferative agent. The suggested me chanism of action of zotarolimus is to 
bind to FKBP12, leading to the formation of a trimeric complex with the protein kinase mTOR (mammalian target of 
rapamycin) and thus inhibiting its activity. Inhibition of mTOR results in the inhibition of protein pho sphorylation events 
associated with translation of mRNA and cell cycle control. Similar to Resolute Integrity and Endeavor Resolute, the 
function of zotarolimus on the Resolute Onyx stent is intended to reduce the incidence of restenosis in coronary 
interv entions. The Resolute Onyx stent has a nominal drug dose of approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1024481] been proven to reduce the incidence of restenosis 
in coronary inter ventions.

All subjects evaluated for potential PCI should be assessed for study eligibility. A  qualified member of the study center’ s 
research team will review the subject’s medical history and screen for study eligibility. S tudy centers  may be asked to 
maintain a record of each subject screened by [CONTACT_941] s tudy center  along with the reas on(s) for study exclusion.  
 
8.3. Subject Consent  
All subjects must complete a n Informed Consent Form prior  to undergoing any study -related assessments , other than 
procedures conducted per standard treatment at the institution . While consenting should be completed prior to the stent 
placement procedure when possible, subjects may complete informed consent up to [ADDRESS_1024495] (IRB) policies for obtaining informed 
consent.  
 
In advance of the consent discussion, the patient  should receive the IRB and Medtronic -approved Informed Consent Form . 
During the consent discussion, the investigator or his/her designee (only in geographies where allowed) must fully inform the  
patient  of all pertinent aspects and risks of the study.  All items discussed in the Informed Consent Form must be explained 
by [CONTACT_749136].  The language used shall be as non -technical as possible and 
must be understandable, read aloud to the prospective subject and the impartial witness, where applicable. Informed Consent 
Form s should be made available in patient ’s native language.  
 
Where allowed by [CONTACT_8236], in the event that  the patient is unable to provide written informed consent, verbal consent 
from the patient or written assent from a legally acceptable representative will be accepted to facilitate enrollment. The le gal 
representative may provide written consent on behalf  of the patient only after having been fully informed about the registry. 
Where a patient is providing verbal consent, an impartial witness must be present during the entire informed consent 
discussion. Once consent has been given, the witness must sign an d personally date the consent form, to confirm that the 
information contained within the informed consent and any further information provided by [CONTACT_749137]. Where a patient has initially verbally consented 
or a patient’s legally acceptable representative has assented on behalf of the patient, written consent should be sought from 
the patient as soon as, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the patient is capabl e of understanding the process and capable of signing 
the consent form.  
 
Neither the investigator nor the study center  staff shall coerce or unduly influence a patient to participate or to continue to 
participate in the clinical study. The informed consen t process shall not waive or appear to waive the subject’s rights. The  
patient will be provided ample time to read and understand the Informed Consent Form  and to consider participation in the 
study.  All questions about the study should be answered to the satisfaction of the subject.  
 
When the patient decides to participate in the clinical study, the site’s current IRB and Medtronic -approved Informed 
Consent  Form must be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_749138]. If the patient is  consented within 
the allowed time frame after Resolute Onyx DES implantation, the time should be documented along with the date. If 
applicable, a witness shall also sign and personally date the consent form to attest that the information in the Informed 
Consent Form was accurately explained and clearly understood by [CONTACT_423], and that informed consent was freely given.

subject with  a copy of the signed and dated Informed Consent Form . The consent process must  be documented in the 
subject’s medical record.  
 
8.4. Revisions in Subject Consent Form  
Medtronic will inform the investigators whenever information becomes available that may  be relevant to the subject’s 
continued participation in the study. The investigator or designee should inform the subject in a timely manner.  
 
Medtronic will revise the written Informed Consent Form whenever new information becomes available that may be r elevant 
to the subject’s continued participation in the study. The revised information will be sent to the investigator for approval by 
[CONTACT_231010] , if required. After approval by [CONTACT_1201], a copy of this information must be provided to  the 
participating subjects, and the information process as described above, in the section on Subject Consent, needs to be 
repeated.  
 
8.5. Antiplatelet Medications  
Antiplatelet medication dosing  should be administered per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749103]. During the index procedure, heparin or bivalirudin will be 
administered as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109210]. Use of GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa blockers during the index procedure is left to the discretion of 
the investigator. All antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications will be recorded on the eCRF throughout the study. The 
following are the recommendations for antiplatelet tr eatment:  
 
Pre-procedure:  
A loading dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_749104] [ADDRESS_1024497]-procedure to ≤30 days : 
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: daily dose 75 -100 mg  recommended per DAPT guidelines   
• P2Y12 inhibitor: standard daily dose recommended by [CONTACT_749139], with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 75mg once daily, being 
the preferred agent  
 
>[ADDRESS_1024498] -procedure to (indefinite) : 
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 75 -100 mg daily or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg daily  recommended per DAPT guidelines  
 
Note 1: For staged procedures, DAPT schedule will be calculated from the date of the staged procedure . 
Note 2 : Subjects who suffer a stent thrombosis during the first 30 days may be maintained  on DAPT beyond 30 days at the 
investigator’s discretion . 
Note 3 : The clinical profile of subjects included in the study make it unlikely that more  potent antiplatelet  agents  than 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_749105].  Should  this be considered  justified  by [CONTACT_093],  however,  then the dose regimens  of

  other antiplatelets (e.g.  prasugrel  or ticagrelor)  should  follow the regimen  recommended by [CONTACT_749140] . 
Note  4: Subjects  being  treated  with oral anticoagulants  may receive single antiplatelet therapy (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) plus an 
oral anticoagulant from the  date of the index procedure  onwards.  
 
8.6. Medication Adherence  
Patient adherence to  the one-month DAPT regimen is highly important for this study. The investigator and team should take 
extra steps to ensure this is communicated with the patient. To be deemed one -month clear for DAPT discontinuati on at 1-
month , subjects mus t not interrupt aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] /or P2Y12 inhibitor for longer  than [ADDRESS_1024499] also continue on single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after one month of 
DAPT  through the end of the study .  Subjects will be provided a medication reminder card and also instructed to inform the 
investigator and team on any changes in medication including medication stop date, reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_88794], 
medication restart  date, and medication dosage. Dual antiplatelet therapy compliance will be assessed in the clinic at the 1 -
month visit as well as in follow -up contacts and will be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
8.7. Procedure  
Treatment of the target lesion(s) should be performed according to the IFU that is provided with each Resolute Onyx  stent . 
The beginning of the procedure is defined as the time the guide catheter is inserted into the subject.  
 
There is no limitation to the number of treated vessels and lesions. Full lesion c overage will be ensured  by [CONTACT_749141]. Operators are instructed to insert only the Resolute Onyx stent . In the case that multiple stents are 
required, a staged procedure is planned, or revascularization occurs,  the Resolute Onyx stent  should be used. No mixture of 
DES  is permitted in a given subject unless the study stent cannot be placed , in which case the  recommendation would be for 
the operator to use another device  at Investigator’s discretion . 
 
Optimal technique  in placement and in expansion of the assigned DES should be practiced. While recommended, the 
decision to perform predilatation and post dilatation  is left to Investigator’s discretion. In the case it is used, post -dilatation 
should be performed with an appropriately sized (length and diameter) non -compliant balloon to assure that the stent is in full 
contact [CONTACT_198957]. Do not use the stent delivery system for post -dilatation.   
 
If the procedure involves treating a bifurcation lesion, a sing le-stent strategy (the provisional stenting technique ) is 
recommended. This provisional technique recommends stent placement in the main branch , finalized with proximal 
optimization technique, followed by [CONTACT_7581] a second stent if inadequate results are found in the side branch (such as 
threatened closure of the side branch, dissection  type B or worse , cases of TIMI flow <3, or residual stenosis more than 
80%). Provisional stenting is currently sanctioned by [CONTACT_749142]/AHA and ESC revascularization guidelines .[ADDRESS_1024500] 
ancillary devices (e .g., guidewires, sheaths/guiding catheters, pre -dilatation balloons) used during the preparation and 
procedure should be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instr uctions.

This document is electronically controlled    056-F275, v  A Clinical Investigation Plan Template  
  
   
Patients receiving non -study stents, or who undergo any non -study procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease (i.e. 
any procedure other than PCI with Resolute Onyx  stent ), are considered major protocol deviations and will be followed for 
ITT analysis through one year only. The end of the procedure is defined as the time the guide catheter is removed from the 
subject.  
 
At discharge, clinical status will be assessed. Per in formed consent, a letter will be sent to the subject’s referring physician 
providing information on the subject’s participation in the study, including a schedule for follow up time points and 
instructions to transition from DAPT to single antiplatelet the rapy after [ADDRESS_1024501] practice.  
 
8.8. Staged Procedures  
Treatment of all target lesions with the Resolute Onyx stent  within a single PCI is encouraged, if reasonable and safe. 
However, when staging is required for clinical reasons, the staged procedures should be performed within 30 days from  
index procedures  and similar to  index procedure, with a Resolute Onyx stent . A staged procedure is considered a subsequent 
treatment of a lesion in a vessel not treated at index  that is present at the time of the index procedure. Staging should be pre -
specified at the time of the index procedure  and follow -up should be calculated from the date of index procedure . Cardiac 
enzymes should be obtained before and after the staged procedure, with the same steps as that taken for the index procedure. 
Lesions and vessels treated with Resolute  Onyx sten t at the staged procedure are considered target lesions and vessels.  
 
In addition, staged procedures should meet the following requirements:  
• Staged procedures must be pre -specified at index procedure AND completed within 30 days of index procedure to 
qualify as a planned staged procedure. Any additional procedure to the index procedure that does not meet these 
requirements may be considered as a revascularization and follow -up will be based on the timing of index 
procedure.  
• Resolute Onyx s tents should be used at both index and at staged procedure s.  
• Staged procedures in the target vessel (s) treated at index  are NOT allowed.  
• Staging should not involve a segment directly adjacent to a segment treated during the index PCI . 
• Every urgent coronary reintervention before the planned staged procedure is considered an event . 
• Duration of DAPT is one month following the staged procedure . 
• For one -month clear analysis, the “clear” definition should be extended to one month beyond the planned staged  
procedure . 
• Follow -up for the one month and two month time points will be calculated from the date of staged procedure; 
remaining follow ups will be calculated from the index procedure . 
 
8.9. Bailout  
For subjects who consent prior to procedure, bailout procedur es should be avoided unless required for subject safety. If 
bailout procedures are performed, justification should be documented on the eCRF.

MDT18015RES008                                                                    Version  3.[ADDRESS_1024502] in this study experiences a major dissection or an occlusive complication (as evidenced by [CONTACT_749143], chest pain, or ischemic ECG  changes which do not respond to standard rescue techniques), bailout procedures may be 
perform ed. For these events occurring during the study procedure, additional stenting with the Resolute Onyx DES  may be 
employed as a bailout treatment.  In the event a Resolute Onyx DES cannot be implanted, the operator may deploy  another 
device at Investigator’s  discretion to complete the procedure successfully. Subjects with bailout non -study stent (s) will be 
followed for ITT analysis through one year and DAPT is per physician discretion.  
 
Target lesion(s) is/are to be selected with the intent to cover each lesion with a single stent. If incomplete coverage occurs 
during the procedure, additional stenting with assigned study stents may be employed  to provide complete coverage.  
 
Refer to IFU  for procedural  guidelines . 
 
8.10. Treatment Failure  
Study  stent(s) that enter the guide catheter and fail to be implanted at the intended location are considered treatment failures 
and should be recorded in the eCRF . Treatment failures should be followed -up for safety purposes through one year and these 
subjects and lesions will be included in the ITT population  but not the primary analysis . Subjects experiencing total treatment 
failur e (i.e., no Resolute Onyx stent  treatment ) will not be replaced.  After the one-year time frame, total treatment failures 
should be exited from the study.  
 
8.11. Assessment of Effectiveness  
Assessments of effectiveness will include acute device, lesion, and procedural successes as well as adjudication of any 
revascularizations reported through each subject’s follow -up. 
 
8.12. Assessment of Safety  
Reports of all adverse events related to endpoint (including bleeding), SAEs,  adverse device effects and device deficiencies , 
with the return of the dev ice when possible,  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_13735] . The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will 
review and adjudicate  clinical events possibly related to study endpoints that need adjudication throughout the duration of the 
study .  
 
8.13. Recording Data  
Data collected on each subject will be recorded on a web -based eCRF. This  study will utilize an Oracle Clinical Remote Data 
Capture (RDC) system that is the property of Medtronic.  Each enrolled subject is assigned a unique study ID number. 
Records of the s ubject/subject ID  relationship will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452]. Individual subject medical information 
obtained as a  result of this study will be considered confidential.   
 
Authorized site personnel as indicated on the Delegation Task List (DTL) will record the required data on  eCRFs . Study 
personnel delegated for eCRF  completion and/or approval per the DTL  will be trained on the use of the RDC system and 
thereafter be provided with a user name [CONTACT_749178]. Passwords are individual and cannot be shared.  
 
The eCRF s must be completed and updated to reflect the latest observations on the subjects  participating in the study. The 
investigator (or delegated personnel by [CONTACT_1697] ) will electronically sign the  appropriate page s of each eCRF . In the U.S. 
the delegated personnel will be an approved sub -investigator, and in Japan this may be study staff that has been delegated to 
enter information into the electronic data system as a copy from medical records or other materials. The Oracle Clinical RDC

the Instructions for Use.  
 
8.18. Deviation Handling  
A study deviation is defined as an event where the investigator or site personnel did not conduct the  study according to the 
Clinical Investigation Plan, applicable laws or regulations, IRB, or the investigator  agreement.   
 
Regulations require that investigators maintain accurate, complete and current records, including  documentation of any 
deviations from the investigation  plan including the date of and reason for the  deviation. The deviations must be reported to 
the sponsor on the eCRF .  
 
Investigators are required to obtain prior approval from the Medtronic Clinical  Research Department before initiating 
changes in or deviations from the investigation plan, except  wher e necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a 
subject in an emergency. Such approval  will be documented in writing and maintained in the study files.  
 
Deviations shall be reported to Medtronic regardless of whether medically justifiable, pre -approved by  [CONTACT_13735], or taken to 
protect the subject in an emergency. Deviations to protect the life or physical wellbeing  of the subject in an emergency must 
be reported to Medtronic and the IRB within five working  days.  
 
Subject -specific deviations wi ll be reported on the non -compliance eCRF . Deviations that are not subject  specific  (e.g., 
unauthorized use of an  investigational device by a physician who has not signed an Investigator Agreement) will be  reported

  to Medtronic in writing. Investigators will also adhere to procedures for reporting study  deviations to their IRB in accordance 
with their IRB requirements.  
 
The study center ’s compliance with the clinical investigation plan will be assessed on an ongoing  basis. Corrective and 
preventive action  plans will be developed and implemented to secure compliance. In  cases of serious non -compliance, the 
sponsor may decide to stop subject enrollment  and site participation  at an investigational  site based on its assessment  of 
repeated occurrences of signif icant non -compliance.  
 
Examples of deviations include but are not limited to the following:  
• Failure to obtain informed consent prior to participation  
• Incorrect version of the Informed Consent  used 
• Failure to obtain IRB approval before the start of the stud y 
• Treated subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Follow -up visit not done  
• Reportable adverse events not reported in the required time frame as required by [CONTACT_749148]  
• Source data permanently lost  
• Enrollment of patients during lapse of IRB approval  
 
8.19. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation  
A study subject has the right to discontinue participation in the study at any time without penalty or loss  of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled. A  withdrawn subject will be treated according to  standard of medical care and will not be 
replaced. Subjects will be included in the analyses up to the time  that consent was withdrawn.   
 
If an investigator decides to withdraw a subject or if the  subject dec ides to withdraw from the study, the investigator will 
document the reason for withdrawal , if known,  and indicate any rationale for the withdrawal from the study in the subject’s 
file. If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to problems related to the  investigational device, continued follow -up may 
be requested by [CONTACT_749149] . In all other cases, no additional data will be captured after the subject 
withdraws or is removed from the study, unless the information is publicly avai lable. Subjects have the right to withdraw 
from the study at any time without explaining why and without any consequences.  
 
Subject Lost -To-Follow -Up (LTFU) should be avoided as much as possible and investigators are urged to  do their utmost 
best to mainta in subject follow -up compliance. Continuous  attempts ( e.g., phone, email, certified letter) throughout the final 
follow -up period should be made  to contact [CONTACT_423], the subject’s family or referring physician before documenting a 
subject LTFU (at  least three documented attempts must be made). It is recommended that death study databases ( e.g. SSDI)  
should be checked before subjects are considered LTFU. A subject is not considered LTFU until the  subject’s final follow -up 
window has closed. Once a subject  has completed their final follow -up visit, a study exit form must be completed.  
 
 
9. Risks and Benefits

MDT18015RES008                                                                    Version  3.[ADDRESS_1024507] su ggested that major bleeding is correlated with adverse events46, this study balance s the potential risks of 
shorter DAPT  such as a higher risk for thrombotic  complications after stent implantation, with the potential benefit o f reduc ing 
the bleeding risk in  a population that is at high risk for bleeding complications. These “ high-bleeding risk ” patients are 
estimated to be approximately 15% of those treated for PCI and include patients excluded due to age, underlying 
comorbidities, (i.e. low ejection fractio n, chronic renal insufficiency) and other reasons, who are not able to be subjected to 
longer term dual antiplatelet therapy use. In many drug -eluting stent studies, these high-bleeding risk  patients have been 
excluded from the study population.  
 
While the re is early clinical evidence suggesting that the clinical risks around usage of a shorter DAPT treatment after DES 
implantation may be low47, there is limited conclusive evidence in a wider population suggesting short DAPT duration may 
be safe and effectiv e for all patients. However, the high-bleeding risk  population has been identified in published guidelines 
as a subgroup that may be suitable for shorter DAPT compared to other patients treated with DES, with evidence supporting 
DAPT duration as short as one month.48 49 In addition, the LEADERS FREE study was conducted with a population of high-
bleeding risk  patients with the understanding that these included patients with potential to be at higher clinical risk and still 
demonstrated safety and effectiveness with 1-month  DAPT when compared to a bare -metal stent. This high -bleeding risk 
population in the LEADERS FREE study included subjects who had clinical or anatomic features that posed a higher ischemic 
risk, including  subjects who  had multivessel disease ( 1493 /2399  (62.2%)), ACS  (659/2432  (27.1%)), diabetes (805/2427 
(33.2%) ), hypertension (1913/2427 (78.8%)) , bifurcation (15.5%), in -stent restenosis (2.5%)  and chronic total occlusion 
(4.7%) . While rates of adverse clinical outcomes were higher in these subgroups as compared to treatment of simple lesions, 
the investigators did not find patients to be at higher risk in these subgroups that would trigger concern. These data were p re-
specified and also publi shed by [CONTACT_749150].50 51 Given that the Onyx ONE Clear Study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are similar to that of LEADERS FREE, it is expected that similar proportions will be enrolled and 
have clinical or anatomic features that pos e a hig her ischemic risk.  
 
In addition, the study design will minimize the risks through observance of strict study center and investigator selection 
criteria, careful subject selection and management, rigorous adherence to a standardized schedule of evaluations  and adverse 
event monitoring. Risks may be further limited by [CONTACT_749151]. The 
investigators  are also expected to perform continuous monitoring, assessment and documentation of any risks. The device 
used in this study is commercially available  and ha s a proven safety record.

subjects are enrolled, and by [CONTACT_749153] -up of the subject are consistent with current me dical 
practices.  
 
9.2. Risks Related to Devices  
The risks associated with using the  study  device are related to the drug, the stent materials , and risks associated with 
standard percutaneous coronary diagnostic and treatment procedures.  
 
As outlined in t he commercially available IFU for the study device, physicians should make decisions about duration of 
DAPT on an individual basis and should integrate clinical judgment, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and subject 
preference.  While there are no new risks identified  specific for this study, risks from product commercial IFU include the 
following:  
 
Percutaneous Coronary Diagnostic and Treatment Procedures  
Risks associated with using these products are those associated with percutaneous treatment procedures for a stenotic coronary 
artery. The complications relating to standard PTCA and stenting include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Abrupt vessel closure  
• Access site pain, hematoma or hemorrhage  
• Allergic reaction to anti -coagulation and/or anti -thrombotic therapy, contrast material, or stent and/or delivery 
system materials, drug, and polymer coating  
• Aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula  
• Arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation)  
• Balloon rupture  
• Bleeding  
• Cardiac tamponade   
• Coronary artery occlusion, perforation, rupture, or dissection  
• Coronary artery spasm

  • Peripheral ischemia / peripheral nerve injury  
• Renal  failure  
• Shock / pulmonary edema  
• Stable or unstable angina  
• Stent deformation, collapse, or fracture  
• Stent migration or embolization  
• Stent misplacement   
• Stroke or transient ischemic attack  
• Thrombosis (acute, sub -acute,  or late) 
 
Additional Potential Risks Related to Resolute Onyx  stent  
Additional potential adverse events that have been associated with zotarolimus include but are not limited to:  
• Anemia   
• Diarrhea  
• Dry Skin  
• Headache  
• Hematuria  
• Infection  
• Injection site reaction

additional risks may include , but are not limited to , the following:  
• Allergic reaction  
• Focal inflammation at the site of stent implantation  
• Restenosis of the stented artery  
 
9.3. Potential Benefits  
Clinical practice guidelines have been updated recently to reduce the duration of DAPT after technological advancements in 
design and manufacture of newer generation DES, while leveraging the now available abundance of supportive long -term 
safety data of currently marketed DES. This  study identifies a specific population which may benefit from shorter DAPT 
treatment due to a high risk for bleeding. Ris k of major bleeding may prevent these patients f rom receiving a DES and limit 
treatment to a POBA or a bare -metal stent  which may not be the preferred treatment . Reducing the duration of DAPT to one 
month may allow high bleeding patients  to be treated with  a DES  as it may reduce the bleeding risks for this patient 
population. Recent evidence such as presented on the LEADERS FREE trial relating to the occurrence of major bleeding to 
higher mortality rates suggests also that shorter DAPT may have a positive i mpact on the risk of the patient to have adverse 
events.[ADDRESS_1024510] to the use of the Resolute 
Onyx  stent system s with a specific time frame for DAPT . As highlighted by [CONTACT_749154]/EACTS and 
ACC/AHA guidelines on DAPT, the generation of clinical evidence supporting recommendations on DAPT duration in 
                                                            
[ADDRESS_1024511] -DES implantation may be 
complicated by [CONTACT_749155] ( e.g., clinical status, bleeding) or unplanned surgical interve ntions. For the 
patient, in addition to a priority of safety and well -being, concerns may stem from individual ized preference as well as 
affordability.  
 
Importantly, as highlighted by [CONTACT_148188], decisions about duration of DAPT are best made on a n individual basis and 
should integrate clinical judgement, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and patient preference.  However, there are strong 
potential benefits for the subject, especially one that is at higher risk for bleeding or who would otherwis e not be able to 
receive treatment with a DES.  
 
9.4. Risk  Benefit Rationale  
Appropriate risk management activities have been performed on the Resolute Onyx stent , resulting in a positive risk -to-
benefit rationale as confirmed by [CONTACT_749156].  
 
Ultimately, it is the balance between the need for DAPT use after DES implantation and the risk for bleeding that provides 
the ba sis for this study. Based on our curre nt knowledge, while the included patient population is at higher risk for bleeding, 
participation in  this study does not impose significant additional risks to the subject when compared to the existing DAPT 
treatment regime based on current guidelines  and clinical evidence that has been obtained in recent studies , including 
LEADERS FREE . Subjects at high-bleeding risk s may benefit from a shorter duration of DAPT due to the reduced risk of 
bleeding events  and potential s equelae  that exist with prolonged DAPT. As recent studies have shown that the occurrence of 
major bleeding events can be linked to higher rates of mortality, the opportunity to reduce the risk of such bleeding events is 
important to patient safety. Further more, the use of DES compared to bare -metal stents has been compared in many studies 
and have led to general consensus that DES is preferred to bare -metal stents. Under these premises, the availability of clinical 
evidence on short DAPT use in a high -bleed ing risk population provides opportunities for patients for potentially safer 
treatment.  In this carefully selected population of patients with high risk for bleeding, i t is anticipated that the potential 
benefits of the study outweigh the potential risks .

10.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  
Investigators are required to report  adverse events and device deficiencies as described in the table below , from the start of 
procedure until subject’s exit from the study . Reportable adverse events  will be reported to the sponsor and documented on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and in the subject’s medical records. All assessments prior to subject enrollment are considered 
standard of care.  
 
Reportable events will be followed until the event has resolved (i n the case of permanent impairment, the  event will be 
followed until it stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained).  The investigator will report events that may 
occur to the Sponsor, and will assess seriousness,  relationship ( related ness to the device, procedure and therapy  where 
applicable), subsequent intervention required,  resolution status and whether or not the adverse event resulted in the subject’s 
discontinuation from the  study. The following table outlines the five different levels of causality for every  adverse event  to be 
classified against.  
 
Table 8. Causality Assessment53 
Not related  Relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when:  
 - the event is not a known54 side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar 
devices and procedures;  
 - the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or the 
procedures;  
 - the serious event does not follow a known response patt ern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
 - the discontinuation device  application or the reduction  of the level of activation/exposure – 
when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
 - the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected  by [CONTACT_10398];  
 - the serious event can be attributed to another cause ( e.g., an underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors);

In addition, investigators are obliged to report appropriate adverse events to their IRB in accordance with the requirements 
and local regulations.  
 
All events and complaint reporting will be reviewed by [CONTACT_13735]. This process is part of postmarket  vigilance. Medtronic 
will review and report all repor table events (including device deficiencies) according to national regulations in acceptably 
timely conditions. For events, this review will include the determination whether the SAE meets  regulatory reporting 
requirements. The Sponsor will ensure timely S AE reporting to meet global  regulatory requirements. The Medtronic 
employee who first becomes aware of an SAE/Device Deficiency related to a Medtronic device will immediately report this 
device -related SAE/Device Deficiency to the Medtronic Product Experience  Management (PXM) Galway, Ireland. The 
Medtronic PXM  Galway,  Ireland will ensure prompt review, and appropriate reporting.  
 
10.3. Recording and Reporting of Device Deficiencies  
Device deficiencies are defined as inadequacy of a medical device with resp ect to its identity, quality,  durability, reliability, 
safety or performance. Device deficiencies include  malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.   
 
Malfunction is defined as the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or other wise perform as intended. 
Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device.  The intended performance of a device 
refers to the intended use for which the device is labeled or  marketed. Product labels, Instructions for Use, User Manuals , and 
if appropriate an IB,  for this study  are provided separately.

could have led to a serious adverse device effect (SADE) (i.e., if suitable action had not been taken, if intervention had no t 
been made, or i f the circumstances had been less fortunate) require immediate reporting. All report able device deficiencies 
and malfunctions will be documented on the appropriate eCRF , one form for each deficiency,  and further reported to the IRB 
(if required) within the IRB required timeframe and  local and national regulations.  
 
 
10.4. Emergency Contact [CONTACT_749159]. Sponsor contact [CONTACT_3031] (including name, title, address, and  telephone number(s) is subject to

For reportable AEs or device deficiencies that require immediate reporting (see Table 7), initial reporting shall be done by 
[CONTACT_338858] . If the eCRF  is not available  during the required reporting perio d, the reportable AE or 
device deficiency should be reported to Medtronic by [CONTACT_749160], such as the responsible site manager . In due time,  the 
reportable AE or device deficiency needs to be entered in the eCRF  as well.  
 
 
11. Data Review Committees  
 
11.1. Clinical Event Committee  
The Clinical Event Committee (CEC) is composed of  independent  cardiologists who are not participants in the  study. The 
CEC is charged with the development of specific criteria used for the categorization of clinical  events and clinical endpoints 
in the study. Criteria will be established for selected complications and  clinical events. At the onset of the study, the CEC will 
establish explicit rules outlining the minimum  amount of data required, and the algorithm followed in orde r to classify a 
clinical event. The CEC will  meet regularly to review and adjudicate pre -defined clinical endpoint events. If needed, the 
adjudication  committee will require collection of additional source documentation from the clinical centers. The  proce dures 
by [CONTACT_749161] a separate CEC charter . 
 
11.2. Data Safety and Monitoring Board  
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will evaluate safety data on an ongoing basis and advise Medtronic about 
the continuing safety o f the study, to ensure the well -being of the current participants and those yet to be enrolled as well as 
the continuing validity and scientific merit of the study. The primary responsibility of the DSMB is to monitor the health, 
safety, and welfare of subjects. The DSMB will be composed of physicians  from the fields of cardiology and interventional 
cardiology and at least  one biostatistician with experience in analysis of clinical studies . The members of the DSMB will not 
be investigators in the study and will be independent of Medtronic.  
 
Prior to the first DSMB review, guidelines for the identification and evaluation of significant safety findings and/or increased 
frequency of events that may impact the  rights, safety or welfare of subjects will be established. All materials, discussions, 
and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential.  The proceedings of each DMSB meeting will be recorded in

continue as planned, specify a modification, or termination) to Medtronic and the Study Principal Investigators . All final 
decisions, regarding study  modifications rest with the Executive Committee and Sponsor.  Details around the procedures of 
the DSMB are documented in a separate DSMB charter.  
 
11.3. Executive Commit tee 
The Executive Committee is composed of the study governance members including the study leadership and committee 
members. Their  role is to provide overall supervision of the study, advise in study design , provide feedback on current 
practice and to assist in communications with clinical investigational sites.  This committee will meet periodically by 
[CONTACT_749162], including subject enrollment, clinical site progress, and 
protocol compliance. The Executive committee will also be responsible for reviewing the final results and determining the 
methods of presentation and publication.  
 
12. Statistical Design and Methods  
 
The Onyx ONE  Clear Study  is a prospective, multi -center,  single arm  study for a commercially approved product . A total of 
700 US subjects deemed at high risk for bleeding and/or medically unsuitable for more than one month  DAPT treatment will 
be treate d with the Resolute Onyx  stent and studied for a one month  DAPT treatment . Additionally,  100 subjects may be 
enrolled in Japan . 
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical safety of the Resolute Onyx stent as compared to the Performance Goal ( PG) 
with use of one-month DAPT in subjects deemed at high risk for bleeding and/or medically unsuitable for more than one-
month  DAPT treatment.  
 
12.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint in this trial is the composite of cardiac death  and myocardial  infarction  at one year for a one -month 
clear population  [timeframe:  one month to one year].  
 
12.1.1.  Primary Hypothesis  
The primary endpoint of the study will be compared to a PG of 9.7%. The study hypotheses are:  
H0: π ≥ 9.7%  
HA: π < 9.7%  
Where π denotes the binary rate of cardiac death and myocardial infarction at one year in a one-month clear population  
[timeframe: one month to one year] . This one -sided test will be carried out at the 0.[ADDRESS_1024519].  
 
12.1.2.  Hypothesis  
Based on historical short DAPT studies with high -bleeding risk patient populations (LEADERS FREE, ZEUS, and 
SENIOR), the weighted average of cardiac death and myocardial infarction at one year was 9.6%. As disproportionally 
higher rates of STEMI, unstable angina, and multi -vessel disease were identified in the ZEUS study population which could 
have led to a higher rate of cardiac death , the ZEUS rate was revised. Similarly, the SENIOR rate contribution was derived 
from the published rates based on subjects with planned one-month DAPT use.

Approximately 3% of CD/MI events occurred in LEADERS FREE study at 30 days. To account for a “ one-month clear” 
population, the weighted CD/MI rate at 12 months will be discounted by 3%, resulting in an average rate of 6.6%. In 
addition, to account for the 3% population that will also be removed from the denominator of the rates, the expected CD/MI 
rate between 30 days and one year is more accurately represented a s 6.8%.  
 
The performance goal  (9.7%)  incorporated  a clinically acceptable margin of 2.9% to the expected rate.  
 
In defining a “ one-month clear” population, an attrition rate of 20% will be applied to account subjects who interrupted or 
discontinued DAPT (greater than 3 cumulative days) within the first one month  of procedure, who were excluded due to 
events that would prohibit them from discontinuing DAPT beyond one month , who failed to transition from DAPT to SAPT 
one mo nth after procedure, and who were  lost to follow -up. Peri-procedural MIs will not exclude the patient from being 
considered as “one month clear”. For the secondary endpoints like TLF, all available biomarkers (including peri -procedural) 
will be forwarded t o the CEC to be used towards the adjudication of events.  
 
12.1.3.  Sample Size Calculation and Methods  
Assuming a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a true event rate of 6.8%, an effective sample size of 1360  subjects will yield 
a greater than 97% power to reject the null hypothesis. Assuming a 20% attrition rate, a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1024520] completed  their one year follow up will al so 
be included in the primary analysis.   
 
12.2. Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT): All subjects who signed the informed consent with an attempted implant procedure.  Time zero begins 
at the date of the  index procedure.  
 
Primary Analysis : ITT subjects who are one -month clear and received the Resolute O nyx stent only .  Time zero begins at  the 
date of the  index  procedure.  
 
 
12.3. General Analysis Overview  
Descriptive statistics of continuous outcomes will be presented with sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. All statistical analyses 
will be  performed using SAS for Windows (version 9.1 or higher) or other widely accepted statistical or graphical  software. 
Patient data listings and tabular and graphical presentations of results will be provided. Statistical analyses will be 
independently validated. Additional details on the analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for this 
study.

  12.4. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
Cardiac death and myocardial infarction will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]. The CD/MI rate  at one year in a one -month clear 
population  [timeframe: one month to one year]  will be compared with the performance goal of 9.7% , with a one -sided 
binomial  exact test at the 0.025 significance level. The analysis  for the primary endpoint  will be performed in ITT subjects 
who are one -month clear and received the Resolute Onyx stent only . 
12.5. Analysis o f Secondary Endpoints  
For secondary endpoints, event /success  rates, and 95% two-sided confidence interval will be provided. The time -sensitive 
nature of any response variable may be displayed by [CONTACT_2329] a Kaplan -Meier plot.  Further details on the secondary endpoints 
will be inclu ded in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
12.6. Analysis of Baseline Characteristics  
All clinically relevant baseline variables will be tabulated and reported. Categorical variables will be reported  using counts 
and percentages, and continuous variables will be reported by [CONTACT_749163],  the mean, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum values.  
 
12.7. Analysis of Subgroups  
Subgroup analyses of  the primary endpoint include  but are not  limited to  the following patient ch aracteristics. Further details 
on subgroup analysis are included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
• Acute Coronary Syndrome

12.9. Additional Analysis  
There may be additionally  100 subjects enrolled in Japan. Once all enrolled subjects (US and Japan) have had the chance to 
complete  1-year follow up, an additional report ( including subjects from Onyx ONE Clear as well as the Onyx -arm of Onyx 
ONE  Global Study ) may be prepared as requested by [CONTACT_47921].  
 
12.10.  Missing Data   
Deviations from original statistical plan will be avoided, and e very effort will be undertaken to minimize missing data. In 
time-to-event outcomes, dropouts wil l be censored at the time of discontinuation, consistent with the Kaplan -Meier approach. 
Unless otherwise  specified, no statistical techniques will be used to impute missing data for continuous or categorical  
outcomes. The number of subjects included in each analysis will be reported so that the reader can  assess the potential impact 
of missing data.  Further details are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

9.1 Potential Ris ks This high -bleeding risk population in the LEADERS 
FREE study included complex lesion subgroups such 
as in the senior and in ACS (STEMI/NSTEMI) 
patient population.  While rates of adverse clinical 
outcomes were higher in these subgroups as compared 
to treatment of simple lesions, the investigators did not 
find patients to be at higher risk in these subgroups that 
would trigger concern. These data were pre -specified 
and also published by [CONTACT_749174].  This high -bleeding risk population in the LEADERS FREE study 
included subjects who had clinical or anatomic features that 
posed a higher ischemic risk, including subjects who had 
multivessel disease (149 3/2399 (62.2%)), ACS (659/2432 
(27.1%)), diabetes (805/2427 (33.2%), hypertension (1913/2427 
(78.8%)), bifurcation (15.5%), in -stent restenosis (2.5%) and 
chronic total occlusion (4.7%).  While rates of adverse clinical 
outcomes were higher in these subgroups as compared to treatment 
of simple lesions, the investigators did not find patients to be at 
higher risk in these subgroups that would trigger concern. These 
data were pre -specified a nd also published by [CONTACT_749175]. Given that the Onyx ONE Clear Study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are similar to that of LEADERS 
FREE, it is expected that similar proportions will be enrolled 
and have clinical or anatomic features that pose a higher 
ischemic risk.   Modification  Added proportions of 
enrolled subjects who had 
clinical or anatomic features 
that pose a higher ischemic 
risk in LEADERS FREE 
study and an estimate of 
similar proportion of this 
population in the current 
study

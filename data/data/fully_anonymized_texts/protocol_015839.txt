1.0 Background And Rationale  
 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
 
Germ cell tumors (GCT) are highly sensitive to chemotherapy such that even with 
metastatic  disease at diagnosis, many patients can be cured —greater than 90% 5- year 
overall survival —at the time of diagnosis1.  The International Germ Cell Consensus 
Classification divides patients based on risk factors into good, intermediate and poor 
prognostic categories to better estimate outcomes [Appendix I]2.  Many patients who 
fall into the poor risk category or other patients who relapse are successfully 
salvaged with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant 
(AuSCT)3-6.   
 
Beyer and colleagues analyzed [ADDRESS_864013] treated with AuSCT7.  Four factors 
were found to be important in multivariate analysis (Beyer Index):   
• progressive disease after salvage therapy immediately prior to transplant  
• absolute cisplatin refractory disease (defined as progressive increase in ser um 
markers despi[INVESTIGATOR_645422] -going cisplatin chemotherapy) or cisplatin refractory disease 
(defined as disease progression within [ADDRESS_864014] cycle of chemotherapy)  
• an hCG level of > 1000 IU/L  
• primary mediastinal non -seminomatous GCT  
 
Patients with mo re than 2 of these factors were considered poor risk with a 2 year 
relapse free survival of only 5% versus 51% for patients with no risk factors and 27% 
in patients with [ADDRESS_864015]
4,9.  Interestingly, in the initial prognostic study by [CONTACT_645433], only 20% of 
patients were treated with two transplants.  An initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_645423], demonstrated feasibility of tandem high -dose che motherapy with AuSCT in a cohort 
of patients with either high -risk primary disease in partial response or platinum -
sensitive relapse
9.  Both conditioning cycles consisted of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and 
etoposide (ICE).  Treatment related mortality was zero and at almost [ADDRESS_864016] looked at sequential 
therapy with regimens including paclitaxel, a drug found effective in cisplatin-
refractory patients10.   A recent study utilized paclitaxel in both conditioning 
regimens in 33 patients11.  At a med ian follow -up of 5 years, 36% of patients were 
Auto PBSCT in GCT  
 
7/12/2019 Page 7 of 29 confidentia l alive without disease although only 2 (18%) patients with a Beyer index of ≥ [ADDRESS_864017] differing 
mechanisms of action and differing resistance patterns as high dose therapy.  This 
would permit tumor kill prior to development of further resistance.   
 
Mobilization of sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells may not occur i n 
all patients.  For those patients collecting ≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg but < 4 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg, only a single transplant can safely be performed.  However, it would 
be inappropriate to deny them AuSCT which is a demonstrated salvage regimen with 
potential for cure.  This protocol accounts for this possibility by [CONTACT_1541] a 
treatment option for patients with insufficient PBSC collection for tandem transplantation.  The conditioning regimen for the single transplant is identical to the 
conditioning reg imen of Transplant [ADDRESS_864018]

End organ toxicities such as myelosuppression often dictate the maximal doses of 
chemotherapy that can be administered safely.  Autolog ous peripheral blood stem 
cell transplant (AuSCT) after high -dose chemotherapy circumvents this marrow 
toxicity allowing for dose intensification.  This has been demonstrated to be useful in 
the salvage setting for patients with relapsed germ cell tumor ( GCT)3-[ADDRESS_864030]  
2.2.3 Evaluate time to engraftment of neutr ophils and platelets for each 
transplant  
2.2.4 Determine numbers of patients unable to adequately mobilize 
sufficient peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for tandem transplant  
2.2.5 Identify prognostic factors of those patients unlikely to mobilize sufficient PBSC for tandem transplant  
2.2.6 Compare outcomes of overall and disease free survival for patients 
undergoing single versus tandem transplant due to biologic 
randomization

5 T
REATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 G-CSF Mobilization of Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Stem Cells  
 
Patients will be treated with Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) 
10µg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest vial size)  beginning [ADDRESS_864040] aphereresis . 
 
Begin peripheral blood stem cell collection per section 5.2 on day 5 of G -CSF 
mobilization.  
 
5.2 Peripheral blood stem cell collection  
 Daily peripheral blood stem cell collection will continue for a minimum of 3 
days unless the goal of 10 x 10
6 CD34+/kg is reached earlier.  
 
Minimum collection criteria for continuing co llection:  
The first collection  must yield ≥ 0.1 x 106 CD34 cells/kg  
After the second collection a total of ≥ 0.3 x 106 CD34 cells/kg must have 
been collected.  If either of these conditions is not met, apheresis is 
discontinued and the subject will begin Chemotherapy Mobilization per 
section 5.3.   
 
Total cell collection of  ≥ 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  
A total cell collection of ≥ 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  is considered sufficient for 
the tandem transplant (Transplant 1 plus Transplant 2).  The collected PBSC 
will be cryopreserved such that  approximately 50% of the leukapheresed 
product can be thawed and infused for each transplant .  Patient will proceed to 
transplant 1 per section 5.4. 
 
Total cell collection of  ≥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  but < 4 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg  
If patients cannot be adeq uately collected with GCSF mobilization  (< 4 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg ) Chemotherapy M obilization will be done  per section 5.3.

5.3 Chemotherapy Mobilization and cell collection (for patients with a total cell 
collection of < 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg)  
 
 
Chemotherapy  mobilization:  
Mesna  800mg/m2 IV  
Cyclophosphamide  4gm/m2 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours  
Mesna  800mg/m2 IV 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 12 hours following the 
cyclophosphamide  
G-CSF  10µg/kg/day (rounded to nearest vial size) beginning 72 hours 
after com pletion of cyclophosphamide (day 4) and continuing  until 
leukapheresis is completed  
 
The dose  of cyclophosphamide will be calculated using actual body 
weight unless the patient is ≥120% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in which 
case, the Cyclophosphamide dose wi ll be based on Adjusted Ideal Body 
Weight (AIBW) . 
 
IBW men =  50kg + 2.3kg (inches of height over 60in)  
IBW women  = 45kg + 2.3kg (inches of height over 60in)  
 
AIBW = IBW + 1/3(ABW -  IBW)  
 
Standard Cyclophosphamide hydration orders will be used. 
 
Monitor CBC daily starting on day 4.  Leukapheresis will start on the first 
day following an absolute neutrophils count (ANC) ≥ 700/µL . 
 
Minimum collection criteria for continuing collection:  
The first collection  must yield ≥ 0.1 x 106 CD34 cells/kg  
After the second collection a total of ≥ 0.3 x 106 CD34 cells/kg  must have 
been collected.   
If patient has received chemotherapy mobilization and the minimum criteria cannot be met, the cell collection should be stopped.  If the patient has collected > 2 x 10
6 CD34 cells/kg with the combined apher eses, the patient is 
eligible for a single transplant.  If the total collections are < 2 x 106 CD34 
cells/kg, the patient is removed from study, and other treatment options 
discussed.

6.1.[ADDRESS_864046] to Transplant 2 (see 
section 3.11) then all required observations for Transplant 1 will continue.   
6.1.2 If the patient is eligible for Transplant 2 between day +30 and day +90, then the required observations for Tr ansplant 2 will become effective at 
the time eligibility is determined.  If the patient has had investigations performed (i.e. serum tumor markers on day +42) within the 2 weeks prior to admission for Transplant 2 (day +50 scheduled admission), these will not need repeated and the values obtained from the Transplant 1 observations will be used. 
 
6.2 Staging studies prior to enrollment to define the extent of disease will include unilateral bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645424], PET/ CT 
scans of  chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain, serum tumor markers including AFP, 
β-hCG, and LDH  
 
If patient has had no prior bone marrow involvement , then bone marrow 
biopsies will be performed to determine eligibility and then at yearly intervals unless otherwise cl inically indicated.  
 
6.3 Imaging will be performed prior to enrollment in study; at Day +28, at Day +100, at Day +180, at [ADDRESS_864047] -

10.1 Primary Clinical Endpoint: Probability of one year survival for 
tandem AuSCT  
 
10.[ADDRESS_864057]  
10.2.3 Probability of  engraftment of neutrophils and platelets  
10.2.4 Determine numbers of patients unable to adequately mobilize sufficient 
peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for tandem transplant  
10.2.5 Identify prognostic factors of those patients unlikely to mobilize sufficient PBSC for tandem transplant  
10.2.6 Compare outcomes of overall and disease free survival for patients undergoing single versus tandem transplant due to biologic randomization 
 
10.3 Statistical Analysis  
 Survival and disease -free survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. 
Engraftment will be estimated by [CONTACT_645437]. 95% confidence intervals will be used to make inferences. Comparison of survival and disease free survival between patients receiving single versus tandem transplant will be completed by [CONTACT_63450] -rank test or left descriptive 
depending on patient numbers. The toxicity rate and analysis of prognostic factors 
will be descriptive using proportions.

a SEER incidence rate of testicular cancer in 2003 of 5.3/100,[ADDRESS_864059] will be anticipated eligible for this study.  50- 60% of patients are 
expected to receive a tandem AuSCT. Assuming that we enroll the maximum number of 25, we will then have 15 patients among the tandem patients to get a n 
estimate of the survival. Assuming a survival estimate of 0.5, the 95% confidence bandwidth will have a width of 0.5.

tolerated level of 15% among the tandem AuSCT, the trial will be halted and 
reviewed if [ADDRESS_864062] 15 evaluable patients. 
  
11 Retention of Records 
 
The investigator will retain study records, including source data, copi[INVESTIGATOR_235838], study drug receipt and dispensation, and all study correspondence indefinitely in a secured facility.   In addition, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will 
keep a master log of all patients participating in the study, with sufficient information to allow retrieval of the medical records for that patient.  
 Research data is collected in the BMT database indef initely.

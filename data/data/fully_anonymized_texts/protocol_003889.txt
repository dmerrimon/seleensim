 OBJECTIVES:  
(Describe  the purpose,  specific  aims,  or objectives.  State  the hypotheses  to be tested.) 
 
 
Chronic back pain (CBP) can last from months to a lifetime, severely impacting patients’ quality 
of life. Based  on our human brain  imaging  studies  and preclinical  findings,  the hippocampus  and 
its network are associated with pain and pain experience in patients with chronic pain. In this 
study we aim to test whether a non -invasive enhancement of dorsal hippocampus activity leads 
to networks alteration that can modulate pain in CBP patients. 
 
Aim 1: To investigate  whether  a novel  target,  dorsal  hippocampus,  indirectly  stimulated using 
high frequency rTMS, will lead to an increase in hippocampal network connectivity that can modulate pain, as compared a sham control rTMS, in CBP patients.  
 
We h ypothesize that changes in pain from baseline to post- stimulation will be superior for 
hippocampal- target  than for control  stimulation  (sham). Pain is primarily  assessed by [CONTACT_711937]; additional  questionnaires  will be used as secondary  exploratory 
outcomes.  
BACKGROUND:  
Pain is the primary reason why people seek healthcare. Everyday millions of Americans are either partially or totally disabled due to pain. If untreated, this pain can lead to depression, 
insomnia, depressed immune function, changes in eating patterns, impaired cognitive function, 
and other  long- term deleterious  effects  commonly  associated  with chronic  pain
1–3 . Chronic  back 
pain constitutes the major form of chronic pain, with a prevalence as high as 70 -85% in adults 
at some time in their lives 4. In the US, low back pain is the most common cause of activity 
limitation in adults younger than [ADDRESS_968350] that low  back pain is one of 
the major  - if not the major  - cause  of work  absence,  and therefore  results  in a significant  burden 
to both the economy and health care system.  
Current treatments for CBP involve the use of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, 
antidepressants,  and/or  anticonvulsants  or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  These carry  relatively  high risks yet show 
limited success rates6, leading investigators to explore non- invasive interventions that in 
combination with conventional treatments, may produce greater pain relief in CBP 7,8. 
Chronic back pain is associated with many negative affective mood disorders 9, and cumulative 
evidence suggests an association of hippocampal  networks  and chronic  pain.  Previous  research 
performed by [CONTACT_711938], and hippocampal mechanisms such as diminished hippocampal neurogenesis 
10. Moreover, abnormal glutamatergic activity was previously described in animal 
chronic pain models and bilateral hippocampal deactivation during innocuous stimulation in neuropathic  patients  
11,12. Therefore,  our group  conducted an animal  study  using  chemogenetics 
or direct  GLU injection to increase  dorsal  hippocampal  glutamatergic  activity and modulate pain. 
This demonstrated the analgesic effects of hippocampal stimulation; since increases in 
excitability of dorsal hippocampal neurons altered resting state connectivity (rsfMRI) within 
hippocampal networks that are specifically related to neuropathic behavior (tactile allodynia), 
thus indicating the potential for hippocampal stimulation in the management of chronic pain 13. 
Considering  the previously  established role of the hippocampus  in pain perception,  and its

 morphological changes in chronic pain, there is now impetus for investigating hippocampal 
excitation in chronic  pain relief.  With this in mind,  we reason that in humans,  by [CONTACT_711939], we can directly target chronic pain.  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to indirectly stimulate the dorsal hippocampus to increase 
hippocampal connectivity and modulate pain. We will use rTMS to stimulate an area of the parietal cortex with high functional connectivity to the hippocampus, using seed- based 
connectivity  analysis  of rsfMRI  data,  in order  to modulate hippocampal- mediated networks.  It is 
notable that targeting hippocampal excitability using rTMS is an approach that we have 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_214669]. The hippocampus is not directly accessible to rTMS. We use cortical “access 
windows”,  which  are stimulation-accessible areas  of the cortex  that have  high connectivity  with 
the hippocampus and therefore stimulation applied to these areas can indirectly influence the 
hippocampus. In several experiments. We have shown that this method increases excitability 
and rsfMRI connectivity of dorsal hippocampus, leading to long -lasting improvements in 
hippocampal- dependent function
14–17. We hypothesize that dorsal hippocampal stimulation will 
lead to analgesic effects in CBP.  
In line with the promising  preclinical  results  we report,  in this study  we will collect  preliminary 
data to systematically test whether the modulation of hippocampal network changes the experience of pain in CBP patients.  
STUDY  ENDPOINTS  
This is a mechanistic study; therefore, the main study aim is to show that the hippocampal 
stimulation  leads  to functional  connectivity  changes  across  series  of hippocampal networks  and 
how these connectivity changes are correlated with pain decrease.  
The secondary  outcome  will be changes  in pain ratings.  The effects  of the brain stimulation  will 
be measured by [CONTACT_711940] (painApp) and questionnaires, using our in- house pain app. 
As we collect these outcomes repeatedly, we will have changes in pain immediately after the 
stimulation session and also over  the next 2- weeks.We will test immediate and 2 -weeks 
changes  in painApp ratings  relative  to baseline.  Questionnaire analyses,  and other  time course 
analyses of painApp data will be treated as exploratory in nature.  
 
STUDY  INTERVENTION(S)  / INVESTIGATIONAL  AGENT(S):  
Brain  Stimulation  
For the brain  stimulation we will use Repetitive  Transcranial  Magnetic  stimulation (rTMS)  The 
sessions will be performed at either the CTI or the LHN. Repetitive TMS parameters are determined based on the allowable dosage of rTMS delivery, calculated based on published standards for experimental rTMS protocols, and in accordance with standard operating 
procedures for rTMS 
18,19. Previous studies have shown that four or more rTMS sessions are 
needed to induce changes in the hippocampal network conectivity20. 
The brain stimulation can be delivery using different devices; in this project we will use a 
MagPro X100 stimulator connected to a MagPro Cool -B65 liquid -cooled butterfly coil 
(MagVenture A/S, Farum, Denmark). Resting motor thr eshold (M1- rTMS) will be determined 
during the visit 1 or visit 2 and used along  the 10 visits.  Single  TMS  pulses  are delivered to the 
thumb -control area of the brain’s primary motor cortex and the pulse intensity required to 
reliably evoke movement of the  thumb is determined. This value is used as each individual 
subject’s “motor threshold”, and stimulation is delivered at a proportion of the motor threshold.

HRP -593 / v03152019   
 The rTMS  pulse sequences  and intensities  used  are all within  the published safety  guidelines  
21,22. 
As different  stimulation  conditions  (hippocampal,  M1 or sham)  will be delivered in each  of the 
three rounds of stimulation, participants will be told that stimulations can feel and sound 
different.  All participants  will receive all the 3 modalities  of stimulation  following  specific  order 
(see details below).  
• Stimulation  Modality  1- Hippocampus -stimulation:  
Repetitive TMS will be applied at 100% resting motor threshold intensity to a region of interest 
located in the parietal cortex, that will be determined based on its connectivity with the 
hippocampus. This stimulation consists of a series of 1,600 pulses administered as 2 -second 
periods of 20 Hz pulse trains separated by 28- s inter -train intervals (~20 minutes for the entire 
daily stimulation session).  The induced current  field will be oriented perpendicular/anterior  to the 
long axis of the gyrus encompassing the stimulation location. 
• Stimulation  Modality  2-Sham -stimulation:  
Parameters will be identical to the hippocampus -stimulation, except that the coil will be flipped 
over to the sham side and a stimulating electrode will be attached to the skin near the parietal rTMS target location. This electrode will be used to deliver a small current mimicking real 
stimulation  sensation,  therefore  participants  cannot  reliably  discriminate  physical  sensations  for 
real versus sham rTMS.  
A trained co- investigator  on the study  will administer  the rTMS.  Prior  to performing  any study 
procedures, the study staff member will be trained in the techniques of rTMS as well as all aspects of the evaluations. This study staff member will then be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_403247].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_711924]- investigator is qualified to administer the 
stimulation  and the evaluations.  Subjects  are allowed to miss up to 1 stimulation  visit in each 
treatment round, we will drop out subjects that miss more than 1 stim visit per round.  
 
Stimulation  modality  sequences:  
The order of the stimulation modalities will be different across subjects. Subjects  will be 
randomly assigned to one of two possible groups/stimulation sequences (fig 1). Before 
enrollment starts, we will produce 18 envelopes containing the stimulation sequence (see below 
possible combinations; we expect to use only 16). The stimulation sequence will be kept in sealed envelopes; therefore, subjects will get their assignment according to the order of 
entrance in the study. The study coordinator will retain the original sequence list which will be 
kept in a locked  place.  The study  staff who provides  the stimulation  TMS  session will be the only 
un-ed personnel.

* PainApp: participants will be instructed to use our smartphone- based app to report pain 
intensity (NRS, where [ADDRESS_968352] imaginable pain), mobility (minimum, 
average,  maxi mum),  mood  (NRS, where - 10 is sad and +10 is happy),  and medication use, 
collected twice daily from Visit 1 until the end of participation (~100 ratings). 
MRI Scan:  
Subjects will undergo MRI scanning at the Northwestern University, Department of Radiology Center  for Translational Imaging  (CTI). All procedures  are standard  in our laboratory  and have 
been approved in multiple previous IRB protocols.  
More specifically, we will conduct a MRI scan (Siemens Trio, 3T, 64- channel head coil) with 
both structural  (T1 scan,  5 minutes)  and rsfMRI  (EPI [CONTACT_39710],  8 minutes)  protocols.  No contrast  will 
be used in the MRI.  
The structural scan will allow us to use the built -in neuronavigation TMS system, for optimal 
localization of the stimulation sites. Resting- state fMRI will be used to identify the functional 
localization for indirect stimulation of the hippocampus. To do so, we will follow a well - 
established in- house processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], replicating the methods used in our previous 
experiments using this method 
14–17. Briefly, whole- brain seed -based correlation will be 
performed,  using the left dorsal  hippocampus  as a seed  region.  This will allow  us to identify,  at a 
single -subject level, the exact parietal target that has maximal connectivity to the dorsal 
hippocampus. By [CONTACT_711941], modulation of the hippocampus connectivity 
can be achieved non- invasively 14,23  and with long- lasting effects in brain connectivity after three 
stimulation sessions 24. 
In this same  visit, participants  will further  complete  questionnaires  regarding  pain ratings  and 
the characteristics of their pain (see below for detail information).  
Participants  will be assigned to one of the six possible stimulation  sequences  and trained on our 
pain app (a smartphone- based tool used to rate  pain and mood on NRS scales, as well as 
indicate rescue medication use, twice  a day).  They  will be asked to use the pain app for the next 
7-[ADDRESS_968353] round of intervention and during all the study duration.

 There will be 2 MRI visits: one at baseline (visit 1), the second MRI will depend on participants 
allocation:  participants  randomized to group  [ADDRESS_968354] a second  MRI at visit 6; and participants 
randomized to group 2 at visit 11.  
• Visit  2 – 11 (Approx  Time:  1 hour)  
Intervention visits:  These visits  will be scheduled ~1 week  after the visit 1 measurements  are 
done.  
At visit 2, the stimulation protocol  will start,  and participants  will receive a total of 10 sessions:  5 
consecutive daily sessions of each stimulation round following the prior stimulation sequence 
order, interleaved by 2 weeks of wash out period. All subjects will undergo sessions of sham, 
and hippocampal -stimulation, in a crossover manner. As different stimulation conditions 
(hippocampal, M1 or sham) will be delivered in each of the two rounds of stimulation, participants will be told that stimulations can feel and sound different.  
Before  stimulation,  the subjects  will complete the following  assessments:  
o NRS  for back  pain 
After  each session,  subjects  will complete the following  assessments:  
o Side Effects  Questionnaire for rTMS  
o NRS  for back  pain 
o At visits  6 and 11 participants  will also complete the following  questionnaires:  
o PainDetect;  
o Short -form Montreal  Pain Questionnaires  (sfMPQ);  
o BDI

Sources of materials  
Research materials  to be obtained from participants:  
Urine specimens will be collected at the screening visit to check for illicit drug use. In addition, women of childbearing potential  will be required  to have a urine  pregnancy  test at screening visit 
ensure a negative result (testing required by [CONTACT_711942]; these tests will be disposed of at the visit).  
Research data collected from  participants:  
There  are several  types  of data that we will be collecting:  brain  images;  self-report  questionnaire 
measures; and physical, psychological, and physiological parameters. In addition, clinical and demographic data will be obtained, including: complete information regarding descriptors  of the 
participants’ back pain (duration, frequency and magnitude of pain, etc) as well as a general medical history including surgical and treatment history, disability status, drinking and drug use, 
demographics, smoking status, height and weight. For all participants, the smartphone app will be used to monitor medication use, ratings of back pain intensity (NRS), mood and mobility, 
twice daily until the end of the study participation 
Questionnaires used  for assessing characteristics  of cohorts:  
• Personal  Health History (PHH): This general questionnaire will assess demographic 
information  (gender,  age, marital/relationship status, race/ethnicity,  and education),  pain history 
(descriptions, diagnostic testing history, and treatment history), general health history (other 
medical/surgical history, concurrent medications, health behaviors, a general symptom

 checklist, and health -care utilization), and work history.  The entire questionnaire will be 
completed  at the visit 1. Subjects  will be asked  about  any changes  to concurrent  medications  at 
subsequent visits.  History and physical examination will be done to confirm diagnosis, inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and assess overall safety. 
• Vitals  measurements : blood pressure,  heart  rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] r ate, height  and weight 
will be measured.  
• PainDETECT (PD -Q): A 12 -item self -report instrument that assesses neuropathic pain 
properties  and was originally  developed in a sample  of 8,000  low back  pain suffers  in [LOCATION_013]. 
The PD -Q demonstrates high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (85%) and has since been 
validated in other clinical pain populations. Although this instrument has not been validated in 
OA populations, it has been widely used in numerous OA studies25. 
• Beck Depression Inventory,  second version (BDI-II): A 21-item self-report  instrument 
for measuring the severity of depression in adults. It is well validated in pain populations and 
has been extensively used in pharmacological research26. 
• Short -form Montreal Pain Questionnaires (sfMPQ): A well-validated pain measure, 
which permits separation of sensory and affective components of pain, as well as a total pain score.  It also includes a numeric/descriptor scale, a visual analog pain scale (VAS), and a body 
map to localize the pain
27. This ins trument is very well validated and often used in 
pharmacological research. However, its affective subscale is thought to be relatively rudimentary.  It will be used to track  development  or continuation  of pain,  as well as post-surgical 
pain.  
• Numerical  Ratin g Scale  (NRS):  is an 11-point  numerical  rating  scale used  to measure 
pain intensity, where [ADDRESS_968355] week. This questionnaire has been extensively used across 
pain management studies.  
• NIH PROMIS -57 Profile : This 57 -item questionnaire contains brief scales for anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, pain interference, pain intensity, physical function, sleep disturbance, and the ability  to participate  in social  roles.  Each  scale was created  using PROMIS  methodology  and 
calibrated using item response theory.  
• Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS): The PCS is a 13- item instrument derived from defi nitions  
of catastrophizing described in the literature as well as items from the catastrophizing subscale of the CSQ. The PCS instructions ask participants to reflect on past painful 
experiences, and to indicate the degree to which they experienced each of  13 thoughts or 
feelings when experiencing pain, on 5- point scales with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all 
the time. The PCS yields a total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination, 
magnification and helplessness. The PCS has been shown to have adequate to excellent internal consistency (coefficient alphas: total PCS = .87, rumination = .87, magnification = .66, 
and helplessness = .78).  
• Global impression of change (PGIC): this questionnaire reflects a patient's belief about 
the efficacy of treatment.  Although  widely  used in chronic  pain clinical trials,  PGIC's  validity  has 
not been formally assessed. PGIC is a 7 point scale depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a patient's rating of overall 
improvement.

 2. Visit 6 and 11: These visits will be separated in two parts: part 1: last day of stimulation 
(stimulation + questionnaires) and part 2: MRI (at least 24hrs after part 1). For group1, only visit 
[ADDRESS_968359] 2 parts and for group 2 only visit 11 (see Figure 1 for details).  
3. PainApp: participants will be instructed to use our smartphone- based app to report pain 
intensity  (NRS,  where [ADDRESS_968360]  imaginable pain),  mobility  (minimum, average, 
maximum),  mood (NRS,  where - 10 is sad and +10 is happy),  and medication use, collected twice 
daily from Visit 1 until the end of participation).  
 
DATA AND  SPECIMEN BANKING  
Data will initially be entered onto case report forms and then into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. All questionnaires will be electronic (created or copi[INVESTIGATOR_711927]) and completed by [CONTACT_711943]/her email address. Once 
completed,  the questionnaire data are stored in the REDCap  database  and cannot  be altered  by 
[CONTACT_711944]. This process will be designed so that the system automatically sends the 
correct questionnaires at defined intervals and tracks participants over the follow -up, informing 
research staff either when participants have completed the battery or when they have gone 
outside the allotted time window and must be called. Thus, REDCap will aid in the promotion of 
scheduled and diligent contact [CONTACT_711945]. All remaining data 
will be collect ed by [CONTACT_711946]. 
Scanning data will all be digital and is burned onto DVDs, sent to a Northwestern University archive system, and stored in the lab’s secure servers. Likewise, data collected with our smartphone app will be digitally stored in the lab’s secure server. Only subjects’ participation 
identification numbers (PI[INVESTIGATOR_29721]) will be included in any of these materials; a master study list will  
be maintained by [CONTACT_711947] (TJS). Acc ess to this list will be limited to the site 
investigators, clinical coordinator, and other study personnel directly involved with data  
collection on an as needed basis. All the data will be collected specifically for this study and not in the course of usual clinical care. All non- digital data (e.g., consent forms) will be stored in a 
locked  cabinet  in a locked  room.  Any digital  information  will be pass -word  protected and if any of 
this has identifying information on it, it will be encrypted.  
Access to PHI: 
All data collected will be linked to participants by [CONTACT_711948] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_29721]), provided at the time of screening.  A master study list linking participants’ 
names to study identification numbers will be the only means  of linking data to specific 
individuals.  This list will be kept on an encrypted personal  computer  residing  in the Apkarian  lab, 
not connected to the internet, and with password protection. Only Apkarian and Schnitzer will 
have access to this file, and it will only be used in case of an unforeseen emergency need. 
SHARING  RESULTS  WITH  PARTICIPANTS  
Screening laboratory  tests  may be shared  with the participants  and/or  their physicians  at their 
request. The results of the questionnaires and brain scans will  not be provided to the 
participants.  
STUDY  TIMELINES

RECRUITMENT  METHODS  
Potential patients will be screened via a database maintained by [CONTACT_8355]—investigators 
(TJS), the registry is approved under the IRB (STU00007522 - Protocol title: Physical Medicine 
& Rehabilitation Registry).  We will also extend recruitment  through community  and partnerships 
with medical in stitutions (Northwestern Medicine, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab), through online 
advertisement, and by [CONTACT_193858] -based methods including ads.  
Materials that will be used to recruit subjects will be uploaded in the IRB application, and only 
used once they have been approved.  They include ads, brochures, and letters. Contact 
[CONTACT_711951]/ads and other subject facing recruitment materials will be updated as needed without  IRB approval.  No other  content  on the subject  facing  recruitment  materials  will 
be changed without IRB approval, only contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 
COMPENSATION  FOR  PARTICIPATION  IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES  
Participants will not be paid at the time of prescreening. For the screening visit, participants will 
receive $75 ($25 for questionnaires + $40 for  the MRI) for travel and their involvement. For  
visits after the screening period (V2 -V11) participant will receive $20/stimulation session; $[ADDRESS_968363] after each stimulation round (5 visits). Participants will 
receive $40 dollars for each MRI completed. Participants will receive $0.25 per eDiary entry recorded throughout the study, ratings are capped at a max of 2/day and as the study lasts 
approximately 7 weeks. In addition, participants will receive an extra $20 if complete all the 
study visits and bonus of $20 dollars if they complete more than 90% of the pain diary ratings 
(90%  is approximately  90 rates).  In all visits,  participants  can opt to receive a parking voucher.  If 
a parking voucher is required for one of the Northwestern Parking garages, $[ADDRESS_968364] (VISA).

2If participants  complete  90%of  all pain diaries  entries  (around  90 entries)  they will receive an additional  
$[ADDRESS_968369] to discontinue the study if those circumstances occur. 
If a participant  withdraws  early,  payment  will be made for the portion  of the research  study  that 
has been completed (prorated  to the nearest  1-hour increment).  Incomplete data sets obtained 
from participants (due to early withdrawal) will be excluded from the primary analysis and included in an exploratory full dataset analysis.  
RISKS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
Taking part in this study may involve  the following  risks:  
The most common side effects of rTMS can include mild headaches or discomfort at the 
stimulation  site. This occurs  in approximately  5% of subjects.  The subject  is allowed to stop the 
stimulation at any time if they feel uncomfortable. These effects generally wear off shortly after 
the session and can be treated via over -the-counter analgesics. If subjects experience 
discomfort at a stimulation location, research staff will attempt to move the stimulator to a 
location that minimizes this discomfort. Research staff will be in constant contact [CONTACT_711952]. Vital signs will be collected and used to exclude subjects from rTMS if 
outside of normal established ranges (see above). With the permission of the subject, the primary care physician will be contact[CONTACT_711953] -up care if vital 
signs are outside of the normal range.  
Although extremely rare, undergoing rTMS may induce a seizure. The risk of seizure due to 
rTMS is extremely rare with the rTMS procedures that will be used under this protocol. The 
screening procedures and rTMS stimulation protocol used here is in accordance with 
recommendations by [CONTACT_711954], and the proposed rTMS procedures are classified as very low in 
risk based on these  recommendations. The risk of seizure for our rTMS parameters among 
individuals meeting our safety requirements (including no history of seizure/epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], among 
other exclusionary criteria) is quantified in two publications: Rossi et al. (2009)
18 and Oberm an 
et al. (2011)22. Rossi et al. Identified one instance of seizure among all studies conducted from 
1998- 2008 among subjects with no history of seizure meeting our inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
There were additional instances of seizure reported among subjects who would be excluded from our studies because of psychiatric diagnoses, current use of anti -psychotic drugs, and 
neurological  diagnosis,  all of which  are exclusionary  for our studies.  The risk estimate  quantified 
from Rossi et al., 2009, for subjects meeting our criteria is 0.01% likelihood of seizure during a rTMS session. Oberman, 2011, reviewed studies using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as 
in our studies  and report  a risk of 0.02%  likelihood  of seizure during a rTMS  session.  The risk of 
seizure for an individual with no seizure history and meeting our other inclusion/exclusion criteria is therefore approximately 0.01- 0.02% (~1 to 2 in 10,000).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_711930], trained clinical staff (nurse, doctor, nurse practitioner  or a physician  assistant)  will be present  for all rTMS  sessions.  Trained clinical

 staff will be available for all sessions, however  they will stay in an adjacent  room  observing  with 
no direct unnecessary contact [CONTACT_109116]. This is a mechanism study and only subjects 
will be blinded to the stimulation sequence. This will not compromise blinding. The clinical staff 
will monitor subjects for any signs of seizure, especially tonic -clonic muscle contractions 
associated with grand mal seizure. In the case of a seizure, rTMS procedures will be 
immediately terminated and an emergency response unit (911) will be called. The trained clinical staff will perform standard medical intervention for seizure. We will follow standar d in- 
house safety  protocol  required  by [CONTACT_365419]. In the rare event  that a seizure the attending  neurologist 
collaborating with the study  - [CONTACT_711970]  will be notified as soon as possible,  and subjects 
will be released to emergency medical care upon their arrival.  
With MRI, there is risk of claustrophobia and anxiety involved with the scanning procedure, 
which involves the potentially uncomfortable experience of lying in a relatively confined space with minimal  head  and body  movements  for up to 15 minutes  at a time.  In this time period,  their 
pain (if they have any) may become worse. Over the last 20 years of doing brain scans in 
various populations (healthy and not), the main limiting factor has been claustrophobia.  
Participants  also may feel anxious  in the scanner  and simply  cannot  tolerate it. 
With regard to the questionnaires, although the majority of participants will find these to be 
harmless, mundane, or possibly interesting, there is always a possibility that some of the questions may be sensitive in nature and may make them uncomfortable (particularly t hose 
asking about mood or personality). All questionnaires have the option of being marked as “will not answer”. Any task that subjects are not comfortable with will be skipped. These tasks are administered  by [CONTACT_711955]. 
There  is no known fetal risk from MRI scanning during pregnancy;  however,  the absolute  safety 
has not yet been established. Therefore, any patient who is pregnant or states that there is a 
possibility of being pregnant will not be excluded from the study. 
 
POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
We cannot promise any benefits; however, possible benefits include a decrease in pain as a 
result of the stimulation sessions.  We a re not able to estimate at this time the probability, 
magnitude  or duration of benefit.  We hope  to define these  parameters  with the results  of this 
study.  
DATA MANAGEMENT  AND  CONFIDENTIALITY  
Data will initially be entered onto case report forms and then into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. All questionnaires will be electronic (created or copi[INVESTIGATOR_711931]) and completed by [CONTACT_711943]/her email address.  Once

 identification  numbers  (PI[INVESTIGATOR_29721])  will be included in any of these materials;  a master  study  list will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_711947] (TJS).  Access to this list will be limited to the site 
investigators,  clinical coordinator,  and other  study  personnel  directly  involved with data collection 
on an as needed basis.  All the data will be collected specifically  for this study and not in the course 
of usual clinical care.  All non -digital data (e.g., consent forms) will be stored in a locked cabinet 
in a locked room.  Any digital information will be pass -word protected and if any of this has 
identifying information on it, it will be encrypted.  
Data  Analysis Plan 
MRI data will be analyzed using the FSL software  library  [30]. Briefly,  structural  data will be skull- 
stripped and normalized to MNI space through nonlinear transformation. Functional data will be 
motion corrected and smoothed with a 4 mm smoothing kernel. Data will be further denoised by 
[CONTACT_711956]- censoring and regressing out the motion parameters. Finally, data will be 
band- pass filtered (0.01 to 0.1 Hz). Functional connectivity analyses will be carried on by  
[CONTACT_711957] a hippocampal seed and all 
other voxels in the brain. The maximal statistically significant cluster near a predetermined 
coordinate in the parietal cortex (see Wang et al. 2014) will be extracted, spatially warped to the 
subject native space, and fed into the TMS neuronavigation system for stimulation.  
Statistical analyses will be performed using the software R. We use repeated- measures within- 
subject  analysis  of variance for dependent  variables  1) change in painApp immediately  after rTMS 
relative  to baseline,  and 2) for change  in painApp in the long term (average  over the second  week 
after rTMS) relative to baseline, with independent factors being hippocampus -rTMS and sham - 
rTMS; with Bonferr oni post -hoc comparisons. If the ANOVAs are significant and post -hoc 
comparisons indicate superiority of hippocampus -rTMS, we declare that the approach is a 
clinically important means of pain control in CBP, and newer larger studies should be launched.  
Power Calculation  
This study aims to collect preliminary data in humans to test whether a manipulation of the 
hippocampal network can lead to changes in pain experience in CBP participants. With this in 
mind,  we will aim for a final sample size of 12 subjects.  Due to possible dropouts  over the course 
of the study, we will recruit a total of 16 subjects. If this study shows indication that the hippocampal stimulation leads to higher connectivity increase across series of hippocampal networks  that modulates  pain,  the results  of this study  will be used to perform  a power  calculation 
in order to perform a future study aiming to treat chronic back pain. 
 
PROVISIONS TO MONITOR  THE DATA TO ENSURE  THE SAFETY  OF PARTICIPANTS  
The primary protection will be careful recruitment, thereby [CONTACT_711958], i.e., subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
MR Imaging  
Individuals who cannot tolerate the confinement of an MRI scanner and those who may not be 
able to be scanned because of implanted metal devices will be excluded. Claustrophobia is the 
main limiting factor; we attempt to identify people at risk by [CONTACT_711959] (a fake scanner made to look and feel like the real one) to assess their comfor t levels. 
There is a standard checklist of additional exclusionary items for MR scanning (e.g., implanted 
devices, exposure to metallic fragments at work, etc) that will be utilized prior to entering 
participants  into the study  and again prior to each  imag ing session.  Personnel  continuously  query 
the subject  in the scanner  as to their overall  well-being  during scans  and will discontinue the scan

 and relieve  the subject  from the discomfort  at any time requested.  It is possible that the anatomical 
scans may uncover a brain abnormality of which the participant was not aware. In such cases, 
the subject  is removed from the study  and given  appropriate  medical  advice (TJS);  his/her  scans 
are sent to a radiologist for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_711932].  The likelihood of 
this happening is low (less than 1%). Over the last 20 years of doing brain scans in various populations (healthy and not), participants often are surprised at how anxious they feel in the 
scanner  and simply  cannot tolerate it. Otherwise,  subjects  are usually  enthusiastic  in participating 
in trials that may lead to new discoveries  that either  pertain to their conditions  or help other  people.  
TMS 
Individuals  who cannot  tolerate TMS  stimulation  or those  who may not receive  stimulation  will be 
excluded. To minimize risk and protect participants, a trained clinical staff will be present for all 
the rTMS sessions (a trained clinical staff will also be present on “sham” sessions, even though 
in these sessions the intensity of stimulation is adjusted to a low value that cannot influence the 
brain). Study staff personnel continuously query the subject regarding their overall well -being 
during the stimulation protocols and will discontinue and relieve the subject from the di scomfort 
at any time requested.  
Questionnaire Risks 
To deal with the possibility that some questions may be sensitive in nature or make people feel 
uncomfortable, individuals will be told that they need not complete any items of entire 
questionnaires if they feel that doing so will cause discomfort. Because we are measuring depression, anxiety, and other mental health constructs in these questionnaires, [CONTACT_292444], a 
licensed clinical psychologist, will be available to consult about any concerns that patients have 
about  their mental  health,  including  referrals  to appropriate providers.  All such  participants  will be 
given a list of referral sources in case they wish to seek mental healthcare, and participants will be invited to contact [CONTACT_711960].  
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT  THE PRIVACY  INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS  
Privacy and confidentiality will be maintained using allocation numbers (also called participant IDs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]) throughout the s tudy with the master study list being maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_711933] a documented need for this information.  All electronic information will be pass -word protected and stored on a secu re 
server; when necessary, it will also be encrypted for extra protection.

 If a subject is injured as a result of this study (medications, or procedures), they should seek 
medical treatment  through their primary  care physician or treatment  center  of choice.  They  will be 
instructed during  the consent  process  to promptly  tell the study  doctor  about  any illness  or injury. 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [university, researchers] will not pay for medical care required because of a bad 
outcome resulting from participation in this research study.  
ECONOMIC  BURDEN TO PARTICIPANTS  
Participants  will not be responsible for any study -related costs because  of participation in the 
research.  
 
CONSENT  PROCESS  
Informed consent  is a process  that is initiated  prior to the individual  agreeing to participate  in the 
study  and continues  throughout  study  participation.  We will be obtaining informed consent  for all 
subjects in this study.  We do not plan to enroll non -English speaking subjects, cognitive 
impaired individuals, individuals under 18 years of age, and or adults who are unable to  
consent.  
The following  outlines  the informed consent  process:  
After  passing the pre-screening  over the phone,  the participant  will be scheduled for a screening 
visit. If possible, a copy of the IRB- approved consent form will be emailed or mailed to the 
subject prior to the scheduled visit.  
The consent process will take place in Abbott Hall on the 10th floor clinical research exam  
space in a private exam room or in the CTI in a private room.  The consent form will be 
explained to the participant (the participant will read along with staff): each section of the form will be discussed, taking time to highlight the purpose of the study, procedures, risks, 
confidentiality  measures  taken  to protect  the participant,  and how to revoke/withdraw  consent,  if 
desired, and to answer any questions the participate may have.  If staff cannot answer the 
question or if the participant  has concerns  to discuss, the study  physician or PI [INVESTIGATOR_711934].  Subjects will be given as much time as they need to make their 
decision whether or not to participate. There will be a waiting period available to the participant; they will have  an opportunity  to take the consent  document  home  to discuss  with family,  friends, 
and/or their physician prior to signing the document. Once the document is signed, the subject will sign and date two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. One copy to take home and one copy to keep with the subject’s 
source documents. The consent process will also be documented in the subject’s source documents.  
All participants will be re -consented should a new ICF be approved by [CONTACT_711962].  In cases  where participants  may need to be notified  of new information  before  an 
ICF is approved by [CONTACT_1201], subjects will be notified by [CONTACT_711963].  
This study  will follow  SOP:  Informed Consent  Process for Research  (HRP -090) as well as 
“SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091).”

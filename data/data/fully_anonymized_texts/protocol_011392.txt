Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_1083274] of several 
systematic quantitative evaluations (Marinho et al., 2003; Twetman et al., 2003), which provide the 
highest standard of evidence for the e ffectiveness of fluoride dentifrice. Marinho et al. (2003) based their 
conclusions on a meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_1083275] (average reduction in Decay, Missing, and Filled Surfaces (DMFS) of 24%) 
on the permanent dentition. In addition, they concluded that the effectiveness of fluoride dentifrice may 
be relatively gre ater in individuals with a higher caries experience, with increased fluoride concentration, 
increased frequency of use, and with supervised brushing. There was no evidence that the effect was 
dependent on background exposure to fluoridated water. Twetman e t al. (2003) reached similar overall 
conclusions from their systematic review.  
The current levels of fluoride dentifrice products that are marketed worldwide generally fall in the range 
between 1000 – 1500 ppm F, although dentifrices with lower fluoride c oncentrations are marketed in 
some countries. All fluoride toothpaste sold in the US is in the 1000 -1100 ppm F range. Walsh et al. 
(2010) reported based on a network meta -analysis that the relative anticaries effects of fluoride 
toothpastes increased with higher fluoride concentration. Based on 74 trials involving the caries scores 
(DMFS) in the mixed or permanent dentition, the anticaries effect of fluoride toothpaste was 23% for 
1000/1055/1100/1250 ppm F and 36% 2400/2500/2800 ppm F; however, toothpastes with 440/500/[ADDRESS_1083276] been extensively reviewed at a Conference held in [COMPANY_002]ster, NY in 1994 (Adv Dent Res 
9:169 -340, 1995). While intra -oral models have been in use for the past forty years, a "Consensus 
Conference of Intraoral Models" (ADA, Chicago, Sept. 1990) clearly identified the need for validation of 
intra-oral caries models for their potential use as methods of evaluating the efficacy of fluoride dentifrices 
and other fluoride -containing dental products. Based on this conference and the [COMPANY_002]ster Mod els 
conference, there is general agreement among researchers in the field that appropriately validated in 
situ models represent an acceptable approach for testing the anticaries potential of fluoride products. 
The use of intraoral appliance models overcome  the ethical and practical problems associated with 
human studies by [CONTACT_787368] a well -controlled test site mounted in the subject's own partial denture. Intraoral mode ls 
serve as bridges between the clinical situation and the more controlled laboratory environment. 
Philosophically, these models should, as far as possible, be representative of what occurs in the clinical 
situation, yet keep variables under control so tha t meaningful outcome differences can be detected in a 
reasonable number of subjects (Zero, 1995).  
Previous work by [CONTACT_365054] a modification of the Koulourides intra -oral model 
(Koulourides et al., 1974) has sufficient sensitivity and reprodu cibility to respond in dose -response 
manner to meet the requirements for model validation (Proskin et al., 1992). The model, which uses 
partially demineralized enamel as the starting hard tissue substrate, permits the evaluation of the ability 
of the test dentifrice to enhance net remineralization and measure fluoride bioavailability under clinically 
relevant conditions. Our current model has been validated based on its response to different dentifrice 
fluoride concentrations - 0, 250, 500 and 1100 ppm fluo ride (Zero et al., 1994; Zero, 1995; Zero et al., 
2005) as well as in several more commercially funded in situ studies testing fluoride dentifrice products 
that also included fluoride dose response controls (Zero et al., 2018).  
Our intraoral model system u ses the surface microhardness (SMH) test to assess changes in the mineral 
content of enamel. A very precise instrument (Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester) with a Knoop diamond 
under a fixed load is used to place indentations into the enamel surface. The length o f the indentations 
is accurately measured using an image analysis system and correspond directly to the depth of 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020154  
Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 5 of 29 
 penetration of the diamond into the enamel surface (30:1 ratio). This method can be considered 
analogous to the dentist’s use of a sharp dental  probe to detect clinical dental caries; however, the SMH 
test is hundreds -fold more sensitive and accurate. Using the SMH test, the hardness of sound enamel 
can be measured and compared with the hardness of enamel after exposure to a caries 
(demineralizat ion) challenge and after exposure to conditions that favor remineralization. An increase in 
the indentation length compared to the baseline indentation length indicates softening of the enamel 
and demineralization. A decrease in the indentation length repr esents rehardening of the enamel surface 
and remineralization. The SMH test is one of the few methods that can be used to accurately determine 
the very early changes occurring at the enamel surface during the caries process (Zero, 1995). For early 
enamel l esions, a decrease in SMH has been shown to be linearly related to mineral loss 
(demineralization) (Zero et al., 1990). White (1988) reported that for shallow enamel lesions, an increase 
in SMH was highly correlated with remineralization as measured by [CONTACT_787369].  
Another advantage of our in -situ model system is that fluoride uptake can be measured on the same 
enamel specimens that are used to evaluate changes in mineral status 
(demineralization/remineralization) of enamel. Fluoride uptake testing usi ng in vitro models is accepted 
by [CONTACT_787370] - Anticaries Drug 
Products for Over -the-Counter Human Use. An important advantage of determining F uptake using an 
intraoral appliance model is that studies are conducted under clinically relevant conditio ns, which very 
closely approximate the in vivo situation.  Human subjects apply the test dentifrice by [CONTACT_787371]. The fluoride is delivered in the presence of physiologically secreted saliva and 
there are intermittent c ycles of demineralization and remineralization during the experimental period as 
with the natural caries process. Furthermore, when the active fluoride agent in a dentifrice is sodium 
monofluorophosphate (MFP), plaque and saliva present in the oral environ ment provide the necessary 
phosphatases to hydrolyze MFP to release free fluoride ion (Pearce and Dibdin, 1995). This will take 
place only to a limited extent when using non -biologic in vitro testing methods. Thus, the determination 
of intraoral fluoride u ptake should provide a better estimation of the true fluoride bioavailability of fluoride 
dentifrice products than determination of fluoride uptake in vitro.

2.1.3  Mitigating Bias  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to  a treatment  sequence  (see section 3.1.2 ). Identities of the study 
investigational products will be disguised with a study label . Similar sized kit boxes  will be used to ensure 
product blinding.  All treatment products will be dispensed in a secluded area, away from the study 
examiner, to maintain the study blind.   All subjects will receive the same product for Period 5.  
 
The treatment product(s) each subjec t will receive will not be disclosed to the Principal Investigator, 
examiners, study center personnel, subjects, contract monitors, contract vendors, or the Sponsor, 
except for select site personnel responsible for usage instruction and supervised use .  Period [ADDRESS_1083290] use instructions to be used throughout the duration of their 
study period.  Subjects will receive a new kit box at the beginning of each study period.    
 
The kit boxes will be labeled by [CONTACT_787373]  (except Period 5) . Kit box labels will also c ontain the study 
number, emergency phone number, distributor name/address, appropriate caution statements, content 
statement and other information as required by [CONTACT_395309]. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_787364] a content statement listing study number and 
kit box numbers contained within.  Supplemental products will be provided to site.   
 
The site will be provided with a code breaker report in a sealed envelope.  The sealed code breaker 
report contains documents that list the kit box number or treatment code while the identity of the 
treatment products is hidden by [CONTACT_395310] -off seal  (except Period 5) . If the study blind needs 
to be broken, an individual subject’s investigational product  may be  ascertained by [CONTACT_395311], locating the subject’s kit box number or treatment code and scratching off the 
opaque seal to reveal the treatment identity . The sealed code br eaker report will be opened if a clinically 
serious AE occurs or management of the subject requires knowledge of the identity of the investigational 
product.  The Investigator should immediately inform the Sponsor that the code will be broken and record 
the date, time and reason for b reaking the code in writing.  After the study is complete and the study 
database has been finalized and locked, the site will return the code breaker report to the Sponsor using 
the self -addressed, stamped envelope provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1083291] Participation  
Visit 1 ( Screening ) 
Subjects who have been recruited for the study via a telephone interview will sign in at the study site for 
this and all subsequent visits. At this time, subjects  will be asked to read and sign duplicate copi[INVESTIGATOR_787365], authorization for the release of health information for research form and 
demographic form. Demographic information and study entry criteria will be  obtained and documented 
on the appropriate case report form (CRF).  Upon review  of these documents, an update of their medical

 history/medications and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, each subject will be given an oral soft/hard 
tissue exam (OSHT) prior to their acceptance into the study. Their mandibular partial denture will be 
examined to determine if specimens can be held in one buccal flange area and the posterior denture 
teeth of the same side, as previously described. They will then provide a stimulated and unstimulated 
saliva sample to determine salivary flow rate. If no contr aindications to their participation are discovered 
and the subject meets the study requirements, the subject will be accepted into the study.  
 
General comments, if any, will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
Visit 2  (Prophy  Period 1)   
Two to three days prior to the beginning of Treatment Period 1, subjects will return for a professional 
dental prophylaxis. Subjects will answer have their medical history/medication information updated  and 
answer continuation questions.  Subjects will then receive an oral s oft tissue exam (OST) and oral hard 
tissue exam (at the first period only).   The subject’s mandibular partial denture will be prepared to hold 
the round enamel specimens  by [CONTACT_787374] s in the partial denture s at the specimen sites in the 
buccal flange area and the buccal surface of two denture teeth on the same side of the partial denture. 
A temporary dental material  (DentuSil™ ) will be placed in the drilled -out areas of the partial denture. 
Subjects will be given flu oride-free toothpaste to use at home for the next two to three days until they 
return for their next visit. They will be encouraged to remove their partial denture at night until their next 
visit.  
Visit  3 (Begin Treatment Period 1 )  
Each subject will recei ve an OST examination, answer continuation questions and have their medical 
history/medication information updated. Subjects will be asked to return the washout product they 
received at Visit [ADDRESS_1083292] use. Subjects 
will be instructed on the brushing method  (see Appendi x). The four enamel partially demineralized 
specimens will be placed in the buccal flange/posterior teeth areas on one side of the subject's 
mandibular partial denture. All subjec ts will be instructed to wear their partial denture containing the 
enamel specimens 24 hours a day except during the cleaning of their natural teeth (twice per day) and 
for short periods to rinse their mouth out with tap water after meals and snacks.  
Visit 4 (7 Day Removal)  
Seven (7) days following Visit 3, the subjects will return to the Institute and answer continuance criteria 
questions and update their medical history/medication information. One enamel specimen will be 
removed from anterior dentur e tooth site of their partial denture and the hollow will be filled with a 
temporary dental material (DentuSil™ ). The subjects will be told to continue using their assigned product 
as instructed.  
Visit 5 (14 Day Removal)  
Fourteen ( 14) days following Visit 3, the subjects will return to the Institute and answer continuance 
criteria questions and update their medical history/medication information. One enamel specimen will 
be removed from posterior denture tooth site of their partial denture and the hollow will be filled with a 
temporary dental material  (DentuSil™ ). The subjects will be told to continue using their assigned product 
as instructed.  
Visit 6 (End Treatment Period 1)  
Twenty -one (21) days following Visit 3, the subjects wil l return to the Institute and receive an OST 
examination, answer continuance criteria questions and update their medical history/medication 
information. Subjects will be asked to return the study product and diary they received at Visit 3. The 
remaining tw o enamel specimens in the buccal flange site will be removed from their partial denture and 
the hollows will be filled with a temporary dental material ( DentuSil ) 
 
Period 2, 3 , 4 & 5 
The procedures outlined above  (Visit 2 -6) will be repeated until each subject has used each of the four 
test products , followed by a 5th test product in Period 5 . At Visit 21  (and also at Visit 26 for those subjects

2.1.8  Treatment Codes  
The site will be provided with a code breaker report in a sealed envelope  (except for Period 5) . The 
sealed code breaker report contains documents that list the kit box number or treatment code while the 
identity of the treatment products is hidden by [CONTACT_395310] -off seal. If the study blind needs to be 
broken, an individual subject’s investigational product may be  ascertained by [CONTACT_787378], locating the subject’s kit box number or treatment code and scratching off the opaque 
seal to reveal the treatment identity . The sealed code br eaker report will be opened if a clinically Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE)  occurs or management of the subject requires knowledge of the identity of the 
investigational product.  The Investigator should immediately inform the Sponsor that the code will be 
broken and record the date, time and reason for breaking the code in writing. After the study is complete 
and the study database has been finalized and locked, treatment codes will be unblinded.

prior to dispensing (five tubes per product will be weighed and average weight determined). At the end 
of each treatment period, subjects will be required to return all product containers (including empty ones) 
to the st udy site. The tubes will be individually weighed upon return and that number subtracted from 
the average weight will be recorded on the treatment dispensing log.  
 
The amount of test product used for each study treatment will be compared to daily product us age 
recorded on the subject’s diary. Significant discrepancies will be discussed with the study subject, as 
needed. Subjects who miss 15% or more treatments within the three -week treatment period will be 
considered non -compliant. The reason for non - compli ance will be noted in the subjects’ study records.  
All subjects will be instructed to use  only the assigned  products in place of normal oral hygiene  for the 
duration of the study.

Diary for Home Use  
At the start of each treatment period, subjects will be provided with a diary  (see Appendix)  to record the 
date, and the time of the morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) of each brushing and any deviation from the 
brushing regimen. In addition, subjects will also record any new or changes in pre -existing medical 
conditions, medications or non-drug treatments or any change in signs or symptoms that may occur.  
Subjects will be required to bring the completed diary to the end of treatment visit. Study staff will review 
the Diary with the subject to confirm treatment compliance and clarify listed medical conditions, 
medications and non-drug treatments.  
 
Intra-oral Appliance  
The in -situ model involves the placement of gauze -covered enamel specimens in the subject’s 
mandibular partial denture (see Figure 1). The subject’s denture will be prepared for the study by 
[CONTACT_787379] s in the buccal flange area on one  side of the partial denture and in two denture  teeth 
on the same side large enough to accommodate the enamel specimens. Four gauze -covered  [ADDRESS_1083302] with DentuSil™ - Silicone Soft Reline Material (The Harry 
J.Bosworth® Company, Skokie, IL) or an equivalent material. The Dentu Sil™ material will be placed in 
the drilled sites and the enamel specimens carefully inserted so that they be mounted flush with the  
surface of the  buccal  flange /denture teeth when fully seated. Great care will be taken to avoid 
contaminating the enamel surface of the specimens with the luting material. Upon completion of the 
study the subject’s partial denture  will be repaired. The location where the enamel specimens will be 
placed on the subject’s partial denture are not functional parts of the denture, and the experimental 
procedures will not cause any permanent damage to the denture.  
 
Prior to placement in the subjects’ partial dentures, all enamel specimens will be sterilized by [CONTACT_787380].

The hard tissue structure s examined will include assessing for enamel irregularities, tooth fracture, 
pathologic tooth wear, cavitated lesions, active non -cavitated lesions, residual roots, faulty restorations 
and implants. Observations will be listed as “Absent” or “Present” and conditions noted as present will 
be described.  
 
All abnormal findings are recorded and categorized by [CONTACT_787381] “other -oral.” An AE is recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after treatment application or any 
abnormal finding noted prior to treatment application increases in severity after treatment is applied.  
 
 
3.3.2  Adverse Event  Management  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a product and 
which does not necessa rily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whet her or not related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which suggests a definite hazard or handicap to 
the subjects. SAEs are any events resulting in death, life threatening situation, disabilit y or permanent 
damage, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or congenital anomaly/birth defects; 
events requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage; or other serious (important) 
medical events.  
 
All other AEs that do not fit with in these criteria will be considered “non-serious .” Unexpected adverse 
event/reaction is an y occurrence the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the AE provided 
in the current summary of product characteristics. All other AEs are considered “expected .”  
 
When an AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be carried out and appro priate treatment will be 
recommended. Additional follow -up will be performed as necessary and recorded as source 
documentation, with the results provided to the Sponsor. Subjects that experience any clinically 
significant AE will remain under medical super vision until the Principal Investigator /Medical Monitor  
recommends appropriate follow -up treatment or deems the AE to be resolved, stabilized, or no longer 
serious enough to warrant follow -up. 
 
When an Investigator is notified of a serious AE, the Investig ator must promptly (within 24 hours) notify 
the Sponsor (Clinical Trial Manager or the Medical Monitor) of the serious event, regardless of causality.  
Within 5 working days, a written and/or electronic report describing the circumstances of the event must 
be submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator will be responsible for SAE reporting to the IRB.  
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_1083305] dose of study drug until dismissed  from 
the study will be considered a treatment -emergent AE. All treatment -emergent AEs will be collected . 
The severity , action taken,  causality , outcome, and category  of all recorded AEs will be recorded . 
 
Severity  
Severity refers to the extent to which an AE affects daily activities. Severity will be categorized according 
to the following criteria:  
• Mild: Normal activities unaltered;  
• Moderate: Normal activities altered;  
• Severe: Unable to undertake normal activities.  
 
The term “severity” is not the same as “serious.” Seriousness, not severity, serves as the guide for 
defining regulatory reporting oblig ations . 
 
Action Taken  
If any action was taken due to the AE, it should be recorded.  
• None:  No action was taken by [CONTACT_423].  
• Discontinued: Investigator recommended,  or subject stopped using the study products.  
• Reduced /Interrupted : Investigator recommended or subject reduced or interrupted the instructed 
product usage.  
 
Causality  
Causality refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug. Assessment of causality is the responsibility 
of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12758]. If this responsib ility is delegated to a sub -investigator, this 
should be appropriately documented in the delegation sheet.  Causality will be categorized according to 
the following criteria:  
• Doubtful: There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to st udy drug usage, 
or there is another more probable medical explanation.  
• Possible: There is medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug usage. 
However, other medical explanations cannot be excluded as a possible cause.  
• Probable: Ther e is strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to study drug usage.  
• Not Related: There is no evidence to suggest the adverse event is related to study drug usage.  
 
Category  
Category refers to the region or area where the AE occur red. Catego ries are listed 0 -9.  
• 0 = Non -oral related  
• 1 = Perioral area/lips  
• 2 = Labial mucosa/buccal mucosa  
• 3 = Mucolabial fold/mucobuccal fold  
• 4 = Gingiva/free and attached  
• 5 = Palate/hard and soft  
• 6 = Oropharynx/uvula  
• 7 = Tongue  
• 8 = Sublingual  
• 9 = Other oral  
 
3.3.4  Adverse Event Follow -up 
Any self -reported  AE that remains unresolved by [CONTACT_787382] /designee , and the resolution should be documented only as source 
documentation . If a subject is unreacha ble to determine whether the AE has been resolved, the attempts 
to contact [CONTACT_787376] . Examiner observed AEs that 
are unresolved at the end of the study are followed to resolution at the discretion of the Medic al Monitor.  
 
Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_1083306] substrate for the preparation of the 4 x 4 mm 
and the 4 mm round specimens. The teeth will be collected and transported to OHRI in a saturated 
thymol solution. Upon receipt, the teeth will be sorted and cleaned. The teeth will then be stored in 
saturated thymol solution during sample preparation procedur es. 
 
Teeth will be selected based on the following criteria:  
• Free of caries and major restorations;  
• No discoloration and no markings, such as cracks, when viewed under a microscope at 20× 
magnification;  
• Sufficient tooth surface to provide a large size spec imen to meet study requirements.  
 
A core of enamel 4 mm in diameter will be prepared from each human tooth by [CONTACT_787383] a hollow -core diamond drill bit. Each block will be ground and polished to 
create flat surfaces  [Zero et al., 1990].  
 
The round specimens will be ground and polished to create planar parallel dentin and enamel surfaces. 
All grinding/polishing will be done on a polishing surface moistened with deionized water (dw ). The 
dentin side will be ground flat using 500 grit silicon carbide paper, followed by [CONTACT_787384]. A small orientation cut will be placed on each block (see Figure 2). The enamel surface 
of each specimen will be ground usin g 1200 grit silicon carbide paper followed by 2400 and then 4000 
grit silicon carbide paper. After the grinding procedures are completed, the enamel specimens will be 
placed under running dw for three minutes, sonicated in deionized water (dw) for three mi nutes and then 
placed under running dw for three minutes. The polishing step will involve the use of a 1 micrometer 
(μm) diamond suspension on a polishing cloth. The enamel specimens will then be rinsed under a steady 
stream of dw for three minutes, sonica ted for three minutes in 2% microliquid soap and then rinsed again 
with dw for three minutes. Resulting specimens will have a thickness range of 1.[ADDRESS_1083307] a minimum polished surface of 3 mm × 3 mm in the center of the enamel sur face.

 4.2 Lesion Creation  
The round enamel specimens will be partially demineralized using a modification of the method 
described by [CONTACT_364655] [1987]. The human enamel specimens will be immersed for 24 hours at 37º C under 
static conditions in 40 ml of an acid buffer (0.05 mol/L lactate), 50% saturated with respect to 
hydroxyapatite and with 0.2% (wt/vol) carbopol 907 (BF Goodrich Co., [LOCATION_003]) added (pH adjusted to 5.0 
using KOH or NaOH), and then rinsed thoroughly with  deionized water. The demineralized enamel 
specimens will then be stored in a moist environment to prevent dehydration.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1083308] a continuous, uniform shiny surface, with no matt areas. Lesions with 
matt area(s) will be rejected. The following criteria will be used to select specimens for inclusion in the 
study:  
•     The lesioned areas of each specimen shoul d be of equal and uniform opacity; and  
•     The lesioned areas of each specimen should possess a surface shine when exposed to light, 
thereby [CONTACT_365059].  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1083309] will be u sed to assess changes in the mineral status of partially demineralized enamel 
specimens. SMH will be measured using a Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester. Each enamel specimen will 
be secured on a 1 -inch square acrylic block with sticky wax and then placed on the microhardness 
tester. Five baseline indentations spaced 100 µm apart will be placed with a Knoop diamond under a 50 
gram load in the center of a flattened, polished sound enamel specimen. SMH will be determined by 
[CONTACT_787385] u sing Wilson 2100 - Clemex CMT Software (version 6.0.011). 
For enamel specimens to be acceptable for use in the study, the mean of the five baseline indentation 
length must be [ADDRESS_1083310] deviation of ≤ 3µm.  
 
After in vitro demineralization, the e namel specimens will be again SMH tested by [CONTACT_365062] 100 µm to the left of the baseline indentations (see Figure 2). To qualify for the study, the 
mean (n = 5) indentation lengths of the partially demineralized specimens must fall within a  range of 
100-[ADDRESS_1083311] deviation of ≤ 10  µm. After 7, 14 and 21 days of intra -oral exposure the 
enamel specimens will be again SMH -tested by [CONTACT_365061] 100 µm to the right of the 
baseline indentations (see Figure 2). The extent  of remineralization will be calculated based on the 
method of [Gelhard et al., 1979].  
 
 %SMH recovery = (D1 -R)/(D1 -B) ×100  
      
B = indentation length (µm) of sound enamel specimen at baseline  
D1 = indentation length (µm) after in vitro demineralization  
R = indentation length (µm) after intra -oral exposure.  
 
Additionally, the absolute remineralization change will be computed as: SMH change=  D1-R 
 
4.4.2  Enamel Fluoride Uptake  
The microdrill enamel biopsy technique as described by [Sakkab  et al., 1984] will be used to analyze 
the fluoride content of the partially demineralized enamel specimens. Each enamel specimen will be 
mounted perpendicular to the long axis of a drill bit attached to a specially designed microdrill, and drilled 
to a de pth of ~100 µm through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen; see Figure 2).  
The drilling and sample collection will be performed in a static -controlled atmosphere to prevent loss of 
enamel powder due to charging effects. The enamel powder sample, poo led from the four drilling 
samples, will be transferred to an analyzer cup cap. 20 microliters (μl) of 0.5 Molar (M) Perchloric Acid 
(HClO4) will be added to the enamel powder and the cap gently swirled to dissolve the powder. T o the 
analyzer cap containin g the 20 μl of HClO4/enamel powder, 40 μl of citrate/ ethylene -diamine -tetraacetic 
acid (EDTA) buffer and 40 μl of de -ionized water will be added and immediately analyzed for fluoride

determined using a calibrated microscope interfaced with an image analysis system. The amount of 
fluoride -uptake by [CONTACT_787386] µg F/cm2.  
 
4.5 Laboratory Data  
As each specimen is analyzed, individual Excel files will be generated and imported into a validated 
relational database management system. After the analyses are completed, all enamel specimen 
surface microhardness, and enamel fluoride uptake data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_787366]. The investigator will document this review and documentation will 
be filed with the laboratory study files.  
 
4.6 Specimen Reten tion 
Laboratory specimens will be retained by [CONTACT_787387].  
 
5. STATISTICAL PLAN  
5.1 Statistical Methods  
Efficacy Analyses  
The mean % SMH recovery and SMH change will be calculated using the five sets of indentations w ithin 
each enamel specimen. The mean fluoride uptake will be calculated using the four samples within each 
enamel specimen. The mean % SMH recovery , SMH  change  and mean fluoride uptake will be computed 
for each  enamel specimen  at the different time points (1 specimen for 7 and 14 days and 2 specimens 
for 21 days) within a subject; if a subject is missing an enamel specimen for the 21 -day reading , the 
single  available enamel specimen will be used. The treatments will be compared using analysis of 
variance mo dels (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suitable for a crossover study.  
 
To assess for potential carryover effects on the primary endpoint, t he models will include random effects 
for subject and fixed effects for study period , product  and carryove r term . If the carryover term is not 
significant at the 0.1 level (p>0.1) then the final crossover model  will not include the carryover term .  
 
A repeated measures  crossover  model will also be carried out to explore the treatment time effect . T his 
model will  includ e a random effect for subject and fixed effects for study period , product, treatment times 
(7, 14 and 21 days)  and treatment time by [CONTACT_787388] . For SMH  change , B (indentation length 
(µm) of sound enamel specimen at baseline) or D1 (indention length (µm) after challenge) will be added 
as a covariate in the model.  Additionally, the product by [CONTACT_787389].  A 10% significance level will be used for all product comparison tests. No alpha -level 
adjustments for multiple comparisons adjustments will be applied.    
 
If the data does not satisfy the normality criterion, log transformation or analogous nonparametric 
methods will be employed.  Additional statistical techniques may also be applied in order to more fully 
understand the data.

The PP population will be a subset from the ITT population without any major protocol deviations.  
   
6. DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability  
of the data:  
• documenting Clinical Trial Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan ; 
• site initiation meeting ; 
• routine site and/or data monitoring;  
• ECRF review against source documents;  
• data management quality control checks;  
• statistical quality control (QC) checks;  
• continuous data acquisition and cleaning;  
• internal review of data . 
 
In addition, a Sponsor representative may conduct periodic quality assurance audits of the study  
processes, including, but not limited to, clinical site visits, laboratories, vendors and contract  research 
organizations , the study  database, and P&G's final study report.  Data monitoring will ensure quality of 
collected information by [CONTACT_787390]. The investigational site will 
follow  up on any queries from P&G Data Manager.  If a query arises from a  subject  that was lost to follow -
up, the site will take action to contact [CONTACT_787391]. The study monitor  
will ensure that the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and any  amendments, good 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_787367] , and applicable laws and regulations.  
 
Case Report Forms  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRFs to be used in this study.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to maintain and submit accurate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor.  All 
hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
  
All questions should  be answered.  For paper CRFs, if an entry requires correction, a single line will be 
placed through the entry so as not to obscure the original record, the corrected entry will be initialed and 
dated by [CONTACT_121754], and a reason will b e given for the change.  There will be no 
whiteouts or erasures.  For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires correction, the change is made directly 
to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to provide a reason for the change, and the correction 
is log ged in by [CONTACT_121755].

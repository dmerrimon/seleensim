TITLE:   An Open-Label Extension (OLE) Study to Ev aluate the Efficacy and Safety of Nefecon 
Treatment in Patients With IgA Nephropa thy Who Have Completed Study Nef-301 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:   Nef-[ADDRESS_886091] NUMBER:   2020-003308-[ADDRESS_886092]:   Nefecon™ (budesonide mo dified-release capsules; 
Nefecon™ is a trademark of Calliditas Th erapeutics AB [hereinafter Calliditas]) 
PHASE:   3b 
INDICATION:   Treatment of primary immu noglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) 
OBJECTIVES: 
Primary Objectives: The primary objectives are the following: 
 To assess the effect of 9 mont hs of retreatment with Nefecon on urine protein to creatinine 
ratio (UPCR) and estimated glomerular filtra tion rate (eGFR) in patients who completed 
Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; and 
 To assess the effect of 9 months of treatment  with Nefecon on UPCR and eGFR in patients 
who completed Study Nef-301 with placebo treatment. 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives  are the following: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 9 months  of retreatment with Nefecon in patients who 
completed Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 9 mont hs of treatment with Nefecon in patients who 
completed Study Nef-301 with placebo treatment; 
 To assess the effect of 9 months of retreatment with Nefecon on additional aspects of renal 
function in patients who completed Study Nef-301 with Nefecon treatment; and 
 To assess the effect of [ADDRESS_886093] udy Nef-301 with placebo treatment. 
POPULATION: 
Patients who have completed Study Nef-[ADDRESS_886094] continue to be  treated with a stable dose o f 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor ther apy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
[ACEIs] and/or angiotensin II t ype I receptor blockers [ARBs]). In addition to meeting all other 
eligibilit y criteria, patients mu st have proteinuria based on 2 consecutive measurements separated

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter,  open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of Nefecon treatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study Nef-301 
and continue to be treated with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs). 
Patients who previously received  Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment, whereas 
patients who previously received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be treatment naïve to Nefecon. During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Investig ators will remain blin ded to treatment given 
in Study Nef-301. 
Assuming that 75% of the patients who have completed Study Nef-[ADDRESS_886097] 2 weeks and calculated by [CONTACT_657307] 1 g/day (1000 mg/day) or UPCR 0.8 g/gram ( 90 mg/mmol) in [ADDRESS_886098] eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the CKD-EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_14420]. 
During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 
16 mg/day dose may be reduced to  8 mg/day if clinically releva nt adverse events (AEs) develop 
during the 9-month Treatment  Period that the Investigator c onsiders related to the study drug and 
that mandate dose reduction. 
From the first day of dosing, a telephone visit will occur at 1 month, and onsite visits will occur 
at 3, 6, and 9 months. After comp leting 9 months of study drug tr eatment, patients will enter the 
2-week Tapering Period with Nefecon 8 mg/da y. To perform replicate laboratory sampling, an 
onsite visit will occur 14 to 35 days after the 9- month visit. An onsite follow-up visit will also 
occur at 12 months.  
Patients will remain on a stable dose of RAS i nhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout 
the study. If a patient receives resc ue treatment (syste mic steroids and/or  immunosuppressive 
treatment), the patient will be withdrawn from Nefecon treatment and continue with study visits 
for a total of [ADDRESS_886099] dose.

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886100] 2020 6 Patients who prematurely discont inue Nefecon at 16 mg/day s hould have the dose reduced to 
8 mg/day for 2 weeks, if feasible, to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  
Unless a patient withdraws his/her consent to par ticipate in the study, all patients should complete 
the remaining study visits (especially at 9 and 12 months), rega rdless of whether they are still 
receiving study drug. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
Nefecon 16 mg (four 4 mg budesonide modified -release capsules once per day [QD]) will be 
administered orally fo r [ADDRESS_886101] be swallowed whole and 
may not be chewed or crushed. 
The 16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically relevant AEs develop during the 
9-month Treatment Period that th e Investigator considers rela ted to the study drug and that 
mandate dose reduction. The Medica l Monitor should preferably be consulted prior to reducing 
the dose. If a dose reduction is made, then the dose should not be increased back to 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg). 
After completing [ADDRESS_886102] udy drug treatment, the daily dose of  study drug will be reduced 
from 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks to prevent adrenal insufficiency (Tapering Period). Patients  who have their daily dose of study drug reduced 
to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) due to safety and/or tolerability reasons during the 9-month 
Treatment Period will remain on this dose during the 2-week Ta pering Period. Patients who 
prematurely discontinue study dr ug while taking 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) should have the 
daily dose of study drug reduced  to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks, if feasible, to 
prevent adrenal insufficiency. 
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoints will include the following: 
 Ratio of eGFR at 9 months compared to base line, calculated using th e CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420]; and 
 Ratio of UPCR at 9 months compared to baseline. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The secondary efficacy endpoint s will include the following: 
 Ratio of urine albumin to creatinine ratio ( UACR) at 9 months compared to baseline; 
 Short Form 36 quality of life assessment  at 12 months comp ared to baseline; 
 Proportion of patients with microhematuri a at 9 months compared to baseline; 
 Proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment and time to  receiving rescue treatment; 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886103] 2020 7  Proportion of patients on dial ysis, undergoing kidney transp lantation, or with eGFR 
<15 mL/min per 1.73 m2; and 
 Cortisol suppression at 9 and 12 months, measured as urinary co rtisol excretion over 24 hours 
compared to baseline. 
SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety variables will include the following: 
 Treatment-emergent AEs, defined as AEs that  occur for the first time after dosing in 
Study Nef-[ADDRESS_886104] before dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE but worsen in severity after 
dosing in Study Nef-301 OLE; 
 AEs leading to study drug discontinuation; 
 AEs of special interest (AESIs) (severe inf ections requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], new onset o f 
diabetes, confirmed fracture, new osteonecros is, gastrointestinal bleeding that requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], reported occurrence  of cataract form ation, and reported onset of glaucoma); 
and 
 Vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory variables, and p hysical examination findings. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
No formal statistical analyses will be perfor med. eGFR, UPCR, and UACR are expected to be 
log-normally distributed; therefore, the ratio of  9 months to baseline for eGFR, UPCR, and UACR 
will be summarized using geometric mean and its associated 95% confidence interval. If outlying 
data are present for an endpoint, a supplementary description of the data will be performed using 
a robust regression approach. Separate summar ies will be provided according to whether the 
patient received Nefecon or placebo in Study Nef-301. 
Each efficacy variable will be summarized in [ADDRESS_886105] 1 e fficacy measurement (UPCR or eG FR) collected after dosing. Any 
data recorded after rescue trea tment will not be included in th e analysis for either analysis 
population. 
Baseline eGFR, UPCR, and UACR will be defined as  the geometric mean of the 2 consecutive 
measurements prior to dosing. The 9-month eGFR , UPCR, and UACR values will be defined as 
the geometric mean of the values recorded at Study Visits 8 and 9. 
For UPCR, the primary analysis will calculate the mean of the change from baseline in 
log(UPCR), with results back-trans formed to provide a geometric mean ratio and 95% confidence 
interval. For eGFR, due to the possible presence of  outlying data, the primar y analysis will use the 
same approach but deriving the mean change and it s confidence interval us ing a robust regression 
model. 
If a reasonable proportion of patients do not provide  9-month data, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_6486] a mixed model that incorpor ates any data recorded at 3, 6, and 12 months 
with different assumptions made about efficacy after discontinuation of treatment.

Summary statistics will be presented for changes in vital signs and laboratory tests throughout the 
study. Physical examinat ions will be listed. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
All patients who have completed Study Nef-301 and meet all eligibil ity criteria will be able to 
participate in Study Nef-301 OLE. Assuming that  75% of the patients who have completed 
Study Nef-[ADDRESS_886107] deviation for the change fr om baseline in log(UPCR) and log(eGFR) was 
0.59 and 0.18, respectively. If 125 patients are recr uited within each efficacy group (prior Nefecon 
or prior placebo) and a 25% reduction (ratio of 0. 75) in UPCR is observed in this study, the upper 
95% confidence limit for the baseline ratio will exte nd to 0.83. Likewise, if there is no change in 
eGFR observed in this st udy (ratio of 1), the lower 95% confiden ce limit for the baseline ratio will 
extend to 0.97. Therefore, this st udy will provide a sufficiently prec ise estimate of the efficacy o f 
Nefecon according to whether the patient pr eviously received Nefecon or placebo. 
SITES:  
It is anticipated that there will be approximately 140 sites globally.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s di sease, is the most 
common cause of glomerulonephriti s worldwide, with prevalence estimates varying from 5% to 
more than 40% of patients with glomerular disease.1 It is characterized by [CONTACT_618627]-containing immune complexes in the glomer ular mesangium, leadi ng to inflammation. 
Primary IgAN may present in different forms. One form is characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_618601], often associat ed with viral infections, but no or  minimal proteinu ria and long-term 
stable renal function. Another fo rm is characterized by [CONTACT_657308]/or reduced  glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Pa tients with this more severe form 
are at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require treatment. 
Primary IgAN can occur at any age, but the clin ical onset is common du ring the second or third 
decades of life.[ADDRESS_886119] in 15% to 20% of patients within 10 years and in 30% 
to 40% within [ADDRESS_886120] in patients with 
primary glomerular disease who re quire renal-replacement therapy.6 It is estimated that IgAN 
accounts for 10% of renal transp lants among patients with primar y glomerulonephritis in the 
[LOCATION_002], and between 7% to 20% of patients in Europe and Australia in long-term dialysis 
and renal transplantation programs.6,7 
Risk factors for disease progressi on include persistent proteinur ia, elevated serum creatinine, 
microhematuria, and speci fic histological lesions.8,9,10 Other risk factors for progressive renal 
failure include hypertension, reduced GFR, and to a lesser extent, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].11,12,13 
Clinical and nonclinical evidence suggests a pi[INVESTIGATOR_618602].14,15,16,17 In IgAN patients, mucosal B-cells located in Peyer’s patches are 
primed to produce aberrantly glycosylated, ga lactose-deficient polymeric immunoglobulin A1 
(Gd-IgA1), which in circulation can form  large immune complexes with anti-glycan 
immunoglobulin G antibodies.14,18,19,20 These complexes bind to glom erular mesangial cells and 
stimulate cell proliferation, rel ease of inflammatory mediators that promote proteinuria, and 
fibrotic remodeling, ultimately lead ing to loss of renal function.14,18 This pathogenesis suggests 
that local immunosuppression of mucosal B-cell ac tivation and proliferati on in Peyer’s patches, 
which reside in high density in the distal part of the small in testine, could attenuate Gd-IgA1 
production and leakage to the systemic circulation, thereby [CONTACT_657309].

Rigorous blood pressure control wi th angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or 
angiotensin II type I receptor bl ockers (ARBs) to achieve  blood pressure targ ets of <130/80 mmHg 
is the cornerstone of therapy. Fo r patients with proteinuria desp ite rigorous blood pressure control 
by [CONTACT_657310]-angiotensin system (RAS ) inhibition, immunosuppressive agen ts such as corticosteroids 
or cyclophosphamide may be added. Corticostero ids may lower the risk of kidney disease 
progression and the need for di alysis and transplantation, bu t the use is limited by [CONTACT_10070]-known 
adverse effects.4 
Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid (GCS ) with weak mineralocorticoid activities. 
Immunosuppressive and anti-inf lammatory properties have led to the approval of budesonide

Nefecon is an oral, modified-rel ease capsule formulation of budes onide that combines a delayed 
capsule disintegration with a sustained/prolonged rel ease of the active ingredie nt in the distal part 
of the small intestine. By [CONTACT_657311], Peyer’s patches,  reside in high density, a local pharmacological 
effect is achieved. Budesonide may suppress lo cal B-cell activation and proliferation in these 
patches and inhibit subsequent pr oduction and leakage of Gd-IgA1 into the systemic circulation. 
Glomerular mesangial deposition of Gd-IgA1 resu lting in nephritis and loss of renal function can

Nefecon is under investigation fo r the treatment of patients w ith primary IgAN at risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_618605]. From the results in Phase 1 and 2 studies in healthy volunteers and in patients 
with primary IgAN, Nefecon is suggested to be a safe and well-tolerated steroid formulation for 
adjunctive therapy to ACEI and/ or ARB treatment in IgAN patients at risk of progressing to ESRD. 
Further details regarding the noncli nical studies of Nefecon and th e clinical development program 
can be found in the I nvestigator’s Brochure.24 
The current study is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open- label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Nefecon tr eatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 
Study Nef-301 and continue to be treated with a stable  dose of RAS inhib itor therapy (ACEIs 
and/or ARBs). 
1.2 Benefit/Risk 
The active ingredient in Nefecon is budesonide , a potent steroid with a high first pass liver 
metabolism, which makes it well suited for local treatment, where feasible. The advantage of local application of budesonide has been  demonstrated in several mark eted products, such as for the 
treatment of asthma, where the inhaled budesonide  products can provide a high concentration of 
steroid to the airway tissue with only limited syst emic exposure due to the low bioavailability. In 
this way, high exposure of the steroid can be ach ieved to the target ti ssue with only limited 
systemic exposure and risk for st eroid-related adverse effects.  
Budesonide is a well-characteri zed glucocorticosteroid that, apar t from treatment of asthma, also 
has been developed for local treatment of infl ammatory conditions such  as Crohn’s disease and 
ulcerative colitis. These products ha ve been on the market for up to  [ADDRESS_886124] supported the

During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 
16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if c linically relevant advers e events (AEs) develop 
during the 9-month Treatment  Period that the Investigator c onsiders related to the study drug and 
that mandate dose reduction. 
From the first day of dosing, a telephone visit will  occur at 1 month, and onsite visits will occur at 
3, 6, and 9 months. After completing 9 months of  study drug treatment, patients will enter the 
2-week Tapering Period with Ne fecon 8 mg/day. To perform re plicate laboratory sampling, an 
onsite visit will occur 14 to 35 days after the 9- month visit. An onsite follow-up visit will also 
occur at 12 months. 
Patients will remain on a stab le dose of RAS inhibitor therap y (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout 
the study. If a patient receives re scue treatment (systemic steroi ds and/or immunosuppressive 
treatment), the patient will be withdrawn from Nefecon treatment and continue w ith study visits

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886146] 2020 27 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Treatment Groups 
Patients will receive Nefecon 16 mg/day for a 9-month period. The 16 mg/day dose may be 
reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically  relevant AEs develop during the 9-month Tr eatment Period that 
the Investigator considers related to the study drug and that mandate dose reduction. 
After completing 9 months of study drug treatment , patients will enter the 2-week Tapering Period 
with Nefecon 8 mg/day to prevent adrenal insuff iciency. See Section 5.5.3. Patients will then enter 
the 3-month Follow-up Period. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
Budesonide, which is the active drug substance in Nefecon, is a well-do cumented compound with 
extensive experience from clinical use in the treatment of asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. 
Nefecon is a modified-release oral  formulation, designed specifically to rel ease budesonide in the 
distal part of the small intestine where Peyer’ s patches reside at high density, thus providing a 
potent immunosuppressive effect to reduce local  B-cell activation and proliferation and the 
subsequent production of Gd-IgA1. Based on safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2b study, 
where doses of placebo and Nefecon 8 mg and 16 mg  were given daily for 9 months, the Nefecon 
16 mg/day dose was selected for Phase 3. Nefecon treatment at doses of up to 16 mg/day for 
[ADDRESS_886147] despi[INVESTIGATOR_657297], has 
demonstrated promising efficacy results on protei nuria reduction and eGFR stabilization, with no 
safety concerns.24  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
This is an open-label study. All patients wi ll receive Nefecon treatment for 9 months. 
During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Inves tigators will remain blinded to treatment given 
in Study Nef-301. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Procedures for breaking the b lind are not applicable for th e current study (Nef-301 OLE). 
5.5 Drug Supplies 
5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging 
Nefecon is a modified-release capsule containing  4 mg of the active substance budesonide. The 
capsule is white to off-white, of size 1, with bl ack printing “CAL10 4MG,” and is coated with an 
enteric coating layer that delivers the capsule int act until it reaches the distal part of the small 
intestine. The capsule contains triple coated be ads with a sugar sphere as the core. The inner 
coating layer contains the active substance, and the outer coating layer is a prolonged-release 
polymer coating that cont rols the rate of release of the ac tive substance once the capsule has 
dissolved.  
Nefecon capsules will be packaged  in high-density polyethylene bottles and should be stored 
between 15°C to 25°C in their original container with the cap tightly sealed. Nefecon will be 
packaged and labeled according to the requirements of local law a nd legislation, as well as current

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886148] 2020 28 Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical  Practice (GCP) guidelines. Proof labels, 
detailing actual label text, will be available in the study files. 
5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will trigger the first shipment of study drug to the site for 
the patient. The Investigator (or his/her desi gnee) will dispense the study drug to the patient. 
Patients must take the first dose of study drug in the presence of site staff during Study Visit 4.  
Following initial shipment, there will be an au tomatic resupply of stu dy drug to the site for 
dispensing to the patient at Study Visits 6 and 7. 
The Investigator (or his/her desi gnee) must record the patient number, the identification number 
of the study drug dispensed, the date dispensed, a nd the amount dispensed in the source documents. 
The disposition of study drug delivered to an Investig ator will be recorded on a per-patient basis. 
Dispensation logs will be completed for all patients at each site documenting dispensed and returned study drug throughout the c ourse of the study. Patients will  be reminded at each scheduled 
study visit to return all empty bottles and unused study drug. The dispensation logs will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_618636]. 
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
Nefecon 16 mg (four 4 mg budesonide modified-rel ease capsules QD) will be administered orally 
for [ADDRESS_886149] be swallowed whole and 
may not be chewed or crushed. 
The 16 mg/day dose may be reduced to 8 mg/day if clinically relevant AEs develop during the 
9-month Treatment Period that the Investigator considers re lated to the study  drug and that 
mandate dose reduction. The Medi cal Monitor should preferably be  consulted prior to reducing 
the dose. If a dose reduction is ma de, then the dose should not be in creased back to 4 capsules QD 
(Nefecon 16 mg). 
After completing [ADDRESS_886150] udy drug treatment, the daily dose of study drug will be reduced 
from 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks to prevent adrenal insufficiency (Tapering Period). Patients who have their daily dose of study drug reduced 
to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) due to safety a nd/or tolerability reas ons during the 9-month 
Treatment Period will remain on this dose duri ng the 2-week Tapering Period. Patients who 
prematurely discontinue study dr ug while taking 4 capsules QD (Nefecon 16 mg) sh ould have the 
daily dose of study drug reduced  to 2 capsules QD (Nefecon 8 mg) for 2 weeks, if feasible, to 
prevent adrenal insufficiency. 
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance 
Patients will be instructed to re turn all empty bottles a nd unused study drug to th e site at the next 
study visit. Accountability of the used and unused study drug will be recorded. Compliance with 
the study drug regimen will be evaluated by [CONTACT_657318]. During the Treatment

accurate records of all study drug received, disp ensed, or returned/disposed, as well as a 
temperature log to document temper ature conditions during storage. 
Temperature excursions up to 30°C will be allowed. Details regarding allowed excursions will be 
available in the pharmacy manual. 
Return and destruction of study drug will be de scribed in the pharmacy manual. The Investigator 
agrees to only distribute study drug to patients participating in the study. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Patients must not receive other investigational drugs during the study. Systemic immunosuppressive drugs  (including GCSs) are prohibite d during the study. Herbs for 
medicinal use, including Eastern herbs and Eastern traditional medi cines, with a known effect on 
the immune system (e.g., Tripterygium wilfordii or ginseng) or with a kn own effect on proteinuria 
or creatinine, are not allowed during the study. Patie nts should be encouraged to not use herbs for 
medicinal use, including Eastern herbs and Ea stern traditional medici nes, during the study; 
however, if used, they should be recorded as concomitant medications. See Appendix E for 
additional information on  immunosuppressive drugs. 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole ) are prohibited during treatment with study drug. 
See the US Food and Drug Administrati on website for additional examples.
29 During this time, 
patients should also be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. 
If a patient receives rescue  treatment (systemic steroids and/or  immunosuppressive treatment), the 
patient will be withdrawn from Ne fecon treatment and continue with  study visits for a total of

8.1 Adverse Events 
Ongoing AEs from the patient’s involvement in St udy Nef-[ADDRESS_886170] dose of study drug in Study Nef-301 OLE. New 
treatment-emergent AEs will be those starting with Study Nef-301 OLE dosing (Study Visit 4). 
An AE is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence in a cl inical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or diseas e temporally associated  with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the in vestigational medicinal product. 
The Investigator will collect AE s with a non-leading question such as “have you experienced any 
new health problems or worseni ng of existing conditions” as well as collecting ev ents directly 
observed or spontaneously volunteer ed by [CONTACT_279950]. Al l AEs, including observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, including AESIs and SAEs, w ill be monitored and documented by  [CONTACT_737] (or his/her 
designee) from Study Visit [ADDRESS_886171] dose of study drug, inclusive, regardless 
of whether the patient discontinues the study prem aturely. Patients should be instructed to report 
any AE that they experience to the Investigator (or hi s/her designee).  
Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  [CONTACT_445239]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be reco rded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at Study Visit 1 should not be reported as an AE unless the 
medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline worsens in severity or seriousness at 
any time during the study. In this cas e, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant ab normal laboratory or ot her examination (e.g., physical examination) 
findings that are detected during the study or are presen t at Study Visit [ADDRESS_886172] that is determin ed to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE. 
Any medical condition or abnormal finding that worsen s in severity or seriousness and that fulfils 
the criteria for an SAE will be reported as such, from signature [CONTACT_43998]. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended respon ses to a medicinal product re lated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal product m eans that a causal 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886173] a r easonable possibility, i.e., the 
relationship cannot  be ruled out. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable Refe rence Safety Information (RSI). For Nefecon the 
RSI is included in the Investigat or’s Brochure curre ntly in force.24 The RSI will be reviewed yearly 
and the periodicity of the review  will be harmonized with the re porting period of the Development 
Safety Update Report. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Even ts by [CONTACT_248128] (intens ity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to  its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity: 
 Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily 
activities. 
 Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
 Severe – An event that is incapacitating with  inability to work or perform normal daily 
activities. 
Causality Assessment: 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of  the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: 
No (not related, unlikely to be related) – The time  course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rule s out a causal relation ship and another cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], co mplications, etc.) is suspected. 
Yes (related) – The time course between the ad ministration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the AE is consistent with a causa l relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (eviden ce) or arguments to sugge st a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
o Each report should be evaluated in the contex t of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any othe r disease the patient may have. 
Calliditas Therapeutics AB 
Clinical Study Protocol Nef-301 OLE 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886174] 2020 39  Concomitant drug- 
o The other drugs the patient is taking or th e treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whethe r any of them might be reco gnized to cause the event in 
question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data  may indicate whether a particular  response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/ or mental stresses- 
o The exposure to stress might i nduce adverse changes in the re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical 
and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and pharmacoki netics of the study drug- 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorptio n, distribution, metabolis m, and excretion) 
of the study drug should be considered. 
8.[ADDRESS_886175] 
The following, which are establis hed potentially clinica lly significant conse quences of steroid 
treatment, will be considered AESIs:  
 Severe infection requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 New onset of diabetes mellitus; 
 Confirmed fracture; 
 New osteonecrosis; 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding th at requires hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 Reported occurrence of cataract formation; and 
 Reported onset of glaucoma. 
If not already determined from th e general questions used to cap ture AE, the patient must be 
explicitly asked if the fo llowing have occurred sin ce the last study visit:  
 Have you been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657298]/or gastrointestinal bleeding? 
 Have you had any X-ray confirmed fractures? 
 Have you been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus? 
 Have you visited an ophthalmologist and been diagnosed with glaucoma or cataract(s)? 
AESIs may or may not constitute an SAE. Howe ver, all types of AESI s must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety and processed as SAEs , regardless of their fo rmal classification of 
seriousness, in accordance with th e instructions in Section 8.4. Th e AESIs that do not fall into the 
category of SAEs will be recorded from Study Visit [ADDRESS_886176] dose of study

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886177] 2020 40 8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is cons idered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Calliditas, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
o NOTE: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Calliditas, its occurrence place s the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an event that, had it occurre d in a more severe fo rm, might have caused 
death. 
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445216]; 
o NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room  visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l admission for more 
than 24 hours will not be recorded as a SAE under this criteri on, nor will elective 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657299]-ex isting (prior to signing of 
the ICF) conditions that did not worsen from baseline. Howe ver, unexpected complications 
and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657300]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180136] (i.e., no place to stay, live too far aw ay to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l visits) will not be 
considered inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be  life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not re sult in inpatient hosp italizations, or the 
development of drug dependency. 
8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators

treatment but will not be withdrawn from the study. 
The patient should be followed by [CONTACT_42498]. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason befo re the anticipated date, the I nvestigator should notify Medpace 
Clinical Safety. At the completion of the pregna ncy, the Investigator will document the outcome 
of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification 
as an SAE (i.e., postpartum co mplication, spontaneous  abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the Investigator should fo llow the procedures for reporting an SAE.

The Safety Analysis Set will include all patients  who have received at least 1 dose of study drug 
at the time of the analysis. 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
No formal statistical analyses will be perf ormed. eGFR, UPCR, and UACR are expected to be 
log-normally distributed; therefore, the ratio of  9 months to baseline for eGFR, UPCR, and UACR 
will be summarized using geometric mean and its associated 95% confidence interval. If outlying 
data are present for an endpoint, a supplementary description of the data will be performed using 
a robust regression approach. Separate summaries  will be provided according to whether the 
patient received Nefecon or placebo in Study Nef-301. 
Each efficacy variable will be summarized in 2 different analysis sets, the Completers Analysis 
Set and the Full Analysis Set. Any data recorded after rescue treatment wi ll not be included in the 
analysis for either  analysis population. 
Baseline eGFR, UPCR, and UACR will be defined as  the geometric mean of the 2 consecutive 
measurements prior to dosing. The 9-month eGFR , UPCR, and UACR values will be defined as 
the geometric mean of the values recorded at Study Visits 8 and 9. 
For UPCR, the primary analysis wi ll calculate the mean of the change from baseline in log(UPCR), 
with results back-transformed to provide a geomet ric mean ratio and 95% c onfidence interval. For 
eGFR, due to the possible presence of outlying data, the primary analysis will use the same 
approach but deriving th e mean change and its co nfidence interval using a robust regression model. 
If a reasonable proportion of patients do not provide 9-month data, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_6486] a mixed model that incorpor ates any data recorded at 3, 6, and 12 months 
with different assumptions made about efficacy after discontinuation of treatment. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will 
include all safety data from patien ts who have received at least [ADDRESS_886190] dose of study drug and separately for periods during and 
after dosing. 
Summary statistics will be presen ted for changes in vital signs and laboratory tests throughout the 
study. Physical examinat ions will be listed.

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886202] 2020 48 11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibil ity of the Investigator to ensure that the study is c onducted in accordance with 
the protocol, ICH GCP, Directive 2001/20/EC (EU sites only), applicable regulatory requirements, 
and the Declaration of Helsinki and that valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, 
Calliditas in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before the enrollment of any patie nt in this study, Calliditas or their designee will review with the 
Investigator and site personnel th e following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRFs 
and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for reporting 
SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit Calliditas or thei r designee to monitor th e study, which will require 
direct access to source data, as frequently as de emed necessary to determine that data recording 
and protocol adherence are satisf actory. During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the 
eCRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may 
be made. After the eCRF data is entered by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety 
information, completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify 
data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clin ical study. If necessary, requests for 
clarification or correction will be sent to Investig ators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be 
expected to cooperate with the monitor and pr ovide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_657321] e study-specific monitoring log. 
11.[ADDRESS_886203] be available fo r inspection by [CONTACT_618650], Calliditas or th eir designee, and the IRB/IEC as appropriate. Patients or their 
legal representatives may request their medical info rmation be given to thei r personal physician or 
other appropriate medical personnel responsible for their welfare. 
Patient source data is co nfidential and disclo sure to third parties other than those noted above is 
prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records 
To enable evaluations and/or audi ts from regulatory authorities or Calliditas, the Investigator will 
keep records, including the identity of all par ticipating patients (sufficient information to link 
records, e.g., eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed IC Fs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], SAE 
forms, source documents, and de tailed records of tr eatment disposition. Th e records should be 
retained by [CONTACT_657322], local regulations, or 
as specified in the Clinical St udy Agreement, whicheve r is longer. The Inve stigator must obtain 
written permission from Calliditas before disposi ng of any records, even if retention requirements 
have been met. 
If the Investigator relocates, re tires, or for any reason withdr aws from the study, Calliditas should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an a cceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator, another institution, or to Calliditas.

Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_886219] 2020 58 APPENDIX C:  RENIN-ANGIO TENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITOR AND 
OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS 
ACCORDING TO THE 2012 KIDNEY DISEASE: IMPROVING GLOBAL 
OUTCOMES GUIDELINES 
Patients must continue on a stable dose of reni n-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapy 
(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and/or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers 
[ARBs]) at the maximum allowed dose or maxi mum tolerated dose according to the 2012 Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Ou tcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.1 A stable dose is defined as a dose 
within 25% of the dose at Vis it 17a or 17b in Study Nef-301.  
The following are recommendations for optimizati on and maintenance of RAS/antihypertensive 
therapy that are in line with the 2012 KDIGO guidelines1 and should be followed throughout the 
study: 
 Antihypertensive therapy is recommended to ach ieve a target systolic blood pressure 
<125 mmHg and target diastolic blood pressu re <75 mmHg. Antiproteinuric therapy should 
be used to try to achieve a ta rget proteinuria level <1 g/day. Antihypertensive therapy in these 
patients will follow current  clinical guidelines; 
 ACEIs are recommended as a first-line therapy and increased to the maximum tolerated daily 
dose (not to exceed the maximum recommended daily dose) depending on the degree of arterial 
hypertension and proteinuria. Pa tients can be converted to an ARB when ACEIs are not 
tolerated. Combination ACEI and ARB thera py is discouraged, but may be used at the 
discretion of the Investigator. If  combination therapy is used, th e stable dose should be based 
on the maximum tolerated dose rather  than the maximum allowed dose; 
 In patients who do not tolerate ACEIs or ARBs , other antihypertensive treatments may be used 
according to local treatment guidelines to achie ve the target blood pres sure. Study centers are 
not limited to the use of specific compounds; 
 Antihypertensive therapy with other agents incl uding diuretics, aldoste rone agonists, calcium 
channel blockers, and β-blockers may be maintained or  added according to the 2012 KDIGO 
guidelines and the clinical guideli ne of the individual study center in order to achieve the target 
blood pressure;1  
 In the case of hypotension, withdrawal of other antihypertensive (non-ACEI/non-ARB) 
medications should be considered as the first alternative; and  
 In the case of hypertension, addition or dose increase of other antihypertensive 
(non-ACEI/non-ARB) medicatio ns, as recommended by [CONTACT_941] 2012 KDIGO guidelines, should 
be considered.1

TITLE  Long itudinal evaluation of [18F]MK -6240 as a novel tau PET radiotracer in subjects 
with Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment compared to healthy 
volunteers  
TEST PRODUCT  [18F]MK -6240  
STUDY CENTER University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health  
TRIAL OBJECTIVES  The overall goal of this protocol is to characterize the longitudinal change in tau 
burden using [18F]MK -6240.  Data from this study may be used to inform the design 
of future therapeutic trials utilizing [18F]MK -6240 as a marker of disease 
progression.  
The primary objectives of this study are:  
• To characterize the longitudinal change in [18F]MK -6240 brain uptake 
at 26 (6 months) and 52 (12 months) weeks compared to baseline in 
subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  dementia , mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI)  and healthy volunteers (HV).    This comparison may 
include 78 (18 month) week measures, if the 26 or 52 week measures 
are not available, in order to attain 6 month and 12 month intervals .     
• To correlate the changes in [18F]MK -6240 uptake and changes in 
clinical cognitive assessments (MMSE, ADAS- cog and CDR)  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To characterize the longitudinal change in [18F]MK -6240 brain uptake 
at 104 (24 months) weeks compared to baseline in subjects with A D 
dementia, MCI  and hea lthy volunteers.    This comparison may include 
130 (30 month) week measures, if two or more [18F]MK -6240 scans 
are not available.  
• To evaluate cross -sectional comparison of [18F]MK -6240 uptake in 
AD, MCI and HV  at baseline 26, 52 and 104 weeks .   This may include 
78 (18 month) and/or 130 (30 month) week measures, if the 26, 52, or 104 week measures are not available.    
 
STUDY DESIGN  This is a longitudinal, observational study evaluating the imaging characteristics of the tau PET radioligand [
18F]MK -6240 in AD, MCI  and HV subjects. Up to 42  
subjects including approximately 28 MCI/mild AD subjects, up to 5 moderate AD 
subjects, and 9 similarly aged HV subjects will be consented and screened.   
Imaging procedures includ e [11C]PiB, [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783628] one [18F]MK -6240 PET imaging session will be 
considered enrolled in the study. As many as  28 MCI/mild AD subjects, 5 moderate 
AD subjects, and 9 similarly aged HV subjects  may complete an evaluable 
baseline [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783629] 23 subjects (15 MCI/mild AD, 
3 moderate AD, 5  HV subjects ) to complete the 24 month follow up.  Subjects who 
discontinue prior to completing the 12- month or 18- month [18F]MK -6240 PET scan 
may be replaced in the study until a total of 15 patients (MCI/AD) complete the [ADDRESS_783630] a final 
evaluat ion any time between 18 and 24 months.  
All subjects will provide informed consent at enrollment before any study 
procedures are performed.  The Screening procedures will occur within 60 days 
prior to baseline [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783631] 26, 2021                                              Page 6 of 36 assessment, review of medical history and medications, physical examination, 
[11C]PiB PET imaging and brain MRI.  
 
 
[11C]PiB and MRI IMAGING: 
As part of the Screening Visit, subjects will complete structural brain MRI imaging  
which  will be used for eligibility evaluation, co- registration with PET imaging and 
volumetric analysis.   
If an evaluable PiB scan has been acquired and is available for use in this study 
and occurred within 12 months of screening, the scan will not be repeated. 
Otherwise, [11C]PiB PET imaging will be obtained at screening to evaluate for 
amyloid deposition. Subjects will be considered amyloid positive if [11C]PiB DVR 
(distribution volume ratio) imaging demonstrates amyloid deposition based on 
qualitative read or DVR index value >1.20 .  
For the [11C]PIB PET imaging session, subjects will receive a single IV bolus 
injection target dose of 15 mCi ± 20% of [11C]PIB and scanned dynamically for 70 
minutes.   For participants who may not be able to tolerate this long scan, a 20 
minute scan will be offered after 50 minutes of uptake.  
 
[18F]MK -6240 PET IMAGING VISITS:   
Subjects will complete [18F]MK -6240 PET imaging at four time points:  Baseline, 6 
months, 12 months and 24 months.   If unable to complete the 6 month, 12 month, 
or 24 month visit, an 18 month and/or 30 month visit may instead be scheduled, 
totaling a maximum of four time points.  [18F]MK -6240 is administered 
intravenous ly at a target dose of 185 MBq ( 5 mCi ) plus or minus 20% .  Image 
acquisition will occur from [ADDRESS_783632] -injection .  Repeat of up to two 
[18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783633] will be conducted by [CONTACT_593917] 4 days (±2 days) post -injection of [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783634] information regarding new adverse or ongoing events.     
The primary outcome for [18F]MK -6240  imaging will be the standardi zed uptake 
value ratio (SUVR).  The reference region is the inferior cerebellum  gray matter . A 
standardized volume of interest (VOI) template will be used to quantitatively  
measure [18F]MK -6240 tracer uptake in regions with expected tau pathology.

ANALYSIS OF STUDY 
OBJECTIVES  
 
  
 
   
The change in [18F]MK -6240 uptake (e.g. composite and regional SUVR, voxel 
based statistics or change in tau distribution) will be determined by [CONTACT_593919] -up visit (6, 12 and 24 months).    If the 6, 12, 
or 24 month visit measures are not available, this may include 18 and/or 30 month 
visit measures. The change in [18F]MK -6240 uptake will be compared among the 
groups (AD, MCI and HV subjects)  aligned on intervals of 6, 12, 18 and 24 months .   
The relationship between the change in [18F]MK -6240 uptake (e.g. composite and 
regional SUVR, voxel based statistics or change in tau distribution) and change in 
clinical  severity or cognitive outcomes will be analyzed in AD  dementia , MCI and

2.1 Background  
Neurofibrillary tangles begin during the preclinical phase of AD, and by [CONTACT_593920]  (Braak & 
Braak, 1990; Braak, Braak, & Bohl, 1993) . However, the rate of temporal change in 
neurofibrillary tangle burden in individual cases is poorly understood.  
Up until recently, the information about the temporal and spatial signal from neurofibrillary 
tangle (tau related) pathology in AD has come from neuropathology studies of brain bank cases  
(Gomez -Isla et al., 1996) and in life from CSF tau protein levels which have no spatial 
information and suffer from lack of standardized assays from lab to lab ( Mattsson et al., 2013) .  
The advent of tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using compounds  (Chien et 
al., 2014 ; Maruyama et al., 2013; Villemagne et al., 2014) such as [F -18]AV1451 and now [F -
18]MK6240 (Hostetler et al., 2016; Lohith et al., 2018) hold promise of making major 
breakthroughs in diagnosing AD accurately  and characterizing its rate of progression.  Our 
group has published one of the first clinical papers  (Betthauser et al., 2018) on MK -6240  
describing its temporal properties and imaging characteristics. W orld-wide the field  has now 
conducted over 4000 exams with this compound and find it safe with no radioligand- related 
serious adverse events and strong binding to AD -relevant brain regions in amyloid positive 
subjects in a pattern consistent with the neuropathology literature (see Figure 1 ).  
 HV subjects .  In addition, the correlation between baseline [18F]MK -6240 uptake 
and baseline clinical endpoints will be evaluated in  all subjects . 
Cross -sectional comparisons will be made among the clinical groups (AD, MCI and 
HV subjects) at Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months for the following measures : [18F]MK -
6240 uptake (composite and regional SUVR), neuropsychological testing (MMSE, 
CDR, ADAS -cog), MRI markers of atrophy such as hippocampal volume.    If the 6, 
12, or 24 month visit measures are not available, this c ross-sectional comparison 
may include 18 and/or [ADDRESS_783637] been successfully imaged in several studies in AD patients using high affinity 11- C and 
18-F- labeled PET tracers such as PiB or florbetapir  (see Johnson, 2018 for a review ; 
Villemagne et al., 2013 ; Villemagne et al., 2012) .  
2.2 Rationale for choice of amyloid imaging radiotracer:  
[
11C]PIB is the first of the amyloid imaging agents and is still considered the best of these 
agents for its overall imaging properties including lower non- specific off -target white matter 
binding and its large dynamic range (Villemagne et al., 2012) .  [11C]PIB utilizes carbon [ADDRESS_783638] -decaying (20 minute half -life). While a distinct advantage for such a fast -decaying tracer 
is a much lower radiation exposure to the body, its short half life makes it unwieldy for wide 
commercial distribution. Thus, even though [11C]PIB offers the best image characteristics and 
lowest radiation exposure (about 3mSv which is less than 1/3rd of the dosage of newer F18 
agents, about 10mSV), it was never feasible to produce commercially in large scale and FDA approval was not ever sought by [CONTACT_593921]. Each dose must be manufactured locally under 
IND.  Since its initial discovery in 2004, four other agents have been discovered ([18F]NAV, 
[18F]florbetapir, [18F]florbetaben, [18F]flutemetamol) and three of these have gone through 
the requisite process to obtain FDA approval —[
18F]florbetapir, [18F]florbetaben, and 
[18F]flut emetamol. All of the FDA approved tracers have inferior imaging properties when 
compared to PIB, but to their advantage they are also Fluorine- 18 based with a much longer 
half-life (~110 minutes) which allows them to be manufactured at central specialized 
manufacturing sites and distributed regionally throughout the country. (This is similar conceptually to how hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593906] [
18]FDG for clinical use from an 
external vendor.)

individuals organized by [INVESTIGATOR_176216] -based Braak stages. [18F]MK -6240 
spatial binding patterns in PiB(+) individuals recapi[INVESTIGATOR_593907]’s disease, including in the hippocampus. The PiB(+) de mentia case in the far 
rightward column was clinical diagnosed with probable AD dementia (not informed by [CONTACT_593922]) but exhibited only circumscribed 
[18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783639] to which other amyloid radiotracers are compared (Klunk et al., 2015) . This is due to 1) its wider dynamic range which may 
improve its sensitivity to earlier stages of amyloid elevation 2) its relatively better target -
specific binding pattern such that it binds largely only to the fibrillar amyloid plaques, while F18 agents are more lipophilic and characteristically bind to off -target myelin- containing brain 
regions including very high binding in the white matter and thalamus making it difficult to accurately visually rate and quantify signal that is due to true amyloid signal versus off -target 
‘spi[INVESTIGATOR_393833]’ effects into tissue of interest.  
In a series of studies, PiB has demonstrated high agreement with histopathology for identifying amyloid plaques (Bacskai et al., 2007; Ikonomovic et al., 2008; Joie et al., 2018; Leinonen et al., 2008).  PiB differentiates AD cases from controls in vivo (Klunk et al., 2004) , 
and predicts subsequent cognitive decline in cognitively normal adults (Clark et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2016; Donohue et al., 2017), and conversion to dementia in patients with MCI (Chen et al., 2014; Frings et al., 2018; Hatashita & Wakebe, 2017; Iaccarino et al., 2017; Kemppainen et al., 2014; Kikukawa et al., 2018; Trzepacz et al., 2014; Wolk et al., 2009) .  
Comparison to Florbetaben  
Villemagne et al. (Villemagne et al., 2012)  compared 20 people (10 AD dementia and 10 
controls) with [
11C]PIB and [18F]Florbetaben. The correlation of global amyloid burden as 
estimated with each tracer was r=.97. However the effect -size was nearly uniformly higher 
(by 10%) for PIB than florbetaben.  
 
Comparison to Florbetapir  
Wolk and colleagues (Wolk et al., 2012)  compared [11C]PiB to [18F]Florbetapir in 12 AD 
cases and 14 healthy control subjects of similar age. Global beta- amyloid composite scores 
were computed in parallel fashion and correlated. The Pearson coefficient was r= .78. The area under the curve for separating cases from controls was 1.[ADDRESS_783640] compared agreement between PIB and [18F]Flutemetamol and all report very strong robust agreement (Adamczuk et al., 2016; Leinonen et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2017; Mountz et al., 2015; Vandenberghe et al., 2010) .  Mountz et al. (2015)  report a 
correlation greater than 0.90 in global amyloid burden and strong agreement (.82 kappa coefficient) for visual rating.  Adamzuck found the concordance between PIB  and 
flutemetamol of =94% for amyloid positivity and r=.84 for the global index score 
semiquantitative composite.  Leinonen et al (2013)  and Vandenberghe et al. (2010)  reported 
correlations of .[ADDRESS_783641] 26, 2021                                              Page 12 of 36  
Summary: PIB is the standard for comparison for the F18 amyloid agents. PiB corresponds 
strongly to amyloid pathology at autopsy, separates cases from controls with AUCs at or near 1.0 (Lowe et al., 2017)  and PIB elevation in controls and MCI is correlated with high 
specificity to later decline and conversion to dementia. The F18 agents are strongly corre lated to PiB. The higher radiation dose of the F18 agents, and their higher off -target 
binding to white matter (lipophilicity) make them less optimal than PiB for detecting and 
quantifying amyloid plaques in vivo  in a clinical research setting.  
 
2.3 Rationale  for imaging tau with [F- 18]MK6240  
The ability to image brain amyloid has offered an important advance for the diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative conditions  (Jack et al., 2018; Johnson, 2018 ).  In contrast to Aβ -rich neuritic  
and diffuse amyloid plaques, the density and distribution of  pathological tau, aggregated in 
neurofibrillary tangles, increases with AD -related cognitive impairment and correlates with 
neurodegeneration.  But the spatiotemporal rate of progression in the brain within individual 
people is not well understood. This information is needed in order to appropriately  plan 
intervention trials. Furthermore, first generation tau tracers such as AV1451 and THK5351 have been shown to have off -target binding effects in regions relevant to AD, which poses 
challenges to treatment trials wishing to demonstrate target engagement with those compounds.  
   
[
18F]MK -6240 has been developed as a highly specific positron emitting radiopharmaceutical 
for in vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates  (Hostetler et al., 2016 ; Lohith et al., 2018) . [18F]MK -
6240 has been previously evaluated by [CONTACT_593923]. This study aims to evaluate the longitudinal change in 
tau burden using [18F]MK -6240 PET imaging in relation to cog nitive and functional metrics.  
2.4 Human Safety and Tolerability  
[18F]MK -6240 has been evaluated in over  1000 subjects world -wide in several studies including 
over 240 at the UWSMPH and is well tolerated with no known radioligand- related serious 
adverse events.  
3 S TUDY PURPOSE  
The overall goal of this study  is to evaluate the longitudinal change in the uptake of [18F]MK -
6240. The data obtained will be vital in forming hypotheses for future larger studies, particularly 
for hypotheses about effect sizes that may inform future large scale clinical trials .

4.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objectives of this study are : 
• To characterize the longitudinal change in [18F]MK -6240 brain uptake at 26 and 52 
weeks compared to baseline in subjects with dementia due to AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and healthy volunteers (HV).   This comparison may include 78 (18 
month) week measures, if the 26 or 52 week measures are not  available, in order to 
attain 6 month and 12 month intervals .       
• To correlate the changes in [18F]MK -6240 uptake and changes in clinical cognitive 
assessments (MMSE, ADAS -cog and CDR).   
4.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To characterize the longitudinal change in [18F]MK -6240 brain uptake at 104 (24 
months) weeks compared to baseline in subjects with dementia due to AD , mild 
cognitive  impairment and healthy volunteers.   This comparison may include 130 (30 
month) week measures, if two or more prior  [18F]MK -6240 scans are not available.  
• To evaluate cross -sectional comparison of [18F]MK -6240 uptake in AD, MCI and HV 
at baseline 26, 52 and 104 weeks .  This cross -sectional comparison may include 78 
(18 month) and/or 130 (30 month) week  measures, if the 26, 52, or 104  week 
measures are not available.

permission to contact [CONTACT_982], the patient will be contact[CONTACT_38435], and the study will be explained per the phone screening script. The phone screening script  
also contains an oral consent and HIPPA authorization for medical records review. 
The study team will conduct the eligibility checklist with the patient and will access medical records with oral consent.  Medical records may be requested with oral 
Version 4, August 26, 2021                                              Page 17 of 36 consent  to evaluate eligibility including current diagnoses and m edications , cognitive 
status , and prior head imaging.   
• For ADRC clinical core(2015 -0030)  and WRAP (2016- 0634)  participants, the 
applicable source study  staff will conduct database screens for participants who meet 
criteria for older controls or patient groups. [CONTACT_94795], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16604], is also 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_593909].  
• From this general pool, case records will be examined further for eligibility criteria. Candidates who are ostensibly eligible on the record review will be contact[CONTACT_426]  a 
source study staff member via letter or phone and invited to participate. Reasons for 
non-participation of eligible unscreened candidates will be logged.  
• Interested candidates will be phone screened . If all eligibility criteria are met, the 
participant will have the in person screening visit  to involve cognition, physical exam 
and MRI and PiB .  A screening log will be kept to record reasons for screen failures . A 
waiver of written  consent is requested for the phone screen. Interested candidates will 
undergo verbal consent before screening information is collected via phone.  
• Informed consent is  required prior to procedures. Only individuals with capacity to 
consent at screening will be included.   For participants diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 
disease, this will be assessed by [CONTACT_593928] a brief interview format based on questions on the Consent form.  For all others, this is with 
the study coordinator.  After enrollment, subjects who decline to the point where they no longer have capacity to consent will be allowed to continue because  they initially 
expressed this desire on the enrollment consent form .   
• In the event  that reconsent is needed during the course of the study, capacity will be 
reassessed at that time.  If a participant is found to lack decisional capacity to consent based on the brief interview, they will be allowed to continue because they initially expressed this desire on the enrollment consent form.  In this case, assent (the participant’s desire to continue to participate or not participate in the research) will 
always be obtained, as well as surrogate consent.   The surrogate would be sought in 
the following order of priority: participant’s research power of attorney/research advance directive, guardian or healthcare power of attorney, or next of kin.  Next of kin includes (in the following order): spouse, adult child, parent, adult sibling, grandparent, adult grandchild, or a close friend of the participant.  Participant’s assent will always operate as a veto to the participant’s participation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_593910]’s preference.

participant.  Participant’s assent will always operate as a veto to the participant’s participation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_593910]’s preference.     
7.1.2   Screening Evaluation 
Screening procedures will occur within 60 days prior to the Baseline assessment with [
18F]MK -
6240 PET imaging , and will include  collection demographic and other health related information 
(age, gender, ethnicity, race,),  cognitive testing (MMSE, CDR and ADAS -cog), review of 
medical history and medications,  tobacco use including smoking status (active or not), pack -
year,  duration  of smoking, consumption during the last 6 months (#pack per day) , physical and 
neurological examination.  All subjects will complete these clinical assessments to ensure the 
subject is medically stable to complete the study protocol.  In addition, [11C]PiB PET/CT imaging 
will be completed for all subjects and  serves as part of the screening process to confirm 
presence of amyloid deposition. Brain MRI (structural T1, T2) will be obtained at screening for 
eligibility evaluation and analysis of neurodegeneration.  
 
7.1.3  Physical and Neurological Examination  
A brief physical and neurological examination will include the exam ination of general 
appearance, neck (including thyroid), lungs, heart, lymph nodes, vascular and neurological.   
The physical exam at screening may be performed at the investigator’s discretion to ens ure 
the participant’s eligibility.  A recent physical exam from the referring physician may be used to ensure eligibility  throughout the course of the study .  
Information for all physical and neurological examinations will be included in the source documen tation. Significant findings that are present prior to injection of [
18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783643]'s source documents. Significant findings noted after injection of [
18F]MK -6240, which meet the definition of an adverse event will be recorded 
as an adverse event.  
Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted as needed with pre- menopausal women who are of 
child-bearing potential.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_783644] 26, 2021                                              Page 20 of 36 7.1.5  Height and weight  
Height and body weight (in indoor clothing) will be measured at the screening and main study 
visits. 
7.1.6  Clinical Scales  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) 
The MMSE is a sensitive, valid and reliable 30- point questionnaire that is used extensively in 
clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment .  It is commonly used as 
screening tool for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus,  
making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.  
Administration of the test takes between 5 –[ADDRESS_783645] MMSE form, which is 
currently published by [CONTACT_149749], is based on its original 1975 
conceptualization, with minor subsequent modifications by [CONTACT_89588].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)  
The CDR was developed at the Memory and Aging Project at Washington University School of 
Medicine in 1979 for the evaluation of staging severity of dementia. It was developed primarily 
for use in persons with dementia of the Alzheimer type (the equivalent of probable Alzheimer’s Disease) and it can also be used to stage dementia in other illnesses as well.  
The information from which the CDR score is derived consists of a standard set of information 
collected in a clinical instrument that uses other well -known scales for some of its foundation.  
The CDR Global Score will be used in this study as an eligibility criterion.  In assigning a Global 
CDR, the six domains that are used to construct the overall CDR table are each scored 
individually. The six domains are: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem -solving, 
Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care. In rating each of these domains, 
the assessment should be based on the subject’s cognitive ability to function in these areas. If 
they are limit ed in performing activities at home because of physical frailty, this should not 
affect their scoring on the CDR, which again should be rated on their cognitive ability alone. 
Each domain is rated on a 5- point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairm ent; 0.5, 
questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe 
impairment (personal care is scored on a 4- point scale without a 0.5 rating available).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -cog)  
The AD AS-Cog is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in clinical trials 
in AD. The ADAS -Cog is a more thorough battery than the Mini Mental State Exam, and 
primarily measures language and verbal epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]. The ADAS -Cog consists of 13 items 
and takes approximately 25 minutes to administer.  The ADAS was developed as a two- part 
scale: one that measured cognitive functions and one that measured non- cognitive functions 
Version 4, August 26, [ADDRESS_783646] current research, including this study, uses the ADAS -Cog, 
which is the sub- scale that measures cognitive ability.  
 
7.1.7  The MRI Protocol:   
If the participant otherwise meets all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, t he MRI will be 
performed.  This procedure includes a T1-weighted anatomic volume, and a T2weighted fluid 
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scan to determine whether the brain is normal.  These 
sequences do not take the place of a clinical MRI examination. If clinically  significant 
abnormalities are found, the participant is excluded and referred for further clinical follow -up.  
 The MRI exams will be performed using a 3T MRI scanner at the Waisman Center or WIMR using the standardized ADRC MRI. Alternatively,  a UW Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593911].  The scan duration is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_783647] exploratory comparisons . Sequences  may include: 
 
T1w Bra in Volume:  This sequence that provides high- resolution isotropic 1 mm voxels for 
volume and region quantification.  This sequence is required and used for quantifying the PET 
images.  
T2 Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR):  This is a 3D volume acquis ition and is 
sensitive to ische mic disease and other pathology . This scan will be used to quantify white 
matter hyper -intensity lesion burden.  
Other non- required MRI sequences .  Additional sequences from the ADRC/WRAP standard 
protocol may be used to maintain continuity with prior and future MRIs with the program . These 
are performed when time schedule and tolerability permit and will be used to conduct 
exploratory analyses.  
T2-weighted volume and susceptibility weighted scans : These ar e product sequences and 
are used for tissue segementation and for radiology reads respectively.  
Quantitative T1 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_593912]  [experimental] : This is a locally developed 
anatomical sequence for detailed T1- mappi[INVESTIGATOR_593913]. This is a non -standard 
sequence conducted in Research mode.  
Diffusion Imaging [experimental]  A diffusion- weighted may be performed used for whole brain 
advanced DTI studies. Diffusion encoding will be performed using multiple shells and multiple 
direct ions requisite for NODDI and advanced DTI modeling of white matter tracts.   
Pseudo- continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL)  [experimental]  provides a perfusion 
weighted scan used to assess flow and aspects of neurovascular  function.  
Version 4, August 26, 2021                                              Page 22 of 36 4D flow  [experimental] : We will use a novel high -resolution flow -sensitive MRI approach to 
quantify macroscopic CBF in all extracranial and intracranial arteries in a single acquisition. 
The method developed at UW uses radial undersampling and significantly reduces otherwise 
prohibitively long scan times for a vascular examination uses no exogenous contrast agent. 
The method allows for coverage of the entire brain, providing high spatial resolution (0.6 mm isotropic) and flow dynamics within a 7- minute exam. This is a non -standard sequence 
conducted in Research mode.  
The scans above that are labeled as experimental are being conducted as a research tool. S
afety and efficacy of the scans themselves a re not being evaluated.  Similarly, when MRI is 
acquired on the MRI750 model at Waisman or at WIMR , a [ADDRESS_783648] and thus experimental. The study is not evaluating the safety or 
efficacy of the head coi l.  
Quality review:  MRI and PET scans will be checked immediately after acquisition for technical 
quality (motion and other artifact) of the T1- weighted sequence and if needed this may be 
rescanned either during the same MRI session or at a rescheduled session . Images are 
uploaded to the Wisconsin ADRC imaging lab immediately after the session and the post -
processing procedures are implemented including an additional quality check by [CONTACT_3476].  
7.1.8  Radiology Review of MRI:  
All MR images receive radiological review from the MRI Service of our ADRC (Neuroradiologist Howard Rowley  or a similarly qualified neuroradiologist) within [ADDRESS_783649] been previously detected; any significant findings are referred  
for clinical follow -up. 
7.1.9  PiB at Screening :   
[
11C]PiB is synthesized using our standard methods.  N -methylation of the 6- OH-BTA-0 
precursor (ABX, Inc.) is accomplished using [C -11]methyl triflate produced via an automated 
chemistry module and subsequently purified using HPLC.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_593914] [C -11]PiB 
product are in excess of 2 GBq, with specific activities of 150 – 600 GBq/umol.   
 
PiB PET /CT Scanning: Participants are positioned head first, supi[INVESTIGATOR_593915]- plane field of view. A CT  scan is acquired for attenuation correction. A 70 
minute dynamic [C -11]PiB PET acquisition is then initiated with the injection of a 15 mCi target 
dose of [C -11]PiB bolus, injected over 30 s. For participants who may not be able to tolerate 
this long scan, a 20  minute scan will be offered after 5 0 minutes of uptake. Dynamic acquisition 
frames included 5 x 2 min and 12 x 5 min for a total of 17 time frames.  The PET data are reconstructed using a filtered back -projection algorithm (DIFT) with sinogram trimming to a 
voxel size of 2.57mm x 2.57mm x 2.43mm and matrix dimension of [ADDRESS_783650] motion during the course of the study and a denoising algorithm is applied to the voxel -based time series ( Christian, Vandehey, Floberg, & 
Version 4, August 26, 2021                                              Page 23 of 36 Mistretta, 2010 ; Floberg et al., 2012) . The PET time -series is coregistered into the space 
defined by [CONTACT_941] T1 -weighted MRI scan based upon coregistration with the time- integrated (i.e. 
sum image) [C -11]PET scan using mutual information.  
 
PiB Distribution volume Ratio Maps: The data are transformed into voxel -wise parametric 
images representing [C -11]PiB binding using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region of 
negligible binding ( Price et al., 2005). The cerebellar time- activity curve is extracted from the 
PET data using a cerebellar gray matter (GM) mask image derived from the coregistered T1-
weighted MRI using FreeSurfer software.  Voxel -based parametric images using Logan 
graphical analysis are created as described previously (Lopresti et al., 2005) .  For the Logan 
graphical method ( Logan et al., 1996) , linear regression was applied to the transformed data 
using the 35- to 70- min (7 points) interval and a mean efflux constant of 0.149 min-1. Using 
SPM12, the DVRs are also spatially normalized to the International Consortium for Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 152 atlas (ICBM 152, i.e. MNI space) and smoothed with an [ADDRESS_783651] component of the PET/CT scan may be repeated up to one time per study timepoint.  The CT attenuation correction scan may be repeated if the scan fails for some reason, or if the participant must get off of the scanner bed.  
 
7.1.10  [
18F]MK -6240  
Descriptive name: 6- Fluoro-3- (1H-pyrrolo[2,3- c]pyridin -1-yl)isoquinolin -5-amine.  
 
The synthesis and PET /CT scanning with MK6240 will be done consistent with the Investigators 
Brochure and the IND . F-18 is created with the GE PETrace cyclotron at WIMR.  Radiolabeling 
is performed using automated research chemistry synthesis units for C -11 methylation 
(Scansys), F- 18 nucleophilic substitution ( ELIXSYS, Synthera, Scansys, CTI CPCU). Analytic 
equipment includes  HPLC, GC, TLC and Endosafe- PTS for performing radiopharmaceutical 
quality assurance. For this project, a dedicated HPLC system will be committed to the synthesis 
of [F-18]MK6240. 
 
A 5 mCi dose ± 20% of MK6240 bolus is injected  over 30 second infusion  at Bas eline, 6, 12, 
and 24 months . If the 6, 12, or 24 month visit is missing, this may also occur at 18 and/or [ADDRESS_783652] -injection.   Repeat of up to tw o [18F]MK -6240 PET imaging scans  over the 
course of the study  may be completed  if needed, if the patient remains under the annual 
radiation allowance.  Repeat scans will be prioritized for the Baseline and 12 month visits.  
Scans will be repeated only one time per study timepoint (e.g. the baseline scan would only be repeated up to one time).  Scans may be repeated if the participant moves during the scan 
such that the images aren’t useable for analysis, or if the participant  can’t tolerate the full 
imaging session such that the required imaging frames aren’t acquired.  SUVR images will be 
generated using the inferior cerebellum as the reference region of nondisplaceable uptake.  
Version 4, August 26, [ADDRESS_783653] component of the PET/CT scan may be repeated up to one time per study timepoint.  The CT attenuation correction scan may  be repeated if the scan fails for some reason, or if the 
participant must get off of the scanner bed.  
 
7.1.11  Data obtained from referral source s:   
This study recruits from the  Wisconsin ADRC , WRAP  and local UW  memory clinics , and 
relevant information pertinent to subject selection and screening will be obtained regarding cogniti ve diagnosis and medical history .  
 
Data collection from source study and clinical referral source  
This study recruits from WRAP and Wisconsin ADRC and local UW memory clinics, and 
relevant information from those sources may be used to determine eligibility. Information to be collected includes the following:  
Diagnosis : From the memory clinics this would include physician summary reports  with 
diagnostic information.  From the ADRC and WRAP this would include diagnostic consensus conference summaries  and reports .  Primary diagnoses (such as MCI or dementia due to AD) 
and any relevant secondary diagnoses (such as vascular disease) would be captured. Rationale: Diagnosis is a main groupi[INVESTIGATOR_164572].  
Medical history  will be accessed as part of the subject selection and screening process. For 
the clinic this may include the memory clinic physician summaries/notes and for the ADRC/WRAP would include clinician and self -reported medical history survey results.  The 
rationale is to identify people who are eligible.  
Prior imaging: Although w e will collect an MRI under this protocol, results /reports  from prior 
MRIs conducted for WRAP or ADRC in the past 24 months  may be used to guage eligibilty . 
Rationale: To avoid screening someone whose may be ineligible based on the existing MRI.  
Genetics :  APOE genetic status will be collected from the ADRC and WRAP source cohort s 
rather than repeating it .  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_783654] Withdrawal  
Subjects who discontinue prior to completing the 12- month or 18 month [
18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783655]  15 MCI/AD  subjects 
complete the [ADDRESS_783656] a final 
evaluation (including all the original assessmen ts and imaging) any time between [ADDRESS_783657]’s premature withdrawal from the study and document this information. In 
addition, the study team will as k the subject to return for an Early Terminations Visit for a final 
evaluation.  
Subjects may develop adverse events or abnormalities in vital signs, physical or neurological examination, or laboratory determinations during their participation in the study. If these occur, the investigator may discontinue a subject from the study if, in his/her clinical judgment, continued participation would result in undue risk or further worsening of the condition.  
For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e. those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator will show due diligence by [CONTACT_593930], e.g. dates of telephone calls, 
registered letters, or other attempts to communicate.

7.3 Data Sharing:  
 
Banked images and their meta- data from this study will be managed by [CONTACT_593931]. Images from ADRC 
participants may be uploaded to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center or other NIH -
specified repository. The images from applicable subjects  will also be shared back with the 
source protocols and with the ADRC UP protocol (2013- 0178) to address the major specific 
aims of the UP project. Once the data are shared with repositories and with the source protocols, the data may be used to address future unspecified research by [CONTACT_593932]. Other investigators who wish to use these data may apply via established resource request mechanisms to the ADRC and WRAP, and the respective executive committees will evaluate the merit of the request and decide how these and other ADRC or WRAP data are shared. Investigators from within the ADRC and WRAP, other departments within UW, institutions outside UW, and private companies may submit applications requesting the data. Only coded data are shared with researchers that are not listed as key personnel on the projects. [CONTACT_94795] holds ultimate responsibility for data sharing oversight, and will review all requests. He will ensure that local IRB policies are followed prior to releasing data.

AFETY CONSIDERATIONS   
8.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE)  is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, 
having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen.  Adverse events 
will be recorded regardless of their relationship to the study.  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly.  
Serious adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_63405] , FDA, and  IRB within 
the required timeframes  after learning of the event.  
8.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Monitoring  
Given that this longitudinal study involves procedures that will occur at 6- 12 month intervals 
and does not include chronic treatment with an investigational agent, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will only be captured during the study visit before and after PiB and MK6240 scans.  The participant will receive a phone call within 4 days from the study 
team for the purpose of ascertaining their wellbeing  and information on any adverse events  
that occur within 24 hours after the scan. If any adverse events are discovered, a clinician will 
continue to follow up with the participant until resolved.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_593916] , FDA  and sponsor  per the relevant regulations.  Although no study related 
adverse events are expected (based on our past experience), we will examine AEs for study 
related trends.  If needed, we would modify the consent form after consult ing with the IRB.   
Version 4, August 26, 2021                                              Page 28 of 36 8.3 Follow -up for Adverse Events  
The investigator is obliged to follow subjects with AE’s until the events have subsided, the 
conditions are considered medically stable, or the participants are no longer available for follow up. Subjects who discontinue due to adverse events will be treated and followed according to 
established medical practice.  
8.4 Risk benefit discussion  for pertinent study procedures  
MRI – There are no known biologic risks associated with MRI scanning.  Participants will be 
screened by [CONTACT_593935].  Subjects with the following should not participate in MRI studies: metallic implants, such 
as prostheses, shrapnel, or aneurysm clips, or persons with electronic implants, such as cardiac pacemakers. The magnetic field generated by [CONTACT_593936] e a 
displacement or malfunctioning of these devices. Potential side effects of the scan include headache or anxiety due to claustrophobia and/or noise, and risk of injury due to other 
unapproved metal being brought into the scanner room.  To minimize the level of noise, all subjects will be fitted with disposable earplugs.  Communication with the participant is still possible during the scan.  In addition, fatigue and physical discomfort due to the length of the scan session are possible.  An abbreviated sc an sessions consisting of the T1- weighted scan 
and FLAIR scan is sufficient for fulfilling the MRI component of this protocol .  
 
PET/CT Imaging ( [F-18]MK6240 and [C-11]PiB radiotracers) – PET/CT imaging involves 
exposure to small amounts of ionizing radiation, which has no known or expected harmful effects. No serious adverse effects  or concerning trends  attributable to the 
radiopharmaceuticals used in this study have been reported.  However, the possibility exists 
for a rare reaction to any of the substances or procedures to which the subject is exposed.  Based on data from [ADDRESS_783660] commonly occurring adverse events possibly related to injection of MK6240 include headache (occurred in 10 out of 6378 participants, or 0.16%) and dizziness (occurred in 2 out of 6378 participants, or 0.03%).  The following occurred in only one participant out of 6378, or 0.02%: abdominal distention (bloating or swelling in the belly area), injection site bruising, arthralgia (joint pain), dysgeusia (altered sense of taste), parosmia (altered sense of smell), insomnia (difficulty falling asleep), and dysuria (discomfort when urinating).  All reported adverse events were considered mild in  
intensity, and resolved shortly after the scan.  A PET/CT scanner will be used and a low dose CT transmission scan is acquired for attenuation correction (0.4mSv).  The whole body 
radiation dose of 26.9mSv received by [CONTACT_593937]/CT [F-18]MK6240 ( 5.9mSv  for 
each of 4 visits is 2 3.6mSv) and [C -11]PiB (3.3mSv)  scans will be below the guidelines 
established in 21CFR §361.1 for whole body (Annual Limit - 50mSv), active blood forming 
organs, lens of eye and gonads (5 rad) and target organ (15 rad).  Specifics regarding the effective human radiation dos imetry for a subject undergoing [F -18]MK6240 and PiB are 
provided in the Investigators Brochure  for each ligand.  
Repeat of up to two [
18F]MK -6240 PET imaging scans  over the course of the study  may be 
completed if needed, if the patient remains under the annual radiation allowance.  Each 
additional [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783661] 26, 2021                                              Page 29 of 36 repeated only one time per study timepoint (e.g. the baseline scan would only be repeated up 
to one time).  The CT component of the PET/CT scan may be repeated up to one time per study timepoint (0.4mSv per additional CT scan).

9.1 Study Monitoring  
9.1.1  Internal Audit and Data Safety Monitoring:   
The Study Monitoring Plan describes the strategy, responsibilities, and quality management activities in place to ensure adequate protection of the rights, welfare, and safety of human subjects and the quality and integrity of the resulting data, in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and guidance.    This observational cohort study does not require an external DSMC. T he
  radioligands are 
delivered in tracer quantities that have no known pharmacological effect.  However, as 
described in the Study Monitoring Plan, the investigator and clinical team will review the AE 
logs and any Study Monitoring findings to determine if there are trends or  side effects that are 
study related that may warrant changes to the protocol and/or consent form.

9.3 Data management tools  
9.3.1  CoRRIE  – CRM database  
Directly identifiable information and indirectly identifiable information (identified by [CONTACT_554772]) will be stored in CoRRIE .  
 CoRRIE  is a contact [CONTACT_593938], correspondence 
and scheduling. It is used by [CONTACT_593939]- linked  studies . It is a web -based, electronic database 
that is password- protected.  
In addition to storing the names of those who enroll in this study, the CoRRIE  database will 
also help the staff to manage their contacts with participants. The database allows for the storage of participants’ relationship to our program by [CONTACT_593940]. The database also allows us to track and 
assign activities that take place during the course of research (phone calls, letters, screenings).  
Version 4, August 26, [ADDRESS_783664] “RMRaic00” 
added to it to create a unique participant identifier that will rem ain with the participant from 
study to study. This number will be used to label brain images collected in affiliated ADRC protocols. This will allow physicians who are reviewing the brain scans to look for brain changes over time.  
9.3.2  PANDA and PACS  
Image data management tool:  Image data are electronically transferred and stored on servers 
at the ADRC imaging core (PI [CONTACT_78919]. Johnson) and metadata inserted into an imaging database called PANDA. Image headers by [CONTACT_593941]. A dditionally,  
each image is automatically inspected,  and any PHI removed. These resources are maintained 
by [CONTACT_497566].  Some derived numeric image data, cognitive and questionnaire data may be maintained in PANDA. User access is protocol sp ecific such that 
only users authorized to see this study’s data will have access.  
MRI images labeled with only study IDs as identifiers are also uploaded to the Dept of Radiology PACS directly from the scanner for radiology over -reads.  
9.3.3  BOOKED:   
Directly  identifiable information and indirectly identifiable information (identified by [CONTACT_356161]) will be stored in Booked. A participant scheduling web application, Booked, has been 
developed by [CONTACT_593942] (PHP) free, open source project. The Booked application can prevent double booking of staff and resources, provides email notification to staff when they are added to appointments, provides email notification if an appointment has been 
cancelled, and email reminders before an appointment starts. Staff can be linked to multiple roles in appointments. The calendar view can be filtered by [CONTACT_593943], staff and study participant. The appointments are color coded by [CONTACT_593944]. Booked 
reports can track cancelled appointments, cancellation reason, appointment types, resource usage, staff hour totals, and staff appointment counts.  Booked is limited to https ssl connections. Only users granted protocol specific permissions can login to Booked and view study participant information. It is also important to note that the Booked software is installed on the DOM production server in the DOM server room; therefore,  all Booked data will be on 
the DOM server. Access to Booked via the web is limited to UW Networks. Booked is a free, open source project; therefore,  there are no connections or relationships with the Booked 
software manufacturer. Participant Name, phone number and ADRC Registry ID ( 2016- 0735) 
are identifiers used in Booked. Booked is an appointment scheduling application, so the 
Version 4, August 26, [ADDRESS_783665] Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized according to the clinical 
group (HV, MCI , mild or moderate AD) using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and 
using frequency count and percentage for discrete variables.   
10.2 Image Analysis  
The MRI and [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783666] (ROI) for analysis of regional [18F]MK -6240 binding/uptake. The [18F]MK -
[ADDRESS_783667] ( ROI) 
templates to assess tracer uptake and quantification.  Standard uptake values (SUV) and 
Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) will be calculated for the areas and will serve as 
the primary imaging outcome measure.   
10.3 Statistical Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the tau deposition (e.g. composite and regional 
SUVR, voxel based statistics or change in tau distribution) using [18F]MK -6240 PET.  
The Baseline [18F]MK -[ADDRESS_783668] s at different stages 
of the disease, and HV groups descriptively, quantitatively and visually by [CONTACT_593945]. 
[18F]MK -6240  binding in AD at different stages of the disease, and HV binding across multiple 
regions will be compared.  Within the AD groups, the distribution and binding of [11C]PiB will be 
compared to the [18F]MK -6240 binding across multiple regions.  
The primary objective of this imaging trial is to evaluate the longitudinal change in [18F]MK -
6240. Composite and regional SUVRs will be determined for each of the [18F]MK -6240 imaging  
sessions (Baseline, 6- month, 12- month, and 24- month).   This may also include 78 (18 month) 
and/or 130 (30 month) week  measures, if the 26, 52, or [ADDRESS_783669]: inferolateral temporal cortex, posterior 
cingulate, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067], mesial temporal cortex and anterior 
cingulate. To help control type 1, a composite inferomedial region will be used as the primary 
outcome . Change in tau regional deposition and/or volume of deposition as measured by 
[18F]MK -6240 (e.g. composite and regional SUVR, voxel based statistics or change in tau 
distribution) will b e determined by [CONTACT_593946] -up visit 
using an appropriate repeated measures metric. The change in tau burden will be compared among the groups (HV, prodromal, mild and moderate AD).   
The relationship between the change in tau deposition by [
18F]MK -6240 (e.g. composite and 
regional SUVR, voxel based statistics or change in tau distribution) and change in clinical

tool that has received IRB approval for use in other ADRC and WRAP linked protocols. Data 
and images are electronically transferred to PANDA, which is maintained by [CONTACT_593950]. The PANDA is a Ruby [CONTACT_593951] a MySQL backend database, 
which provides secure web interfaces to a repository of MRI, PET and project -specific 
variables including neuropsychology, lab results, questionnaires, and participant properties. 
Security of the database uses best practice guidelines. Viewing and editing data are 
separately granted permissions and are access -controlled at the project level. Editing of data 
will be locked to all but the DBA. In all cases this also requires a user to be listed on the IRB -
approved protocol (via ARROW study team list). For security, all login and query downloads 
are logged and traceable by [CONTACT_593952]. Further, any logged query, including table fields 
and selection criteria, may be reconstructed at a later date for auditing if needed. The DBA 
has an interface to view the queries by [CONTACT_45907]/time. As imaging data cannot be uploaded, it is 
the image metadata that are uploaded into the SQL database; the images themselves are 
stored on a secure DOM server in the imaging core. Data are transferred to database users 
using https downloads of queries  in CSV text files that can subsequently be imported into 
statistical analysis software.

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Indication  
Chronic Plaque -type Psoriasis  
Study Rationale  
Chronic p laque -type psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that manifests as a chronic 
inflammatory skin disease.  The features of the underlying inflammation are erythema of the skin 
with associated induration, scaling , and plaque formation, often in the exten sor surfaces.  It 
affects 1–3% of the world’s population and can result in significant morbidity and diminished 
quality of life of individuals with the disease.[1] 
Pathologic  chronica lly activated T lymphocytes are crucial in the development of chronic 
plaque -type psoriasis.[2], [3]  These abnormal lymphocytes cause chronic inflammation and the 
resultant clinical manifestati ons of the disease.  There is increasing evidence that these 
chronically activated lymphocytes traffic to skin from highly immune -rich areas of the body – 
“immune hubs” – like the intestines.[4], [5]  This is further supported by [CONTACT_166673]  [6], [7], [8] and the detection of 
upregulated gut-tropic CCR9+ immune cells in inflamed end organs.[9] 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -enteric coated (EC)  is an allosteric modulator of F1F0 adenosine  triphosphat e 
synthase enzyme  (F1F0-ATPase ) that acts on chronically activated lymphocytes locally in the 
lumen of the gut due to limited systemic absorption.  The mechanism of LYC -[ADDRESS_193374] chronically activated lymphocytes versus normal lymphocytes because of 
the metabolic differences between the  cells.  LYC -[ZIP_CODE] has demonstrated efficacy in animal 
models of psoriasis  and other models of systemic inflammation like collagen -induced arthritis 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_166649].  It has also been studied in healthy subjects  up to a 300 mg 
daily dose  and 200  mg daily dose over 7  days with very low systemic absorption and a  very low 
incidence of adverse events  (AEs) .   
With the low systemic exposure of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC, the good tolerability demonstrated in 
healthy subjects , the growing scientific support that chronically activated lymphocytes traffic 
from immune -rich areas of the body to chronically inflamed tissue , and the efficacy of gut-
directed F 1F0-ATPase modulators  demonstrated in systemic autoimmune models ( psoriasis  and 
collagen -induced arthritis) despi[INVESTIGATOR_166650] , it is proposed that LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Disease Background  
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder, manifesting in the skin, joints, or both.[10]  The disease is 
characterized by [CONTACT_166674], raised 
plaques, usually on the extensor surfaces of the body.  Psoriasis provides many challenges 
including high prevalence, chronicity, disfi guration, disability, and associated comorbidities

(such as arthritis, depression, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular diseases ).[10], [11], 
[12]   
The prevalence of psoriasis in the US was estimated to be 7.4  million in 2013.  The estimated 
total financial burden of psoriasis was estim ated as 35.2  billion dollars.[13]   
The current  treatment options for psoriasis  are determined by [CONTACT_166675].  For 
patients with severe disease that affects a large percentage of BSA , there has been robust efficacy 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_166676]-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α , anti -interleukin ( IL) 12/23 and anti -IL-17.[14]  Patients with 
moderate plaque psoriasis are either treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450] (eg, co rticosteroids, retinoids, 
vitamin D analogs), for minimal BSA  involvement, ultraviolet  (UV)  light (with or without 
psoralen) , or oral drugs  that aim to reduce inflammation through systemic effects on the immune 
system (eg, methotrexate and apremilast).   These treatments are limited in demonstrating robust 
efficacy or have safety issues through local effects on the skin or systemic effects on the immune 
system.  The current study  with LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -enteric coated ( EC) aims  to assess the efficacy and 
safety of an  agent that works locally in the gut with limited systemic exposure to address this 
continued unmet medical need.   
2.[ADDRESS_193380] Background  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC is an orally administered small molecule  modulator of the mitochondrial F 1F0-
ATPase, being developed for th e treatment of inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis  
(UC)  and chronic plaque -type psoriasis .  It is formulated with an enteric coating that allows for 
drug delivery beyond the stomach at a pH of 5.8 – 6.8.  The properties of the study drug are s uch 
that systemic absorption is low as demonstrated in a healthy volunteer trial where LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -
EC was administered up to a 300 mg single dose and 200 mg daily dose over one week .  In the 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial in which 200 mg capsules were d osed once daily for one 
week, the maximum concentration ( Cmax) seen was 21.4 ng/mL (mean 10.3 ng/mL) and the 
maximum area under the curve ( AUC ) seen was 30 6 ng·h/mL (mean 17 3 ng·h/mL ).

Based on its mechanism of action  and distribution profile , LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC is anticipated to 
demonstrate clinical efficacy free from generalized immune suppression in subjects with chronic 
plaque -type psorias is.  
2.3 Nonclinical Studies  
2.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] is an orally administered small molecule that functions as an allosteric modulator of 
the mitochondrial ATP ase, also known as the F 1F0-ATPase.  Compounds that modulate F 1F0-
ATPase activity increas e superoxide formation and mediate apoptosis of susceptible cells via a 
well-characterized apoptotic signaling cascade.  Consistent with this mechanism of action, LYC -
[ZIP_CODE] slows the rate of ATP production in sub -mitochondrial particles, increases reactive  
oxygen species (ROS) generation, and induces apoptosis of a lymphocyte cell line.    
Recent literature on autoimmune disease pathogenesis proposes that chronically activated 
lymphocytes traffic through immune -rich hubs, such as the gut, prior to infiltrati ng distal 
inflamed tissues like the skin. Because LYC -[ADDRESS_193383] significantly 
higher exposure in the gut then in plasma, this may allow local targeting of pathogenic cells in 
the gut . In support of this hypothesis,  LYC -[ZIP_CODE] and oth er ATPase modulator compounds are 
efficacious in rodent models of systemic autoimmune disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_166651] .  For instance , efficacy was demonstrated by [CONTACT_166677] -[ZIP_CODE] in a collagen induce d 
arthritis model at  an average concentration (C ave) of 0.9 ng/mL ( 2nM ) and an area under the 
plasma (concentration -time) curve from time 0 to 24  hours (AUC 0-24h) of 22 ng·h/mL  which is 
below the effective concentration to achieve 50% of the maximal response ( EC 50) based on 
biochemical (27 nM) and cellular  assays (59 nM) .  Another ATPase modulator in the chemical 
series , LYC -[ZIP_CODE] , demonstrated efficacy in the imiquimod -induced ear swelling rodent model.  
It demonstrated this efficacy at 30  mg/kg which is comparable to exposures above as LYC -
[ZIP_CODE] is approx imately 100-fold less potent than LYC -[ZIP_CODE].   LYC -[ZIP_CODE] was selected for 
advancement based on its in vitro  potency, in vivo  immunomodulatory activity, and a 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile characterized by [CONTACT_166678].   
In rodent inflammatory bowel disease efficacy  studies, LYC -[ADDRESS_193384], colonic drug lev els exceeded the 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC 50) values in enzymatic and cellular assays.  These data suggest that efficacy 
was largely driven by [CONTACT_166679] .  It is in the gut where it is

hypothesized that chronically acti vated lymphocytes traffic  prior to infiltrating distal inflamed 
areas like the skin . 
2.3.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] has low aqueous solubility and exhibits moderate apparent permeability in a Caco -2 
cell model.  Following administration of single o ral doses of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] as an emulsion in a 
lipid-based formulation, bioavailability is low to moderate in monkeys, mice, and rats (10 –38%).    
When administered as a powder blend in an EC capsule (the intended clinical formulation) to 
monkeys, the AUC 0-24 of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC is approximately 10% of that achieved using a lipid -
based formulation.  In mouse, rat, and monkey, LYC -[ZIP_CODE] exhibits low to moderate plasma 
clearance, low to moderate volume of distribution, and a long terminal elimination half -life.  
Plasma protein binding is moderate in all species (13 -18% free).    
LYC -[ADDRESS_193386] 
(LYC -[ZIP_CODE]) was observed that appears to be formed non -enzymatically.  Conversion of 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] to LYC -[ZIP_CODE] also was observed in simulated gastric fluid, consistent with the 
compound’s known instability in the presence of acid.  LYC -[ADDRESS_193387] 
inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) but may be a weak time -dependent 
inhibitor of CYP 2D6.  LYC -[ZIP_CODE] is unlikely to be associated with significant drug -drug 
interactions.    
2.3.3 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] is not genotoxic and does not produce adverse central nervous system (CNS), 
pulmonary or cardiova scular effects in single dose safety pharmacology studies. In rats and 
monkeys dosed for up to 28 days with LYC -[ZIP_CODE], there was no evidence of generalized 
immunosuppression.  
In the rat 28-day good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology study, an AUC of  ≥ 5800  ng·h/mL  
was associated with sporadic instances of mortality .  The NOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day with plasma 
AUC values of 1690 ng∙h/mL in male rats and 1040 ng∙h/mL in female rats. In the rat 91 -day 
GLP toxicology study, the no observed adverse event level ( NOAEL ) was 10 mg/kg with a 
plasma AUC of 7750 ng∙h/mL (combined sex mean). Since mortality was observed in previous 
studies at a lower AUC, the rat NOAEL across all studies was considered to be the mid dose in 
the 91 -day of 3 mg/kg with a C max of 257 ng/mL and an AUC of 3060 ng∙h/mL.  
 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  
Clinical Protocol LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -2003  
Issue Date: [ADDRESS_193388] calorimetry, at doses ≥ 7 mg/k g, LYC -[ZIP_CODE] produced dose -related increases in oxygen 
consumption and body temperature consistent with mitochondrial uncoupling. At a tolerated 
dose, measurable and reversible increases were observed for both parameters.  
In the 28 -day GLP monkey toxicolog y study, an exposure of 6340 ng∙h/mL in the male high dose 
group (30 mg/kg) was associated with dose -limiting emesis and diarrhea leading to euthanasia of 
the group following 16 -18 days of dosing. In surviving animals, complete recovery from these 
clinical  signs occurred following a reversal period of 28 to 38 days. The NOAEL in the 28 -day 
monkey study was 10 mg/kg/day associated with an AUC of 4820 ng∙h/mL (combined sex 
mean). In the 91 -day GLP toxicology study, the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg with an AUC of 2580 
ng∙h/mL.  
2.4 Previous Human Experience  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC has been studied in two Phase 1 studies.  
The Phase 1a study was comprised of a single ascending dose  (SAD ), MAD , and food effect 
(FE) component. A total of 57  healthy male subjects were randomized in the study, 34  subjects 
in the SAD component , 16 subjects in the MAD component , and 7  subjects in the FE component. 
A total of 40 subjects received LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment.  
A total of 52  treatment emergent adver se events (TEAEs) were reported .  All TEAEs were of 
mild severity.  There were no deaths or SAEs reported and no discontinuations due to AEs in any 
components of the study .  A total of 6  TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_166680].  All of these TEAEs were reported in the SAD  component of the study, of 
which 5  TEAEs were reported by 3  placebo subjects and 1  TEAE (flatulence) by a subject 
receiving a single dose of [ADDRESS_193389] to clinical laboratory, vital s igns 
(including body temperature), ECGs, continuous cardiac monitoring, PE, respi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and 
tissue or pulse oximetry.  
In the SAD component of the study, the C max reached a plateau of 3 to 4 ng/mL at the 75 mg 
dose cohort ([ADDRESS_193390] sensitive species) and the AUC began 
to plateau at the 150 mg dose. In the MAD component of the trial, the mean C max and AUC 
values were 10.3 ng/mL and 173 ng∙h/mL on Day 7 following oral administration of 200 mg. 
The extent of accumulation foll owing multiple dosing was 3 - to 4-fold.

The Phase 1b study was an open -label, SAD study to evaluate the PK profile, safety and 
tolerability in subjects with UC. A total of 6 subjects rec eived LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment at either 
25 mg (3 subjects) or 100 mg (3 subjects). No AEs were reported for the study.  
Overall, oral administration of LYC -[ADDRESS_193392].  The increased exposures were not associated with any safety findings.  
Additional information can be found in  the current LYC -[ZIP_CODE] Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and 
in Addendum #1.  
2.5 Dose Selection Rationale  
The proposed dose to be studied in this Phase  2a study  is 25  mg once daily (q.d.) oral dose.  The 
rationale for this is based on the exposures required to demo nstrate efficacy in models of 
autoimmune disease , and the safety margins for the both the fasted and fed states.  
From the SAD  study, a dose of 25  mg was associated with a C max of 1.7  ng/mL and an AUC 0-72 
of 31.5 ng·h/mL.  Projection of steady -state exposur e was based on the average accumulation 
observed following doses of 100 or 200  mg and using linear regression in relation to other doses 
studied.  Using these methods, the steady -state C max and AUC following daily doses of 25  mg are 
projected to be approxi mately 2  ng/mL and 40  ng·h/mL , respectively .  Both the C max and AUC 
values exceed the exposures achieved in the collagen -induced arthritis  model  where C ave was 0.9 
ng/mL ( 2nM) and AUC was 22 ng·h/mL.  Exposures were comparable in an imiquimod -induced 
ear swelling model when those exposures are extrapolated for the [ADDRESS_193393] 13-fold higher than in plasma, which will ensure adequate exposures at the site of action: 
chronically activated lymphocytes trafficking in the gut.

4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Design Overview  
This is a phase  2a multi -center, randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
study designed to eval uate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment in  
subjects with chronic plaque -type psoriasis .  
After signing an informed consent, all eligible subjects will be followed for approximately 
16 weeks,  which includes up to 2 weeks  between  screening and Study D ay 1 (first dose of 
treatment), [ADDRESS_193399] phases of this study outlined below:  
Screening :  The screening visit will take place up to [ADDRESS_193400]’s first dose of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC (or matching placebo) .  Subjects  who meet all eligibility 
requirements  will return for the next phase of the study.  
Treatment Period :  Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to active 
treatme nt (LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25 mg q.d.) or matching placebo .  Subjects will receive their first 
dose of study drug at the investigational site after randomization has occurred.  Subjects will 
return to the investigational site at W eeks 2, 4, 8, and 12  for efficacy as sessments, safety 
monitoring, and study drug receipt  (at Weeks 2, 4, 8) .

Follow -Up:  There will be [ADDRESS_193402], and the sponsor will remain blinded to 
treatment until after the database lock.  
4.2 Number of Subjects and Sites  
A total of approximately 30 subjects will be randomized into the study and treated at 
approximately 6 sites (refer to Section  8.1 Sample Size Calculation) . 
4.[ADDRESS_193403] 3  numbers will 
identify the site number (e.g., 200, 201, 202) and the next 3  numbers will be assigned 
consecutively s tarting with “001” then “002.”  Subject  identification numbers will be captured on 
the CRFs and will serve as the primary method of identifying each subject on the CRFs and on 
the site’s source documents throughout the study.  Each site will prepare and maintain a “Master 
List” of each subject p articipating in the study.  
Each subject meeting entry criteria will be assigned a randomization number.  The treatment 
assignment for the subject will be linked to the randomization number.  Before enrollment 
begins, the randomization numbers list will be generated .  The subject identification number and 
randomization number will be assigned by [CONTACT_166681] (IRT) system.   
Rescreening of subjects who previously failed screening may be  allowed depending on the 
reason for the screen fa il and after consultation and approval by [CONTACT_12925].  Depending 
on the timing of the rescreening, the subject may need to repeat certain screening assessments to 
confirm eligibility into  the study  and this determination will be made through discuss ion with the 
Sponsor  on a case -by-case basis .

LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  
Clinical Protocol LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -2003  
Issue Date: [ADDRESS_193418] should not eat for approximately 1  hour (or more) after taking study drug .  
The exception to this is the Visit  2/randomization visit when the first d ose of study drug is 
administered in the clinic.   Subjects may have eaten their morning meal prior to coming for this 
visit.  They should note the time they ate their last meal prior to this clinic visit and study drug 
should not be administered until at l east 2  hours after that meal.   
 LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25  mg q.d.:  one 25 -mg capsule of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC, administer upon 
awaking in the morning after fasting overnight and do not eat within the next approximately 
1 hour after dosing    
 placebo q.d.:  one matching place bo capsule, administer upon awaking in the morning after 
fasting overnight and do not eat within the next approximately [ADDRESS_193419] access.    
5.3 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized  on the same day (Visit  2) and just prior to th e subject’s first dose of 
study drug.  The first dose of study drug will be taken while in the cl inic under medical 
supervision.  Randomized subjects will receive either LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  
5.4 Maintaining and Breaking the Blind  
The 2  capsules developed ( LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  EC 25  mg and placebo) are indistinguishable (identical 
in size, shape, color, appearance , and both are EC) and packaged identically.  
To minimize the potential for bias, treatment information will be kept confidential and will not 
be available for release to the investigator, site staff and Lycera until after database  lock at  the 
end of the study (V isit 7/Week 14).   
The study site will  be instructed on the method for breaking the treatment blind prior to study 
start (ie, the actual treatment received by [CONTACT_423]) .  The treatment blind is  to be broken only 
in emergency situ ations when medical/supportive care cannot be provided without determining if 
the subject  was treated with  the study drug .  In the event that the  treatment  blind needs to be 
broken prior to the completion of the study, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_166682] .  
The investigator will explain and document in writing why the blind was broken, how the blind 
was broken, and how the integrity of the remaining blinded subjects was maintained.

6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Visit Timing  
The sche dule of study procedures is below ( Table  1); however, a subject may be seen at any time 
for safety reasons.  Routine clinic visits outlined in the protocol should occur whenever possible 
at the same time of day throughout the stud y to decrease variation in assessments and 
procedures.   Prior to each clinic visit, subject activities should remain consistent with their 
normal routine (eg, meals, medications, caffeine ingestion).  Subjects should take prescribed and 
over-the-counter me dications at the same time of the day throughout the study.    
 The day the subject receives the first dose of study drug is defined as Study Day  1.  The 
timing of all study visits are based on Study Day  1.   
 Study visit timing and windows are as follows:    
 Screening (Visit  1) – approximately Study Day  -14 to Day  -1  
 Randomization/ treatment (Visit  2) – Study Day  1 
 Visit  3 (Week  2 – Study Day  15) – window  ± 2 days  
 Visit  4 (Week  4 – Study Day  29) – window  ± 2 days  
 Visit  5 (Week  8 – Study Day  57) – window  ± 3 days  
 Visit  6 (Week  12 – Study Day  85) – window  ± 3 days  
 Follow -up (Visit 7) (Week 1 4 - Study Day  99) – window ± [ADDRESS_193425] be documented on the CRF.

and nitr ites.  Microscopic urinalysis will be performed on samples with abnormal blood, leukocyte esterase, protein, and 
nitrate.   
h All subjects will have one blood sample collected at Week 8 (any time  post study drug dose ) to measure plasma LYC -
[ZIP_CODE] concentration.  
i AEs will be assessed after the informed consent is signed.  
j Photographs will be taken at randomization (pre -dosing) and at Week 12 in a subset of subjects .  
k Optional  skin biops y will be colle cted at Week 8 in a subset of approximately 6  consenting  subjects. Biopsy collection 
instructions will be included in a separate document. This tissue will be assayed  for concentration of  LYC -[ZIP_CODE] . 
l Note that conf irmation of moderate plaque -type psoriasis is determined at both Screening and Visit 2 (baseline, prior to 
first dose).

of the details of the study including its nature, risks, and procedures, and has signed and dated 
IRB/IEC -approved inform ed consent document ( ICD).  A subject who satisfies all eligibility 
criteria during the screening visit may proceed to the next visit.   
A laboratory test (eg, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 
platelets) or procedure that d oes not meet eligibility criteria can be repeated once at the 
discretion of the investigator in order to determine eligibility.  A subject who does not satisfy all 
entry requirements that can be assessed during the screening phase will require no further v isits 
and will be identified as a screen failure in the source documents and CRFs.   
Re-screening of subjects initially not meeting all selection criteria may be allowed once after 
consultation with the sponsor.     
6.3 Efficacy Assessments Performed  
6.3.1 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index  (PASI)  and Body Surface Area (BSA)  
The PASI[17], a widely used index to express the severity of chronic plaque -type psoriasis , will 
be assessed at the time point s indicated in the schedule of events ( Table  1).  The PASI is a 
quantitative rating score for measuring the severity of psoriatic lesions based on area coverage 
and plaque appearance.

Confidential and Proprietary   Page 36 of 63 
The index combines the assessment of severity of the lesions (erythema, induration /thickness , 
and desquamation /scaling ) and percentage of affected area into a single score ranging from 0 (no 
disease) to 72 (maximal disease).   
The index is calculated as follows  (also see Appendix A) :  
 The subject’s body is divided into 4  regions  (head, upper  extremities , trunk, and lower 
extremities ).  Each of these [ADDRESS_193433] scored by [CONTACT_166686] 4  scores are 
combined into the final PASI.   
 For each region , the percent of area of skin involved  (0 to 100 % BSA) , is estimated using 
the palm (in cluding fingers)  and %  BSA is totaled for the whole body.  Additionally the %  
BSA in each of the 4 body region s is transformed into a grade from 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%)  
for the PASI calculation .  
 Within each of the 4  body regions , the severity of chronic pla que-type psoriasis  is estimated  
by [CONTACT_166687] 3  clinical signs:  erythema (redness), induration (thickness), and 
desquamation (scaling).  Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very 
severe) . 
 The sum of all 3  severity parameter s for each region  of skin is then multiplied by [CONTACT_166688] a different factor for each region  (0.1 for head, 0.2 for 
upper extremities , 0.3 for trunk  and 0.4 for lower extremities ).   
The investigator will collect the co mponents necessary to calculate the PASI and these 
components will be entered into  the CRF where the PASI score will be calculated. To be eligible  
for study participation , the subject must have a PASI score of greater than 7 at both the screening 
visit and  the randomization visit, with total BSA involvement of 5 -15%, inclusive.    
The PASI scoring system is described further in Appendix A.  
6.3.2 Static Investigator’ s Global Assessment  (static IGA)  
The static IGA[15] is used to measure psoriasis severity in clinical trials. The static IGA used in 
this trial will be a 6-point scale and will be evaluated at the time points indicated in the schedule 
of events ( Table  1). The scoring is  based on resp onse to treatment measured by [CONTACT_166689], 
induration, and scale. The static IGA scoring and descriptors are as follows:

 circulatory system  
 abdominal examination  
 musculoskeletal  
 neurological examination (to record the presence of abnormalities in mental status, motor, 
and sensory function [includes reflexes ]) 
 any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evaluate sy mptoms or 
adverse experiences  
Every effort should be made to have the same examiner perform eac h PE for a given subject to 
minimize variability in the examinations.  Clinically significant changes from screening should 
be noted as AEs.   
6.4.2 Vital Sign s Measurements  
Vital signs measurements will be performed at the time points indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  1) and will consist of BP (systolic and diastolic), HR, RR, and temperature .  
Subjects should sit quietly with feet flat on the floor or be supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lying down) for at least 
5 minutes prior to measurements.   
 Subject  must remain seated  or lying down  for the entire measurement.  
 The use of automated devices for measuring BP and HR is acceptable .  If done manually, HR 
must  be measured in the brachial/radial artery as per site standard procedures .   
 Blood pressure determinations must be performed u sing calibrated and appropriately 
maintained equipment and the same equipment  should be used on the same subject  
throughout the study as much as possible.    
 The same size BP cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrat ed, will be used to measure 
BP each time.   
Subject ’s arm should be at the same height (at the level of the heart) during each BP 
measurement.   Clinically significant changes from baseline should be recorded as AEs.

recorded as AEs.  
6.4.4 Laboratory Assessments  
Labo ratory assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  1) and will be evaluated by a central laboratory . 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_166665] v alues outside the 
laboratory reference ranges.  All laboratory abnormalities considered to be clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_166666].  Confirmed, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should 
be further evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_166667] d as an AE.  
Chemistry Panel Sample  
The c hemistry panel includes:  glucose, calcium, sodium, albumin, total protein, potassium, 
bicarbonate, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) , creatinine , lactate,  lactate dehydrogenase

abnormal blood, leukocyte esterase, protein, and nitrate.   This test will be evaluated by [CONTACT_166690] .   
Childbearing Potential Evaluation and Pregnancy Tests  
Serum FSH in postmenopausal female subjects and a serum hCG (pregnancy test) in 
premenopausal females will be evaluated at the central lab  at screening .   
Urine pregnancy tests for female subjects of childbearing potential will be performed at the time 
points indicated in the schedule of as sessments ( Table  1). 
6.4.5 Body Temperature  monitoring  
Subjects’ body temperature will be measured at clinic visits  (Table  1).  Use the same type 
thermometer throughout the study (eg, oral, axillary, etc.)  
If the temperature reading is > 101°F (or 38.3°C), the subject is to be evaluated for a possible 
bacterial or viral infection.  This assessment is to be completed per the investigator’s best clinical 
judgment (eg, if there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a urinary tract infec tion, then the subject is to have a 
urinalysis performed; if the subject has signs and symptoms of a classic viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629], then the subject can be treated symptomatically without being evaluated).   
If there are no signs or sympt oms of infection, the study drug is to be withheld and the subject 
should be evaluated for other sources of increased temperature as medically indicated.  Study 
drug may be re -started if it has not been interrupted for more than [ADDRESS_193438]  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for the occurrence of AEs and for abnormal 
clinical laboratory values.

mitochondrial modulation  and those AEs which may indicate hepatotoxicity. I nvestigators 
should be particularly mindful of  these AEs , which include vomiting, abdominal pain, elevated 
lactate, and abnormal liver function tests indicative of possible hepatotoxicity (AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, ALP, LDH) . Guidance for monitoring for these AEs of special interest is outlined 
below:  
Vomiting or Abdominal Pain:  
If a subject exhibits repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_166668].  They should present to the clinic as soon as possible to be evaluated 
for potential source of the symptom  and liver function testing should be performed .  The study 
medical monito r should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If a source is not readily identified then study drug should 
be withheld and the subject should continue to be evaluated for the source and managed as 
medically indicated.  Study drug may be re -started if it has been interrupted for no more than [ADDRESS_193440] from the study.  
Monitoring Lactate and Liver Function : 
If a subject exhibits any of the following elevations, study drug should be withheld at least until 
evaluation of the subj ect:  
 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_193441]  
 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_193442] for more than 2 weeks  
 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_193443] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_193444]  
 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_193445] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinop hilia (> 5%)  
 ALP > 1.[ADDRESS_193446]  
 Lactate ≥ 3 mmol/L  
 LDH > [ADDRESS_193447] the stop taking

scheduled study visit) . As dehydration and heavy physical exertion can cause elevations (eg, of 
blood lactate levels), the clinical lab should be repeated with the subject instructed to ensure 
hydration and avoid heavy physical activity.  The study medical m onitor should be contact[CONTACT_166691] .  If the elevation is confirmed by [CONTACT_166692], study drug must continue to be withheld.  Close observation of

performed [ADDRESS_193449] is asymptomatic. The investigator should obtain a detailed history 
of symptoms, prior or concurrent diseases, concomitant drug use, alcohol use, recreational drug 
use, special diets, and exposure to environmental chemical agents. Evaluatio n should be 
performed to rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function as appropriate (eg, international normalized 
ratio, direct bilirubin). Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consults. If a source of the 
abnormal value is not readily identified the subject should continue to be evaluated for the source 
and managed as medi cally indicated.  Study drug may be re -started if study drug has been 
interrupted for no more than 3 days and  the source of the abnormal value (s) is determined, or if 
upon repeating the clinical lab the value returns to normal, and in the clinical judgemen t of the 
investigator and study medical monitor it is safe for the subject to continue study drug.   If study 
drug cannot be ruled out as the cause of the abnormal value then study drug should be 
permanently discontinued.  Additionally, if study drug is int errupted for more than 3 days, then 
study drug should be permanently discontinued.  
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S AFETY MONITORING  
7.1 Adverse Event Definition  
Defined by 21  Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 312.32(a) and consistent with International 
Council on Harmoniz ation  (ICH) E2A guidance, an AE means untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can 
be any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or diseas e 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  Examples of 
AEs include but are not limited to:   
 abnormal test findings

 clinically significant symptoms and signs  
 changes in PE findings  
 hypersensitivity  
 progression/wo rsening of underlying disease  
Events related to the underlying disease(s), which have not worsened in intensity (severity) or 
frequency since screening, are not AEs.   
7.2 Serious Adverse Events Definition  
Defined by 21CFR 312.32(a) and consistent with ICH E2A  guidance, an AE is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the investigator  or Sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:   
 death   
 life-threatening (ie , in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor , its occurrence places the 
subjec t at immediate risk of death.   It does NOT include an event, that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death .)   
 in-subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]    
 persistent or significant incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions    
 congenital anomaly/birth defect    
 other medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention t o prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above  (eg, an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in

LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  
Clinical Protocol LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -2003  
Issue Date: [ADDRESS_193452]  will be questioned about AEs.  For all enrolled/ randomized subjects, 
AEs should be recorded on CRFs from the time the subject has signed informed consent.  For 
subjects not randomized , only SAEs and AEs leading to screen failure will be collected on the 
CRFs from the time the subject has signed informed consent.   
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE , see Section  7.2 above .  If 
an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as 
appropriate.   
AEs should be reported using concise  medical terminology on the CRF s.  The diagnosis should 
be recorded on the CRF, rather than reco rding individual signs and symptoms.  For example, 
congestive heart failure should be recorded rather than low ejection fraction, pedal edema, rales 
and dyspnea. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are 
not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom not part of the 
diagnosis should be recorded separately, for example: congestive heart failure and conjunctivitis 
should recorded as separate AEs.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive procedu res should not be reported as AEs.  However, the 
medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the 
definition of an AE  and procedure would be the treatment and recorded a s “action taken” of the 
AE.   
For all AEs, th e investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring i mmediate notification to Lycera  or its designated representative.  For al l AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained to determine the causality of the AE.   
All AEs that occur from the time of informed consent , regardless of whether the particular event 
is expected and regardless of relatedness, will be recorded as an AE.   
7.4 Assessment of S everity  of Adverse Events  
The investigator or blinded physician will assess subjects at each visit for the occurrence of AEs.  
In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non -leading 
questions:  “How are  you feeling?”  All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_166693] a causal relationship to the study drug is 
suspected.

Severity of AEs will  be graded according to N ational Cancer Institute Common T erminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (N CI CTCAE ) v4.03.  
Adverse events that are not included in the NCI CTCAE lists will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE general guideline for grades as follows:  
Grade 1  Mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical o r diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate, minimal, local intervention, or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), eg, 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166669], using the telephone, managing 
money.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL, eg, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with 
subject ’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAE s, listed in Section  7.2.

made immediately, irrespec tive of the extent of available AE information.   
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded 
SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure in  utero (EIU) cases.   
The i nvestigato r should continue to report any significant follow -up information to Lycera or 
designee  up to the point of resolution.   
In the rare event that the i nvestigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an  SAE 
immediately (eg , if an outpatient study  subje ct initially s eeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24  hours after learning of it and the document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the SAE.    
The study sponsor medical monitor will perform final medical review of SAEs.  Full details of 
the SAE processing and review procedures will be documented in a safety management plan and 
medical monitoring plan.  Serious adverse events, including any deemed as suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be repo rted to U.S. FDA within 15 calendar 
days of notification and within 7 calendar days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is considered life -threatening or 
resulted in death.  A serious adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it’s not listed in the 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] IB  or is not li sted at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  Non-S[LOCATION_003]R 
SAEs will be reported annually as per regulatory guidance.   
For all SAEs, the i nvestigator is obligated to pursue an d provide information to Lycera  or 
designee  in accordance with the t imeframes  for reporting specified above.   In addition, an 
investig ator may be requested by [CONTACT_166694] -up infor mation in 
an expedited fashion.   In general, the SAE form will  include a description /narrative  of the event 
in su fficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determ ination of possible causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications a nd illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a subject  death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Lycera  or its 
designated representative.   Expedited safety reports on all unexpected SAEs that are at least 
possibly related to study procedures will be provi ded to the FDA .   
Subjec ts with unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs identified on the last 
scheduled visit, sho uld be followed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator until the event s are satisfactorily resolved.  
Resolution means the subject  has returned to the  baseline state of health, the i nvestigator does 
not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE , or upon agreement with Lycera  or 
designee .

7.7 Exposure in Utero   
For investigational  products w ithin clinical studies , an EIU occurs if:    
 A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after receiving the study drug  (eg, after 
Study Day 1).   
If any study subject  becomes pregnant during the ir participation in the study, the subject will 
stop study d rug and withdraw from the study.  The investigator must submit  this information to 
Lycera  or designee on the EIU Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has 
occurred and within 24  hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitt ed should 
include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to an induced 
termination of pregnancy).   
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all EIU re ports with an 
unknown outcome.  The i nvestigator wi ll follow the pregnancy until completion or  until 
pregnancy termination (i e, induced a bortion) and then notify Lycera  or designee of the outcome.  
The i nvestigator will provide this information as a follow  up to the initial EIU Form.  The 
reasons(s) for an  induced  abortion should be specified.  An EIU report is not created when an 
ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable , however such 
events should be considered as SAEs and the investigator should follow the procedures  for 
reporting SAEs .   
If the pregnancy outcome meets the criteria for immedi ate classification as an SAE (ie , 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including resulting in an 
aborted fetus, still birth or neonatal death]),  the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs.   
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be a ssessed at the time of birth (ie , 
no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an EIU F orm can 
be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], 
unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.

Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:    
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.    
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 1  month of birth should be reported, without regards to 
causality as SAE s.  In addition, any infant death afte r 1 month that the i nvestigato r assesses 
as possibly related to the in  utero exposure to the investigational medication should be 
reported.    
7.8 Relationship/ Causality of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
The i nvestigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious  and non -
serious).  The causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug  itself (eg , LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC or placebo ) caused or contributed to an 
AE.   
If the final determination o f causality is unknown  and the i nvestigator  does not know whether the 
study drug  caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to  study drug ” for 
reporting purposes.   If the i nvestigator’s causality assessment is “unknown , but not related to 
study drug ”, this sho uld be clearly documented on study records  and will be categorized as “not 
related to study drug” for reporting purposes .   
Relationship of an AE to  the study drug  will be assessed as follows:  
Unrelated [Not Related or Unlikely Related] :  There is not a te mporal or causal relationship to 
the study drug .  If the AE is “unrelated” to the study drug , the investigator  must assess whether 
the event is thought to be related to the disease under study, concomitant medication, other 
illness, other, or unknown.    
Related  [Definite ]:  There is reason to conclude that the  study drug caused the AE.   
Suspected  [Possible or Probable ]:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study drug and the AE.  For analysis purposes , “Suspected [Possible or Prob able]” events are 
categorized as “Related.”

8.0 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLAN  
8.1 Sample Size Calculation  
A total of approximately 30  subjects will be randomized into the study and using a 2:1 
randomization ratio of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25  mg or placebo daily.   
A sample size of 30  subjects (20 LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC and 10 placebo) will achieve approxi mately an 
80% power to detect difference in the mean percent change from baseline in PASI at Week  12 in 
the LYC -[ZIP_CODE] treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group.  The mean percent 
change from baseline in PASI at Week  12 in the placebo treatmen t group is assumed to be 16.7% 
with SD=32.0.[16]  The power was computed assuming the mean percent change from baseline in 
PASI at Week  [ADDRESS_193464] 52.7% (SD=32.0) for a me an 
difference of at least 36.0%.  The test statistic used is the two -sided t -test.  The alpha level of  the 
test was targeted at 0.05.  
8.2 Analysis Populations  
8.2.1 Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects.  Subjects will b e included in 
the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment they actually 
received.  All efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS.   
8.2.2 Safety Set  
The safety set is defined as all randomized subjects  who received at leas t one dose of study drug .  
For summaries/listings where treatment group is included, subjects will be included in the 
treatment group to which they were actually treated.  All safety analyses will be performed on 
the Safety Set.

adjustments for multiplicity.  Additional details of the statistical analyses will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan ( SAP).   
8.5 Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1 Primary Effic acy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean percent change from baseline in PASI score at 
Week  12.  The endpoint will be calculated by [CONTACT_166696]  12 PASI score and subtracting the 
baseline PASI score then dividing by [CONTACT_166697] P ASI score and multiplying by 100 to get the 
percentage.  The mean percent change from baseline in PASI scores will be compared between 
the LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment group and placebo using analysis of covariance with treatment as a 
factor and baseline as a co variate to assess the null hypothesis that the LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC arm mean 
percent change equals the placebo arm mean percent change   The mean difference (LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -
EC versus placebo) will also be estimated  along with the 95% confidence interval of the 
differenc e. If the confidence interval does not contain 0 the null hypothesis will be rejected and 
the mean percent change from baseline in PASI score at Week 12 will be considered different 
due to treatment arm.

8.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized and compared between the 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment arm and placebo:  
 The proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥  75% reduction from baseline in PASI at Week  12 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_166698] a ≥  75% reduction from 
baseline in PASI at Week  [ADDRESS_193468] . 
 The mean percent change from baseline t o Week 12 in the BSA  will be calculated by [CONTACT_166699]  12 BSA and subtracting the baseline percent BSA then dividing by [CONTACT_166700] 100 to get the percentage  of baseline .  The mean percent 
change in each treatment arm wi ll be compared using the same methodology for the primary 
efficacy endpoint . 
 The proportion of subjects who achieve “clear ed” (score = 0) or “ minimal ” (score = 1) on the 
static IGA at Week 12  will be calculated by [CONTACT_166698] 
“cleared” (score = 0) or “minimal” (score = 1) on the static IGA at Week [ADDRESS_193469] . 
 The proportion of subject s who achieve a t least a  [ADDRESS_193470] a 2 step reduction 
on the static IGA at Week 12 (ie, a score of 5 at baseline to a score of 3 or less at Week 12 )

10.1 Study Monitoring  
The i nvestigator will allow representatives of Lycera  (or their designee) to periodically monitor 
all CRFs, source documents, informed consent documents , and clinical laboratory records for 
each subject .  The purpose of the monitoring visits will be to:  
 evaluate the progress of the study  
 verify the accuracy and completeness of the CRFs  
 verify the signed ICD, the Regulatory binder, and study drug  storage and records  
 resolve any inconsistencies in the study rec ords 
 ensure that all protocol requirements are being fulfilled  
 ensure GCPs are being followed  
The study site may be  subject  to review by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC , and/or to quality assurance audits 
performed by [CONTACT_166703] (or designee) , and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_166704].   
It is important that the i nvestigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and labora tory data 
entered on the CRFs. Subjec t source documents are the investigator’s  subject  record s maintained 
at the study site.   In most cases, the source documents will be the hospit al’s or the i nvestigator’s 
chart.   In cases where the source docum ents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166670]’s chart, the 
information collected on the CRFs must match those charts.    
The CRF for questionnaires may serve as the source document.   
10.[ADDRESS_193479] Retention  
Food and Drug Administration /ICH regulations require all i nvestigators participating in clinical 
drug studies to maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following periods:

In the PASI the body is divided into 4 regions: head (H), trunk (T), upper extremities (U) and 
lower extremities (L). Each region is considered to account for the following % of total BSA, 
head = 10%  (0.1) , trunk = 30%  (0.3) , upper extremities = 20%  (0.2)  and lower extremities = 40%  
(0.4) .   
 
Estimation of the % body area affected by [CONTACT_166710] (fingers included)  and then converted the corresponding numeric score 
(0 to 6) as indicated in column 5 in the above table.   
 
Each region is also evaluated separately for signs of disease (er ythema  (E), thickening  (I), and 
scaling  (D), which are rated and given a score (0 to 4),  as indicated in the above table.  
 
The PASI generates a numeric score that can range from 0 (no signs of psoriasis) to 72.  
 
Scores from the 4 regions are combined to g et the PASI score using the PASI formula:  
PASI = 0.1(E H + IH = S H)AH  + 0.3(E T + IT + S T)AT + 0.2(E U + IU + S U)AU + 0.4(E L + IL + S L)AL 
 
The investigator will be responsible for collecting the components (E, I, S) and the total  regional 
area. These compo nents will be entered into the CRF and calculation of the PASI score will done 
in the CRF.

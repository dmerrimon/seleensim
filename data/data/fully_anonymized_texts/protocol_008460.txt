 3 BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE:  38 
The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with and without 39 
diabetes is well established (2-6). Extensive data from observational and prospective randomized [ADDRESS_785831] reported a strong association between 41 
hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcome, such as mo rtality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), 42 
infections and overall complications (2, 5, 7 -9).  Most clinical trials in critically ill and general [ADDRESS_785832] reported that improvement of glycemic control reduces LOS, 44 
risk of multiorgan failure and systemic infections (10-12), as well as short - and long -term 45 
mortality (7, 12)  in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes.   46 
Clinical guidelines from professional organizations (13-15) recommend the use of subcutaneous 47 
(SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical [ADDRESS_785833] common SQ insulin regimens for inpatient glycemic 49 
management are sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) and basal bolus insulin therapy in 50 
combination with correction insulin scale (16, 17) .  The use of basal bolus regimen results in 51 
better glycemic control and lower rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593670] 52 
regular insulin (SSRI) (17-20).  The basal bolus regimen, however, requires multiple insulin 53 
daily injections and is associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia , which has been 54 
reporte d in up to 32% of non -ICU patients with T2D (17, 19, 20) .   55 
 56 
Increasing evidence indicates that incretin -based agents are safe and effective for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 57 
management of patients with T2D.   We recently completed a  randomized open label trial 58 
comparing differences in glycemic control between treatment with sitagliptin (Januvia ) alone [ADDRESS_785834] basal bolus regimen in general medicine 60 
and surgery patients with T2D (see pre liminary result section).  We found no differences in mean [ADDRESS_785835] a 63 
benefici al cardiovascular profile improving functional status and endothelial function (21), 64 
increasing left ventricular function in patients with heart failure (22) and in surgery patients 65 
undergoing CABG (22, 23) , and to reducing infarct size and preserving  left ventricular 66 
myocardial performance in ischemic models (24).   67 
 68 
Liraglutide is a once -daily human GLP -1 analogue approved for the treatment of T2D.  69 
Liraglutide has been shown to lower blood glucose, stimulate endogenous insulin secretion, 70 
decrease plasma glucagon levels, inhibit gastric emptying, reduce food intake and body weight 71 
and improve ß -cell function when administered subcutaneously (25). Liraglutide increases  72 
insulin secretion in a glucose -dependent manner (i.e., only when plasma glucose levels are 73 
elevated), resulting in low -risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. When compared to 74 
insulin glargine therapy, the use of GLP1 has resulted in comparable red uction in HbA1c level, 75 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4 lower rates of hypoglycemia and less weight gain (26).  No  prospective studies; however, have 76 
compared the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595258].  77

 79 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:  80 
Primary objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of liraglutide (Victoza®) versus glargin e 81 
insulin on glycemic control after 26 weeks of treatment in medicine and surgical patients with 82 
T2D after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  83 
 84 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  85 
Study Hypothesis (hypotheses):  86 
We hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide  (Victoza®) will result in a similar improvement in 87 
HbA1c levels and in lower rate of hypoglycemic events compared to treatment with glargine 88 
(Lantus) in patients with T2D after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  89 
 90 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine whether treatment with liraglutide  (Victoza®) will result in 91 
similar glycemic control (HbA1c at 26 weeks) and a lower rate of hypoglycemic events 92 
compared to treatment with glargine (Lantus ) in patients with T2D after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 93 
discharge. Patients with poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥7%-10%) T2D treated with diet or oral 94 
antidiabetic agents , or on low -dose insulin therapy (TDD ≤0. 4 unit/kg/day ) will be randomized 95 
to liraglutide or glargine with or without oral agents at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] .  96 
 97 
Endpoin ts: 98 
Study Outcomes:  99 
The primary outcome  of the study is to determine differences in HbA1c concentration at 26 100 
weeks from discharge between liraglutide and glargine insulin therapy .    101 
 102 
The secondary outcome  is to compare differences between treatment groups in any of the 103 
following measures during the 26 weeks following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124060] T2D:  104 
• Self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) 7 -point profiles  105 
• Fasting and postprandial BG concentration  106 
• Incide nce rate and number of h ypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe h ypoglycemic 107

Study type : 122 
The trial is a 26 -week, randomized, open label -controlled two -armed, multi -center , multi - 123 
national trial investigating the efficacy and safety of liraglutide versus glargine insulin in 124 
medicine  and surgical  patients with T2D after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   125 
 126 
We will recruit a total of 330 poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥7%-10%) patients with T2D treated 127 
with diet or oral antidiabetic agents (OAD) or on low -dose insulin therapy (TDD ≤0. 4 128 
unit/kg/day)  prior to admission. Patients will be treated with a standard basal bolus insulin [ADDRESS_785836] patients via telephone call every 2 weeks to assess response 132 
to therapy. In addition, patients will be asked to attend an outpatient clinic visit at  2 (optional),  4, [ADDRESS_785837]’s pre -admission OAD regimen.  Dose of OAD should remain 140 
unchanged throughout the trial, howeve r dose reduction of insulin and sulfonylurea is allowed 141

Hypoglycemia: Patients will receive diabetes education prior to discharge and  will be instructed 423 
on hypoglycemia sign/symptoms and treatment.  Patients will be asked to call the diabetes center 424 
and/or PCP in the event of hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the dose of OAD 425 
will be reduced or discontinued and the daily dose of basal insulin will be reduced by 10% to 426

 433 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  434 
This study is randomized multicenter, open -label controll ed trial. The overall hypothesis is that 435 
patients with T2D discharged on liraglutide and glargine will experience similar improvement in 436 
glycemic control (HbA1c level at [ADDRESS_785861] -discharge).  In addition, we anticipate that 437 
compared to patients treate d with insulin glargine, patients on liraglutide will experience lower 438 
number of hypoglycemic events and less weight gain during follow -up.  439 
 440 
Sample Size and Power Calculations: The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control 441 
measured by [CONTACT_13505]1c at 26 weeks after discharge between treatment groups. To show the non - 442 
inferiority of liraglutide to basal glargine insulin in terms of glycemic control, we set the 443 
equivalence margin as 0.5%, from a view that an HbA1c difference < 0.5% is usually not [ADDRESS_785862] deviation of 26 week A1c is 446 
bounded about 1.5%.  We set the margin of equivalence as 0.5%  and assume the true difference 447 
between mean A1c is 0. A sample size of 124 for each treatment group would achieve 80% [ADDRESS_785863] the hypothesis that the mean HbA1c in patients treated with liraglutide is < 0.5%  [ADDRESS_785864], with 450 
alpha=0.05 . Accounting for 10% attrition rate, we would need [ADDRESS_785865] in this study is the difference in hypoglycemia (BG <70 454 
mg/dl). Based on our preliminary discharg e data, 30 -40% of patients treated with basal insulin [ADDRESS_785866] one hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Assuming a hypoglycemia rate of 20 -35% in the 456 
insulin group in this study, given the sample size of 140 subjects per treatment group, based on a 457 
two sided Fi sher’s exact test with alpha=0.05, we would have 80% power to detect an odds rati o 458 
in hypoglycemia rate of 0.42 in liraglutide group (versus glargine group). In the following table, 459

ADVERSE EVENTS:  609 
Definition:   An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a product, and [ADDRESS_785880] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is an 611 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or disease [ADDRESS_785881] treatment follow -up period as defined in the protocol.  615 
AEs include a clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness  and clinical laboratory 616 
adverse event (CLAE).  An AE is either a serious AE (SAE) or a non -serious AE.  617 
 618 
In this trial, an SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  619 
-Death  620 
-A life -threatening experience  621 
-Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  622 
-Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  623 
-Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening or require 624 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  625 
-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_593680].  626 
 627 
Severi ty Assessment Definitions:  628 
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  629 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  630 
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  [ADDRESS_785882] Assessment Definitions:  633 
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  634 
U1111 -1139 -2991                  OCTOBER 28, 2019 VERS  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21 • Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  635 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product  [ADDRESS_785883] treatment follow -up period, as 640 
defined in the protocol.  641 
 642 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  643 
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_57676] [ADDRESS_785884] signed the informed consent  645 
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. [ADDRESS_785885] has completed the trial  647 
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 648 
disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with sequelae 649 
should be rated  as an SAE  650 
• Not recovered  651 
• Fatal  652 
• Unknown  653 
 654 
Reporting of adverse events:  All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and [ADDRESS_785886] 656 
with the trial site s taff (site visits and telephone contacts), the subject will be asked about AEs. 657 
After  the ICF is signed , all adverse events related to protocol procedures are to be reported.   658 
 659 
The presence of SAE will be reported to the Emory IRB and Novo Nordisk within 2 4 hours  by 660 
fax or e -mail. A SAE is any adverse event from this study that results in one of the following 661 
outcomes: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening experience (that 662 
is, immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and events considered 663 
significant by [CONTACT_81121].  664 
  665 
Reporting of pregnancies:  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast -feeding will not be [ADDRESS_785887] will be 669 
asked to p rovide information about her pregnancy, delivery and the health of her infant until age 670 
one month. If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed [ADDRESS_785888] (MESI)  [ADDRESS_785889] are those events thought to be [potentially] associated with [ADDRESS_785890] including  acute pancreatitis , cardiovascular events (heart 679

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a systemic vasculitis of the large vessels 
with a predilection for the cranial branches of the aorta.  GCA affects women to men in a 3:[ADDRESS_1114157] persistent systemic and vascular inflammation with resultant pathology related to progres sive 
vascular occlusion.
The characteristic symptoms of GCA include those related to vascular occlusion such as headache, jaw 
pain related to use (jaw claudication), as well as ocular symptoms.  Visual symptoms occur in up to 30% 
of GCA patients and can in clude diplopia or vision loss with 15% of patients manifesting permanent 
unilateral or bilateral loss of vision.  Patients with GCA experience systemic symptoms such as fever, 
fatigue, and weight loss.  There is a significant overlap between GCA and polymy algia rheumatica (PMR) 
with up to 30% of those with GCA manifesting PMR.
Corticosteroid (CS) therapy is the current mainstay of treatment for GCA.  High doses of CS therapy are 
initially required and most often quickly control inflammation and prevent visi on loss and/or other 
irreversible symptoms.  Initial high dose CS therapy is followed by a prolonged period of dose tapering.  
During this tapering phase, between 50% and 80% of GCA patients experience a disease flare.1  In 
addition to symptomatic pathology, prolonged exposure to CS therapy results in approximately 80% of 
GCA patients manifesting steroid -associated pathology within 10 years following diagnosis.2
Though many symptoms such as headache and PMR symptoms resolve rapi[INVESTIGATOR_807006], ischemic complications such as jaw claudication may take considerably longer.  
Additionally, GCA is associated with chronic vascular damage including aortic inflammation with 
subsequent aortic aneurysm formation which may result in spontaneous rupture and/or the need for 
surgica l repair.  Notably, there are cases reported of chronic underlying vascular inflammation and 
progression of vascular pathology despi[INVESTIGATOR_807007], even while still 
on chronic CS therapy.3  Thus, there remains the potential for improved treatment options which can 
mitigate this subclinical vascular inflammation.
The prevalence of GCA varies by [CONTACT_807021] r ates of temporal arteritis/GCA varying widely 
between 1 and 30 per 100,000 individuals and with further enrichment in individuals ≥ [ADDRESS_1114158] demonstrated superiority in the achievement of GCA disease remission compared to

STUDY M16 -852  |  Version 7.0  |  EU CT 2023- 505476- 29-[ADDRESS_1114159] -of-care CS therapy.4,5  In addit ion to increased rates of remission, these studies demonstrated 
the ability to reduce exposure to CS therapy by [CONTACT_807022]. ]
Upadacitinib as Potential Treatment for GCA
Targeting the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases such as GCA, rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), atopic dermatitis (AD), 
and axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), is supported by [CONTACT_110976]- inflammatory 
cytokines that signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune -related disorders.  The 
activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other 
molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellula r trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to multiple 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including the key cytokines driving GCA pathogenesis.6-8
The JAK family is composed of 4 members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2).  These cytoplasmic 
tyrosine kinases act in tandem to activate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 
that transduce cytokine -mediated signals, and are associated with multiple membrane cytokine 
receptors such as common gamma chain (CGC) receptors and the glycoprotein 130 transmembrane 
proteins.9  JAK3 and JAK1 are components of the CGC cytokine receptor complexes that are responsible 
for the signaling of the inflammatory cytokin es interleukin (IL) -2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21; whereas IL -[ADDRESS_1114160] JAK1 may offer an improved benefit/risk profile 
in patients with GCA.  Upadacitinib has reduced activity against JAK2 and JAK3 which may mitigate JAK2 
inhibitory effects on erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis as well as immunosuppressive effect mediated by 
[CONTACT_166527]3 inhibition.
By [CONTACT_807023]1, it is anticipated that upadacitinib wil l demonstrate the ability to 
abrogate signaling of key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of GCA.  Extensive preclinical, ex vivo, 
and in vivo studies have demonstrated robust inhibition of the JAK1- dependent cytokines IL -6 and 
Interferon gamma (IFN -γ).  These two cytokines have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of 
GCA.  IL -[ADDRESS_1114161] 
IFN-γ blockade abrogates STAT1 activa tion, reduced expression of ICAM -1, CXCL9, 10, 11 and prevents 
macrophage adhesion/infiltration.
Similarly, treatment with the relatively non -selective JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in a translational model of 
human GCA14demonstrated abrogation of STAT -1 signaling, reduced blood levels of IFN -γ, and 
prevention of T cell and macrophage accumulation in the vessel wall.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Clinically, the persistence of smold ering inflammation is supported by [CONTACT_807024], or the closely related large vessel vasculitis Takayasu's arteritis, who were treated with the IL -[ADDRESS_1114162] that although IL -6 
receptor blockade can provide reduction in flares when used continuously on the background of a 
forced CS taper, ultimately targeting the CS/IL -6 resistant Th1 responses will be ne cessary to resolve 
chronic smoldering vasculitis.  Among those with a good response to tocilizumab in a 1- year study, over 
half of subjects relapsed (as early as 3 months) after discontinuation of IL -6R blockade.17
Using RA as a model, exposures achieved with upadacitinib 15 mg daily are anticipated to provide a level 
of IL -6 inhibition in range of that achieved with tocilizumab 162 mg weekly (the app roved GCA dose).  In 
addition to IL -[ADDRESS_1114163] inhibition of the IFN -γ signaling with 
upadacitinib.  Thus, upadacitinib treatment has the potential to provide additive efficacy above and 
beyond that observed with IL -6R bl ockade alone.
Clinical Hypothesis
It is hypothesized that inhibition of cytokine signaling through the IL -6, IFN -γ, and IL -12 signaling 
pathways by [CONTACT_620917], a selective JAK1 inhibitor, will result in improved ability to maintain remission 
with absence of GCA signs and symptoms compared to placebo (PBO), even in the setting of a more 
rapid reduction of CS treatment.
2.[ADDRESS_1114164] -of-care CS therapy (56% versus 18% rates of 
sustai ned remission from Week 12 through Week 52 defined as the absence GCA signs and symptoms, 
normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C -reactive protein (CRP), and adherence to 
the CS taper regimen),5there is still significant room for improvement.  In addition, it is not yet clear if 
the observed benefit translates into a potential for drug -free remission.  Thus, there remains a medical 
need for additional therapeutic options in GCA to further increa se rates of sustained remission and 
minimize steroid exposure.
The doses to be evaluated in Study M16 -852 (upadacitinib 7.5 and 15 mg once daily [QD]) are expected 
to provide an optimal benefit/risk profile to support chronic administration in this study p opulation; 
refer to the Selection of Doses in the Study section for additional details.
Adverse events (AEs) such as infections includin g herpes zoster reactivation, major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non -fatal myocardial infarctions and non -
fatal strokes), thrombosis, malignancies, and hematologic AEs have been observed with JAK inhibition.  
Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability to decrease inflammation mediated by 
[CONTACT_166527]1 signaling while hav ing less inhibitory effect on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially minimize 
some of the reported safety concerns with less selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be 
mediated by [CONTACT_110978]2 and JAK3 signaling pathways .
An increased risk of infections including opportunistic infections (e.g. ,mucosal candida infections) and 
herpes zoster, non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and abnormal laboratory changes (e.g., elevations of

blood cells) have been observed with upadacitinib therapy. 
In ORAL Surveillance, a study of a different JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, in RA patients [ADDRESS_1114165] one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rate s of all -cause mortality, malignancies, MACE 
and thrombosis (overall thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) were seen in 
patients treated with tofacitinib versus TNF blockers .7These higher rates were primarily observed in 
patients 65 years of age and older, patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and 
patients with other cardiovascular risk factors (such as current or past long -time smokers). Although 
upadacitinib clinical trial data to date have not indicated a higher risk for MACE, venous 
thromboembolism, malignancies excluding NMSC, or deaths in RA pat ients treated with upadacitinib 
versus adalimumab, the findings of the ORAL Surveillance study may potentially also apply to other JAK 
inhibitors and an increased risk for these events compared to TNF blockers cannot be completely 
excluded. Therefore, the investigator should consider the benefits and risks of upadacitinib treatment 
and suitable treatment alternatives in determining study participation and the continued use of 
upadacitinib in patients [ADDRESS_1114166] long -time 
smokers, and/or patients with other malignancy risk factors (e.g., current malignancy or history of 
malignancy).
The results of genetic tox icology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, 
upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in 
females of childbearing potential.  Based on the calculated safety margins for human fet al exposure with 
seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects 
who are treated with upadacitinib.
A detailed discussion of the pre -clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and safety 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.18
Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable 
benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib and support the continued investigation of upadacitinib in patients 
with various autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.
In vi ew of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19 [coronavirus SARS- CoV-2]) pandemic, the benefit -risk 
profile of various immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the 
effects of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not wel l defined.

the data.  Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the populati on 
pharmacokinetic analyses.
3.6 Patient Experience Endpoints
Data on patient experience will be collected by [CONTACT_807026] (eCRF).  The objective of the research is to obtai n relevant 
information about patient experiences regarding the burden of GCA disease and treatment.
3.7 Biomarker Exploratory Research
Optional blood samples for exploratory research will be collected as described in the Activity Schedule 
(Appendix D).  Prognostic and predictive biomarker signatures may be evaluated.  Biomarker 
assessments may include nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  Expl oratory research will focus 
on GCA and upadacitinib.  The objective of research is to analyze samples for biomarkers that will help 
to understand the subject's disease and response to upadacitinib.  Genes of interest may include (but 
not limited to) those associated pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), 
genes within the target pathway (JAK, Tyk2, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), or other genes believed to be 
related GCA and other inflammatory diseases (human leukocyte antigens [HLA], IL).  Research may also 
include epi[INVESTIGATOR_110937]'s response to treatment or 
disease.  Samples for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteomics will be used to research if any genetic 
variants result in changes t o gene expression or protein concentrations.
These assessments may be explored in the context of GCA or related conditions and/or upadacitinib or 
drugs of similar classes.  Research on samples collected in [LOCATION_013] will be restricted to GCA and 
upadacitinib.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with 
the clinical study report.
The samples may be retained for no longer than [ADDRESS_1114167] one of the following:  unequivocal cranial symptoms of GCA, unequivocal 
symptoms of PMR, or other fe atures judged by [CONTACT_807027], 
AND an ESR ≥ 30 mm/hr or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL.

STUDY M16 -852  |  Version 7.0  |  EU CT 2023- 505476- 29-[ADDRESS_1114168] one attempted CS taper.
The study will allow enrollment of a minimum of 30% of subjects with new onset disease and up to 70% 
of subjects with relapsing disease.  The study will also allow enrollment of up to 20% of subjects with 
previous u se of an IL -6 inhibitor with discontinuation based on reasons other than disease flare.
The study duration will include a 35 -day maximum Screening Period:  a 52 -week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group treatment period (Period 1); a 52 -week blinded ex tension period in which 
subjects may either be re -randomized or continue their original treatment assignment (Period 2); and a 
30-day follow -up period.
In Period 1, subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatm ent 
groups:
Upadacitinib 15 mg administered daily + 26 -week CS taper regimen (n = 210)
Upadacitinib 7.5 mg administered daily + 26 -week CS taper regimen (n = 105)
PBO administered daily + 52 -week CS taper regimen (n = 105)
Subjects must have received treatment for active GCA at a dose of ≥ 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) at 
any time prior to Baseline and must be receiving prednisone (or prednisolone) ≥ [ADDRESS_1114169] has already 
taken the CS dose at home on the day of the Baseline vis it, dosing should not be repeated with 
sponsor -provided CS.  Prednisone or prednisolone will be tapered according to a predefined schedule 
over a 26 - or 52- week period.  Open -label prednisone or prednisolone will be provided until the dose is 
tapered to 2 0 mg/day.  Subsequently, blinded prednisone or prednisolone will be provided for the 
remaining blinded taper regimen through Week 52.  See Section 5.8for additional details regarding CS 
therapy during the study.
Subjects assigned to either dose of upadacitinib who achieve sustained remission for at least 
24consecutive weeks prior to the Week 52 Visit (at the end of Period 1) will be re -randomized in a 
2:1ratio to either continue on upadacitinib or switch to PBO in Period 2.  Subjects who achieved 
sustained remission for at least 24 weeks prior to the Week 52 visit (at the end of Period 1) who were

will be discontinued from study drug and the study at the end of P eriod 1.
Subjects who discontinue study drug during Period 1 should receive treatment at the investigator's 
judgment, in accordance with local standard -of-care (which could include tocilizumab), and continue to 
follow the regular visit schedule for the remainder of Period 1 and adhere to the Period 1 study 
procedures as noted in Appendix D.
In Period 2, subjects who experience a flare (defined as an event deter mined by [CONTACT_807028] > 30 mm/hr attributable to 
GCA, AND requiring initiation of CS) will start open- label escape therapy with prednisone or 
prednisolone at investigator's discreti on.  A flare may be documented at either a scheduled or 
unscheduled visit.  Subjects meeting flare criteria will return within approximately [ADDRESS_1114171] ug should receive treatment at the investigator's 
judgment, in accordance with local standard -of-care (which could include tocilizumab), and continue to 
follow the regular visit schedule for Period 2 and adhere to the study procedures as noted in 
Appendix D.
An independent, external data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established for periodic review of 
unblinded safety data and to ensure subject s afety.  In addition, a futility analysis will be conducted by

new interventions.
Selection of Doses in the Study
This Phase 3 study will evaluate 2 doses of upadacitinib (7.5 or 15 mg QD) using the once -daily tablet 
formulation.  The selection of doses was informed by [CONTACT_807030] -response relationships 
characterized in Phase 2 studies in RA (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550), the Phase 3 clinical trials in RA 
(Studies M13 -549 [SELECT -NEXT] and M13 -542 [SELECT -BEYOND]), and the published results for Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies of the IL -6 inhibitor tocilizumab in GCA.4,5
Exposure -response analyses of the two Phase 2 studies in RA using the immediate -release formulations 
(doses from 3 mg twice daily [BID] to 18 mg BID and 24 mg QD) indicated that the 6 mg BID dose 
(equivalent to the 15 -mg QD dose) approaches the plateau of efficacy in RA, and increasing the dose to 
12 mg BID (equivalent to the 30 -mg QD dose) appears to res ult in modest incremental efficacy 
benefit.19,20  A bioavailability study has demonstrated that a 15 mg QD regimen of the once -daily 
formulation provide equivalent daily area under the curve (AUC) and comparable maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) and minimum serum concentration (C min) to [ADDRESS_1114175] two RA Phase 3 clinical trials (Study M13 -549 [SELECT -NEXT] and Study M13 -542 
[SELECT -BEYOND]) evaluating upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe RA showed that after 
12weeks of treatment, both doses of upadaci tinib (15 mg and 30 mg QD) met the study's primary 
endpoints of ACR20 and Low Disease Activity (LDA).  Key secondary endpoints were also achieved.  
Study M13 -549 evaluated upadacitinib compared to PBO in subjects who did not adequately respond to 
treatment with conventional -synthetic disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD -IR), while 
Study M13 -[ADDRESS_1114176] antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD -IR).  Result s from the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 RA studies support the use of upadacitinib 15 mg as an efficacious dose in RA, and this dose is 
also expected to be efficacious in GCA.
In addition, a 7.5 mg dose will also be evaluated to ensure the minimal efficacious dose in GCA is 
characterized.  Since GCA affects an older population with co -morbid conditions and requires initiation 
of high dose CS, this population is potentially at greater risk of infections.  As such, a 7.5 mg dose may 
provide an optimal benefit/risk pro file to support chronic administration in GCA patients.
The doses to be evaluated in Study M16 -852 (upadacitinib 7.5 mg and 15 mg QD) are predicted to 
provide exposures that are lower than the no -observed- adverse -effect level (NOAEL) exposures from 
the pre clinical toxicology studies as well as the highest exposures that were previously evaluated and 
found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers in Phase [ADDRESS_1114177] on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics based on population pharmacokinetic analyses across Phase 1,

Efficacy in GCA was demonstrated for an IL -6 receptor inhibi tor, tocilizumab, using doses that were

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].For a woman who is ≤ 55 years of age and is not perman ently surgically sterile, as defined above, and 
has had no menses for 12 or more months, FSH should be tested at Screening .
If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential and 
protocol -specified contraception is required.
If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, contraception is 
not required.
If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, contraception is 
required and pregnancy testing requirements for wo men of childbearing potential must be 
followed as described in the Study Activities Table ( Appendix D).
A woman who does not meet the definition o f postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile is 
considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly 
effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study Day 1 (or earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_1114194] dose of study drug:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days 
prior to Study Day 1.
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with 
inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1.
Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation ( For subjects in Japan:   Bilateral tubal ligation).
Vasectomiz ed partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation 
of the surgical success and is the only sexual partner.
Intrauterine device (IUD).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse -when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Periodic 
abstinence (for example, using calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable.
If required per local guidelines, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm 
or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly effective birth control 
methods listed above (excluding true abstin ence).
If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal (defined 
above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
It is important to note that contracepti on requirements described above are specifically intended to 
prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy upadacitinib.

Unless subjects request to discontinue from participating in the study (withdrawal of informe d consent), 
subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should continue to be followed for all regularly 
scheduled visits for the period from which they discontinued (refer to Section 5.6).
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_1114201]'s source documentation.
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The study may be 
discontinued or terminated in case of an unacceptable risk, any relevant toxicity, or a negative change in 
the risk/benefit assessment.  This might include the occurrence of AEs with a character, severity or 
frequency that is new in comparison to the existing risk profile.  In addition, data deriv edfrom other 
clinical trials or toxicologica l studies which negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment might cause 
discontinuation or termination of the study.  The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if 
he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety re asons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly 
notify the investigator.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_12899].
5.[ADDRESS_1114202] should be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue 
participation in the st udy.
If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug, the procedures outlined for the Premature 
Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_1114203] dose 
of study drug is required to ensure all treatment -emergent AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) have been

STUDY M16 -852  |  Version 7.0  |  EU CT 2023- 505476- 29-[ADDRESS_1114204] dose of study drug.
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug treatment should continue to be fo llowed for all regularly scheduled visits for the period 
from which they discontinue as outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D), unless subj ects have 
decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent).  That is, 
subjects who discontinue study drug during Period 1 should continue to follow the visit schedule for the 
remainder of Period 1, but not continue i nto Period 2.  Subjects who discontinue study drug during 
Period 2, should follow the visit schedule for the remainder of Period 2.  As noted in the Activity 
Schedule ( Appendix D), at the visits after study drug discontinuation, subjects should adhere to all study 
procedures except for dispensing study drug or reviewing returns and accountability, 
dispensing/reviewing study drug instructions, dosing d iaries, pharmacokinetic sample collection, and 
sample collection for exploratory research.  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific 
importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (discontinuation of study drug treatment and study 
participation; withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time.  If a subject prematurely 
discontinues s tudy drug treatment and study participation (withdrawal of informed consent) 
simultaneously, the procedures outlined for the PD Visit should be completed as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_1114205] discontinues from study (withdrawal of informed consent) following a previous 
discontinuation of study drug that resulted in an initial PD Visit, a second PD Visit is not required.
If a subject is discontinuing at Week 52 because they do not meet the criteria to enter Period 2, a 
separate PD Visit is not needed; instead, the Week [ADDRESS_1114206] dose of study drug should occur to ensure all treatment emergent
AEs/SAEs have bee n resolved.  This visit may be a telephone call if a site visit is not possible.
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status, including the date of the last study dru g dose and the primary 
reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new 
treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's 
condition.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_1114207]'s source documentation.
If a subject withdraws from stud y follow up or withdraws permission for the collection of their personal 
data, the study staff may still use available public records to obtain information about survival status 
only, as appropriate per local regulations.

Assessment of GCA Signs and Symptoms
Clinical signs and symptoms of GCA will be evaluated at every study visit according to the schedule of 
assessment and entered into the eCRF.  GCA signs and symptoms include the following:
Fever (> 38°C or 100.4°F)
Sympt oms of PMR (morning stiffness and/or pain, in the shoulder and/or hip girdles)
Localized headache, temporal artery or scalp tenderness
Visual signs or symptoms such as acute or subacute vision loss due to arteritic anterior ischemic 
optic neuropathy, trans ient blurry vision (generally monocular or at least affecting one eye at a 
time, but potentially affecting both eyes)
Jaw or mouth pain
New or worsened extremity claudication
Other features judged by [CONTACT_807036] a GCA or PMR flare.
Acute Phase Reactants:  High Sensitivity C -Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and Erythrocyte 
Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
Knowledge of the laboratory results for hsCRP may result in inadvertent unblinding of a subject's 
treatment.  Therefore, after the Baseline Visit, hsCRP results (analyzed and reported by [CONTACT_11378]) will not be made available to the Sponsor, the investigator, study site personnel, orthe 
subject through the duration of the study. The Sponsor will be blinded to the hsCRP results u ntil the 
time of the primary analysis .  
After the Screening visit, ESR results (analyzed and reported by [CONTACT_12082]) will not be made 
available to the Sponsor, the investigator, the subject, and study site personnel , with the exception of 
the lo cal Laboratory Assessor to prevent biased efficacy assessment.  A local Laboratory Assessor will be 
assigned at each study site to review ESR results.  Only the Laboratory Assessor is permitted to review 
ESR results and will advise the investigator of any ESR measurement >30 mm/hr.

a. The 1 -mg prednisone/prednisolone open -label dose is not needed for protocol -defined open -label taper, but may be used 
for escape therapy, if needed (Corticosteroid Escape Therapy during the Study).
b. The CS tapering schedule is provided in Appendix E.
Corticosteroid Therapy as Study Drug
There are two phases to the CS (prednisone or prednisolone) taper regimen:
Open- label taper, for CS dosages from 60 mg/day to 20 mg/day
Blinded taper, for CS dosages < 20 mg/day.
Starting at Baseline, all subjects will switch from CS obtained outside of the study to open -label oral 
prednisone or pred nisolone provided by [CONTACT_151079] a dose of 20, 30, 40, 50, or [ADDRESS_1114211] of these doses.  Subjects will 
follow the CS Tapering Schedule as per Appendix E, completing the open -label phase and transitioning 
to the blinded phase of tapering depending on the CS dose at baseline (i.e., subjects starting on 
20mg/day will transition to the double -blind phase of tapering more quickly than patients starting on 
60mg/day).

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Open- label prednisone or prednisolone will be provided until the dose is tapered to less than 
20mg/day .  Subsequently, blinded CS therapy and/or matching CS PBO will be provided for the 
remaining blinded taper regimen.  While receiving blinded CS therapy, subjects will receive 1 carton 
containing 3 bottles of CS study drug per week and will be instructed t o take 1 capsule per bottle per 
day; the 3 capsules combined will be equivalent to the weekly dose according to the CS Tapering 
Schedule ( Appendix E).
Corticosteroid Escape Therapy during the Study
Subjects who require CS escape therapy for their GCA disease will be deemed non- responders in the 
primary analysis.  Any use of CS for escape therapy throughout the study will be documented in the 
eCRF.
Period 1:
At every visit, an assessment of subject's disease will be made to assess if the subject can adhere to the 
CS tapering schedule.  If subject has no flare of GCA and is able to follow the CS tapering schedule, the 
subject will continue receiving prot ocol -defined blinded or open label CS therapy in the study.
In Period 1, disease flare is defined as an event determined by [CONTACT_807037] ≥30 mm/hr (attributable to GCA), AND requir ing an 
increase in CS dose.
Subjects who experience disease flare or are unable to adhere to the protocol -defined CS tapering 
regimen during open -label tapering of prednisone (at doses of 60 mg/day to 20 mg/day) should stop the 
protocol -defined CS taper an d receive open -label escape therapy with prednisone or prednisolone at 
the discretion of the investigator.  Ongoing CS use and subsequent tapering will be at the discretion of 
the investigator.  While on open- label CS escape therapy, the subject should con tinue in the study for 
the full 52 weeks and receive blinded study drug (upadacitinib or PBO).  If, after [ADDRESS_1114212] with other 
available treatments, bli nded study drug (upadacitinib or PBO) and CS should be discontinued and the 
subject should be managed based on standard -of-care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which may include tocilizumab.  After 
discontinuation of study drug (upadacitinib or PBO and CS dispensed by [CONTACT_2728]) , CS will be prescribed 
by [CONTACT_807038]'s judgment and in accordance with local 
standard of care.  Medications prescribed by [CONTACT_807039].  Subject s who are discontinued from study drug during Period 1 should 
continue to follow the visit schedule for the remainder of Period 1 (Section 5.6).
Subjects who experience disease flare or are unable to adhere to the protocol -defined CS tapering 
regimen during the blinded protocol -defined CS taper should stop the protocol -defined CS taper and 
receive open -label escape therapy with prednisone or prednisol one starting with at least 20 mg/day at 
the discretion of the investigator.  Ongoing CS use and subsequent tapering will be at the discretion of 
the investigator.  While on open- label CS escape therapy, the subject should continue in the study for 
the full 52 weeks and receive blinded study drug (upadacitinib or PBO).  If, after [ADDRESS_1114213] with other 
available treatments, blinded study drug (upadacitinib o r PBO) and CS should be discontinued and the

standard of care.  Medications prescribed by [CONTACT_807039].  Subjects who are discontinued from stu dy drug during Period 1 should 
continue to follow the visit schedule for the remainder of Period 1 (Section 5.6).
Subjects who receive CS escape th erapy will be eligible to continue in Period 2 if meeting criteria for 
study continuation outlined in Section 4.1 .
Period 2
In Period 2, disease fl are is defined as an event determined by [CONTACT_807037] ≥30 mm/hr, AND requiring initiation of CS.  Subjects 
who experience disease flare in Period 2 (blinded extension phase) should receive an escape regimen of 
open -label prednisone or prednisolone at investigator's discretion.  Thereafter, open -label escape CS 
taper will be based on the investigator's judgment and in accordance with local standard -of-care.  At the 
investigator's dis cretion, these subjects may also discontinue study drug (upadacitinib or PBO and CS 
dispensed by [CONTACT_2728]) and receive treatment in accordance with local standard -of-care, which may 
include tocilizumab, and should continue to follow the visit schedule for t he remainder of Period 2 
(Section 5.6).  After discontinuation of study drug (upadacitinib or PBO and CS dispensed by [CONTACT_2728]), CS 
will be prescrib ed by [CONTACT_807038]'s judgment and in 
accordance with local standard of care.  Medications prescribed by [CONTACT_807040].
5.9 Randomization/Drug Assignment and Blinding
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_110990].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_110991].  Subjects may only be rescreen ed one time without prior [COMPANY_013] approval.  For additional 
re-screening, [COMPANY_013] TA MD approval is required.
All screening activities must be completed and reviewed prior to enrollment.  Subjects who meet the 
eligibility criteria will proceed to enrollment via the IRT system on Day 1 (Baseline Visit of Treatment 
Period 1).  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_807041].  
A subject number is assigned at screening via IRT.  Enrolled subjects will keep their screening number as 
their subject number throughout the study.
This study is designed to enroll 420 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without 
enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Subjects in screening 
will be permitted to enroll even if the target number of subjects has been enrolled.
Randomization of all subjects, except for those in Japan, will be strat ified by [CONTACT_807042] 
(prednisone or prednisolone > 30 mg or ≤ 30 mg), prior use of an IL -6 inhibitor, and whether entering 
the study with new onset or relapsing disease.  In Japan, the study will attempt to include a minimum of 
8 subjects; no stratifi cation will be utilized for randomization, however, data on all 3 stratification 
factors will be collected.  In Period 1, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (upadacitinib 15 mg +

regimen).
In Period 2, subjects from the Period [ADDRESS_1114214] 24 weeks 
prior to the Week 52 visit (at the end of Period 1) will be re -randomized to either continue on 
upadacitinib o r switch to PBO (Section 4.1); re-randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_807043] 
(new onset or relapsing disease).  Subjects from the P eriod [ADDRESS_1114215] 24 weeks prior to the Week 52 visit (at the end of Period 1) will continue to receive PBO.  In 
Period 2, subjects previously on upadacitinib will be re -randomized in a 2:1 ratio (upadacitinib [same 
dose as Period 1] or PBO).  Subjects who were assigned to PBO in Period [ADDRESS_1114216] and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team) will remain blinded to each subject's treatment 
until the last subject completes the Week [ADDRESS_1114217]'s treatment 
throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, upadacitinib tablets and matching PBO tablets as well as 
CS capsules and m atching PBO capsules provided for the study will be identical in appearance.  The IRT 
will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency.
In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the stu dy drug assignment, the 
investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_110992].  However, if an 
urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contact[CONTACT_110993], the investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without [COMPANY_013] 
notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, 
which is available only to the investigator.  If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by 
[CONTACT_110994] (preferred) or email 
([EMAIL_2197]).  For country -specific phone numbers, please see the following website:  
(http://www.endpointclinical.com/help -desk/).
In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD, we request that the 
[COMPANY_013] TA MD be notified within [ADDRESS_1114218] be conveyed to [COMPANY_013] and recorded on appropriate eCRF .
5.10 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, writt en instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  Protocol 
deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  If 
a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID -19 
pandemic), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable) 
and [COMPANY_013].  In Japan, the investigator will record all protocol deviations in the appropriate medical 
records at the site.

will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
thro ughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the surgery/ procedure has been

during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/p rocedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is 
to be reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of the 
site being made aware of the serious adverse event (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1114220] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807014]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outc omes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is con sidered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1114221] signs the

S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information) and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reacti ons (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.

Investigators will rate the severity of each AE according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, which can be accessed at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc.
If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be graded follows: 
Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Moderate (Grade 2) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)
Severe (Grade 3 –5)
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self- care ADL (self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden)
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
The investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to the study drugs upadacitinib (or matching 
placeb o) and prednisone/prednisolone (or matching placebo).  Summary of CS -related AEs will be based 
on this assessment.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility –After cons ideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as hav ing a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator ha s not 
reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_110966], another 
cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_20616] r for the SAE.

The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1114223] consists of safety monitoring 
(review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety issues by a safety data 
monitoring committee), and if applicable, interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical 
management and/or discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.  The management of specific AEs 
and laboratory parameters is described below. 
For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study partici pation and are on standard of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab) 
and any intolerability to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355243]. 
Serious Infectio ns:  Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of 
infection during and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject 
develops a serious infection.  A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug 
should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored.  
Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop 
active TB must be permanently discontinued from study drug. 
Herpes Zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_807015] s.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a 
gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment.  If the 
diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation (other than due to appendicitis or mechanical injury) is 
confirmed, the subject must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Major Cardiovascular Event:   For subjects who develop a major cardiovascular event (MACE:  acute 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident [stroke]) while on study drug, the investigator should

drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cerv ix must 
be permanently discontinued from study drug.  Information including histopathological results should be 
queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects 
who are at an increased risk for skin canc er.  Subjects who develop malignancies should be referred to 
appropriate specialists and managed as per standard of care.
Muscle- related symptoms:   If a subject experiences symptoms suggestive of myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis, consider checking CPK and aldola se with clinical management and/or study drug 
interruption as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and 
treated appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thr ombosis, pulmonary embolus or noncardiac, 
non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered 
clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, OR a confirmed 
absolute QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value > 500 msec. 
COVID -19:  Study drug should be interrupted in subjects with a confirmed diagn osis of COVID -19.  
Consider interrupting study drug in subjects who show signs and/or symptoms with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -

Investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment 
following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values 
are described in Table 3, and may require a supplemental eCRF to be completed.  For subjects with 
ongoing laboratory abnormalities which require data entry into an eCRF, an additional eCRF related to 
subsequent laboratory abnormalities is only required if the subject has relevant changes in history (e.g., 
new o nset signs or symptoms) or laboratory values which have returned to normal reference range or

 If a creatine phosphokinase (CPK) value is not available, a CPK should be 
drawn to exclude AST/ALT elevations related to muscle injury 
 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN along wi th new appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or new -onset 
eosinophilia.
 ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than [ADDRESS_1114226] > 8 × ULN, interrupt study drug immediately, repeat testing with a new 
sample, and if repeat test confirms result contact [CONTACT_176454]. 
 Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at 
screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by [CONTACT_372899] 1 week (based on init ial elevated value): 
 ALT > 5 × ULN OR
 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.
 A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the

An independent committee of physician experts in cardiovascular adjudication will be utilized to assess 
potential cardiovascular AEs in a blinded manner as defined by [CONTACT_807048].
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.[ADDRESS_1114230] completed Period 2 (Week 104). 
Statistical analys es will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  The 
statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be defined for Period 1 and Period 2.  The FAS population in Period 1
(FAS1) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Period 1.  The FAS 
population in Period 2 (FAS2) is defined as all subjects who achieve d remission for at least 24 
consecutive weeks prior to the Week 52 Visit (at the end of Period 1 ) and received at least 1 dose of 
study drug in Period 2.   In addition, an exploratory analysis set will be defined for Period 2 to include all 
subjects who did not meet these remission criteria (i.e ., achieve remission for at least 24 weeks prior to 
the Week 52 Visit) but continued in Period [ADDRESS_1114231] 1 dose of study drug in Period 2.  For the Safety

regardless of the randomized treatment.
7.3 Statistical Anal yses for Efficacy
Analysis of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints in Period 1
For the global analysis, the overall type I error rate of the primary and ranked key secondary endpoints 
for the 2 upadacitinib doses will be strongly controlled using a graphica l multiple testing procedure. 
Specifically, the testing will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary endpoint followed by [CONTACT_807049] 3.2and Section 3.3.The testing will start with 
the primary endpoint of 15mg QD with α = 0.05.  Continued te sting will follow a pre -specified α transfer 
path, which includes downstream transfer along the endpoint sequence within each dose as well as 
cross -dose transfer.  The testing of 7.[ADDRESS_1114232] 
prematurely discontinued from the study prior to Week 52.  For the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
upadacitinib groups will be compared with the PBO group using the Cochran -Mantel -Haens zel method 
adjusting for stratification factors.  The primary approach for handling missing data will be Non -
Responder Imputation incorporating multiple imputation (NRI -MI). Subjects with missing data will be 
counted as non -responders, except when missing at random can be reasonably assumed, which will be 
handled by [CONTACT_111012]. For example, missing due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1114233] Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) model with treatment group, 
visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and stratification factors as the fixed factors and the corresponding 
baseline values as the covariates.  TSQM, PGIC value will be analyzed using an MMRM model with 
treatment group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction and stratification factors as the fixed factors.  For 
cumulative CS dose, comparisons between the upadacitinib treatment group and the PBO group will be 
analyzed using a van Elteren test stratified by [CONTACT_81473].  The media n total cumulative 
prednisone dose over the 52 weeks for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% CI for the 
median will be presented.
For time -to-event endpoints, median time -to-event will be reported for each treatment group.  
Comparisons between t he upadacitinib group and the PBO group will be conducted using stratified log 
Page 51 of 155 
STUDY M16 -852  |  Version 7.0  |  EU CT 2023- 505476- 29-[ADDRESS_1114234]; additional analyses may be conducted using Cox's regression to include baseline values and 
stratification factors as covariates.
For count endpoints, comparisons betw een the upadacitinib treatment group and the PBO group will be 
carried out using Poisson regression model with treatment group and stratification factors as covariates, 
adjusting for exposure duration. 
Other Efficacy Variables
Additional efficacy variable s are listed in Section 3.3and will be summarized for Period 1 and 2.  For all 
the additional efficacy variables in Period 1, the summary statisti cs and the statistical method will be the 
same as the corresponding variables described in the primary and key secondary analyses.  For all the 
additional efficacy variables in Period 2, descriptive statistics will be provided for each treatment group 
sequ ence .  For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentage with 95% CI using normal approximation 
will be reported for each treatment group and 95% CI will be reported for treatment difference.  For 
continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, 95% CI, median, and range will be reported for 
each treatment group and 95% CI will be reported for treatment difference.  For time -to-event 
endpoints, median time -to-event will be reported for each treatment group.  For count endpoints, the 
exposure duration adju sted event rates will be reported for each treatment group.
Sample Size Estimation
The planned total sample size of 420 subjects with a 2:1:1 ratio (upadacitinib 15 mg QD: upadacitinib 
7.5mg QD: PBO QD) was determined to have at least 90% power to detect a 20% difference in sustained 
remission rate at Week 52 between the upadacitinib 15 mg arm and the PBO arm (assuming a response 
rate of 40% in the PBO arm), using Fisher's exact test, with an overall two -sided alpha = 0.05.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety analyses for Period 1 and Period 2 alone and long -term safety analyses for Period 1 and Period 2 
combined will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set in Period 1 (for safety analyses for Period 1 
alone and Periods 1 and 2 combined) as well as the Safety Analysis Set in Period 2 (for safety analyses 
for Period 2 alone) respectively, and will be based on treatments actually received regardless of the 
randomly assigned treatment.  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent adverse events (TEAE s), physical examination, laboratory 
assessments, ECG, and vital sign results.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_807050] (MedDRA) system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  In addition, summaries of SAEs and TEAEs by [CONTACT_807051].  SAEs, severe TEAEs, and 
TEAEs that lead to premature study discontinuation will be listed. Changes in vital signs, physical 
examination results, and clinical laboratory variables at each visit as compared to baseline will be 
summarized.  Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.
Missing safety data will not be imputed.

In addition to periodic review of safety data (Section 6.3), the DMC will conduct a futility analysis to 
assess lack of efficacy once the first 140 enrolled subjects complete 24 weeks of treatment 
(approximately 70 subjects in the 15 -mg active treatment arm; 35 subjects in the 7.5 -mg active 
treatment arm and 35 in the PBO arm).  A futility recommendation will be made when the futility 
criterion is met.  Further details will be provided in the DMC Charter.

visits may be needed).  HBV DNA PCR testing every [ADDRESS_1114248] has a history of HBV vaccine and HBs Ab+, HBc Ab –.
m. After the Baseline Visit, results of hsCRP (central laboratory) will be blinded to the Sponsor, the investigator, the subject , and study site personnel.  After the Screening Visit, 
results of ESR (local la boratory) will be blinded to the Sponsor, the investigator, the subject, and study site personnel with the exception of the l ocal Laboratory Assessor 
assigned at each study site (see Section 5.7for additional information).
n. Applies to Period [ADDRESS_1114249] 24 consecutive weeks prior to the Week 52 Visit (at the end of Period 1) will be re-randomized into Period 2.  Remission is defined 
as absence of GCA signs and symptoms AND adherence to the protocol -defined CS taper regimen or corticosteroid -free.  At Week 52, subjects who have absence of GCA signs 
and symptoms AND are CS -free at the Week 52 visit, but do n ot meet remission criteria (i.e., achieve remission for at least 24 consecutive weeks prior to the Week 52 Visit )will 
continue in Period [ADDRESS_1114250] or damaged.
q. Approximately 2 days prior to each visit with scheduled pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collection, site personnel will contact s ubjects as reminder to document dosing 
information on dosing diary and to bring completed dosing diary to the visit.  Additional details are provided in the Operati ons Manual.
Note 1. Visit window is ± 2 days for Period 1 (Week 2 through Week 52 Visit) and ± 2 days for Period 2 (Week 56 through Week 104 Visit).  Any of the procedures may be 
performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator.  
Note 2. Subjects who choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the study, should complete a Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) as 
soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule for the period fr om which they discontinue and adhere to all 
study proce dures except for dispensing study drug, or reviewing returns and accountability, dispensing/reviewing study drug instructions , dosing diaries, PK sample 
collection, and sample collection for exploratory research.  That is, subjects who discontinue study dr ug in Period 1 should complete the visits in Period 1, but not 
continue to Period 2.  Subjects who discontinue study drug in Period 2, should complete the visits in Period 2.  In addition, all future CS escape therapy and 
efficacy -driven discontinuation cr iteria no longer apply.

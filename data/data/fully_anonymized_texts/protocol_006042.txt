 B. Background and rationale  
VEDOLIZUMAB IN CROHN’S DISEASE: Crohn’s disease (CD) is characterized by a 
dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immunity responses.1 Vedolizumab is a novel 
therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds to the α 4β7 integrin which is expressed specifically 
by a subset of gastrointestinal-homing T lymphocytes.2 The binding of α 4β7integrin to mucosal 
addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) expressed on the surface of mucosal 
endothelial cells is a crucial component of the gut-selective homing mechanism for lymphocytes.  
It is currently approved for both induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission in 
moderate-severe CD who have failed at least one conventional therapy.3  
FACTORS IMPACTING CLINICAL USE OF VEDOLIZUMAB IN CROHN’S DISEASE: 
Small bowel CD has no durable surgical cure and, when moderate to severe, typi[INVESTIGATOR_272370]-term maintenance therapy.  Unfortunately, small bowel CD activity is poorly reflected by 
[CONTACT_272382].4,[ADDRESS_332840] it would be. Several reasons 
may underlie this.   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_272371]; however, the onset of benefit 
was less robust and slower than in UC.3,6 This slower onset, combined with the clinical challenge 
of determining disease response in Crohn’s has prompted some physicians to either avoid use or

IRB Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]:  11/7/2025  
 abandon vedolizumab as a therapy prematurely.  However, the trial had clinical disease activity 
indices as their primary endpoint. Clinical status and disease activity indices such as the CD 
Activity Index (CDAI) and the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) correlate poorly with objective 
markers of inflammation in the small bowel, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), endoscopy, or 
radiological disease activity parameters.5  The use of imprecise and flawed clinical disease activity 
endpoints may explain the GEMINI II trial data in the subset of patients with small bowel CD 
(Supplementary Figure 2 A and B) which has led some physicians to assume that the role for 
vedolizumab is predominately for UC and colonic CD and more limited in small bowel CD.3 
ENDOSCOPIC REMISSION WITH VEDOLIZUMAB IN CD: Recently the VICTORY 
consortium reported the rates of mucosal healing (MH) across 141 patients with moderately to 
severe CD cohort.7 In this cohort, 76.4% of the patients had either ileal or ileocolonic CD.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 121 out of the 141 individuals had mainly endoscopic follow-up.   
CROSS-SECTIONAL IMAGING AS A PREDICTOR OF VEDOLIZUMAB RESPONSE IN 
SMALL BOWEL CD: In population-based cohorts, up to one-third of patients with CD have 
evidence of bowel damage with stricturing or penetrating complications at diagnosis, findings 
which are underdiagnosed without the aid of cross-sectional imaging.[ADDRESS_332842] endoscopy (proximal small bowel or stricturing phenotype), and those

 CD patients with isolated intramural disease.4  Therefore, radiological response has emerged as 
an important non-invasive treatment target in small bowel CD, associated with decreased long-
term need for corticosteroid usage, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and surgery.10-12  Additionally, the EMBARK 
study has demonstrated that a combined scoring of disease activity using ileocolonoscopy (SES-
CD) and CTE correlated much better with biomarkers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin, IL-22, 
and serum matrix metalloproteinase-9) than ileocolonoscopy alone.13  Furthermore, a recent 
multicenter study (N = 214 CD patients) by [CONTACT_272383]ça Inflamatόria 
Intestinal compared outcomes with a target of transmural healing (TH) on MRE compared to 
MH on colonoscopy.14  At 12 months, TH compared to MH, showed lower rates of therapy 
escalation (15.2% vs 36.5%, p=0.03) and surgery (0% vs 11.5%, p=0.047), and longer times to 
therapy escalation and surgery (p=0.046 and p=0.045, respectively.  There is an unmet need for 
assessing objective response to vedolizumab in small bowel CD using cross-sectional 
imaging that reflects transmural healing compared to detection of MH with endoscopy . 
PREDICTORS OF REMISSION AND NON-RESPONSE TO VEDOLIZUMAB IN CROHN’S 
DISEASE: Finally, while objective and complete small bowel assessment of response to therapy 
is important, the ability to predict early who is likely to achieve response to vedolizumab at 6 and 
12 months is equally critical to optimize medical therapy within the ideal window of ‘early CD’.15  
In the VICTORY consortium a week 6 clinical remission was achieved in 10.9% with a median 
time to achieve a clinical remission of 25 weeks, though this increased to 18% at 6 months and 
35% at 12 months.7

week 26 clinical remission using clinical predictors.16  In this model, an elevated baseline CRP 
was incrementally associated with a reduction in the probability of achieving clinical remission in 
anti-TNF-naïve participants (OR 0.94 per mg/L increase; P-value < 0.05), but not anti-TNF-
exposed/failure participants (OR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.02). The model had limited performance 
in the validation cohort for Week 26 clinical remission (AUC 0.69), which was not significantly 
improved by [CONTACT_272384] (AUC 0.73). This suggests that a model 
incorporating only clinical predictors is not highly discriminatory for clinical remission. Hence, 
in small bowel CD, there is a knowledge gap in the ability to predict and assess 
response/remission. This unmet need may be addressed by [CONTACT_272385] .

the real-world usage of vedolizumab (VICTORY consortium).[ADDRESS_332848] shown promise with regards to identifying active disease and predicting response to anti-

SUMMARY: The overall goal of the study is to develop data that can convincingly guide 
clinicians on the use and efficacy of vedolizumab in patients with small bowel CD.  There is 
an unmet need to identify response to vedolizumab in small bowel CD using objective endpoints. 
Current data suggest that MR enterography may meet this unmet need. There is an additional 
unmet need to develop predictive models incorporating both clinical and baseline radiological and 
endoscopic variables with higher discriminatory performance in identifying longer term clinical 
remission with vedolizumab. Finally, this proposal is strengthened by [CONTACT_272387]. If successful, these serum biomarkers 
may guide a personalized approach to the treatment of small bowel CD with vedolizumab, 
allowing early identification of PNR, monitoring disease activity and the pharmacodynamics of 
vedolizumab.  
C. HYPOTHESIS  
We hypothesize that radiological response to vedolizumab will predict a reduction in need for 
corticosteroids, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or surgeries in small bowel CD. We also hypothesize that 
predictive models incorporating baseline radiological variables in addition to clinical variables will 
improve model performance in predicting remission with vedolizumab at 6 months.

IRB Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]:  11/7/[ADDRESS_332851] our central hypothesis by [CONTACT_172093]:   
Aim 1: To prospectively determine if  short term (4 months) radiological TR on MRE in 
small bowel CD patients starting vedolizumab predict clinically relevant outcomes at 12 
months; 
Aim 2: To prospectively determine if inflammatory severity defined by [CONTACT_272388] 4 months; 
Aim 3: To assess if quantitative or qualitative change in proteomic serum biomarkers 
(using SOMAscanTM assay) is a relevant surrogate biomarker for radiologic TR on MRE at 
4 months after starting vedolizumab.   
The work proposed in Aim 1 would establish radiological response as a treatment endpoint with 
vedolizumab for small bowel CD. The work proposed in Aim 2 would allow improved 
prediction of remission with vedolizumab in small bowel CD. The work proposed in Aim 3 
would allow the development of a serum biomarker that correlates with radiological response at 
4 months. After completion of the current study aims, the next step using this study cohort would 
be to compare radiological versus endoscopic response at week 52. Future directions would 
include validating the findings of this study by [CONTACT_272389] (based on markers of baseline inflammatory 
severity using MRE and cytokine burden) to achieve clinical and radiological response at 4 and

response (TR) at initial follow-up computed tomography enterography (CTE) or magnetic 
resonance enterography (MRE) in small bowel CD is associated with an improvement in relevant 
long-term outcomes.10  In this cohort of 150 small bowel CD patients who were longitudinal 
followed with serial CTE and/or MRE, radiological TR was examined as a decrease in 
radiological findings of inflammation, in up to five small bowel lesions per patient, over follow-
up CTE/MRE. In this study, 55 patients (37%) were complete radiologic responders, 39 partial 
(26%), and 56 non-responders (37%), at the 1st follow-up CTE/MRE.

Describe procedures for reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events.  
Definitions:   
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered 
a medicinal product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  
This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity 
or frequency since the administration of study drug. 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.    
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. This includes adverse reactions 
which arise from: use of a medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorization;

Amendment [ADDRESS_332876] IRB Approval: 11/8/2024 
IRB Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]:  11/7/2025  
 use outside the terms of the marketing authorization, including overdose, misuse, abuse and 
medication errors; and occupational exposure*. 
* This corresponds to the exposure to a medicinal product for human use as a result of one’s 
occupation, such as nurses who may handle products routinely in their occupational setting. 
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
1) results in death, 
2) is life-threatening , 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
3) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240298] , 
4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , 
5) leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
6) may require intervention to prevent one of 1)-5) above or may expose the patient to danger, even 
though the event is not immediately life-threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe 
in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The 
general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event

Amendment [ADDRESS_332877] IRB Approval: 11/8/2024 
IRB Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]:  11/7/2025  
 itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  
This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criterion 
described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or 
ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Events 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, 
she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue study drug.  The 
sponsor-investigator must fax a completed Pregnancy Form to the [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance or 
designee immediately.  The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy outcome (i.e., 
delivery, still birth, miscarriage) and [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance or designee will request this 
information from the sponsor-investigator. Please refer to study contract for [COMPANY_005] 
pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, the sponsor-investigator must also immediately fax a completed Pregnancy Form to 
the [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance or designee. Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy 
for the final pregnancy outcome. Please refer to study contract for [COMPANY_005] pharmacovigilance 
contact [CONTACT_3031].

IRB Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]:  11/7/2025  
 Serum protein concentration in AIM 3 will be as measured using SOMAscanTM at the certified 
Genome Technology Access Center (GTAC) microarray facility at Washington University using 
Agilent microarray readout.34  This will be drawn prior to initiation of therapy and at week 6. 
This proteomic platform has enabled the simultaneous measurement of a large number of 
proteins to identify biomarkers in lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory arthritis and 
inflammatory bowel disease.25-30,35   
The GTAC lab has been certified in SomaScanTM technology from the SomaLogics company. 
The SOMAscan assay quantitatively transforms the proteins present in a biological sample into a 
specific SOMAmer-based DNA signal. A SOMAmer-protein binding step is followed by a series 
of partitioning and wash steps that converts relative protein concentrations into measurable 
nucleic acid signals that are quantified using DNA detection technology, which for the 
SOMAscan Assay with 1,310 SOMAmer reagents is by [CONTACT_272396]. The assay offers exceptional dynamic range, quantifying proteins that span over 8 
logs in abundance (from femtomolar to micromolar) and excellent reproducibility (4.6% median 
%CV). Agilent SOMAScan slides will be processed through the Agilent scanner and image data 
will be extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software. Extracted initial raw signal intensity 
data will be uploaded onto the SOMAScan server for data QC and standardization. The final data 
set will include SOMAscan generated .adat file, a reformatted text file with standardized relative 
fluorescent unit (RFU) for ~1.3K proteins, SOMAscan Quality Statements (SQS) and basic 
differential expression. The technology has been well validated by [CONTACT_27225]-spec here at Washington 
University.

 Other laboratory tests 
Serum will be collected at all 5 time points with CRP, hematocrit (as part of CBC) and serum 
albumin prior to medication initiation, week 6, 4 months (16±2 weeks), prior to the 3rd 4 weekly 
cycle of vedolizumab after dose escalation in patients who failed to achieve clinical response 
(CDAI 100 point decrease) at week 14 and at 52 ± 4 weeks.   
F. Statistical plan 
Statistical analysis 
AIM 1: Response at 4 month MRE will be categorized as non-response versus response to 
biologic.  Association between response status at 4 month MRE and clinically relevant outcomes 
will be assessed at week 52 in logistic regression model adjusting for variables include gender, 
age at disease onset/disease duration, smoking status and presence of stricturing/fistulizing 
disease at baseline MRE.  Additional time-to clinically relevant outcomes after 6 month MRE 
depending on response status will be assessed using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting 
for prior mentioned variables 
AIM 2: Multivariate logistic regression analyses and backward model selection will be 
performed for baseline clinical, radiological (length of disease) and endoscopic variables (SES-
CD score) and variable interactions that are found to be significant (P < 0.05) on the initial 
univariate analyses. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) will be presented for predictors included in the 
model, with OR > 1 indicating an increased probability of achieving clinical remission at Week

 26. Discrimination performance of the model will be presented as area under the curve (AUC) 
from receiver operating characteristic curves. 
AIM 3: Normality of protein values will be determined by [CONTACT_272397][INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk normality tests. Statistical techniques will include Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
(comparing baseline to posttreatment values in the same individual), Mann-Whitney U test 
(comparing change in individual proteins in SOMAscanTM between the response categories at 
week 14 MRE), linear regression analysis (SOMA scanTM vs. CRP) and logistic regression 
analysis (change in levels of identified proteins in SOMAscanTM versus response categories, 
adjusting for patient and disease characteristics). Spearman rank correlation analysis will be 
applied to assess correlations. The alpha-level will be set at 0.05 for statistical significance.  
Bonferroni correction will be applied for multiple testing. 
Sample size analysis 
We estimate 37% of CD patients with complete, 26% partial and 37% non-response at 14 week 
MRE based on prior data.10  At a power of 80% and a type-1 error (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_332883] a 
hazards ratio of 2.5 or more, we estimate that 38 or more patients will transition from 
partial/non-response to complete response based on prior data. In a year, we expect 50% of the 
patients making such a transition. Hence, we plan to recruit at least [ADDRESS_332884] an HR of 2.0 assuming 50% transition 
within 1 year.

 Lesion Response Definition: 
Qualitative per-lesion analysis 
•       Improved lesion: Decrease in length of active segment or improvement in other morphological 
features listed below, without new internal penetrating disease. 
 Mural thickness of small bowel segment 
 Mural T2 signal  
 Perimural T2 signal  
 Qualitative or quantitative DWI analysis 
 Luminal ulceration 
 Stricture 
•       Worsened lesion: Increase in any of the above imaging parameters including new internal 
penetrating disease. 
•       Unchanged lesion:  Without worsening parameters of any of the above and not classified as an 
improved lesion. 
Per patient response definition  
• Response: All lesions improved. 
• Non-response: Existing lesion(s) worsened, new lesion was detected and all other scenarios not 
meeting definition of response.

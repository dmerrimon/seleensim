2. BACKGROUND  
  
2.1 Study Agent  
 
2.1.1 Natalizumab  
 
Natalizumab (Tysabri®, Biogen Inc.) is a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal 
antibody.  The human region of this product functions as IgG4, considered to be the least immune activating of the IgG immunoglobulins as it does not have high affinity to most Fc gamma receptors and does n ot activate complement.  Natalizumab is engineered by 
[CONTACT_641108] -determining regions of the murine antibody that 
binds to the α4 chain of α4β7 integrin, onto human IgG4 ( Rudick 2004).  Natalizumab is 
 
   
[ADDRESS_858056] the α4 subunit of 
α4 integrins.  One integrin, α4β1, is found on activated lymphocytes and helps bind 
lymphocytes to ligands such as vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM -1) in areas of 
inflammation.  Another integrin, α4β7, interacts with mucosal addressin-cell adhesion 
molecule and mediates homing of lymphocytes to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.    
 VCAM -1 is found in high concentrations in plaques found in multiple sclerosis (MS).  
Natalizumab as an inhibitor of the interaction between lymphocytes and VCAM- [ADDRESS_858057] mechanisms of action that are believed to occur in MS.  Firstly, natalizumab blocks the interaction between endothelial cells and extr acellular matrix proteins.  Secondly, it blocks the interaction of 
monocytes and microglial cells to ligands of α4β1 integrin  including osteopontin and 
VCAM -1.  Lastly, the blockade of the interaction of lymphocytes and extracellular matrix 
proteins is believed to induce apoptosis of these cells, further suppressing the immune activity at disease sites. ( Rudick 2004)  
 In the 1990s the idea that inhibition of α4β1 integrin could modulate inflammatory diseases was tested in animal models.  Anti -α4β1 integrin was found to prevent 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model that resembles MS (Yednock 1992).  Further animal models indicated that molecules directed against α4β1 
integrin  decreased MRI lesions in experimental autoimmune encephalomyel itis (Kent 
1995 – 2 articles ). 
 In a phase I study of 28 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS, natalizumab was found to be safe and effective ( Sheremata 1999).  A 
phase II trial was conducted comparing placebo, 3.0mg/kg and 6.0mg/kg of natalizumab in RRMS or secondary progressive MS ( Miller 2003 ).  Marked reductions in both relapse 
rates and number of new or enlarging lesions were seen with both doses when com pared 
to placebo at [ADDRESS_858058] led to the approva l of this medication for the treatment of RRMS by [CONTACT_86959].  In 2006, Rudick et al. reported the results of a large randomized study comparing interferon beta-1a with and without the addition of natalizumab  (Rudick 2006).  Combination therapy proved to decrease the annual rate of 
relapse over a two -year period (0.34 vs. 0.75, P<0.001).  The second randomized trial 
was the AFFIRM study by [CONTACT_641109]., which randomized patients to receive natalizumab versus placebo for RR MS (Polman 2006).  Again a significant reduction in 
rate of relapse at one year (by 83% with natalizumab) was observed as well as a significant decrease in the number of new or enlarging T2 hyperdense lesions on MRI.   α4β7 is increased in disease sites of inflammator y bowel disease, providing another 
potential target for n atalizumab.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_641098] a single dose of 
natalizumab could induce remission and significantly improve disease activity in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis ( Gordon 2001 and 2002).  Large randomized data from 
 
   
[ADDRESS_858059] further shown a benefit to natalizumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg when compared 
to placebo ( Ghosh 2003 ) in Crohn’s disease.  In this study, at 6 weeks, 71% of patients 
who received 2 infusions of 3mg/kg had response as compared to 38% who received placebo alone.  This significant benefit with natalizumab was sustained at [ADDRESS_858060] clinical trials demonstrated no significant early benefit to natalizumab in patients with Crohn’s disease, it did provide some benefit to maintaining response in patients treated with ongoing monthly infusions if they had an initial response ( Sandborn 2005).   
 2.1.2 Treatment -related Effects of Natalizumab  
 Natalizumab is generally safe, causing only occasional h ypersensitivity reactions. 
(Polman 2006)  The five level dose escalation study by [CONTACT_641110]. showed very 
minimal adverse events, almost all of which were reported at the 3.0mg/kg dose.  Of the 
six patients receiving the 3.0mg/kg dose, one experienced headache, two experienced nausea and one had shakiness.  One patient receiving 1.0mg/kg reported urticaria.  Serum natalizumab concentrations rapi[INVESTIGATOR_641099] 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3mg/kg, but were detectable for one week when 0.3mg/kg was administered.  In contrast, patients receiving 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg had detectable concentrations for 3 to 8 weeks.  Of note anti-idiotypic antibodies were identified in 3 patients who received the 3.0mg/kg dose and persisted for [ADDRESS_858061] concerning toxicity observed with natalizumab remains progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic brain infection caused by [CONTACT_641111].  After the incidence of 0.3% was reported by [CONTACT_641112] ( Rudick 2006 ), natalizumab 
was removed from the market voluntarily in 2005.  At that time, a large retrospective review of patients who had received natalizumab was embarked up on to determine the 
overall incidence of PML in a larger cohort of patients ( Bloomgren 2012).  Two hundred 
and twelve cases of PML were identified amongst 99,571 patients treated with natalizumab (2.1 cases per 1000 patients).  The lowest dose of natalizum ab that has been 
associated with PML is 8 doses, indicating that long -term administration is the major risk 
attributable to developi[INVESTIGATOR_156299].  Other risk factors associated with the development of PML included positive anti-JC virus antibodies prior to treatment and the use of immunosuppressants prior to natalizumab administration. 
 
2.2 Study Disease  – Acute GVHD  
 
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is caused by [CONTACT_641113] a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation  (Ferrara 1991).  The condition occurs in 30 to 50% of 
patients receiving HLA matched transplant s from a related donor and in 50 to 70% of those 
receiving transplants from an  unrelated donor ( Johnston 2008).  Classically, acute GVHD 
occurs during the first few months after transplant and usually involves the skin, liver, and intestinal tract, although other organs can also be involved ( Deeg 2006) .  The affected host 
organs are already compromised by [CONTACT_641114].  This injury which allows for the entry of microbial agents as well as the subsequent cytokine 
 
   
7 activation is thought to be the initial trigger for acute GVHD.  This consequently leads to the 
recruitment and activation of alloreactive naïve donor T cells in secondary lymphoid tissue (Goker 2001 ).  Target organ damage is subsequently mediated by [CONTACT_641115] T cells, which migrate to extralym phoid target sites, as well as the 
actions of local cytokines.  Acute GVHD involving the gastrointestinal system usually manifests as anorexia, nausea, 
and voluminous diarrhea (>500ml/day) which can be hemorrhagic.  These symptoms are also seen in other post -transplant complications including toxicity from conditioning, medications 
and infections.  This can make the diagnosis of acute GVHD of the gut difficult for the clinician.  Although other organs can be affected by [CONTACT_641116], the role of the 
gastroint estinal system is unique in that damage to this system appears to further propagate 
acute GVHD.  The loss of an intact gastrointestinal tract during transplant not only allows for 
local invasion of microbial agents, but also disrupts the normal gut flora.  This subsequently leads to the production of lipopolysaccharide, a potent stimulator of TNFα, IL-1 and IL-12 (Hill 2000).  This therefore allows for the further activation of cytokines which leads to 
progression of acute GVHD.      The mainstay of acute G VHD treatment remains corticosteroid therapy.  The starting dose is 
usually 1-2mg/kg daily of prednisone or the equivalent and is continued for 1-2 weeks prior to a steroid taper.  The response rate to single-agent steroid therapy when analyzed in large retrospective reviews is approximately 50% ( MacMillan 2002, Martin 1990).  Unfortunately, 
even with an initial response to steroids, the durability of this response remains low at 24% and 40% for matched unrelated and related donor transplantation, respectively ( Roy 1992, 
Weisdorf 1990).   
 
The suboptimal results observed historically with steroids alone as treatment of acute GVHD warrants the study of other compounds which may provide more benefit than steroids alone.  Monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_641100]3, IL-[ADDRESS_858062] been used in conjunction with steroids to try to improve the response rates and length of response ( Goker 
2001, Arai 2000, Bruner 2003, Tanaka 2000, Couriel 2009).  The main drawback to these treatments remains the same, the broad immunosuppression leads to both secondary infectious complications as well as disease progression.  The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network completed a multi- center  randomized, four- arm, phase II trial  
designed to identify the most promising  agent for combination with steroids as initial therapy 
for the treatment of GVHD  (Alousi 2009).  Day 28 complete response rates were 26% with 
etanercept, 60% with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 53% with denileukin diftitox , and 38% 
with pentostatin.   Overall survival at [ADDRESS_858063] with MMF (64%).  
Unfortunately in phase III study of MMF versus placebo for the treatment of acute GVHD, 
there was no difference in GVHD free sur vival at 8 weeks, incidence of infection or overall 
survival at 6 months.  ( Logan 2013)   
 Multiple prospective and retrospective studies have been done adding agents like those described above to treat acute GVHD.  As reported by [CONTACT_641117], none of these results have been robust enough to show that combination first line therapy is better than steroids alone ( Martin 
 
   
8 2012).  For this reason, further investigation into new agents is needed to improve the 
response rates of acute GVHD to first line treatment.  Targeting α4β7 integrin  for acute 
GVHD is a novel approach which may be effective and yield less overall immune suppression. 
  
2.[ADDRESS_858064] antigens.  This is 
mediated by [CONTACT_641118] T cells and antigen presenting cells  (APCs).   
Multiple adhesion molecules, including intercellular molecule 1 (ICAM -1), lymphocyte 
function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), 
have been identified in the activation of T cells by [CONTACT_85804] ( Kobayashi 2000).
  Once donor T 
lymphocytes interact with APCs, they differentiate into effector and memory T cells that target vari ous organs implicated in acute GVHD.  It is now recognized that the development 
of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes occurs in secondary lymphoid tissue, most notably in gut-associated secondary lymphoid tissue (GALT) which includes the Peyer’s patches of the small intestine ( Murai 2003), mesenteric lymph nodes and the appendix.  This further 
explains why the gastrointestinal tract acts not only as a target site but a vital amplifier of GVHD.   
 Once activated in GALT, T cells recirculate in the bloodstream and  home to specific organs 
based on specific adhesion molecules expressed on the T cell.  Molecules expressed on T cells that lead to lymphocyte trafficking back to the gastrointestinal tract include L-selectin 
(Dutt 2005), MAdCAM -1 (Ueha 2007) and LPAM (α4ß7 integrin) ( Petrovic 2004).  T cells 
that home to the intestine have been shown in mouse models to induce crypt loss, loss of mucin -containing goblet cells within the crypts, increased apoptosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_641101], and a severe infiltr ate of inflammatory cells between the crypt walls and in the 
lamina propria. ( Dutt 2005)  This results in loss of the normal architecture of the intestine, 
which leads to severe symptoms of gastrointestinal GVHD, including prolonged diarrhea and gut dysfunction.  These adhesion molecules represent a new target for both treatment and monitoring of acute GVHD.    We have previously analyzed by [CONTACT_641119] α4ß7 integrin on lymphocytes from 59 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] a nd found α4β7 integrin 
to be significantly up-regulated on both naïve and memory T cell subsets in patients who subsequently developed intestinal aGVHD compared with those who developed primarily cutaneous aGVHD or did not develop aGVHD ( Chen 2009 and 2013).  These preliminary 
studies demonstrate that α4ß7 integrin can act as a potential target to decrease GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract while maintaining the beneficial graft versus tumour effect.  
  
2.[ADDRESS_858065] chance of preventing crypt necrosis by [CONTACT_641120] T cells to the gut as early as possible.  
 It is hoped that given its specific targeting of α4β7 integrin, natalizumab  can be successful in 
treating acute GVHD, yet be less globally immunosuppressive, the main concern with current available treatments of acute GVHD.  Retinoic acid, known to increase the expression of α4β7 integrin, has been shown to increase the homing of T cells to the gut, worsening acute GVHD of the gut. In this mouse model, retinoic acid did not demonstrate an upregulation of T cells to the spleen, liver, and lung.  This suggests that inhibiting the α4β7 integrin by 
[CONTACT_641121] a specific targeted treatment of gut GVHD, without impacting other 
organ systems. ( Chen 2013) 
 Treatments for acute GVHD are not only immunoscuppressive, but also impair the graft versus tumor effect that is desired from donor T cells targeting m alignant cells in the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Ceacam1, an adhesion molecule found on donor T cells, is thought to control the proliferation, activation and trafficking of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of GVHD, partially mediated through α4β7 integrin.  Absence of Ceacam1 leads to increased rates of gut GVHD while maintaining the desired graft versus tumor effect. ( Lu 2011)  The absence 
of α4β7 integrin on hematologic malignancies provides natalizumab with the unique ability 
to abrogate gut GVHD without effecting th e graft versus tumor effect.   
 There have been studies as outlined above that have examined the maximal tolerated and efficacious doses of natalizumab in treating patients with autoimmune diseases including MS and Crohn’s disease.  In this phase II study, we plan to use much lower doses of natalizumab to determine if there is a possible treatment effect on acute gastrointestinal GVHD.  
 
2.5 Rationale for proposed starting doses and regimen chosen 
The planned treatment for patients presenting with acute GVHD wit h GI involvement will be 
steroids with natalizumab.  In a phase I study of natalizumab, doses of 0.03 and 0.1mg/kg resulted in drug levels that were undetectable after completion of the infusion. ( Sheramata 
1999)  The estimated half life of the 3.0mg/kg do se in this study was 4 -5 days.  Approximately 
90% of patients will achieve over 80% saturation of α4 receptors after receiving a dose of 3.0mg/kg or higher.  Receptor saturation is maintained for 3- 4 weeks with the 3.0mg/kg 
dose.( Rudick 2004 )   Standard mo nthly dosing of 300mg IV has been successfully used in 
patients with MS and Crohn’s disease.   
The treatment of acute GVHD, unlike MS or Crohn’s disease, is an acute process that should require short courses of treatment to demonstrate a response.  An initial standard dose of 300mg IV will be used at confirmation of acute gut GVHD.  If at 4 weeks, there has been a response, but it is less than a complete response, patients can be treated with a second dose of 
 
   
10 300mg IV of natalizumab if he/she did not have a  positive JC viral load or any toxicity to the 
first dose of natalizumab.  If patients have no response  or progression after one dose, they will 
not be given a second dose.  Patients who receive a second dose of natalizumab will be 
evaluated for GVHD -free survival and response  at day [ADDRESS_858066] meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to participate in the study:  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_858067] as defined by [CONTACT_641122], requiring systemic treatment.  
Minimum criteria for GI GVHD includes diarrhea of greater than 500 mL/day.   
Biopsy of the GI tract is required for study entry and must confirm the diagnosis of acute GVHD.  Stool samples to rule out infectious causes of diarrhea, including norovirus, Clostridium difficile and other clinically indicated infections must also be negative.  Eligibility includes:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Acute GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_641102] (HSCT) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical cord blood.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16483]- myeloablative, reduced 
intensity and myeloablative transplant s are eligible.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who develop acute GVHD after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) are eligible.  
[IP_ADDRESS] There is no specified time window after day 0 of transplant as acute GVHD is only defined by [CONTACT_641123].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have experienced neutrophil engraftment after HSCT as defined by [CONTACT_641124] ≥ 500 / µL × 3 consecutive measurements.  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be calculated using the standard formula (Neut + Bands)(WBC × 10

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
   
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registration must 
occur prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol 
before treatment begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 
 
   
[ADDRESS_858069].  
  
Following registration, participants may begin protocol treatment. Issues that 
would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If 
a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s 
protocol status must be changed. Notify the QACT Registrar of participant status

5. TREATMENT PLAN   
  
Treatment will be administered on an inpatient and outpatient basis depending on the participant’s clinical condition. Expected toxicities and potential risks as well as dose modifications for natalizumab are described in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modification). No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_345863]’s acute graft 
versus host disease (GVHD). 
 
5.1 Pre-treatment Criteria  
 
5.1.1 For all  cycles of natalizumab:  
• ANC ≥ 500 / µL (G-CSF support is allowed) 
• Platelets ≥ 10,000 / µL (platelet transfusions are allowed on the same day) 
 
5.2 Agent Administration   
 
5.2.1 Natalizumab  
 
• Administration - Natalizumab at a dose of 300 mg should be in fused in 100 mL 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP over approximately one hour.  After the infusion is complete, flush with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 
• Dosing and Dosing schedule – Patients enrolled in the trial will receive 300mg of 
natalizumab  as described above in administration of the drug.  For patients who 
have a less than complete response after the first dose of natalizumab, a second dose of 300mg will be administered in the same fashion as the first dose.  If 
however a patient  has a complete response, no response , or progression of 
aGVHD, experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction, or ha s a grade [ADDRESS_858072] dose is given. 
• Drug, Tubing and Filtration – N o special IV tubing or filtration is required . 
 
• Hydrations – No hydration is required. 
 
• Special Equipment – Standard IV infusion pump is required. 
 
• Observation – Participants will be observed for [ADDRESS_858073] infusion, observation for one hour is required for 
the second infusion. 
 
• Vital signs – Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862]) should be monitored approximately every 10 minutes during the infusion of natalizumab.  
 
• Infusion reactions – participants will be monitored closely for possible infusion-
related reactions from the administration of natalizumab.  Symptoms include 
lightheadedness, fever, rash, sweats, sensation of throat closing, shortness of breath, throat/lip swelling, headache, and pruritis.  If an infusion- related reaction 
is suspected, the infusion should be immediately stopped and treatment with supportive measures such as intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and diphenhydramine should be given at the discretion of the investigator.    Patients 
who experience a serious hypersensitivity reaction should not be re- treated with 
natalizumab . 
 
5.3 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
N/A 
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive  Care Guidelines  
 
There are no recommended anti -emetics or other pre-medications or IV hydration 
recommended with administration of natalizumab.  Routine use of growth factor (G-CSF) support in the absence of documented neutropenia is not recommended.  Transfusional support will be given per institutional practice.  Anti- infective 
prophylaxis direct ed towards: CMV, gram positive (encapsulated bacteria), 
pneumocystis jirovicii, and fungal infections will be given per standard institutional practice.   
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. Patients will receive a maximum of two doses of natalizumab (see section 5.2.1 on dosing and dosing schedule for eligibility requirements for a second dose of natalizumab) .   
 
5.[ADDRESS_858074] to follow -up, death or participant withdrawal occurs (whichever 
comes first).  The reason for study removal and the date the participant was removed must be documented in the study specific case report form (CRF).   
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators 
must immediately notify the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_501834] telephone # [PHONE_13334]).  
 
6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. Toxicity 
assessments will be done using the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is identified and located on the CTEP we bsite at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  
 In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti -emetics, 
anti-diarrheals, etc.).  
 All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_641125], through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_221824].  
  
6.[ADDRESS_858075] been 
observed in patients receiving natalizumab , including  serious systemic reactions ( ex. 
anaphylaxis) which occurred at an incidence of <1%.   These  reactions usually occur 
within two hours of the start of the infusion. Symptoms associated with these reactions can include urticaria, dizziness, fever, rash, rigors, pruritus, nausea, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, and chest pain. Generally, these reacti ons are associated with 
antibodies to natalizumab.  If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of natalizumab and initiate appropriate therapy. Patients who experience 
a serious hypersensitivity reaction should not be re -treated with  natalizumab .  
 Immunosuppression / Infection  
 
   
[ADDRESS_858076] infections (including serious cases), gastroenteritis, vaginal infections, tooth infections, tonsillitis, and herpes infections, occurred more often in natalizumab treated patients than in  placebo -treated patients .  One opportunistic infection, 
cryptosporidial gastroenteritis with a prolonged course, was observed in a patient who received natalizumab. In Crohn’s disease studies, opportunistic infections (pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia, pulmonary mycobacterium avium intracellulare, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and burkholderia cepacia) have been observed in <1% of natalizumab treated patients; some of these patients were receiving concurrent immunosuppressants .  
Patients being treated in s tudy will receive infection prophylaxis as per standard 
institutional guidelines.   
 
Hepatotoxicity 
Clinically significant liver injury has been reported in patients treated with natalizumab in 
the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including ma rkedly elevated serum  
hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, occurred as early as six days after the first 
dose; signs of liver injury have also been reported for the first time after multiple doses. In some patients, liver injury recurred upon rechallenge, providing evidence that natalizumab caused the injury. If significant liver injury is observed after the first dose of 
natalizumab, a second dose will not be administered. 
 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
As previously outlined, the most concerning toxicity observed with natalizumab remains PML, an opportunistic brain infection caused by [CONTACT_641111].  In a large retrospective 
analysis, [ADDRESS_858077] 99,571 patients treated with natal izumab (2.1 cases per 1000 patients) ( Bloomgren 2012).  The lowest dose of 
natalizumab that has been associated with PML is 8 doses, indicating that long- term 
administration is the major risk attributable to developi[INVESTIGATOR_156299].  Although PML is not expected to  occur in this study, if a case is reported, the study will be immediately halted.  
 
6.2 Dose Modifications/Delays 
  
As most patients in this study will receive a single dose of natalizumab, dose reduction or delay are not applicable.  If a patient experiences any grade [ADDRESS_858078] 
dose of natalizumab or has a positive JC viral load, he/she will not be considered eligible for a second dose.   
7. DRUG FORMULATION AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
7.1 Natalizumab 
 
7.1.1 Description  
 
Natalizumab  is a recombinant humanized IgG4k monoclonal antibody produced in 
murine myeloma cells.  Natalizumab contains human framework regions and the  
 
   
17 complementarity -determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to a4-
integrin.  The  molecular weight of natal izumab is 149 kilodaltons.   
 
In patients with MS, following the repeat intravenous administration of a 300 mg dose of natalizumab , the mean ± SD maximum observed serum concentration 
was 110  ± 52 mcg/mL.  Mean average steady -state trough concentrations ranged 
from 23 mcg/mL to 29 mcg/mL. The  observed time to steady -state was 
approximately 24 weeks after every four weeks of dosing. The mean  ± SD half -
life, volume of distribution, and clearance of natalizumab were 11 ± 4 days,  
5.7 ± 1.9 L, and 16 ± 5 mL/hour, respectively.  
  The effects of total body weight, age, gender, race, selected hematology and serum chemistry measures, co -administered medications (infliximab, 
immunosuppressants, or steroids), and the p resence of anti -natalizumab 
antibodies were investigated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis (n=1156). The presence of anti -natalizumab antibodies was observed to increase 
natalizumab clearance.   Pharmacokinetics of natalizumab in patients with renal 
or hepatic insufficiency have not been studied . 
 
7.1.2 Form  
 
Natalizumab  is supplied as a sterile, colorless, and clear to slightly opalescent 
concentrate for intravenous (IV) infusion.  Each 15 mL dose contains 300 mg natalizumab; 123 mg sodium chloride, USP; 17.0 mg sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate, USP; 7.24 mg sodium phosphate, dibasic, heptahydrate, USP; 3.0 mg polysorbate 80, USP/NF, in water for injection, USP at pH 6.1. 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_858079] be refrigerated between 2 -8°C (36°-46°F) or 
stored according to instructions in the Package Inset.  Do not use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_16507].  DO NOT SHAKE OR FREEZE.  Protect from light.   If not used immediately, store the Natalizumab 
solution for infusion at 2-8°C (36°-46°F).  Natalizumab solution for infusion must 
be administered within 8 hours of preparation.   
7.1.4 Compatibility

7.2 Steroids  
 
   
19  
Commercial supplies of Methylp rednisolone (or equivalent steroid) will be utilized. The 
formulation, preparation and route of administration will be as per package insert. 
 
7.2.1 Administration  
 
The suggested initial choice and dosing of steroid is methylprednisolone at 2 
mg/kg daily.  If methylprednisolone is not used, any steroid, in oral or parenteral 
formulation , can be administered in equivalent dosing to methylprednisolone.  For 
oral doses of steroids, the dose can be rounded to the nearest available tablet strength. Dosing and dose reductions when response is achieved will be at the discretion of the investigator.  A suggested taper is 10-25% every 1- 2 weeks.  
 
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
Patients who are treated on this tr ial will have baseline and serial post -treatment peripheral 
blood samples collected and banked.  Peripheral blood samples will be collected on the day of natalizumab infusion, but prior to starting the infusion (day of infusion will be day 0).  Further per ipheral blood samples will be collected at day 7, day 14, day 21, day 28, day 56, 
day 100, day 180 and one year after administration of natalizumab.  The day 0 peripheral 
blood sample should be collected within 24 hours prior to the  start of the Natalizuma b 
infusion.  The correlative data that will be analyzed in these samples will be  α4 receptor 
saturation and pharmacokinetic studies at one week intervals after treatment.  Levels of α4  
receptor saturation will be correlated with aGVHD and clinical treatmen t responses.  
Aliquots of such samples will also be banked for future correlative studies. 
All peripheral blood samples collected for correlative studies will be collected  in EDTA 
tubes, with a blood volume of approximately 10 mL.  At the time of collection, cells will be 
cryopreserved in FBS + 10% DMSO at –180°C and will be stored in the Pasquarello tissue 
bank.  Mononuclear cells w ill be isolated by [CONTACT_309459]. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells will be washed before analysis by [CONTACT_4133] .  Flow cytometry will 
include a panel of T cell markers and α4β7 integrin.  Pharmacokinetic studies will be 
performed using ELISA with an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody specific for natalizumab 
as the capture anti body. 
9. STUDY CALENDAR  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 -week prior to start of protocol therapy.  
In the event that the participant's condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within [ADDRESS_858082] be performed prior to administration of any study medication. All study assessments and medications should be administered within +
 [ADDRESS_858083] dose.  If however a patient has a complete response, no response, or progression of aGVHD,  experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction, or has a grade 3 or higher toxicity, 
then a second dose of natalizumab will not be administered.

11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of natalizumab.  All grade  [ADDRESS_858093] results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnosti c tests.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
   
23  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen  
• Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admiss ion 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
11.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected
 when it appears in the current 
 
   
[ADDRESS_858094], the Investigato r’s Brochure, the package insert or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agent(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  Although not explicitly stated as adverse events from the study agent, grade [ADDRESS_858095] udy. 
11.1.4  Attribution  
 Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.[ADDRESS_858096] or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms.  
 The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_858097] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  
 
 
   
25 11.3 Reporting Requirements  
 
For multi- site trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the prin cipal 
investigator, each participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_102841]/HCC. The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
 
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events to the study sponsor and/or others as described below.    
11.[ADDRESS_858098] be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.1.2, as well as the following:  
• Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are 
unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related/associated with the intervention. 
Note:  Grade 2 or Grade 3 lab abnormalities that are considered by [CONTACT_641128], or adjustment in prior therapy, do not need to be reported.  
• All Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling) Events – Unless expected AND 
specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting.   Grade 4 
evens previously mentioned that do not require reporting include rash, 
diarrhea and increase bilirubin. 
 
• All Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_858099] study intervention.  
 
• All positive JC viral loads need to be reported regardless of PCR level 
reported . 
 
Note : If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time 
of continuing review.  
 
 
   
[ADDRESS_858100] report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC 
Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the eve nt within [ADDRESS_858101] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_756], email or facsimile to:  
 
  Corey Cutler, MD , MPH 
[PHONE_13334] (Phone) 
[PHONE_13338] (Fax)  
Email: [EMAIL_12217]   
 
Within the following 24-[ADDRESS_858102] provide follow-up information on the serious adverse event. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was 
treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participation.  
11.4.2  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 Non-serious adverse events will be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal 
Investi gator on the toxicity Case Report Forms.   
11.[ADDRESS_858103] (IRB) 
 Investigative sites within DF/HCC will report all serious adverse events directly to the DFCI Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS).  
11.6 Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
 
 The DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator, as holder of the IND, will be responsible 
for all communication with the FDA. [CONTACT_501834], the principal investigator, currently holds the IND for natalizumab (#121195).  The DF/HC C Overall Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_57895], regardless of the site of occurrence, any adverse event that is serious, unexpected and
 reasonably related (i.e., possible, probable, 
definite) to the study treatment.

31 14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
This is a  phase II trial to determine the GVHD free survival rate at day [ADDRESS_858111] dose 
of Natalizumab  (Tysabri®) is administered plus steroids  for initial therapy of GI acute 
GVHD. The initial treatment will be one dose of 300mg IV.  Patients can be treated with a 
second dose of natalizumab at 28 days if they are deemed eligible (see section 5.2.1 for 
eligibility requirements for a second dose of natalizumab).  The primary endpoint is GVHD free survival rate at day [ADDRESS_858112] treatment dose.   Secondary endpoints are outlined in 
section 1.3 (under secondary objectives).   
 For the assessment of the primary endpoint, we employ  a two -stage design with early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641104].  The mainstay of acute GVHD treatment 
remains corticosteroid therapy. The response rate to single -agent steroid therapy when 
analyzed in large retrospective reviews was approximately 50% ( MacMillan 2002, Martin 
1990). The response rate to GI aGVHD was similar to the overall response rate. Unfortunately, even with an initial response to steroids, the durability of this response remains low at 24% and 40% for matched unrelated and related donor transplantation, respectively ( Roy 1992, Weisdorf 1990).   Based on this information and extrapolating our 
internal data, we consider Natalizumab  efficacious if the GVHD free survival rate at day [ADDRESS_858113] dose of Natalizumab is administered is 50% or higher and inefficacious if the 
rate is 30% or lower.  
 The target accrual goal is [ADDRESS_858114] dose of Natalizumab is administered is 13 or more, then this agent will be  regarded as effica cious for 
the treatment of  GI acute GVHD. Conversely, if the total number of GVHD free survival is 
12 or fewer, then this agent will be regarded as f utile.  
 With this design, if the true but unknown GVHD free survival rate is 30%, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641105] 0.52, but 0.06 if the true but unknown rate is 50%. The overall power is 0.80 with a type I error rate 0.08. Table 1 below presents the operating 
characteristics of this design.  
Table 1. Operating Characteristics  
  True but unknown GVHD -free rate at day 56 of 
treatment  
  0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 
Futility after Stage 1  0.52 0.35 0.22 0.12 0.06 
 
   
32 Overall Power  0.08 0.21 0.41 0.62 0.80 
Expected sample size  22.3 24.7 26.7 28.2 29.1 
14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Based on our data in the past 3 years, approximately 6% of patients developed grade 
2-4 gastrointestinal acute GVHD after allogeneic  stem cell transplantation. 
Considering about 250 patients are transplanted per year at this institute  and assuming 
about 50% capture rate , we project that the accru al rate will be approximately 7.[ADDRESS_858115] stage of accrual. 
If non- DFCI center s enroll patients, the accrual will complete sooner.      
14.3 Stratification Factors  
None  
14.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary endpoints are outlined in section 1.3 (under secondary objectives).  Proportions will be reported descriptively. Overall survival (OS) and GVHD- free 
survival will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relapse and non- relapse 
mortality will be assessed in the competing risks framework. If there is enough number of events, we will also explore regression models for OS and GVHD- free 
survival and relapse although the number of covariates included in the model will be limited .  As to the analysis of correlative studies, peripheral blood samples will be 
collected at day 0, day 7, day 14, day 21, day 28, day 56, day 100, day [ADDRESS_858116]. If appropriate, change over 
time will be examined in repeated measures analysis. Due to the exploratory nature, multiple comparisons will not be considered. In particular, we will confirm whether the expression of α4ß7 integrin is  up-regulated in patients with GI aGVHD prior to the 
development of GI a GVHDand assess whether natalizumab reduces the expression 
level of α4ß7 integrin and whether the level is associated with GVHD- free survival.  
14.5 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
Adverse events will be monitored closely. The monitoring guidelines will serve as a trigger for consultation with the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DF/HCC DSMC) for additional review, and are not regarded as formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641106]. In 
the previous studies reported in the literature, natalizumab is generally safe and causing only minimal adverse events (see Section 2.1.2). Based on this information, natalizumab -related grade 4 or higher toxicities is projected to be <10%. If in the first 
10 patients, we observe 2 or more patients with non-hematologic CTCAE grade 4 or 
 
   
33 higher that  are possibly/probably/definitely attributable to natalizumab, further accrual 
and administration of natalizumab will be halted pending review by [CONTACT_6802]. 
Depending on the findings of its review, the DSMC may recommend the permanent closure of enrollment of that arm or continuation of enrollment.  In addition, if a case 
of PML is reported, the study (both accrual and drug administration) will be immediately halted.  Patients  who developed a positive JC viral load or who have a ny 
toxicity to the first dose of natalizumab will not be eligible for a second dose of 
natalizumab.  
 With this design, the probability of halting enrollment is 0.09 if the true but unknown rate of grade 4 or higher non- hematologic toxicity that are attributable to natalizumab 
is 5%, 0.26 if the rate is 10%, and 0.85 if the true rate is 30%.   
15. PUBLICATION PLAN  
The results of this trial will be made public within [ADDRESS_858117] that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes, to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, will be made public no later than three (3) years after the end of data 
collection.

  Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a recombinant humanized IgG4  monoclonal antibody. In this study, the initiation of 
Natalizumab at the onset of symptoms, in addition to  steroids, will provide the best chance of preventing 
crypt necrosis by [CONTACT_641120] T ce lls to the gut as early as possible.  The absent of α4β7 
integrin on hematologic malignancies provides Nataliz umab with the unique ability to abrogate gut GVHD 
without effecting the graft versus tumor effect. Thus, it is  hoped that given its specific targeting of  integrin, 
Natalizumab can be successful in treating acute GVH D, yet be less globally immunosuppressive, the main 
concern with current available treatments of acute GVHD. α4β7 is increased in disease sites of inflammatory 
bowel disease, providing another pot ential target for Natalizumab.  
 Dose 
Calc
ul-• Natalizumab: dosed as a flat mg IV, Sections   7.1.8.  Study Drug  
Administration Treatment Plan administration  Guidelines are found in Sections 5 and 7. 
• Treatment of acute GVHD is an acute process that requires short courses of treatment. 
• Initial standard dose IV will be used at confirmation of acute gut GVHD.  
• If at 4 weeks there has been less than a complete respon se, participants can be treated with a second dose of 
Natalizumab.  
• Pre-treatment criteria: ANC ≥ 500/ μL (G-CSF) support is allowed); Platelets:  ≥ 10,000/ μL (platelet 
transfusions are allowed on the same day). 
• Observations: will be observed for [ADDRESS_858124] 
infusion (monitor for possible infusion related reactions).   See Section 5.2.1. for details.  
• Vital Signs: (temp, Heart rate, blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_857]) should be monitored approximately 
every 10 minutes during the infusion of Natalizumab. Dose 
Modifi
cationExpected Toxicities and Dosing Delays / Dose Modifications are outlined in Section 6. 
 Concom
itant 
Meds General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  are in Section 5.4. 
• Routine use of growth factor (G-CSF) support in the absence of documented neutropenia is not 
recommended.  
• Prednisone requirements: See Section 7.2 to 7.2.1  Req
uire

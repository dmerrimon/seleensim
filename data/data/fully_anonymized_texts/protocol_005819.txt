CONSENT TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY  
“The Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Transcranial Direct Current 
Stimulation (tDCS) on Fibromyalgia Patients” 
 
A. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND  
You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. This research is sponsored by [CONTACT_4878] (NIH) and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new medical technology, cal led 
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), can help reduce chronic pain due to fibromyalgia when applied in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (“talk 
therapy”). tDCS is a minimally -invasive technique (i.e., it does not  involve any surgi cal 
procedures, additional medication or sedation, or needles) that uses a very small amount of electricity to temporarily stimulate specific brain areas in awake people. The electrical current passes through the skin, scalp, hair , and skull and can tempor arily increase or 
decrease activity in areas of the brain that are thought to be involved with pain reduction. Some preliminary studies suggest that tDCS may be effective in reducing fibromyalgia and 
altering pain perception in both healthy adults and in patients with various types of pain 
conditions. However, tDCS is not approved by [CONTACT_4760] a treatment for pain conditions.  
 You are being asked to participate in this study because you are between the ages of 21 -85 
and may meet criteria for these conditions. The investigator in charge of this study is Jeffrey J. Borckardt, Ph.D. This study will involve approximately 72 volunteers with chronic 
pain due to fibromyalgia and will be conducted in Charleston, SC.  
 
B. PROCEDURES  
If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:  
1. You will complete several self- report screening measures designed to assess your 
pain history, level of depression and anxiety.  
Additionally, you will be interviewed by [CONTACT_340631], implanted medical devices, skin 
conditions and history of brain injuries.  
 
2. You will be permitted to continue your current pain treatments (including 
medications), but will be asked not to change the treatment regimen during  your 
enrollment in the study.  
 
IRB Number: Pro00039603  
Date Approved 11/1/2016    Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_421547] is positive you will not be eligible to 
participate in the study.  
4. You will be randomized to one of t wo groups; neither the researcher nor you will 
make the choice of which group you are assigned. The two groups are A and B. If you are randomized to Group A, you will meet with a clinician for 6 sessions of cognitive 
behavioral therapy for pain and you will receive real tDCS. If you are randomized to Group B, you will meet with a clinician for 6 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy 
for pain and you will receive sham tDCS (this is not real stimulation).  
5. You will be given a paper diary to record you r daily pain, mood, sleep and activity 
levels. You will also be scheduled to undergo Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) , 
which will take place in the Brain Stimulation Laboratory in the Institute of 
Psychiatry at MUSC. QST evaluates your response to pain by [CONTACT_2329] a heat stimulator 
on your arm and a blunt tip needle that will be pressed into various skin a reas that 
are thought to be uniquely sensitive in patients with fibromyalgia.  
6. During the treatment phase, you will receive 6, [ADDRESS_421548]. Charleston, 
SC. During each of these CBT therapy sessions, you will undergo approximately 30 
minutes of either real or sham tDCS over the left DLPFC. You will also be asked to fill 
out questionnaires about your mood, sleep, activity levels, and quality of life at each 
session. 
7. When conducting a tDCS session, the investigators may pre- treat your skin  with a 
small amount of mild pain- reducing cream. Small sponges will be soaked in a sterile 
solution of 0.9% sodium chloride insulated by a latex casing.    The sponges will be placed over the area of your scalp corresponding to your group. 
The sponges will be held in place by a Velcro headband. After stimulation, the 
investigators may apply a vitamin- E/Aloe cream to the skin to reduce problems 
associated with skin drying.  
 
8. You may experience [ADDRESS_421549] and then start the manualized 
CBT intervention with simultaneous  tDCS (real or sham; randomized and masked).

You will undergo 1 session per week for ~ [ADDRESS_421550] session. You will continue to complete the electronic pain 
diaries throughout the treatment as well as a 4 -week follow -up phase. At 1, 3 and 6 
months, you will return to the lab to complete follow -up questionnaires.  
 
C. DURATION  
Your participation in the study will involve 12 appointments (baseline visit, [ADDRESS_421551] sessions, 3 follow- up appointm ents). The baseline assessment may last up 
to three hours. The therapy sessions are [ADDRESS_421552] associated with the study will simply remind you of the time and date of 
an appointment and will not include information indicating that this study is related to 
psychiatric or pain research.   
 
D. RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
 
Potential Risks of tDCS:  
tDCS has been found to be safe in humans with mild side- effects such as tingling sensations 
under the sponge electrodes (experienced by 70% of tDCS patients), moderate fatigue (35%), and light itching sensations under the sponges (30%).  
After tDCS, the incidence of side- effects is lower, but include headache (12%), nausea (3%) 
and insomnia (<1%). There is no evidence to date suggesting that tDCS causes seizures.  
This technique is currently being used as a method to reduce seizure frequency in epi[INVESTIGATOR_125801]. However, there is at least a theoretical possibility that tDCS could induce a seizure 
in some patients, thus if you have epi[INVESTIGATOR_340628], you will not be eligible for participation in this study.   
 
Some mild skin irritation can occur after tDCS treatment. If tDCS is delivered at [ADDRESS_421553] only been seen when the skin is not treated with moisturizer creams after stimulation. 
The investigators will apply a vitamin- E/Aloe cream to your skin after each stimulation 
session. Lastly, these rare instances of burns reported in the research literature have all been reported to heal without scarring within 1 to 3 weeks following the end of tDCS 
 
IRB Number: Pro00039603  
Date Approved 11/1/2016    Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_421554] been no reports of long -term changes in cognitive 
function (memory, attention, etc) in tDCS studies. However, tDCS is an experimental procedure and may have unknown side effects. The researchers will let you know if they 
learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
Potential for allergic reaction:  
Some people report allergic contact [CONTACT_340632] a result of exposure to creams such as Benzocaine and Vitamin- E lotion. Dermatitis is described as inflammation of the skin and 
may present as an itchy rash. The rash may be treated with corticosteroid creams (such as hydrocortisone), antihistamines, or wet compresses. If contact [CONTACT_340633], the 
investigator will immediately remove any cream from your skin and apply a wet compress.  
 
Risks regarding Confidentiality:  
All study records will be placed in a locked, secure, limited access location. Your 
participation in the study and the information you provide will be treated as confidential. 
In order to protect your confidentiality, the information we collect will contain your code 
number and not your name. Codes linking numbers and names will be kept in a locked 
secure location and will not be accessible to anyone outside the research team. There is a 
risk of a loss of confidentiality of your personal information as a result of participation in 
this study. 
 
You should know that if you threaten to harm yourself or others, or give information about 
child or elder abuse, this information will be reported to appropriate clinical staff and other 
persons outside the research program as necessary to protect you and others.  
 Even without your consent, suspected or known abuse or neglect of a child , disabled or 
elder abuse, or threatened violence to self or others may be reported to appropriate authorities.   
 
Randomization Risk:  
As there is a 50/50 chance of you receiving either the real or sham stimulation, there is the 
risk of being assigned to th e sham group , which may not receive a benefit.

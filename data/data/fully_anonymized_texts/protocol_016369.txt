Purpose  
The overall objective of this protoc ol is to test if DXM can suppress symptoms associated with Fibromyalgia.  
DXM is used in multiple over the counter cough suppressants. We will be observing the effects of DXM. If one of 
these medications help the symptoms of FM, it will give us information  about what is wrong in people with FM.  
Background  
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain syndrome.  Those impacted by [CONTACT_175109], 
fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive impairment, headaches, among other symptoms. Fibromyalgia (FM) af fects 
approximately 5% of all women in the [LOCATION_002]. Current treatment options are limited because its 
pathophysiology is not currently understood. Many patients suffer with decreased quality of life and loss of 
employment due to this illness.  
We do not understand the precise mechanism of Fibromyalgia, and we do not yet have a targeted treatment for 
the condition. A way to treat the symptoms of FM is paramount as other research concurrently attempts to 
understand the mechanisms behind the disease. The re is current ongoing study of [CONTACT_175122]’s that is taking 
daily blood draws for [ADDRESS_204297] 
on neuropathic pai n.

Version 2019 -05-24 Previous literature has suggested that dextromethorphan at 0.1mg/kg intraperitoneally reduces central 
inflammation (Chechneva et al., 2011 – link below). This dosage would translate to approximately 8mg for an 
average U.S. female weighing [ADDRESS_204298] -
pass metabolism when administered orally.  
In this study, we will be administering no more than a daily dose of DXM (20 mg) to observe the possible 
suppression of symptoms in Fibromyalgia.

We will primarily recruit by [CONTACT_175110]; these are individuals with FM 
who have consented to being contact[CONTACT_34754]. To recruit individuals with FM , we will also contact 
[CONTACT_30572]. After the subject’s physician presents a brief summary  of the study to the potential participant, 
it will be the responsibility of the potential participant to contact [CONTACT_175111]. Our research staff at UAB will not be accepting names or any PHI from the physicians.  We will rely on 
potential study participants to contact [CONTACT_175112] . Participants will also be recruited from the community. Advertisements that are distributed to the public 
will also requi re an interested potential participant to conta ct the research team.  
Telephone Screening  
To minimize inconvenience to potential participants, the prescreening scree ning will be conducted over the  
telephone by a trained member of the research staff: the stu dy aims, protocol, and any possible risks will be 
described and a series of questions will be asked to determine interest and eligibility for screening for the study. 
A request to obtain the participant information will be completed via a partial waiver do cument. Individuals 
refusing to participate or to provide PHI will be thanked for their time and asked if they want their contact 
[CONTACT_175113]’s database to be contact[CONTACT_5646]. If the answer is no, 
[ADDRESS_204300] and they are determined to be potentially eligible for the study, an 
appointment will be made for the m to attend an in -person screening visit.  
Study Visits  
Visit  Locations  
 UAB Clinical Research Unit (CRU), Jefferson Towers Floor 15, [ADDRESS_204301] S, Birmingham, AL [ZIP_CODE]  
 Campbell Hall, [ADDRESS_204302], Birmingham, AL [ZIP_CODE]  
Visit 1 (In -Person Screening)  
Individual s who sati sfy the telephone pre -screening criteria will be invited to a comprehensive in -person 
screening session. These sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_175102]. Individuals will first 
undergo informed consent; the consent form will describe t he necessary eligibility confirmation that takes place 
before proceeding with the full study. Consenting individuals will complete several self -report questionnaires, 
submit to an examination of their height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature), 
and provide a blood sample to ensure eligibility per the study criteria. Participant will receive a hand held tablet 
and instructions on how to complete the daily questions via the tablet. Vital signs & blood draws will be taken by 
[CONTACT_175114],  using standardized sterile techniques.  
Once the blood test results are available from the UAB Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175103]. All eligible participants will be contact[CONTACT_175115] a member of the research 
staff. If a participant’s test results do not meet eligibility criteria, the individual will be informed that they are 
ineligible to participate and  asked  to return the handheld tablet  to the research team . Alternatively, p otential 
participants will be given a self -addressed envelope to return the tablet if they are unwilling to return to the site.  
Visit [ADDRESS_204303] the participants on how to take 
their study medication.  The placeb o will be purchased from a compounding pharmacy such as Double Oak 
Pharmacy in Birmingham, Alabama. The participants will receive their initial 5 weeks supply of medication, 
which is placebo (single -blind). Participants will not be told when they are takin g placebo or DXM until the end 
of study. The participants will also continue to record their symptoms twice a day using the hand -held device 
throughout the duration of the study for the entire (~20 weeks).  
Visit [ADDRESS_204304] their 
vital signs and draw 20cc of blood. The blood will be analyzed by [CONTACT_175116][INVESTIGATOR_175104]’s liver & renal function. Also, at this visit the research team will review daily at -home symptoms & 
any adverse events. If any participant has experienced serious/severe adverse events the participant will be 
terminated from the study as to ensure there is no increased harm to the participant.  If no adv erse events have

vital signs and draw 20cc of blood. The blood will be analyzed by [CONTACT_175116][INVESTIGATOR_175104]’s liver & renal function. Also, at this visit the research team will review daily at -home symptom s & 
any adverse events. If any participant has experienced serious/severe adverse events the participant will be 
terminated from the study as to ensure there is no increased harm to the participant.  If no adverse events have 
been experienced the participa nt will receive the normal dose of DXM to take for [ADDRESS_204306]. Younger will review daily 
symptoms and general health since visit 10 and un -blind the participant to which medications were received 
during the study.  
 A +/ - 3 day stud y visit window will be implemented for all study visits to allow for reasonable flexibility in the 
participant’s schedule as well as staff availability.  
At any time throughout the study, if a participant reports feeling unwell or having any adverse events from any 
of the supplements, a review will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_175105]. If necessary, appropriate medical 
management will be provided.  
If an y participant is terminated from participating in the study, they will be required to return the hand -held 
device and any unused medicine back to a member of the UAB research study staff.  
Study Timeline  
The participant will be involved approximately 20 wee ks for the entire study; this includes the in person 
screening, daily symptom reporting which is 10 minutes per day or less, and  study medication disbursement. All 
blood draws will be conducted at the CRU in Jefferson Towers.  Study medication disbursement  will occur at 
UAB Campbell Hall or CRU.

Biospecimens  
Peripheral blood samples will be collected and appropriately processed by [CONTACT_173602] (CRU) staff.  
Screening session protocol: A 21/23g needle will be used to collect a maximum of 60cc of blood into labeled 
blood collection tubes to conduct screening tests. This blood will be tested by [CONTACT_175116][INVESTIGATOR_175106]. The screening tests will include: complete blood count, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, c -reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, 
rheumatoid factor, liver function tests, kidney function tests and h uman chorionic gonadotropin. The total 
amount of blood drawn per participant for all study visits is 120cc.  
Baseline and drug monitoring phases: At the screening visit and [ADDRESS_204308] the levels of expressed  cytokines in blood as a marker of immune activity. Blood will be 
drawn via venipuncture into one 8 -10cc (approximately 2 teaspoons) vacutainer. The blood will be centrifuged 
and will be extracted and placed into cryovials. The cryovials will then be store d at -80°C until ready for analysis. 
All specimens will be collected and processed by [CONTACT_175117].  
Specimens will be labelled with: 1) participant identification number (PID), (2) date of blood draw, 3) study 
identifier 4) study principa l investigator. We will assign a [ADDRESS_204309] person to be screened will be 
given number 001, preceded by [CONTACT_175118] (DXM) ; the first participant will be DXM -001.  The computer

computer hard drive will be encrypted and password protected. The file itself will require a password for access. 
No specimens will contain personally identifying information.  
Samples will be stored at -80C, for a period not exceeding [ADDRESS_204310] ed to the condition under study that is identified in 
this protocol.

Version 2019 -05-24 Risks and Benefits  
Benefits  
It is possible that some participants may experience an improvement in their symptoms. It is also possible that a 
better understanding of the mechanisms underl ying FM will allow treatments to more effectively target the 
disease for current and future patients.  
Risks  
The physical risks of venipuncture include discomfort and bruising around the blood draw site. There is also the 
risk of infection. The risks associ ated with this study concern the discomfort associated with having blood drawn 
and receiving the Dextromethorphan.  
Participants should not take Dextromethorphan (DXM) if they have been diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU) 
because it could contain phenylala nine, if they are currently using or have used an MAO inhibitor, or if they have 
one of the following conditions: chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, diabetes, liver disease, and mucus with 
cough or slowed breathing. These will be reviewed at the during  the phone screen, in person screening and 
throughout the study. Dextromethorphan is known to produce side effects in individuals which include: slight 
drowsiness / dizziness, nausea or vomiting. Rarely, severe drowsiness can occur, participants will be in structed 
to notify study staff if they experience any of these side effects.  
Grapefruit juice interacts with Dextromethorphan, participants will be asked to not drink grapefruit juice for the 
duration of the study.  
Dextromethorphan is known to produce sid e effects in individuals which include: diarrhea, dizziness, cough, 
vomiting, swelling in the hands, ankles and or feet. Rarely slight drowsiness can occur; participants will be 
instructed to notify study staff if they experience any of these side effects.  The most severe possible 
complication is serotonin toxicity.  
The participant may experience some discomfort, bruising and the possibility of infection at the site of the blood 
draw on visits 1,3,6,9. Bruising should be minimal and should go away with a [ADDRESS_204311] arises, a  determination of severity and proper medical care will be advised and depending on the severity 
of the symptom the participant would be removed from the study and an evaluation of how to continue would 
be made by [CONTACT_5984].  
Minimization of Risks  
Our screening procedures will minimize the probability of enrolling a patient who has a greater than normal risk 
of suffering adverse events from the medication (DXM). Any remaining risks for adverse events will be reduced 
by [CONTACT_175119]:  
1. The risks associa ted with the blood draw will be minimized by [CONTACT_175120]. Standard sterilization procedures will be followed to minimize the risk 
of infection. The blood draw site will be examined carefully to ens ure no adverse events have occurred, 
and it is safe to proceed.  
8 
Version 2019 -05-24 2. A more thorough investigation of adverse events will be collected at each laboratory visit. This includes 
a qualitative open interview assessment of symptoms and general health during the pre ceding month.  
3. Also, blood tests will be collected at the mid -point of each treatment condition (visits 1, 3, 6, 9) to 
monitor liver and kidney function.  
4. The relatively short duration of each study medication treatment (10 weeks)  
5. Participants will be expl ained the symptoms of serotonin syndrome/ toxicity and will be instructed to 
report to the study staff if any symptoms occur. Also, individuals that have experienced an allergic 
reaction to any of the medication used in this study will be excluded from par ticipating during the pre -
screening or at Visit 1.  
Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  
Name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and medical history (participant reported –no medical records) are required to 
assess safety and eligibility for the study. Personally identifying information will also be collected as an 
identification requirement for study procedures. Identifying information will be stored on a single computer that 
is encrypted, and password protected at both operating system levels, and at the file lev el. All data maintained 
on paper -based records will be locked in a file cabinet in a locked room in the lab of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_175108] .

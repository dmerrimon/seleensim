include 1) size criteria, 2) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with calculation of Apparent 
Diffusion Coefficient and 3) Contrast-enhanced dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)2-4. 
While these techniques assess various tumor properties such as volume, cellularity and perfusion, 
these techniques have their own individual limitations. For example, a change in size requires at 
least 2-[ADDRESS_630243] 
4Magnetic Resonance  Fingerprinting (3D MRF) technique, which allows simultaneous estimation 
of both T1 and T2 relaxation times in a clinically feasible manner and in less than [ADDRESS_630244] tissue.
 
2. Preliminary Studies:
Our preliminary work on 3D breast MRF has shown that there are significant differences in T1 
and T2 relaxation times between tumor and normal breast tissue16, 17.  We scanned [ADDRESS_630245] tissue (mean ± SD, Tumor T1: 1156 ± [ADDRESS_630246] T1: 846 ± 388 ms, 
Tumor T2: 72 ± [ADDRESS_630247] T2: 48 ± 12 ms, p = 0.039 for T1, p < 0.001 for T2). In 
addition, we performed a repeat 3D MRF scan after one cycle of chemotherapy in 7 patients and 
patients with decrease in tumor size showed significant decrease in tumor T1 and T2 relaxation 
times while non-responders showed only a negligible change in tumor T1 and T2 relaxation 
times17 (Table 1). Figure [ADDRESS_630248] early response to chemotherapy.

3. Objectives/ Hypothesis
To  assess the utility of quantitative MRI in assessment of response to neo-adjuvant 
chemotherapy in breast cancer
MR  Fingerprinting based relaxometry allows quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation 
times of tumor and normal breast tissue. Response to chemotherapy is associated 
with measurable changes in these properties and may be used to predict treatment 
response earlier than conventional MRI.  
We  hypothesize that 3D MRF before, during and after chemotherapy can provide 
additional quantitative information about changes during treatment and may predict 
early response to chemotherapy.
We  hypothesize that MRF-based T1 and T2 maps will be significantly different for 
breast cancer patients with low and high MammaPrint scores before therapy. This 
will provide additional capability to differentiate low grade and high grade breast 
cancer and potentially eliminate the need for invasive biopsy.
4.  Research Plan
     
4.[ADDRESS_630250] Surgery/Hematology-Oncology 
Clinics and Radiology and the MRI inpatient/outpatient schedules.  Patients will be recruited for 
two different study cohorts:
61.  Patients with biopsy proven cases of breast cancer who will undergo chemotherapy treatment .  
These subjects will receive 3 MRI scans: [ADDRESS_630251] round of chemotherapy, Scan 3 after completion of chemotherapy.  
2.  The range of scores for MammaPrint is -1 to +1.  Any score above [ADDRESS_630252] of care. These subjects will 
receive only one MRI scan before clinically indicated surgery and/or therapy.
We propose the following pathways for patient recruitment: 
for  patients first seen at the Clinics, the treating physician (breast cancer surgeon/breast 
oncologist) will introduce the study and a flyer with key information about the study may 
be given to the patient. If the patient shows willingness to participate, the patient’s MRN 
will be sent via UH email to the Radiology Research Coordinator for actual study consent 
on the day of the baseline diagnostic MRI at UHCMC. 
if  the patient has already had a diagnostic scan elsewhere before visiting the Clinic and is 
still interested in participating in the study, they will be scheduled for a research only  
non-contrast MR Fingerprinting scan at UHCMC before starting chemotherapy. 
alternatively,  for patients who are first scheduled for breast MRI at UHCMC Radiology 
department, consenting will be directly done on the day of MRI without a referral from 
the breast clinic. 
We are requesting a HIPAA waiver to identify eligible patients before approaching them to 
participate in the study. To confirm study eligibility, we will access the Physician Portal to get 
information about the breast cancer diagnosis and pathology results.
Request for waiver of HIPAA authorization and waiver of consent: We are requesting a waiver 
of HIPAA authorization and waiver of consent for identifying and contact[CONTACT_490105] a waiver of the consent for the research study as such. We intend to identify patients 
from physician portal, inpatient/outpatient MRI schedule and/or referred by [CONTACT_490106] a clinically indicated breast MRI and contact [CONTACT_212760]. There will be no improper use 
of or disclosure of PHI under this waiver. The investigator will take precautions to protect the 
subject’s privacy and the confidentiality of the data pertaining to his/her participation in this 
research study.  Only the research staff will access the PHI for above described purpose. The 
patient identifiers accessed under this waiver of HIPAA authorization will not be retained. The 
identifiers will be destroyed on the same day once the purpose of contact[CONTACT_490107]. We assure that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any 
other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, 
or for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under the 
Privacy Rule. We are requesting a waiver of HIPAA authorization for contact[CONTACT_490108] a waiver of informed consent process for the study itself. For this purpose, the 
waiver of HIPAA authorization and waiver of consent is necessary for recruitment. We will not 
be able to meet our recruitment goals without this waiver.
7Inclusion and  exclusion criteria will be assessed for each potential study patient, and written 
informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_490109] a private setting at UHCMC.  
We will  also obtain contact [CONTACT_490110]-up scans for 
assessing tumor response. We hope to get at least one-two eligible patients per week and recruit 
patients over the first eighteen months. Since the chemotherapy regime takes about 4-[ADDRESS_630253] patient 
recruited within 2 years of initiating the study
4.2  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:
1.Biopsy proven cases of breast cancer
2. Women ages 18 and over
Exclusion Criteria
1. Patients with only  benign lesion 
2. Patients with only  ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
3. Patients with recurrent/ residual breast cancer in same breast
4. Pregnant women
5. Lactating Women
6. Patients with ferromagnetic or otherwise non-MRI compatible aneurysm clips.
7. The presence of an implanted medical device that is not MRI-compatible, 
including, but not limited to: pacemaker, defibrillator 
8. Patients with contraindications for MRI due to embedded foreign metallic objects.  
Bullets, shrapnel, metalwork fragments, or other metallic material adds 
unnecessary risk to the patient.
9. Known history of severe claustrophobia.
10. Patients under the age of [ADDRESS_630254] material or 
abnormal kidney function (GFR < 40 mL/ min), a contrast enhanced exam will 
not be performed; however, a non-contrast exam may be performed in these 
patients.
4.[ADDRESS_630255]; the 
witness will sign the consent document. We will not actively recruit students and employees of 
UH and CWRU, however, they will not be excluded from participation. UH/CWRU students and 
employees who may consider participation will be informed that their decision to participate will 
in no way influence their job or status in any way and study results will not be reported to their 
supervisor. We will not actively recruit student or employee populations, but they will not be 
excluded if they otherwise meet enrollment criteria.
8Prisoners and  many other vulnerable populations will be excluded from this study; these 
populations will not provide any unique information to the study and will not benefit from 
participation. 
4.[ADDRESS_630256] MRI:
This is a prospective, longitudinal study comprising of pre-treatment baseline scan, interim scan 
after one cycle of chemotherapy and end-of-chemoetherapy scans. The research sequence being 
evaluated is 3D MR Fingerprinting sequence. This is a painless technique that takes about [ADDRESS_630257] (Gadavist®) for research purposes, the eGFR would be 
checked from patient records and contrast would only be administered to patients who have a 
documented eGFR > 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 within the previous 3months. 
4.4.2  Study procedures:
Radiology study personnel will obtain consent in the Radiology department prior to performing 
3D MR Fingerprinting scans. Consent to participate will be obtained prior to performing any 
research scans:
Visit 1:  3D MR Fingerprinting images will be added to the clinical MRI scan before start of 
chemotherapy or before surgery for the MammaPrint cohort. The additional research images will 
take less than 20 minutes to acquire.
Visit 2:  Patients receiving chemotherapy will be scheduled for a research only non-contrast 3D 
MR Fingerprinting and anatomical MRI scans 7- [ADDRESS_630258] cycle of chemotherapy. 
Acquisition of images will take approximately 30 minutes.
Visit 3:  For patients receiving chemotherapy, if the treating physician orders a clinical MRI scan 
within [ADDRESS_630259] version 1.1 criteria would be considered as 
surrogate criteria  for response (1). Thus no visible tumor and nodes at end of treatment scan will 
be considered  complete response,  >30% decrease in long-axis diameter (LAD) compared to 
baseline will  be partial response, > 20% increase in LAD will be progressive disease while < 30% 
decrease/ > 20% increase in LAD will be considered stable disease. 
All categories of response would be considered independently for analysis.
5.   STUDY PARAMETERS/ DATA COLLECTION
Data may  be extracted from UH patient medical records by [CONTACT_490111]-credentialed 
(CREC/CITI-certified) or  UH employees and  recorded onto UH Radiology password-protected 
computers.  Data  will be collected and stored in REDCap or in a password protected folder on the 
secured UH  s:drive in order to correlate image findings with patient progress/care.   Data will 
include the following:
Name
MRN
Age
Email
Phone  number
Date  of last menstrual period
Date  of biopsy
Biopsy  results
TNM  status/cancer stage
Pathology  report with hormone receptor status
MammaPrint  score
Chemotherapy  schedule and treatment regime
Date  of surgery
Type  of surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving surgery)
Final  surgical pathology 
MRI  images 
106.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
1. From the  3D MR Fingerprinting maps, T1 and T2 relaxation times will be obtained 
for tumor, and peritumoral and normal breast tissue at all three scans.
2. From routine MRI scans, the tumor size and tumor ADC will be obtained.
3. Changes in  all quantitative measurements will be compared between responders 
and non-responders based on final surgical pathology and the predictive value of 
3D MR Fingerprinting as compared to existing techniques would be assessed using 
appropriate t-tests and logistic regression analysis.
Sample Size  Calculation: Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we expect a 25% change in T1 and T2 
relaxation times in responders and less than 7% change in non-responders with an effect size of 
18% (0.18). At a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%, the expected sample size is 62. 
Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we also expect an attrition and drop-out rate of 50%, and thus total number 
of subjects recruited will be 124. 
7.  POTENTIAL RISKS
7.[ADDRESS_630260] MRI
Certain metals  are not safe to go into an MRI scanner. Prior to all MRI exams (standard 
clinical or research), stringent safety checklists will be used to determine if an MRI study 
can be performed on each patient. All patients will be receiving an MRI exam as part of 
the standard of care at baseline. This study will add several minutes to the duration of this 
baseline exam, but will not need any additional administration of contrast agents or drugs. 
7.[ADDRESS_630261]-of-care MRI exam within 
1 month of completion of chemotherapy treatment (for visit 3), a research only exam will 
be performed. This exam will include administration of MRI contrast agent unless the 
subject declines contrast administration. If contrast is administered for research only 
purposes in this subset of patients, the following risks are present:
Potential risks  of IV contrast agents are allergic reaction. Gadolinium-based contrast agents 
(dyes) may increase the risk of a rare but serious disease called nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis in people with poor kidney function with drastically decreased glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR) below 30ml/min, Chronic kidney disease, CKD 4 and 5). To exclude the risk 
of Gadolinium induced nephropathy, we will exclude all patients with a GFR below 40 
ml/min. This threshold is considerably higher than the current clinical threshold of GFR 
below 30.
Over [ADDRESS_630262] agents (GBCAs) have been 
administered since the introduction of these medications in the mid 1980s. The known and 
11proven adverse  effects of these drugs are the possibility of allergic reactions (rare and 
idiosyncratic), and the development of the extremely rare disease Nephrogenic Systemic 
Fibrosis (NSF) with the administration of contrast agents in patients with severe renal 
dysfunction. NSF has been virtually eliminated upon not administering GBCAs in patients 
with end stage renal disease. Additional precautions such as minimizing use of GBCAs 
associated with NSF, and elimination of simultaneous administration of double/triple doses 
of agents, have also contributed. While all GBCAs are known to deposit in neural and other 
tissues, no harmful effect of this deposition has been documented18.
7.3 Confidentiality
Finally, there  is a risk of a breach of confidentiality. To lower this risk, information will be 
de-identified by a co-investigator trained in the protection of PHI (Protected Health 
Information). A unique study code will be assigned to every study subject. This code will 
be used instead of identifiable information to describe which study subject is which when 
cases are discussed among study personnel.
 8.  BENEFITS
There may be no direct health benefits for participation in this study. Participation in this study 
will help the investigators determine whether these MRI techniques are useful, and may provide 
benefit to patients undergoing MRI examinations in the future. 
9.  ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION
Patients may choose not to participate in this study and clinical care will not be affected.  
10.  COST TO RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS
The study will pay for all procedures that are directly associated with this research study.
Procedures or  drugs that are considered standard of care will be the responsibility of the patient 
and their insurance company.
11.  COMPENSATION
Visit 1:  Subjects will receive $100 for research scan
Visit  2:   Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_630263] research scan 
Visit 3:  Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_630264] research scan or $[ADDRESS_630265] research scan
   9. ADVERSE EVENTS
An adverse  event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended event, physical or psychological, 
associated with a research study, which causes harm or injury to a research participant as a result 
of the participant’s involvement in a research study. The event can include abnormal laboratory 
findings, symptoms, or disease associated with the research study. The event does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with the research, any risk associated with the research, the 
research intervention, or the research assessments. Adverse events may be the result of the 
interventions and interactions used in the research; the collection of identifiable private 
information in the research; an underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; and/or 
other circumstances unrelated to the research or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of 
12the subject.  In general, adverse events that are at least partially the result of (a) or (b) would be 
considered related to the research, whereas adverse events solely related to (c) or (d) would be 
considered unrelated to the research.
The significance  of an adverse event is used to describe the patient/event outcome or action criteria 
associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning (i.e., moderate, severe or 
life threatening). Based on the National Cancer Institute Guidelines for the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program, severity can be defined by [CONTACT_490112]:
Grades 1  are mild adverse events. (e.g., minor event requiring no specific medical intervention; 
asymptomatic laboratory findings only; marginal clinical relevance)
Grades 2 are moderate adverse events (e.g., minimal intervention; local intervention;  non-
invasive intervention; transfusion; elective interventional radiological procedure; therapeutic 
endoscopy or operation).
Grades 3  are severe and undesirable adverse events (e.g., significant symptoms requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006]; transfusion; elective interventional radiological 
procedure; therapeutic endoscopy or operation).
Grades 4  are life threatening or disabling adverse events (e.g., complicated by [CONTACT_9420], life 
threatening metabolic or cardiovascular complications such as circulatory failure, hemorrhage, 
sepsis; life–threatening physiologic consequences; need for intensive care or emergent invasive 
procedure; emergent interventional radiological procedure, therapeutic endoscopy or operation).
Grades 5 are fatal adverse event resulting in death.
9.1 Serious  Adverse Events
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes:
1. Results  in death.
2. Is  a life-threatening adverse experience. The term life-threatening in the definition of 
serious refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an adverse event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.
3. Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Any 
adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477671], UNLESS at least one of the following expectations is met:
4. The  admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours OR
5. The  admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the 
start of the study) OR
6. The  admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193899]. However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113276] “medically important” and as such may be 
13reportable as a  serious adverse event dependent on clinical judgment. In addition where 
local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.
7. Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. The definition of disability is 
a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions.
8. Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
9. Is  an important medical event. Important medical events that may not result death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
disease or disorders, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
9.[ADDRESS_630266]’s participation in the study. Subjects will be followed for AEs for [ADDRESS_630267]’s case report form, subject’s medical records, and/or any 
other institutional requirement. Source documentation must be available to support 
all adverse events.
A laboratory  test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the 
subject to withdraw from the study), requiring treatment or causing apparent 
clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported 
as an adverse event.
14The investigator will provide the following for all adverse events:
1. Description  of the event
2. Date  of onset and resolution
3. Grade  of adverse event
4. Action  taken as a result of the event
5. Outcome  of event
In this  study, descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov will be utilized for AE reporting.
Investigative sites  will report adverse events to their respective IRB according to 
the local IRB’s policies and procedures in reporting adverse events.
9.[ADDRESS_630268] be reported to the 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490100].
10.  RECORDS/DATA TO BE KEPT
10.1 Regulatory Considerations
The study  will be conducted in compliance with ICH guidelines and with all applicable 
federal (including 21 CFR parts 56 & 50), state or local laws.
10.[ADDRESS_630269]’s financial responsibility. Subjects will also 
be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The subject 
will be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the 
information provided.
The consent will  take place at the clinical practices of the listed co-investigators in a 
private location.  The patients will be evaluated a second time for MR safety prior 
entering the magnet prior to each MRI examination.
The original,  signed written Informed Consent Form will be kept with the Research 
Chart in conformance with the institution’s standard operating procedures.  A copy of the 
signed written Informed Consent Form will be given to the subject.
10.[ADDRESS_630270] (HIPAA), a 
subject must sign an authorization to release medical information to the sponsor and/or 
allow the sponsor, a regulatory authority, or Institutional Review Board access to 
subject’s medical information that includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44227], 
including subjects’ medical history.
10.4 Accessing  Electronic Medical Records for University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490101]. We seek a HIPAA waiver to identify eligible patients 
and check whether patients meet inclusion criteria before approaching them for the study 
(see Recruitment section 4.1).
In order  to ensure patient safety, investigators and study personnel must have up-to-the 
minute health information for subjects enrolled to this study. Therefore, electronic 
medical records must be utilized to obtain medical information in a timely manner. The 
following electronic systems will be used: IDX program to access scheduling 
information; UH Physician Portal/EMR/AEMR to access lab results and physician notes; 
PCOSS LITE as necessary to locate archived medical records; COPATH to locate 
archived pathology records; PACS to access radiological imaging results; and 
MySecureCare (Sunrise Clinical Manager) to access some or all of the above 
information when this application is fully functional.
Access to  these systems is required for the life of this research study.  Information obtained 
from electronic systems will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_490102]/or printed (lab results, 
physician notes, etc.) and stored in the research chart. Research charts are kept secure and 
destroyed according to UH policy.
The PI,  co-investigators, study coordinator, and/or data manager for this study via 
password-protected login will obtain study data.  The coordinator will be assessing EMR 
to obtain spontaneous adverse events.  All study personnel involved in this research will 
adhere to the UH policies regarding confidentiality and Protected Health Information.
Patient MRI  images will be de-identified to protect personal information and will only 
referred to by a unique number identifier.
Research MRI  and MRF images may be reconstructed or analyzed in either an online or 
offline manner. If images are reconstructed online, it is possible to share these images with 
referring physicians or radiologists using the PACS database. If requested and available 
online, these images may be shared via PACS. However, there may be no direct benefit of 
sharing these research images.
10.5  Retention of records
16The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_356640], case report forms, source documents, 
records of study drug receipt and dispensation, and all IRB correspondence for as long as 
needed to comply with national and international regulations and the institution in which 
the study will be conducted, or for the period specified by [CONTACT_456], whichever is 
longer.  No records will be destroyed until the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_193912].
10.6 Audits and inspections
Authorized representatives  of the sponsor, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) or an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the Center to perform 
audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any 
applicable regulatory requirements.
10.[ADDRESS_630271] or Committee for assessment; 
instead, there will be an ongoing review of the aggregate data each month to ensure that 
the study can continue without undue risk to participants. Data will be reviewed to ensure 
that they are accurate, complete, and that data collection is in compliance with the protocol.
 
There will also  be a continual assessment of the risks and benefits through the review of 
individual adverse events and other safety parameters as they occur throughout the study 
to determine whether individual participants can safely continue to participate. Serious 
adverse events, should any occur, will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_630272] involved. Adverse 
event reporting will be strictly performed in compliance with IRB rules for reporting.

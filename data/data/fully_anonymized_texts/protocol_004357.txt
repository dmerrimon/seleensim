Pre-Analysis Plan
Persuasion in Medicine:
Experimental Evidence on Sender and Signal Effects
This Draft: October 12, 2020
1. Introduction
The aim of this study is to identify which sender/signal combinations are most persuasive in encourag-
ing low socioeconomic males living in the [LOCATION_002] to take up seasonal ﬂu vaccination. We plan to
recruit subjects and randomly assign them to persuasion treatments in the form of video infomercials
that vary dimensions of the sender of the medical recommendation (race and gender concordance, "ex-
pert," and empathy treatments). Speciﬁcally, we will cross-randomize race with the "expert" treatment
as the actor in the video will portray either a doctor or a layperson. In addition, we may randomize
gender of the actor for subjects assigned to a race-concordant "expert" sender, given sufﬁcient funds.
The script used in the experiment will be varied between one that acknowledges past injustices and
one that does not.1Our outcomes of interest are posterior beliefs about seasonal ﬂu vaccination, WTP
for a free ﬂu shot coupon and redemption of the coupon.
We are interested in testing the following hypotheses: (1.a) whether low-income male subjects (both
pooled and separately by [CONTACT_545]) are more likely to be persuaded by [CONTACT_545]-concordant doctors; (1.b)
whether the subjects assigned to a race-concordant doctor are more likely to update/change their be-
liefs/behavior by [CONTACT_547]-discordant senders; and, (2) whether the racial concordance effect is similar
for Black and white male respondents. In addition, given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_213454]-run, a policy relevant question is whether commu-
nity health workers (CHW) or other ancillary staff could function in place of medical doctors when
recommending or informing about preventive health services. This could be a particularly effective
strategy for distributing routine preventive medical care.2Theoretically, doctors may have more exper-
tise when it comes to medical issues and may be viewed as more trustworthy, but laypeople might be
socially more proximate to the men we are trying to reach. Thus, we will test, within Black respondents,
whether a Black male doctor has the same effect as a Black male layperson (Hypothesis (3)). Finally, for
similar (pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]) reasons, we are interested in whether the current stock of medical doctors (which has
relatively few African-American and Hispanic doctors) could be trained in such a way to bridge any
racial discordance effect (if one is shown to exist in our context). Thus, among Black respondents, we

et al (2019).
[ADDRESS_256299] treatment (Hypothesis (4)).
The basic design requires collection of baseline and endline surveys combined with administrative
data from pharmacies about coupon redemption. The outcomes of interest are posterior beliefs about
the safety of seasonal ﬂu vaccination, WTP for a free ﬂu shot coupon, and redemption of the coupon.
Our ﬁeld experiment has the following structure:
1. Recruitment and Baseline Survey
(a) Recruit via Qualtrics during the ﬂu season.4
(b) Collect demographic information and healthcare experience.
(c) Elicit prior likelihood/intent for getting vaccinated and probability of getting sick with the
ﬂu.
(d) Elicit priors from subjects about ﬂu shot safety.
(e) Assign video treatment.
(f) Elicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a ﬂu shot coupon with a multiple price list.
(g) Elicit posterior likelihood/intent for getting vaccinated.
(h) Elicit posteriors about ﬂu shot safety .
(i) Elicit social distance between the sender and receiver.
(j) Elicit ratings on the sender in the video.
(k) Elicit attention to signal in the video.
(l) Distribute ﬂu shot coupons by [CONTACT_6968].
2. Endline Survey (2 weeks after baseline)5
(a) Elicit posteriors about ﬂu shot safety.
(b) Elicit self-report on whether received ﬂu shot.
(c) Elicit recall of information from baseline video.
(d) Debrief subjects.
3. Between Baseline and Endline
(a) Collect information on ﬂu shot coupon redemption from corporate partner.
3Although we could test both the layman and empathy with white respondents as well, it’s not clear how white respon-
dents will interpret the signal. Prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_213456], which might make them more socially proximate than white men dressed as laymen. In ad-
dition, by [CONTACT_213469]-relevant parameters, we increase our power by [CONTACT_213470] [ADDRESS_256300] shifted the release of the endline earlier to
reduce attrition.

2. Hypotheses Tested
In this study, we seek to answer the following research questions:
1. (a) Does racial concordance between an expert (i.e. doctor) sender and receiver affect ﬂu shot
beliefs and/or behavior, and (b) does a subject update beliefs more or change behavior with a
gender-discordant expert in a racial concordance setting?[ADDRESS_256301] of race concordance between expert sender and receiver stronger for Black vs. white
men?
3. Does a layperson sender work as well as an expert ﬁgure (i.e. medical doctor) in shifting the
beliefs and/or behavior of Black respondents?
4. If negative effects of a race-discordant expert sender to receiver exist, can these be mitigated by a
signal that acknowledges past injustices?
3. Research Strategy
3.[ADDRESS_256302] not yet received the ﬂu vaccine in the current ﬂu season. We aim
to recruit 70% non-Hispanic Blacks and 30% non-Hispanic Whites.
The target population is deﬁned by [CONTACT_4868]:
Demographic criteria For inclusion in our study are the following:
• Age: between 30 and 50 years old.
• Education: High school education or less.
• Gender: Male.
• Race: non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic white.
• Has not received the ﬂu shot in the current ﬂu season yet.
• Has sound on his device turned on.
Data quality checks Among the subjects who complete the baseline survey, we will further exclude
subjects from the analysis if they satisfy the following indicator for low-quality survey responses:
• Fast survey-taking: Within race and treatment group, among the 5% fastest in terms of total time
spent on survey.
6We will test Hypothesis 1(b) funds permitting.
3
• Nonsense answers in the open text sections that suggest low effort.7
• Inconsistent responses to questions.8
• Repeat survey takers.9
Flu shot coupon assignment Non-zero price draw: Among the subjects who complete the baseline
survey, we will further exclude subjects from the analysis if they are offered the chance to trade-in their
ﬂu shot coupon for a cash reward in the WTP elicitation module.[ADDRESS_256303] deviation units of 10 main outcome variables11. Details on how we computed
statistical power can be found in this document.
For hypothesis 1(a), we need 385 subjects for each treatment (i.e. racial concordance) and control (i.e.
racial discordance) to test an overall racial concordance effect across both Black and white respondents
assigned to an expert ﬁgure, detecting a difference in means (in standard deviation units) of 0.2. To de-
tect this effect size within each racial group, we need 415 subjects for treatment (i.e. racial concordance)
and control (i.e. racial discordance) group within Black respondents, and 370 subjects for treatment (i.e.
racial concordance) and control (i.e. racial discordance) group within white respondents.
For hypothesis 1(b), we need 430 subjects for treatment (i.e. concordance) and control (i.e. gender dis-
cordance) group within Black respondents assigned to a race-concordant expert delivering a standard
message. We need 450 subjects for treatment (i.e. gender concordance) and control (i.e. gender dis-
cordance) group within white respondents assigned to a race-concordant expert delivering a standard
message.
For hypothesis 2, we need to double the sample size needed to test an overall racial concordance effect
across both races assigned to an expert ﬁgure in order to test an interaction effect (i.e testing whether
the effect of concordance varies by [CONTACT_213471]).
7We refer to nonsense answers in the open text sections as answers that do not have decipherable English. We plan to
have Mturkers code this.
8Examples of inconsistent responses are (1) a respondent responds that he earns a high income but is unemployed or on
disability; (2) a respondent who replies inconsistently on WTP questions (i.e. he is willing to accept $1 for trading in a ﬂu
shot coupon but not $10).
9We will identify repeat survey takers by [CONTACT_213472].
10The probability of receiving the coupon trade-in opportunity is1
1000.
11The 10 main outcome variables are: (1) difference between prior and posterior beliefs in ﬂu shot side effects, (2) dif-
ference between posterior intent and prior intent for ﬂu shot, (3) WTP price, (4) whether R wanted the link to look up
pharmacy to redeem the coupon, (5) R’s likelihood of recommending a ﬂu shot to his friends/family, (6) R’s likelihood of
recommending the ﬂu shot video to his friends/family, (7) R’s subjective trustworthiness on the person in the video, (8) R’s
subjective rating on the qualiﬁcation of the person in the video, (9) whether R would want to ask the person in the video
about other health issues, and (10) whether person like the one in the video would be in R’s contact.

For hypothesis 3, we need 395 subjects for each treatment (i.e. Black respondents assigned to a race-
concordant expert delivering a standard message) and control group (i.e. Black respondents assigned to
a race-concordant layperson delivering a standard message) to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_256304]
deviations.
For hypothesis 4, we need 430 for each treatment (i.e. empathetic treatment arm) and control (i.e. stan-
dard message arm) within Black respondents assigned to a race-discordant expert in order to detect a
0.[ADDRESS_256305] deviations.
In conclusion, we need a sample size of 2,620 (1,720 Black and 900 white respondents) to test our main
hypotheses described in section 5.4with 80% power and at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05.
3.[ADDRESS_256306] to variation in the sender and
message. Each treatment will involve an infomercial video in which a male actor gives information
about the safety and efﬁcacy of the ﬂu shot. We will experimentally vary the: 1) race of the sender
(either African American or Caucasian), 2) the sender "expert" (either doctor or layperson), and 3) the
message (either M1 or M2). Funds permitting, we may also 4) vary the gender of the sender (either
male or female) for the subjects assigned to a race-concordant sender.
We produced videos with a total of [ADDRESS_256307] separately been rated on at-
tractiveness and other characteristics via Mturk. We also collected data from imdb.com and mandy.com
about age, education, height, and weight. In the doctor role, the actors wear a button-down blue shirt,
striped tie, a lab coat and stethoscope. In the layperson role, they wear a white T-shirt. The baseline
script video is about 40 seconds long and is reproduced below.12
Message 1 (M1) script reads:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommends everyone 6 months and older get the ﬂu
shot. The shot protects you from getting sick by [CONTACT_213473] ﬂu in half. It’s also very safe:
less than [ADDRESS_256308] myself,
my family, and my community. I recommend you look into getting vaccinated as soon as possible.
Message 2 (M2) script is identical to the above, except that we added three more sentences acknowl-
edging historical injustices committed by [CONTACT_187050]. They are highlighted in bold-face
below:
12See appendix materials to this pre-analysis plan for two examples of the videos we recorded.
[ADDRESS_256309]. But I hope that sharing some informa-
tion with you can help you understand how important the ﬂu shot is. The shot protects you from getting
sick by [CONTACT_213473] ﬂu in half. It’s also very safe: less than [ADDRESS_256310] to variation in the sender and message. There will be an
equal draw for Black and white senders, an equal draw for male and female senders within each race
concordance group, an equal draw of M1 and M2, and an equal draw towards a expert vs. layperson.
Within each treatment group except the gender treatment group, subjects will be randomly assigned
to one of the 5 recorded actors of the assigned race. For the gender treatment group, subjects will be
randomly assigned to one of the 10 recorded female or male race-concordant actors; we will assign
subjects to each actor with equal proportion.
All subjects will receive a free ﬂu shot coupon, with all individuals informed during WTP elicitation
that they may have the opportunity to trade-in the coupon for a cash reward. Participants will be pro-
vided the ﬂu shot coupon without the opportunity to trade it in for cash with probability999
1000. This is
so that we can measure coupon redemption in the majority of the sample.
We checked whether asking priors changes behaviors via a “doubling down effect” or engaging System
II vs. System I in decision-making. We did not see a strong effect and scaled up the asking of priors to
all respondents (See Appendix Section Dfor pi[INVESTIGATOR_213457]).
Please see Figure 1for the overview of the study design.
13For the layperson video , we replaced the word “cannot” with “can’t” for the phrase “cannot get the ﬂu virus from the
shot.”

3.5 WTP elicitation
Redemption rates of the ﬂu shot coupon (Redemption) as well as willingness to pay (WTP) for the
coupon are the main outcomes of interest in this study. We will use the following method to elicit ﬂu
shot coupon valuations in an incentivized manner.
Immediately after the video treatment stage, we will offer the ﬂu shot coupon to all participants. We
will then inform participants that they may be offered the chance to trade in their ﬂu shot coupon for
cash. Participants will then be shown a multiple price list and asked, for each amount, whether they
would prefer to keep the ﬂu shot coupon or receive a cash reward of the given amount instead.14The
price list includes prices $1, $2, $5, and $10. Prices will be presented as a take-it-or-leave-it offers.
Following WTP elicitation, the computer will randomly choose at random whether the participant will
be offered the chance to trade in the ﬂu shot coupon for cash. If the participant is selected for a chance
to trade in the coupon, the computer will proceed to randomly draw one price offer for that participant.
If the subject accepted at the price drawn, he will receive the cash reward of the given amount in lieu
of the ﬂu shot coupon. If the subject rejected the price, he will not receive the coupon and keep the ﬂu
shot coupon instead. We will skew towards providing subjects with the ﬂu shot coupon without the
opportunity to trade it in so that we can observe redemption decisions for most subjects.
Since our target population is expected to have lower literacy and numeracy then other experimental
samples, we have striven to keep our questions about WTP straightforward and provide an explana-
tion in words of the consequences of each decision.[ADDRESS_256311] is to inform respondents that they can enter a lottery for $[ADDRESS_256312] procrastination.
This strategy is helpful under the following circumstance: Although our intervention shifts beliefs in
the right direction (i.e. towards increased net beneﬁts of the ﬂu shot), beliefs about net beneﬁts are still
below the internal “threshold" for taking the action to redeem the coupon – see theories of behavior
change in Prochaska and Wayne (1997).16That is, even after our intervention subjects are potentially
14In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we paid participants $[ADDRESS_256313] from their overall survey earnings to receive the ﬂu shot coupon. For our main study, we
are using Qualtrics to handle participant payment and deducting from earnings is not logistically feasible, particularly as
participants will be paid less than $[ADDRESS_256314] training/understanding questions in
the survey.
16According to the transtheoretical model in Prochaska and Wayne (1997), behavioral change is a “process involving
progress through a series of stages", which is composed of precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, mainte-
nance, and termination.
[ADDRESS_256315] few participants to drop out after watching the video but prior to
completing the survey as they would forfeit payment. Secondary outcome variables collected in the
endline survey may be impacted by [CONTACT_113479]. These variables are "Flu shot - self report / spouse /
child", all secondary outcomes in the "beliefs about the ﬂu and ﬂu shot" section, and all attention/recall
questions elicited at endline.
4. Fieldwork
4.[ADDRESS_256316] data from two sources - online surveys and administrative data on ﬂu coupon redemp-
tion from the pharmacies. The surveys will be hosted by [CONTACT_213474]. Individual-level
data on ﬂu shot coupon redemption will be sent by [CONTACT_213475], the company that will provide the
ﬂu shot coupons to us. The coupons are redeemable at all major pharmacies, such as CVS, Walgreens,
Kroger, and Wal-Mart, in the US.18
4.2 Incentives
For the main study, Qualtrics will be responsible for administering payment for completing the baseline
survey.19Baseline survey payment will vary depending on the panel to which the participant belongs,
but will average about $2.5. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_256317] for completing the endline survey.
Among baseline survey participants who redeem the ﬂu shot coupon within 5 days of coupon receipt,
we will draw a lottery winner and pay the winner a $[ADDRESS_256318] during the ﬂu seasons of 2019-20 and 2020-21. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_213458] 2019 and ended in March 2020.20Our main study will launch in October 2020,
17The one potential drawback is that ﬁnancial incentive/lottery overpowers the lighter touch treatment that we give via
the videos. Because we are not interested in whether incentives change behavior, we are not randomizing the lottery.
18See list of participating pharmacies here: https://www.totalwellnesshealth.com/pharmacy-2/.
19Participants received a $[ADDRESS_256319] for completing the baseline survey in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and a payment varying between
$5 and $[ADDRESS_256320], which ran from October to December 2019, recruited using Qualtrics and was
unsuccessful due to imprecise targeting of low-education individuals and too many (16) treatment arms. The second, which
ran from December 2019 to March 2020, recruited using Qualtrics and online ads on Facebook and Google. We accrued 853
completed responses through Qualtrics. Our recruitment via online ads was unsuccessful, with an extremely low number
of completed responses and high costs. Learning from the experiences of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409], we plan on scaling-up the Qualtrics
9
with data collection projected to be completed by [CONTACT_213476].
Data collection will entail three components: baseline survey responses, endline survey responses, and
data on ﬂu shot coupon redemption. We will link the data across the three components using a unique
numeric study identiﬁer (ID) for each subject. In practice, we will assign the ID in the baseline sur-
vey, where we also collect subjects’ email addresses. After a participant who is eligible for the coupon
completes the baseline survey, he will receive the coupon immediately by [CONTACT_6968]. The coupon has the
subject’s study ID printed on it. When a coupon is redeemed at a pharmacy, the pharmacist will record
the ID and automatically pass it on electronically to TotalWellness for billing. TotalWellness in turn will
collect the IDs of redeemed ﬂu shot coupons and pass the list on to the research team for billing.
In addition to the above, we will collect data from a separate sample of low-income men regarding
feedback on the actors including their attractiveness, tone and trustworthiness.
4.[ADDRESS_256321]. Any PII will be dropped from the dataset, since it is not needed for the analysis. It is anticipated
that do ﬁles that create and analyze the data will be made available to other research teams. The clean
data (without identiﬁers) will also be made available. Only non-PII information on the actors will be
released.

elicitation as detailed in Section 3.5. Coded as the price on the multiple price list immediately
below the minimum price at which a subject opted to receive the corresponding cash reward
rather than the ﬂu shot coupon. If a subject opted to trade-in the coupon for cash at all prices,
WTP will be coded as 0. Because our funding is currently limited, we may not have the power to
detect all differences but we are actively pursuing sources.

29We will also have a balance test for the actors across race. Caucasian respondents are included reducing the chance
that a racial concordance effect for African-American subjects, for example, is being driven by [CONTACT_213490]-American actors
being more attractive, higher quality etc than the Caucasian actors. This is because the same set of African-American
actors/videos would not have the same predicted effect on Caucasian subjects. It’s also possible that if there are differential
perceptions across expert race by [CONTACT_213491], this is mediating any racial concordance effect we ﬁnd.

• Prior Subjective Belief on Cost of Flu Shot
• Ever Vaccinated in the Past 5 Years

5.4 Treatment Effects
We intend to measure the treatment effects in the following primary outcomes:
5.4.1 Beliefs
•y1: difference between prior and posterior beliefs about ﬂu shot safety, such that:
y1i=m0
1i m1
1i
where m0
1iis subject i’s prior belief on the perceived safety of the ﬂu vaccine, while m1
1iis subject i’s
update belief on the perceived safety. If the information from the video shifts the subject’s priors
to the truth, y1iis positive.
•y2: difference between prior and posterior intention for a ﬂu shot, such that:
y2i=m1
2i m0
2i
where m0
2iis subject i’s prior intention for getting a ﬂu shot, while m1
2iis subject i’s posterior inten-
tion for getting a ﬂu shot. If the subject becomes more willing to get a ﬂu shot after watching the
video, y2iis positive.
5.4.2 Actions
•y3: highest WTP price for a ﬂu shot coupon within a set of prices, $1, $2, $5, $10. If a subject rejects
all the prices, it is recorded as $0.
•y4: pharmacy look-up, which is equal to [ADDRESS_256329] wanted a link to look up pharmacy where
he can redeem his coupon, or 0 otherwise.
•y5: coupon redemption, which is equal to 1 if redeemed, or 0 otherwise.

5.4.3 Endorse
•y6: likelihood to recommend the video to friends or family.
•y7: likelihood to recommend a ﬂu shot to friends or family after watching the video.
5.4.4 Ratings
•y8: video rating about trustworthiness of the actor in providing medical advice (scaled from 1 to
5).
•y9: video rating about qualiﬁcation of the actor in providing medical advice. (scaled from 1 to 5)
5.4.5 Social Proximity
•y10: willingness to ask the actor about other health issues, which is equal to 1 if willing, or 0
otherwise.
•y11: likelihood of having the one in the video in the subject’s contact, which is equal to [ADDRESS_256330] six indices, for each individual i, such that:

We intend to test the following hypotheses with this outcome variable:
H1(a): Y0is higher for subjects randomized to a race-concordant expert than those randomized to a
race-discordant expert.

1c1ja=1,e=[ADDRESS_256331] and actor characteristics would be balanced across arms but it’s possible there is imbal-
ance by [CONTACT_3364]. Additional important controls in our context may be the timing in which recruitment
occurs relative to the ﬂu season and the local intensity of the ﬂu virus nationally or at a more local
geographic level (i.e date and place of recruitment). We will use double-selection LASSO to choose a
control set.[ADDRESS_256332] are the b. If race concordant pairs update more than race-discordant among
those assigned to an expert sender delivering no empathetic message, then b1should be positive (neg-
ative) and signiﬁcant for the outcomes of effectiveness (harm).32
H1(b): Y0is higher for subjects randomized to a gender-discordant expert than those randomized to a
gender-concordant expert within race concordance treatment group.

respondents assigned to a racial concordant sender delivering a standard message, M1. If b2is nega-

concordant setting.

term tests the effect of racial concordance(or discordance) across Black and white respondents.
30A subset of these questions are also asked in the baseline survey to the experimental sample. These variables include
perceived age, qualiﬁcations, education, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. We will also use a voice analytic software to
characterize the actors’ voices.

than for a Black respondent assigned to a Black layperson sender.

i,r=bis an indicator for random assignment to an expert actor among the Black respondents
assigned to a racial concordant sender delivering a standard message, M1. If b4is positive and signif-
icant, this suggests that an expert is speciﬁcally important for Black respondents in terms of updating
beliefs in a racial concordant setting.
H4: For Black respondents, Y0is higher for subjects randomized to a race-discordant expert delivering
an empathetic message, M2, than those randomized to a race-discordant expert delivering a standard
message.

i,r=bis an indicator for random assignment to receive a empathetic message among the
Black respondents assigned to a race-discordant expert sender. If b6is positive and signiﬁcant, this
suggests that, in a race-discordant setting, validating perceived mistreatment in the past by [CONTACT_13461]
ﬁgure makes Black respondents update their beliefs more.
5.5 Heterogeneous Effects
Important secondary analyses will include investigating variation in the treatment response through
interaction effects and sample splits. In particular, we are interested in whether the:
• persuasion treatment effects (TE) (racial and gender concordance, expert and/or empathy) are
different for Black and white respondents
• persuasion treatment effects interact with each other
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213492]33
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213493] (beliefs about safety of shot)
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213494] ﬂu shot
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213495] (e.g. insurance
status, marital status, has PCP , education)
• TE vary by “social distance” between the sender and receiver.34
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213496], such as ﬂu severity, ﬂu shot availability, perceived and actual number
of individuals vaccinated in community
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213497]
• TE vary by [CONTACT_213498] ﬁnding heterogeneous treatment effects
33Attention may also be an outcome, if so we would be estimating complementary effects.

[ADDRESS_256333] Error Adjustments
Although the level of randomization is the individual (respondent) there could be correlation across
individuals randomized to the same actor-script-expert combination. Since we have 40 such treatment
clusters we will plan to cluster at this level. We will also use randomization inference to calculate
p-values (i.e. RI-test command developed by [CONTACT_213499]ß).[ADDRESS_256334] of a concordant source on demand for information on
a potential COVID-19 vaccine. This module will be presented to participants in the baseline survey
following the inﬂuenza vaccination modules.
Subjects will be invited to receive the results of an upcoming expert review of a COVID-19 vaccine. The
institution conducting the expert review will be randomized to either be the Food and Drug Administa-
tion (FDA) or the National Medical Association (NMA), the largest national organization representing
African American physicians in the [LOCATION_002]. The two messages presented to participants are re-
produced below.
Message 1C (M1C) reads:
The National Medical Association (NMA), which represents Black physicians and health professionals in the US,
will perform an independent review of the safety and efﬁcacy of any COVID-19 vaccine approved by [CONTACT_1622].
Once a vaccine has been developed and the NMA has completed its review, would you like to receive an email
notiﬁcation with the results of the review?
Message 2C (M2C) reads:
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has formed an advisory committee of experts, who will perform an
independent review of the safety and efﬁcacy of any COVID-19 vaccine approved by [CONTACT_1622]. Once a vaccine

ﬁcation with the results of the review?
The outcomes of interest will be demand for information on COVID-[ADDRESS_256335] in learning about opportunities provided through the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to participate in COVID-[ADDRESS_256336] - that is the design and execution of the ﬁeld experiment, as well as
the analysis of the collected data. Min Jeong (Joyce) Kim and Nikhil Shankar will support the project
as research assistants, and will assist in all aspects of project implementation.

D. Information on Initial Pi[INVESTIGATOR_213464], we ran two pi[INVESTIGATOR_213465]-
mental design. Our ﬁrst pi[INVESTIGATOR_213466] [ADDRESS_256337] effects. However, among less educated, African-American subjects, there was some indication
that the aforementioned interventions might prove effective (see power calculation above for further
details).
During the ﬁrst pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we had difﬁculty ﬁlling in cells for older African-American men using a Qualtrics
panel. We modiﬁed recruitment for part of our second pi[INVESTIGATOR_213467]/
Facebook. Unfortunately, targeting was more imprecise using online advertisements, and our cost per
[ADDRESS_256338] "persuasive" intervention did not shift beliefs
enough so as to pass individuals’ net beneﬁt thresholds and trigger coupon redemption. Thus, we
added in our second pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a deadline to the coupon (currently within 5 days of receipt) for entry into a
lottery among those who redeem in that time frame.
Third, in the ﬁrst pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we randomly assigned half the sample to a survey that elicited prior beliefs
about the ﬂu and the ﬂu shot and the other half to a survey that did not elicit priors. The rationale was
that while priors are key heterogeneity dimensions of interest and while they increase the power of
our analysis, we were worried that they would trigger a "doubling-down" effect or lead individuals to
engage System II more often, thereby [CONTACT_213500] (because not externally
valid) way. However, our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_213468]. Therefore, starting in the second pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],
we plan on asking these questions to everyone.

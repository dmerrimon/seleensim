Why am I being asked to volunteer?  
You are being invited to participate in a research study. Your participation is voluntary 
which means you can choose whether or not you want to participate. If you choose 
not to participate, there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 
Before you can make your decision, you will need to know what the study is about, the 
possible risks and benefits of being in this study, and what you will have to do in this 
study. The research team is going to talk to you about the research study, and they will 
give you this consent form to read. You may also decide to discuss it with your family, 
friends, or family doctor. You may find some of the medical language difficult to 
understand. Please ask the study doctor and/or the research team about this form. If 
you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form.  
IRB Approved from: 03/10/2016 to: 01/07/[ADDRESS_2959] been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Treatment for pancreatic cancer 
involves surgery as well as chemotherapy (usually with a drug called Gemzar or 
gemcitabine), radiation therapy, or a combination of both (chemoradiotherapy) used 
after surgery (adjuvant therapy .  For patients like you with pancreatic cancer for whom 
surgery is an option, routine care is surgery followed by [CONTACT_3360].  
Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania, Abramson Cancer Center, are conducting a 
study looking at comparing two chemotherapy regimens given before and after chemoradiation.   All of the drugs used in this study are approved by [CONTACT_3361] (FDA) for the treatment of cancer.  Both treatment regimens used in this study have been previously studied and shown to improve survival when 
comparerd to gemcitabine alone.  The first regimen is called FOLFIRINOX.  This is a regimen which includes 5 -flourouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxapliplatin.  The 
other regimen being studied is gemcitabine and abrax ane.  
What is the purpose of this research study?  
The overall goal of this clinical trial is to learn which of these treatment regimens is more effective at reducing the risk of your pancreatic cancer recurring after surgery . 
This study also intends to look at blood and tissue samples to help doctors better understand who is at risk for cancer recurrence.  All patients will receive standard 
treatment for their disease: surgery followed by [CONTACT_3362].  
How long will I be in the study? How many other people will be in the 
study?  
It is estimated that patients enrolled in this study will participate for about [ADDRESS_2960] of your life. The study plans to enroll up to 50  patients with pancreatic cancer for whom surgery and 
chemoradiation is the recommended treatment plan.  
What am I being asked to do?  
Before you begin the study:  
You will need to have the following ex ams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be 
in the study. These exams, tests and procedures are part of routine cancer care, and may be done even if you do not join the study. These visits will occur in the outpatient clinic and will take approximat ely [ADDRESS_2961] be done within 4 weeks of starting this study.

Version 02-18-2016         3 of 19 These tests/procedures will be performed during the screening visit.  
• Review of your medical history including any medications that you may have 
taken recently or are currently taking, other medical problems you may have, and other treatments you have received fo r your cancer and how you 
responded to them.  
• Complete physical examination - including review of height/weight, blood 
pressure and heart rate  and an assessment of your ability to perform daily life 
activities (i.e. walking, house work, etc).  
• Routine blood tests - about 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to check for 
the following:  
o Blood cell counts (number of each type of blood cell)  
o Blood chemistry levels (to test your kidney and liver function and the minerals in your blood)  
o Tumor markers (CA19.9) : Tumo r markers are molecules occurring in blood 
or tissue that are associated with cancer and whose measurement or identification is useful in patient diagnosis or clinical management  
o Collection of one tube of blood, for research purposes only, to test for elem ents that might help predict who is at risk of disease recurrence  
• Pregnancy test - if you are a woman of child -bearing potential. A sample of 
your blood or urine will be needed to complete this test. This test must be done within 72 hours of starting the study drug. If you are pregnant, you cannot participate in this study.  
• Radiology tests – routinely used to assess your disease. These assessments may 
include a CT (computed tomography) scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, PET/CT (positron emission t omogr aphy/computed tomography) scan.  
These are routine procedures used to help doctors monitor your cancer. Your study doctor will explain these tests to you in more detail and let you know which type of scan(s) you will receive. The same type of scans wi ll be used 
throughout your participation on this study as these scans are standard of care for your disease.  
It is possible that after these tests are reviewed, you will not be able to take part in this study. There may be other reasons why you cannot participate. Your study doctor will 
discuss these with you. It is important that you answer all of the questions asked by [CONTACT_3363].  
IRB Approved from: 03/10/2016 to: 01/07/[ADDRESS_2962] been found to b e 
eligible to enter this study, and you agree to participate, you will be scheduled to return 
to the clinic to begin treatment on this study.  Which treatment you receive will be 
determined by a process called randomization.  This means that you will be randomly (by [CONTACT_3364]) assigned to receive either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/abraxane.  You will 
be informed of which treatment arm to which you are assigned.  If there are challenges with your insurance company, you will be offered the alternative treatment ar m.   If 
your insurance company fails to cover the cost of drugs on either arm, you will not be able to participate in this study.   
If you are randomized to receive FOLFIRINOX , treatment is as follows beginning on Day 
1 of each 2 -week treatment cycles for a total of 4 cycles or 8 weeks:  
   Oxaliplatin – 2 hour intravenous (IV, into a vein) infusion  
                 Irinotecan – 90 minute IV infusion  
                 Leucovorin – 2 hour IV infusion  
                  5Fluorouracil (5FU) – given 2 ways  
• As a quick (bolus) IV injection given by a nurse in the infusion suite through the IV tubing with a 5FU -filled syringe, followed by  
• An outpatient, [ADDRESS_2963] one, you will need a “port” or pi[INVESTIGATOR_3351] a

On Day [ADDRESS_2964] of care for your disease. Doctors in Radiation Oncology will review the processes and procedures f or 
chemoradiation as well as the risks, and you will be asked to sign the University of 
Pennsylvania’s consent for chemoradiation therapy. Briefly, chemoradiation requires 
that you have a “port” or some form of IV access that allows for the continuous infusion of a drug called 5 -FU that is used to make radiation therapy even more effective. 
Radiation therapy will take 5 ½ weeks to complete. You will receive radiation therapy 5 days per week for 5½ weeks. During the time you are receiving radiation treatment  you

the medication 5 -FU (Fluorouracil).  
After completed chemoradiation, you will repeat the 8  week s of  chemotherapy with 
FOLFIRINOX, as described above.   
 
If you a re randomized to receive gemcitabine/abraxane , treatment is as follows 
beginning on Day 1 of each 4 -week treatment cycle for a total of 2 cycles or 8 weeks:  
 
Gemcitabine – 30 minute intravenous (IV, into a vein) infusion , repeated days 8 
and 15   
  Abraxane  – 30 minute intravenous (IV, into a vein) infusion , repeated on days [ADDRESS_2965] should you experience unacceptable or intolerable side effects.    
Following 8 weeks of gemcitabine/abraxane, you will wait at least [ADDRESS_2966] of care for your disease. Doctors in Radiation Oncology will review the processes and procedures for chemoradiation as well as the risks, and you will be asked to sign the University of Pennsylvania’s consent for chemoradiation therapy.

Tests/Procedures:  
You will be asked to come into the clinic for tests/procedures  during the course of this 
study.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of routine cancer care for patients 
with pancreatic cancer.  In general, you will have a physical exam on day [ADDRESS_2967] tell your study doctor about all the medications you are taking throughout your participation in this research 
study since the effects of this study drug taken with other medications are not known.

Version 02-18-2016         6 of 19 What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
While on the study, you are at risk for the followin g side effects. Some of these side 
effects may be potentially serious or life -threatening, and may include death. You 
should discuss these with the study doctor. There may be side effects that are currently 
not known to us. If you experience side effects from this treatment, your study doctor may delay or skip a dose of the study drug,  reduce the doses  or ask you to stop study 
treatment. Your doctors may also give you drugs to help lessen these side effects. Many side effects go away shortly after the treatment is stopped, but in some cases side 
effects can be serious, long lasting or permanent. You should talk to your study doctor 
about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study.  
Risks associated with 5 -FU: 
The following side effects are  common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients 
taking 5 -FU: 
• Diarrhea.  
• Nausea and possible occasional vomiting.  
• Mouth sores.  
• Poor appetite.  
• Watery eyes, sensitivity to light (photophobia) . 
• Taste changes, metallic taste in mouth during infusion.  
• Discoloration along vein through which the medication is given.  
• Low blood counts.   Your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily 
decrease.   This can put you at increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding.  
Nadir: Meaning low point, n adir is the point in time betwe en chemotherapy cycles in  
which you experience low blood counts.  
Onset:  7-10 days  
Nadir:  9-14 days  
Recovery:  21-28 days  
These side effects are less common side effects (occurring in about 10 -29%) of patients 
receiving 5 -FU:  
• Skin reactions: Dry, cracking, peeling skin.   Darkening of the skin (hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]), 
darkening of the skin where previous radiation treatment has been given (radiation 
recall).  
• Hair thinning.  
• Nail changes - discoloration, loss of nails (rare) .

Version 02-18-2016         7 of 19 • Hand -foot syndrome (Palmar- plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE) -skin rash, swelling, 
redness, pain and/or peeling of the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet.   Usually 
mild, starting 5 -6 weeks after start of treatment.   May require reductions in the dose of 
the medication.  
Serious adverse reactions  to 5-FU are; chest pain, EKG changes and increases in cardiac 
enzymes - which may indicate problems with the heart.   These symptoms are very rare 
but increased for patients with a prior history of heart di sease.    
 
The use of oxaliplatin in combination with 5 -FU has, in very rare cases, been associated 
with a risk of veno -occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver, a form of serious liver injury.  
Signs of VOD include enlarged liver, fluid accumulation in the abdomen and jaundice 
(yellowing of the skin and eyes). VOD can result in permanent liver damage, enlarged spleen, serious systemic hypertension (high blood pressure) and a twisting of the veins in the esophagus  (can cause bleeding, nausea, vomiting and may require surgical repair).  
 
Risks associated with Leucovorin (LV): Leucovorin is generally well tolerated with rare 
allergic reactions being the most common side effect.  LV can also cause nausea, diarrhea and mouth sores.  In rare cases, it may cause seizures or low blood calcium levels.  
 
Risks associated with Oxaliplatin :  
Oxaliplatin Infusion Related Side Effects:  
• The feeling of difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath , jaw spasm, abnormal tongue 
sensation and feeling of chest pressure.   This has been reported rarely (<5%).   It 
generally starts within hours of Oxaliplatin infusion and often occurs upon exposure to 
cold.   Avoiding exposure to cold helps to prevent this adverse reaction.   Future 
Oxaliplatin infusions may be given over a longer time frame to help reduce the 
incidence.     
The following Oxaliplatin side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for 
patients taking Oxaliplatin : 
• Peripheral neuropathy  - Numbness and tingling and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_3352].   This symptom will generally lessen or go away between treatments, 
however as the number of treatments increase the numbness and tingling will take 
longer to lessen or go a way.  Your health care professional will monitor this symptom 
with you and adjust your dose accordingly.  
• Nausea and vomiting   
• Diarrhea  
• Mouth sores

• Constipation  
• Fever  
• Generalized pain  
• Headache  
• Cough  
• Temporary increases in blood tests measuring liver function.  
• Allergic reaction: a rare side effect, however, call for help immediately if you suddenly 
have difficulty breathing, your throat feels like it is closing, or chest pain.   Other signs of 
allergic reaction include rash, hives, sudden cough, or swelling of the lips or tongue.  
 
Risks associated with irinotecan :   
The following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients 
taking Irinotecan:  
• Diarrhea; two types early and late forms.  
• Early diarrhea: Occurring within 24 hours of receiving drug, accompanied by  [CONTACT_3366], increased salivation, watery eyes, sweating, flushing, abdominal 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  (This can occur while the drug is being administered.   If so, alert your 
healthcare professional promptly.   Medication can be given to stop and/or lessen this 
early side effect).  
• Late diarrhea: Occurring greater than [ADDRESS_2968] with health  care professionals 
for monitoring, and for medication and diet modifications  advice.    
• Nausea and vomiting.  
• Weakness.  
• Low white blood cell count. (This can put you at increased risk for infection).  
• Low red blood cell count (anemia).

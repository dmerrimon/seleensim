Phone: [ADDRESS_682320]  a prospective clinical trial  using a 2 x 2 factorial design;  
patients  with restless legs syndrome (RLS)  will be randomized to one of four treatment 
arms:  no intervention, MMF07 Foot Massager device  alone , heating  therapy  alone , and 
MMF07 Foot M assager device plus  heating therapy .  
 
Few clinical trials have looked into non -pharmacologic , non -invasive  treatment s for 
restless le gs syndrome, despi[INVESTIGATOR_525849], baths and vibration  can alleviate 
RLS sympto ms.  We would like to assess  whether the MMF07 Foot Massager  device 
and/or heating  therapy  is associated with improve d severit y of restless legs symptoms  as 
measured by [CONTACT_525861] .  Secondary outcomes 
include evaluating potential  changes in  both quality of life  and sleep  as measured by [CONTACT_525862], 
respectively .  Curren t therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525850] , therefore investigating  effective 
non-invasive treatments  that attenuate symptoms would be an important advancement in 
the treatment  of this aggravating disease.  
 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by [CONTACT_88086] , uncomfortable  sensations, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y present in the legs, which are temporarily relieved by [CONTACT_206697]. The 
pathophysiology of RLS is unknown.  Several theories exist, including microvascular 
abnormalities (1), peripheral hypoxia (2) and changes in dopamine rgic pathways  which 
may lead to lower iron levels in the brain (3). 
 
Pharmacologic trea tments  for RLS  include dopamine agonists, anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_231063], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_525851].   There is limited data supporting the use of clonidine, 
baclofen, tramadol and magnesium as  first- or second -line therapy.  Iron 
supplementation, orally or intravenously, is recommended for patients with low serum  
ferritin  levels . The only  randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study that 
evaluated oral iron therapy for  RLS did not provide  sufficient evidence to show that iron 
sulfate was a good  empi[INVESTIGATOR_525852]  (4).   
 
There are limitations to p harmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  For example, dopaminergic 
medications, conside red the gold standard treatment for RLS , are associate d with 
“augm entation,” a phenomenon characterized by  [CONTACT_525863], and ascend up the body, sometimes involving the arms and trunk.  Also, 
dopaminergic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525853], such as pundin g, 
pathologic gambling, binge eating and hypersexuality.  Anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698] , benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_525854], dizziness and mood changes.  
 
Non-pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525855] (EECP) (5), sclerotherapy (6), deep brain stimulation 
therapy  (7), and acupuncture (8).  Non-invasive treatments that are recommen ded for 
RLS patients  include warm or cool baths, massage, exercise, and staying mentally active 
as symptoms can be tri ggered when patients are bored.  To our knowledge, there have 
been no clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of heating therapy in treati ng RLS 
symptoms.  A recent study showed that external sensory input may lead to less leg 
discomfort in RLS (9).  In May 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted 
commercial clearance for the Relaxis  Pad to be marketed for improvement in the quality 
of sleep for patients with primary RLS.  This device, developed by [CONTACT_525864], is a 
vibrating pad that patients can place at their site of discomfort while remaining in bed.  A 
four week study publish ed in a non -MEDLINE -indexed journal found that treatment with 
such vibrating pads safely improved sleep in patients with RLS (10). 
 
Given t his knowledg e gap in the realm of non -pharma cologic, non -invasive treatments 
for RLS, our study aims to explore whether the MMF07 Foot Massager and/or heating 
therapy may alleviate  the symptoms of RLS.  
 
III. Procedures  
  
A. Research and Design  
 
Subject Selection/Sample  
 Inclusion criteria:  
1) Patients  between 18 -75 years old diagnosed with RLS according to  the 
diagnostic criteria of  the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group  
(11). 
2) Subjects should  have bothersome RLS symptoms, despi[INVESTIGATOR_525856]  
3) Subjects should be stable on all RLS medication for at least 4 weeks prior to 
enrollment   
4) All subjects must be able to read and write in  English  in order to be  able to 
complete home diary cards and questionnaires.   
5) All women of childbearing age must be using an acceptable form of birth 
control, including abstinence , IUD or intrauterine system in place for at least 
[ADDRESS_682321] or partner  using barrier method (e.g., 
condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) with spermicide from screening 
through study completion; partner has a documented vasectomy > 6 months 
prior to Baseline, Stable hormonal contraception (with approved oral, 
transdermal, or de pot regimen) for at least 3 months prior to screening.  
 
 Exclusion criteria:  
1) RLS secondary associated with end stage renal disease, iron deficiency or 
pregnancy  
2) Concomittant sleep disorders  
3) Does not have sufficient vision to be compl iant with study procedur es.  
4) Any other condition (other than the primary indications), which in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_525857] t o difficulty complying with the 
protocol  
 
 
 
 
 
No Intervention  
 
Patients receiving no intervention will be asked to not alter their nighttime 
 routine.   
 
MMF07 Foot Massager  
 
The MMF07 Foot Massager is manufactured by [CONTACT_525865], a company 
located in Arden, NC.  The MedMassager brand has been on the market for five 
years, but version s of this type of massager have been sold in the [LOCATION_002] 
for almost 30 years.   The MMF07 is engineered in an International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 9001 -2008 manufacturing facility and is Canadian 
Standards Association (CSA) certified for safety and reliability.  The massager 
is FDA certified for therapeutic use under regulation number: 890.5660.  
 
 
The MedMassager MMF07 utilizes a circular motion f ootplate to stimulate 
circulation in the lower extremities.   Rather than an up and down, vibrating 
motion which could cause too much stress, the MMF07 moves the feet and legs in 
a circle [ADDRESS_682322] that has 
been reported by [CONTACT_525866] i n the feet 
and/or legs  during use .   
 
Patients randomized to either  the MedMassager MMF07  only or MedMassager 
MMF07 and heating therapy cohort will be instructed to set this device at setting 
3, then increase or decrease the setting to their desired level of comfort.  They 
will be instructed to use this device for thirty minutes at bedtime.  Patients will 
be provided with a home diary to record duration and device setting on a nightly 
basis. They will be asked to otherwise not alter their nighttime routine.   
 
 
 
Heating  Therapy  
  
Patients randomized to either the heating therapy only or MedMassager MMF07 
and heating therapy cohort will be given an electric heating pad, and they will be 
instructed  to use this pad at the medium setting for thirty minutes at bedtime.  
They can adjust the setting to their level of comfort if needed. They will be 
provided with a home diary to record duration and pad setting on a nightly basis. 
Patient s will be asked to  otherwise not alter their nighttime routine.   
 
 
B. Measurement/Instrumentation  
 
1) International Restless Legs Severity Scale  (12): a [ADDRESS_682323] values ranging from 0 to 4 and the points are then 
added.  Higher values are associated with more severe symptoms.   
2) Restless Legs Quality of Life Questionnaire  (13): a series of 18 questions that 
are scored such that lower scor es indicate worse quality of life.  
3) Medical Outcomes Sleep Study scale (14): a series of 12 questions assessing 
quality of sleep, with values rangin g from 1 to 6  
4) Home diary (see attached)  
 
Visits will be at bas eline and at week 4.  O utcome measures will be self -administered  at 
each visit.  Medical history including demographic information and information about 
alcohol, drug and tobacco use will be collected at the baseline visit. Medications  and 
vital signs will be recorded at each visit.   Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all 
females of child bearing potential at baseline prior to randomization  and again at week 
4. Adverse events will be r ecorded at week [ADDRESS_682324] ical Considerations:   
 
A. Sample Size:  
A total of 40 patients will be accrued to the study with roughly equal allocation to each 
treatment arm.   This sample size will achieve over 90% power to detect a [ADDRESS_682325] roughly 80% power to detect a potential interaction effect 
between MedMassager MMF07 and heating therapy.  Every effort will be made to reduce 
attrition; consent documents will emphasize the importance of complete data and 
encourage patients to return for the follow -up visit.   
 
B. Randomization:  
Patients will be randomized to one of the four treatment options with equal allocation.  In 
an attempt to balance severity across treatment cohorts  the randomization scheme will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_525867] ( mild/moderate vs. severe/very severe ).  The randomization 
scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_525868] a web -based randomization program.  After the patients eligibility has  been confirmed 
and consent documents signed the research coordinator will randomize the patient to one 
of the four treatment options via the web -based randomization program.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_525858] .  
 
C. Analysis plan:  
All demographic and baseline characteristics of interest will be summarized both overall 
and by [CONTACT_9084].  Frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize categorical 
variables and means, standard deviations and other appropriate measures of spread for 
continuous variables.  ANOVA model s will be used for testing and to estimate the effects 
of MedMassager MMF07 alone, heating therapy alon e and the potential interaction 
between MedMassager MMF07 and heating therapy.  Sensitivity anal yses may be 
considered to assess the impact of baseline severity and other clinically relevant 
covariates on the outcomes.  We will adjust for multiplicity for all contrasts. Secondary 
outcomes will be analyzed using a similar approach.  Further details wi ll be provided in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).     
 
 
For study -related patient data (case report forms) a unique identifier will be used.  
Study -related documents will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked office.  A separate 
list (paper -only) will be made containing the unique identifier and the name [CONTACT_525870].  This list will be kept separate f rom the study related documents . Study 
databases will be stored on a password protected computer network in a locked office 
and kept for 5 yea rs.

 Study Design:  This is an open label, si ngle arm clinical trial to investigate the effect of SNF472 in uraemic 
calciphylaxis patients, on top of standard of care.  
Investigational 
Medicinal 
Product:  SNF472   
Presented as 10 mL or 5 mL of sterile liquid in transparent glass vial s, containing either 
300 mg or 450 mg of SNF472 , respectively . The SNF472 solutions used will be either 30 
mg/mL (Batch number P00142 -L001E ) or 90  mg/mL (Batch number  PD14081) and  will be 
diluted in a 100-mL saline bag and the contents of the whole bag will  be administered to the 
patient by [CONTACT_842705] . SNF472 will be administered between 2.5  h and a 4 h period using 
the dialysis system during the dialysis session.  
Number of 
Patients:  15 evaluable CUA patients  who complete the 12 -week treatment period.  
A total of 15 evaluable subjects was determined necessary to show with 80% power that 
the percentage of subjects for which the primary ulcer is totally or partially healed after 12 
weeks of treatment  is greater than 25%. For these calculations, it was assumed that the 
percentage of totally or partially healed subjects for SNF472 will be 60%.  
Study 
Population:   
Main inclusion criteria:  
1. Patients with  either  newly diagnosed CUA OR recurrent CUA that has been dormant 
with no skin lesion involvement for at least 90 days from study start (new or recurrent 
diagnos is must be made  within 5 weeks of study start)  
2. Patients who signed the written informed consent to participate in this clini cal trial (prior 
to any clinical trial -related procedures being performed), after reading the Patient 
Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form (ICF), and who had the opportunity to 
discuss the clinical trial with the Investigator or designee  
3. Males or fe males aged ≥[ADDRESS_1171131] at entry. Male patients 
having sexual relationship in which pregnancy can occur should take adequate 
contraceptive precautions (wear a condom)  (see section 8.3.1.)  
 
Main exclusion criteria:  
1. Body weight above 150 kg  
2. BMI >35 and central(abdominal) ulcers   
3. History of bisphosphonate treatment within 12 months before entering into the 
study  
4. Severely ill patients without reasonable expectation of survival for > 6 months 
according to the treating physician

7. Participation in another clinical trial with an experimental drug within 90 days  prior 
the inclusion  
8. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorders or resultant therapy that is 
likely to invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the patien t to comply with 
the Clinical Trial Protocol requirements  
9. Patients who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], are considered unsuitable for any 
other reason  
Study 
Procedures:  Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any study -related 
procedures are performed.  
The patient’s medical history, demographic, and baseline characteristics, as well as a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_842659], will be collected to determine the patient’s eligibility 
for inclusion, which will be analysed by [CONTACT_842706] (the “gatekeeper ”).  
Blood samples taken routinely from patients will be used as source data for the trial.  
SNF472 will be administered by [CONTACT_842707] a s ingle, constant dosage  for a minimum of 2.5h 
up to the whole duration of the dialysis session. SNF472 will be administered at three 
haemodialysis sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks . 
Follow -up assessments including lesion documentation and clinical status will be done at  
regular intervals (ulcer size, features, Bates -Jensen Wound tool assessment , pain, and 
Wound  QoL) over a period of 12 weeks  (see Table 1). Additional assessments will include 
safety  and assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamic  (PD) profile s. One 
sample of blood to measure biomarkers will be taken at the time of PK samples (see Table 
1). 
During the clinical trial, patients will be monitored closely for any adverse events (AEs).  
The time points where blood samp les will be taken to evaluate safety, PK , PD,  and 
biomarkers are specified in the Table of Assessments  (see Table 1). 
Criteria for 
Evaluation:  Safety:  
Safety parameters will include AEs and SAEs, clinical laboratory and haematology, clinical 
chemistry including plasma electrolytes, 12 -lead ECG , and physical examination.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
• Only C max (plasma concentration  at the end of drug infusion ) will be assessed.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Plasma  samples collected, at baseline and  around the tmax, from all subjects, w ill be used 
for exploratory PD assessment by [CONTACT_43119] v itro test to assess the propensity for 
hydroxyapatite crystal formation in plasma . 
Biomarker:  
Serum samples will be collected at baseline and at the end of the study, frozen, and used 
for exploratory biomarker assessment. The final list of biomarkers will be decided at a later 
time point.

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ZIP_CODE] Palma de Mallorca. Spain  2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background  
SNF472 is an intravenous (IV) formulation of the hexasodium salt of myo -inositolhexaphosphate (IP6, phytate). It is 
being devel oped for the treatment of calciphylaxis, as well as for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients 
with end -stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing haemodialysis (HD).  
2.1.1. Properties of Myo -Inositolhexaphosphate  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate is a naturally -occurring substance found in beans, brown rice, corn, sesame seeds, wheat 
bran, and other high -fibre foods. The calcium salt of IP6 is listed by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as 
generally recognised as safe (GRAS) [1]. It is highly polar and poorly absorbed when given orally. When high oral doses 
are administered, IP6 has chelating properties in the gastrointestinal lumen preventing the absorption of cations such 
as calcium, ma gnesium and iron  [2-4].  Due to this property it has been regarded for almost [ADDRESS_1171152] conventional analytical techniques. Its presence in human tissues and body fluids was 
only shown at the end of the 1990’s, after the development of sensitive assay methods [5-8]. In 1996, IP6 levels were 
shown to be present in human urine [9] and this led to the establishment of a link between IP6 and health, particularly 
with respect to calcium -related diseases, such as renal stones [10-12],  osteoporosis [13-15],  and CVC [16-18].  
When administering SNF472 to animals a s an IV bolus for 28  days, no adverse effects were reported up to 7.5 mg/kg 
in rats and 10 mg/kg in dogs. At 19 and 30 mg/kg , the observed adverse effects were related to the maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C max). The clinical signs in animals suggest that the chelation of cations in the blood in rats 
occurs well above the therapeutic dose levels ( 2 to 3mg/kg). Moreover, extensive telemetry studies in dogs showed 
that doses given by [INVESTIGATOR_123932], which leads to QTc prolongation, can be given by  [CONTACT_842711], including QTc. QTc prolongation can be reversed giving IV calcium gluconate. To avoid bolus C max-related 
adverse effects, IP6 will be administered by [CONTACT_842712]. The IV  route achieves higher 
plasma concentrations of IP6 than is feasible orally and avoids chelation within the gastrointestinal tract.  
2.1.2. Evidence for Efficacy in Calcium -Related Diseases  
Beneficial properties have been attributed to IP6 in oncology  [19-23] and calcium -related diseases (e.g.,  prevention of 
renal lithiasis  [10-12], osteo porosis  [13-15], CVC  [16-18], sialolithiasis  [24], and dental tartar  [25].

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ZIP_CODE] Palma de Mallorca. Spain  Myo-inositolhexaphosphate has been shown to prevent vascular calcification in a variety of animal models  [16-18].  
The in vitro  and in vivo  results show that SNF472 prevents the formation of hydroxyapatite  [26]. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_842667] a negative correlation between physiological IP6 levels and CVC. A high dietary intake of 
IP6 is associated with a lower incidence of aortic stenosis and aortic valve calcification  [27]. 
The inhibition of pathological processes of calcification in soft tissue by [CONTACT_431929]6 is accompanied by a positive effect on 
bone. Both animal models and epi[INVESTIGATOR_842668]6 could be an effective agent for treating osteoporosis 
by [CONTACT_842713]. Ovar iectomised Wistar rats with an IP6 enhanced diet had reduced loss of bone 
mineral density caused by [CONTACT_842714]  [13].  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate has also been shown to inhibit mineralisation in vitro  of MC3T3 -E1 osteoblasts cultures  
[28]. The potential mechanism is through binding to growing crystals and through induction of osteopontin expression. 
This data suggest that IP6 may regulate physiological bone mineralisation by [CONTACT_842715] a specific sign al at cellular level for the regulation of osteopontin. When incubating human mesenchymal 
stem cells (pre -osteoblasts) with IP6, bone formation activity was enhanced  [29]. 
Two epi[INVESTIGATOR_842669] 1500 and 180 subjects, showed that low IP6 intake was associated with a decline in 
vertebral and femoral bone mineral density  [14, 15]. A recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_842670] [ADDRESS_1171153]-menopausal women 
demonstrated that high IP6 exposure over 12  months was associated with lower bone mass loss and decreased 
fracture risk ( lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_842671]) [30]. 
Sodium phytate is also used for Technetium bone scanning (Fyton; 15 mg Na -phytate  [31]). The dose prescribed varies 
from a minimum of 2.5 mg to a maximum 5.0 mg of 99mTc -phytate. This combination is used in medicine as a source 
of radiation for radiotherapy and for diagnostic purposes. Published data shows two half -lives: t ½ α: 2.4 -7.0 min, t ½ β:

Renal Association/European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry, in 2014 the estimated number of new renal 
replacement therapy patients in the 25  countries of the European Union (EU) was 71  631 [33].There are approximately 
360,000  renal replacement  therapy patients in the EU, with 66% of them being treated by [CONTACT_842716] a functioning graft  [34]. 
Calciphylaxis is a rare disease (ORPHA280062) characterised by [CONTACT_842717]. It occurs mostly, but not exclusively in patients with ESRD and the mean life expectancy 
is even lower than for haemodialysis patients  [35]. The prevalence rate is well below the statutory thresholds for orphan

(FDA). It affects 1% to 4% of the ESRD population  [35]. 
2.2. Rationale for the Clinical Trial  
CUA patients are almost all on dialysis, except for a very small percentage who are non -uraemic. CUA has no specific 
treatment. Calciphylaxis is a life -threatening condition with a high mortality rate. The overall mortality in calciphylaxis 
patients with ESRD is 60 -80%  with a 1 year survival of 45%  [35, 36], whereas non-uremic calciphylaxis appears to 
have a slightly better prognosis with an overall mortality of 52%  [37].  
The difference between survival curves of cases and controls was most striking in the first year and more specifically 
in the first few months after the diagnosis of calciphylaxis  [38]. It is clear that the progression of calciphylaxis is highly 
aggressive with early mortality compared to HD patients without calciphylaxis. The mortality of non -uraemic 
calciphylaxis seems to be about 30% lower than in patients with uraemic calciphylaxis  [36, 37]. 
The pathophysiology of CUA involves  the deposition of calcium in the media of small vessels. This leads to regional, 
extremely painful ischemia leading to ulceration. The lesions tend to appear in the upper and lower limbs, although 
truncal lesions have also been described. In addition to t he pain – requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_842672] – these patients 
have an increased susceptibility to infections, which is responsible for over 50% of the mortality.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_842673], hyperbaric O2, bisphosphonates, surgic al debridement, and other locally 
implemented initiatives. However, these measures do not seem to improve either the course of the wound(s) or the 
high mortality rate  [39-42].   SNF472, due to its innovative mechanism of inhibition of the final common pathway of 
vascular calcification, has the potential to decrease the amount of vascular calci fication in these patients, hence 
shortening the time to healing of the wounds and potentially decreasing mortality rates. This study will address the 
potential of SNF472 to improve the course of the wounds seen in CUA patients.  
Further details can be foun d in the Investigator’s Brochure  [26]. 
See Section  4.3 for justification of the clinical trial design.  
2.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The currently available information of clinical experience with IV IP6 is based on:  
1. Technetium formulations for bone and other scans  
2. A single ascending dose study of SNF472 in healthy volunteers  
3. Both a single and repeated ascending dose study in haem odialysis patients treated for up to 28 days  
SNF472 has been extensively studied in non -clinical models for efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. The 
main toxicological finding with SNF472 in animals – at high doses only - is hypocalcaemia due to chelation of ionised

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ADDRESS_1171155] is not 
present in animals when the same bolus doses are administered by [CONTACT_202745]. Moreover, SNF472 
does not block the hERG channel ( Study N o SNFSF2010_01 A0189  [43]). The hypocalcaemia and the associated QTc 
effect are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_842674]. It is expected that the risk of associated hypocalcaemia 
will be minimal in haemodialysis patients , as slow infusions ranging from 2.5 to 4 hours will be used and the plasma 
calcium concentration is controlled by [CONTACT_842718]. Furthermore, in the unlikely situation of 
hypocalcaemia symptoms and signs occurring, they can be reversed by [CONTACT_842719] -gluconate.  
During the phase I studies with volunteers, single doses from 0.5 mg/kg to 12.5 mg/kg were administered  
(SNFCT2012_03 Part C) . A single dose of 9 mg/kg (SNFCT2012_03 Part C) and repeated doses from one to 20  mg/kg 
were studied (SNFCT2014_03) in haemodialysis patients. In healthy volunteers, SNF472 was generally well tolerated, 
except for the occurrence of mild to moderate local infusion site irritation. Infusion site irritation is not an issue i n HD 
patients, as SNF472 is injected into the HD tubing and pass es through a volume of blood of at least 200  mL before 
reaching the patient’s blood vessels.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs), assessed as probably related to the IP, were infusion site  pain, infusion 
site erythema, infusion site hypoaesthesia, and infusion site swelling. A single patient on the 9  mg/kg dose developed 
mild tingling of short duration twice (at 30 minutes and 2 hours) during the infusion. No treatment was required. 
Treatme nt-emergent AEs assessed as possibly related to the IP were injection site bruising, headache, dizziness, pain 
in extremity, lip tingling, and myalgia.  
A preliminary analysis of  the SAD study suggested that infusion of 5mg/kg, 9mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg caused increases 
in QTcB in HVs. These changes mainly occurred within the normal range and values outside the normal range were 
close to the upper limit of normal. No values were seen above 500 mSec (risk of Torsdes des Pointes). Mechanistically 
this can be expla ined by [CONTACT_842720]. It is also clear from limited data currently available that decreased 
ionized Ca is not a risk in HD patients due to slow infusion of SNF472, dilution of SNF472 in at least [ADDRESS_1171156] a favourable 
benefit/risk ratio.  
2.3.1. Efficacy  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate prevents vascular calcification in non -uremic and uremic animal models. Published studies  
[16, 17, 44], as well as the non -clinical studies with SNF472 have shown that parenteral IP6 significantly prevents 
vascular calcification by [INVESTIGATOR_82473] 60% and 95% in animal models. The SNF472 efficacy data obtained in animals have 
helped characterise the concentration -effect relati onship and were used to predict potential doses for human clinical

plasma levels in the 5000 -[ZIP_CODE] ng/mL ( 7.5-15 µM)  range, depending on the specifi c model used . 
In animal models of calciphylaxis, where a  dystrophic calcification in  rat’s soft tissues is induced, IP6 clearly reduces 
plaque formation (calcinosis cutis) induced by [CONTACT_842721] 4. Calcification was significantly lower in animals receiving IP6. In 
rats sacrificed two days after KMnO 4 treatment calcified deposits were only found in injured tissues of non -IP6 treated 
groups  (Study No EF2004_10  [45, 46]). 
IP6 has also been  shown to inhibit mineralisation in vitro of MC3T3 –E1 osteoblasts cultures  [28]. The potential 
mechanism is through binding to growing HAP crystals and by [CONTACT_842722]. When human 
mesenchymal stem cells (pre -osteoblasts) were incubated with IP6, bone formation activity was enhanced  [29]. 
SNFCT2012_03 Pharmacodynamic Data:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments (calcification potential of plasma  [47]), in healthy volunteers showed  a 80% inhibition 
at 5 mg/kg SNF472, which appeared to plateau thereafter since the effects were the same for the 9 and 12.5 mg/kg 
doses.  
SNFCT2012_03 Pharmacodynamic Data:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments in haemodialysis  patients showed  an 80% inhibition at 9 mg/kg SNF472 .

Pharmacodynamic assessments in haemodialysis  patients showed an 80% inhibition from 5  mg/kg SNF472 onwards. 
Less than 20% effect was seen at 1 mg/kg .

SNF472, calcium, and potassium levels were evaluated. Health status, body weight, cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], ECG, 
body temperature, total (serum), and free (blood) concentrations of potass ium were not affected by a 2 -hour infusion 
of SNF472 at 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30  mg/kg. QTc prolongation was observed with the 6 -minute bolus at 30  mg/kg, 
but no QTc prolongation was seen with the  2-hour infusion at any of the doses. During the 2 -hour infu sion, plasma 
concentrations achieved similar C max values (318180  ng/mL) as with a  bolus  (although this might be an under -
estimation  as it is difficult to pi[INVESTIGATOR_263097] C max after a bolus injection ). 
Please refer to the Investigators Brochure  [26] for furth er toxicology data.  
SNFCT2012_ 03 Healthy  Volunteers  Safety data 
There were no SAEs, no deaths, and no withdrawals due to AEs during the study. The number of subjects with TEAE s 
(Treatment emergent adverse event) was similar for all dose groups. TEAE s were mostly mild in intensity and 3 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_842677] 5.0  mg/kg SNF472 dose and 4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_51952] 12.5  mg/kg dose.  
No clinically significant chan ges were observed in plasma calcium levels. Although ionised calcium levels were 
measured, several errors occurred in terms of sampling and analysis:  
• As a result of incorrect handling and extraction of samples, the majority of the samples could not be 
analysed.  
• Due to analytical errors, several results in the samples analysed were considered invalid.  
The most complete data from ionised calcium set was obtained for the 5 mg/kg dose. In the 12.5 mg/kg dose, there 
appeared to be a decrease in ionised calcium  within the normal range. The baseline values for the other doses were 
limited. No formal statistical analysis could be done due to the sparse data. In an attempt to get an idea of baseline 
values in the study populations, we used the ionised calcium befor e the infusion of placebo or active drug was started, 
as well as the 12 -hour values (8 hours after C max at a time when no SNF472 was detectable in the blood) and we 
compared with values obtained around t max and per dose. Hence, the ionised calcium concentrations seem to be similar 
to the pooled baseline values with 5  mg/kg of SNF472. With the 9 mg/kg dose, the two available values seem to be at 
the lower end of the distribution of baseline values, whereas with 12.5 mg/kg dose, two of the three available values 
are below the baseline values. The data, although sparse, suggest that there possibly was a dose -related decrease in 
ionised calcium.  
There were, however, no clinical features of hypocalcaemia or clinically relevant increases in QTc observed with any 
of the three doses evaluated. SNF472 concentrations achieved with 12.5 mg/kg were around eight -fold high er than the 
anticipated therapeutic concentrations.

the DESC (Dose Escalation Safety Committee) decided to increase the dose to be tested in the 2nd cohort (1.5  mg/kg) 
to 5 mg/kg. This decision was based on PK results showing muc h lower values than the anticipated systemic exposure 
of around 2500 ng/mL as predicted by [CONTACT_842723] (levels were below the limit of quantification of 500 ng/mL). 
According to new PK estimations, 5 mg/kg was expected to produce the initially expected le vel of exposure with 1.5 
mg/kg. The C max with 5 mg/kg was [ZIP_CODE] ng/ml, which is nearly triple the anticipated EC50. Using the PK data of the 
5 mg/kg dose and the safety data after each cohort, the DESC decided to modify the following two doses to reach the  
target concentrations. The doses of 9 and 12.5 mg/kg produced SNF472 plasma levels of [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]  ng/mL, 
respectively.

As a conclusion for Phas e 1 clinical trials pe rformed with SNF472 up to date:  treatment -emergent adverse events seen 
exclusively in healthy volunteers and not in HD patients, and assessed as probably related to the investigational 
medicinal product (IMP), were infusion site pain,  infusion site erythema, infusion site hypoesthesia, and infusion site 
swelling. Treatment -emergent adverse events, assessed as possibly related to the IMP, were injection site bruising, 
headache, dizziness, pain in extremity, eyelid injury, and myalgia. T hese effects were not seen in HD patients. A single 
SAE was recorded and was not related to treatment. No clinical significant effects were observed on vital signs, or in 
the laboratory test s.  ECG s, including the QTc interval, was fully evaluated and no clinical ly significant effects were 
observed.   It showed the following:  
o   QTcB prolongation in  HV was found ( all values were below 450 msec) .  Sparse ionised calcium data 
suggested mild hypocalcaemia, correlating with QTcB  
o   QTcB prolongation in HD pat ients occurred with active as well as placebo treatment. It was not 
associated with hypocalcaemia and a relationship to chelation of calcium can be ruled out  
QTc changes are often seen in HD patients and can be due to the composition of the dialysis fluid,  underlying 
cardiovascular disease, changes in Ca, Mg, or K, or du e to medication. As HD patients  showed no significant decreases 
in ionized Ca, SNF472 does not affect hERG channels and  QTcB prolonga tions also occurred in placebos;  an SNF -
related effect is  therefore highly unlikely.

SNF472 administered i.v.  is 100% bioavailable. No compliance issues will be expected with the IV route in patients

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ZIP_CODE] Palma de Mallorca. Spain  4. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY  
4.1. Overview  
The study will be done together with [CONTACT_842756], MD, as the main Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_842678].  To reach the study objectives,  15 evaluable CUA patients  who complete the 12 -week treatment period 
will be enrolled  
The primary investigator, Prof. V Brandenburg,  will be responsible for the diagnosis of CUA together with the locally 
treating physician at the study site (team decision, two -pairs -of-eyes decision). The decision to include the patient into 
the study should be made based on the following criteria  [48]:   
• The diagnosis of calciphylaxis can be made wh en: 
1. The following clinical features are all present, or  
2. Two of the following clinical features and typi[INVESTIGATOR_842679]  
• Clinical features:  
1. A patient on chronic haemodialysis or h aemofiltration or h aemodiafiltration for ch ronic kidney disease  
2. More than 2 painful and non -treatable skin ulcers with concomitant painful purpura  
3. Painful and non -treatable skin ulcers on the trunk, extremities, or penis with concomitant painful purpura  
• Histopathological findings:  
Skin biopsy is recommended only if the three clinical findings presented above are not present and will be left 
to the discretion of the treating physician. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_842680]:  
- Necrosis and ulceration of the skin with calcification of the tunica media and internal elastic membrane of 
small to medium -sized arterioles of dermis and subcutaneous fat  
- Concentric stenosis due to oedematous  intimal thickening of the small to medium -sized arterioles of 
dermis and subcutaneous fat 
Intense pain as primary manifestation followed and associated with cutaneous lesions and palpation of firm calcified 
(leather -like) subcutaneous tissue surrounding the lesion is suggestive of calciphylaxis. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , the lesions do not 
occur at sites primar ily affected by [CONTACT_842725]. In view of the painful character of the 
lesions, palpation is left to the discretion of the treating physician.  
The diagnosis of calciphylaxis can be supported by [CONTACT_842726] a skin biopsy. Benefits of a biopsy include 
exclusion of other conditions that can mimic calciphylaxis such as vasculitis. The characteristic histological features of 
calciphylaxis include calcification, microthrombosis, and fibrointimal hyperplasia of sma ll dermal and subcutaneous

[39-41].  
Performing a skin biopsy will be left to the discretion of the treating physician and will be performed following the site’s 
SOPs. In case the biopsy is performed as a routine procedure at the site, and the result is positive for CUA, the patient 
is includ ed – as long as the “gatekeeper”, namely [CONTACT_842757],  agrees with the remaining diagnostic parameters. 
If the biopsy is negative, [CONTACT_842758]  will check the biopsy results and will decide if he agrees or disagrees with 
the remaining diagnostic p arameters  to include or not the patient .  
In order to have readable biopsies, the following requisites need to be fulfilled:  
1. site of biopsy: the biopsy should include the ulcer borders, not the necrotic core, and be deep enough to 
show deep skin layers  
2. the biopsy material should be fixed in either formalin or paraformaldehyde  or glutaraldehyde   
3. paraffin blocks should be mailed to the core pathology lab (Prof K Amann, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]),  where 
appropriate stains such as EVG, von Kossa, etc. will be  performed  
Wound treatment of calciphylaxis ulcerations will be performed according to local good clinical practice SOPs of the 
corresponding clinical site irrespective of the fact that the ulceration might be evaluated as treatment target within the 
trial. Such a wound treatment SOP might include the interdisciplinary team approach by [CONTACT_484627], dermatologists , 
(plastic) surgeons, and specialized nurses.  
4.2. Endpoints  
4.2.1. Primary endpoint   
• The primary lesion is the largest one – based on longitudinal and transverse measurements - and the one to 
be followed through imaging throughout the duration of the study by [CONTACT_36794][INVESTIGATOR_842681] (more details 
concerning the imaging of the lesions  will be addressed in the imaging manual)  
• A maximum of 3 lesions – including the primary one – will be thoroughly assessed during the study  
• Lesion score (Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool  [49]) will be performed during Weeks 1, 2, then 4, 6, 8, 
10, 12 , and EOS (FU) visit. Of note, elements of the Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool which imply 
probing the wound or measuring its depth are left to the discretion of the treating physician at the site and are 
not compulsory

4.3. Justification of the Clinical Trial  Design  
Preclinical data with SNF472 supports the hypothesis that the compound is able to prevent cardiovascular calcification 
(CVC) . Calciphylaxis is a rare  condition with a high mortality rate. It is characterised by [CONTACT_842727], necrotic, 
skin ulcerations, and calcification of blood vessels. It occurs mostly (98% of cases), but not exclusively, in patients with 
ESRD, where it is also referred to as Calciphic Uremic Arteriolopathy (CUA). “Standard of care” of calciphylaxis is not 
defined by [CONTACT_842724]. However, experts in the field suggest a personalised management plan, taken from 
each calciphylaxis patient a personalized selection from a  homogenous list of measures to be taken which have 
recently been summarized  [39, 41]. Since there is no standard of care and one-year mortality rates are about 50% -in 
a year , the study is open -label and has no placebo control arm.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1171163] been assessed, both in single and multiple 
dosing and up to one month of treatment. Calciphylaxis patients are HD patients;  hence SNF472 is expected to have 
the same PK/PD and safety features .

Possible reasons for withdrawal of a subject from the clinical trial:  
• Subject does not fulfil inclusion criteria  
• AE(s)  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
• Protocol violation  
• Pregnancy  
• Other reasons as judged by [CONTACT_093]  (see also  7.1.4 12-Lead Electrocardiogram abnormalities)  
Patients may withdraw consent for participation in the clinical trial at any time without penalty and for any reaso n without 
prejudice to his or her future medical care. The patient does not need to give a reason for withdrawal of consent. The

condition or non -compliance warrants it. The Sponsor or the Regulatory Authorities may request termination of the 
clinical trial if there are concerns about study conduct or safety.  
In all cases, the reason(s) for withdrawal and the primary reason or failure  to provide a reason, must be recorded in 
the Case Report Form  (CRF) .  
If a patient is withdrawn, or chooses to withdraw, from the clinical trial for any reason, the Investigator must make every 
possible effort to perform the evaluations described for the End of Study Visit (see Section  8.2.5 ) or to verify the health 
status of the patient by [CONTACT_842728]. Withdrawn patients may not re -enter the clinical trial.  
Entered patients who leave the clinical trial be fore receiving a study patient code will be considered as screening 
failures and will be replaced.  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study  may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor and Principal Investigator.  
Replaced patients will receive the wh ole treatment.  
All patients who experience a clinically significant AE (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) which is ongoing either at the 
time of withdrawal or at the End of Study Visit, will be followed up at appropriate time intervals until the AE is re solved 
to the satisfaction of the Investigator. Since it is unpredictable how long such a follow -up will take, data from this 
follow -up generated after study finalization will be recorded by [CONTACT_842729], but not necessarily collected in the CRF and the database. 
However, full details regarding this follow -up will be described in the Clinical Study Report.

To adjust the  dose per ki logram , subjects are divided in to 4 body weight categories (see Pharmacy manual for details).  
Dose levels  of SNF472  from 1 to 20 mg/kg were  tested in Phase1b/2 trials ( SNFCT2014_03) for  1 week and 10 mg/kg 
for 1 month,  without any AE /SAE related with the c ompound . Cmax values expected at the dose selected are not 
exceeding (6 -fold below) the Cmax of 127,291 ng/mL, which was the NOAEL concentration determined in dog pre-
clinical  studies.  
6.3. Supply, Packaging, Labelling and Storage  
The IMP at CSM (formerly B&C) will be stored in accordance to with the manufacturer’s instructions ( -20ºC). The IMP 
will be labelled according to the applicable local health authority, FDA and EMA requirements.  CSM  Group  will send 
the IMP to the Clinical Unit. All IM P shipments will be carried out on dry ice.  
All supplies of SNF472 must be stored  on site at 5ºC (±3ºC) . The preparation of the patient doses will be described in 
the Pharmacy Manual. There will be two Pharmacy Manuals, one for the 30 mg/ml vials and anoth er for the 90 mg/ml 
vials.  The 30 mg/ml vials are packaged in boxes of 9 vials. The 90 mg/ml vials are packaged in boxes of [ADDRESS_1171170] been resolved by [CONTACT_842731].  
6.5. Patient Identification  
At the Screening, each patient will be identified usi ng a unique Identification Number.  
Each patient will receive a Patient ID on Day 1 (of the Treatment Period) after eligibility for the clinical trial has been 
confirmed. The first two letters will correspond to the country where the Clinical Unit is locate d, the next two/three digits 
will correspond to the Clinical Unit and the last two /three  digits will correspond to the patient.  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from clinical trial participation for any reason, regardless of whether IMP was 
administe red or not, will retain their Patient ID and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter the clinical trial.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Management of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will carefully monitor each patient for AEs. In addition, the information on AEs will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_200500]. No leading questions should be asked. When an AE occurs, 
the Investigator will decide whether to withdraw the patient from the clinical trial and/or initiate appropriate treatment.  
In the case of any event requiring medical in tervention occurring during the Treatment Period, the Investigator will 
institute general supportive measures including, where necessary, respi[INVESTIGATOR_842688].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that appears or worsens in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject during the period of observation in a clinical study .  
The adverse event may be any of the following:  
- A new illness,  
- An exacerb ation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a concomitant illness 
(including abnormal laboratory finding ) 
- Unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study medication or comparator drug, or  
- A combin ation of one or more of the above factors.  
No causal relationship with the study medication is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event.” An exacerbation of 
a pre -existing condition/illness is defined as a more frequent occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre -
existing condition/illness during the study. Planned or elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre -existing 
conditions that have not worsened are not adverse events. However, any complication that occurs during a p lanned or 
elective surgery is an adverse event. (If the event fits the seriousness criteria, such as an extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], it 
will be considered a serious adverse event.) Conditions leading to unplanned surgical procedures may be adverse 
events.  
In order for the Sponsor to collect additional information about the clinically important laboratory or diagnostic tests 
(eg, blood, urinalysis, ECG, imaging) abnormalities, at a minimum, the following abnormalities should be captured on 
the AE CRF:  
• Any test result th at meets the criteria for a SAE  
• Any test abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is ne w or has significantly worsened  
• Any test abnormality that required the subject to have study medicat ion discontinued or interrupted

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ZIP_CODE] Palma de Mallorca. Spain  • Any te st abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy, close observation, more 
frequent follow -up assessment, or f urther diagnostic investigation  
Laboratory test abnormalities may not be of clinical significance in the absence of:  
• Clinical symptoms  
• Change in lifestyle  
• Need for intervention  
Only clinically significant test abnormalities should be reported as AEs.  Determination of the clinical significance of 
test abnormalities is the responsibility of the Investigator . In particula r, Grade  1 or 2  haematology, chemistry, 
abnormalities should be carefully considered for clinical relevance by [CONTACT_737], as they are less likely to be of 
clinical significance as compared to Grade  3 or Grade 4 abnormalities.  H aematology and chemis try abnormalities 
determined to be clinically relevant will be assigned a severity rating by [CONTACT_737].  A clinical diagnosis, rather 
than the changes in laboratory or other assessment should be recorded on the CRF as appropriate (eg, anaemia  
versus  low haemoglobin  value, bundle branch block rather than abnormal ECG).  
All AEs, including intercurrent illnesses, occurring during the clinical trial will be documented in the CRF. Concomitant 
illnesses that existed prior to entry into the clinical trial w ill not be considered AEs unless they worsen during the 
Treatment Period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded in the CRF on the Medical History or appropriate page.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess each AE according to the cat egories discussed in the sections below.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Seriousness  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean that 
the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842689]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
•  Is a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may 
be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  [ZIP_CODE] Palma de Mallorca. Spain  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscra sias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note that an AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” for reporting as an SAE if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or  the Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an  SAE with regard to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113617] a 
condition present prior to the subject’s enrolment  in the study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842690]/convenience 
reasons, planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842691]/surgical  procedure, scheduled treatments, or routine 
check -ups, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842692] 24  hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Intensity  
The Investigator will assess the severity of AEs according to the following definitions:  
• Grade 1 (Mild):  asymptomatic or transient, short in duration (<  1 week), no change in lifestyle, and/or no 
medications required.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate):  symptomatic, duration (1 to 2  weeks), alters lifestyle occasionally, medication relieves 
symptoms (may be prescription), a nd/or study medication is continued.   
• Grade 3 (Severe): prolonged symptoms, reversible, major functional impairment; prescription medications 
provide partial relief; may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] <  24 hours; temporary or permanent study medication 
discontinuation.  
• Grade 4 (includes Life threatening):  at risk of death; substantial disability, especially if permanent; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] >  24 hours; permanent study medication discontinued.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the IMP and  the AE and record that assessment in the 
CRF. The most likely cause of an AE/SAE (e.g.,  disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant 
medication, other) will be indicated in the CRF with details of the concomitant disease, medication, or other  cause.  
The causal relationship of the AE to IMP will be described in terms of:

The relatedness of SAEs will also be assessed and documented  on the appropriate CRF page . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected from the time a patient signs the ICF until the Follow -up Visit.  
All AEs,  regardless of the relationship to IMP, must be recorded in the source documents (e.g., medical record)  and 
will be recorded on the appropriate CRF pages, and documents provided by [CONTACT_13099] r. 
All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date, and time of onset, date and time of resolution,

[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
If a female clinical trial participant or a female partner of a male clinical trial participant who has been exposed to the 
IMP becomes pregnant, the course and outcome of the pregnancy should b e monitored and documented.  Pregnancy 
is not an AE; however, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_17258] a 
completed SAE report form (for tracking purposes) and provide any available follow up information on the Pr egnancy 
Outcome Report Form, including perinatal and neonatal outcome.  Protocol required procedures for study withdrawal 
must be performed on pregnant female subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, X -ray studies).  Other 
appropriate follow -up pro cedures should be considered if indicated.

QTcF will be measured.  
Electrocardiogram Abnormalities  
As QTc prolongation is common in ES RD patients on HD and can occur due to underlying CV C disease, haemodialysis, 
sodium thiosul fate, calcimimetics , electrolyte disturbances (Ca, Mg and K) and overdoses of SNF472, careful QTc 
assessment is essential. Any QTc interval using Bazett’s formula (QTcB) >500  ms or increase >[ADDRESS_1171178], apply 
appropriate management and observe until the QTcB has decreased. At the discret ion of the investigator, patients with 
persistent QTc prolongation may be withdrawn from the tria l. 
7.1.5. Physical Examinations  
The physical examinations will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments:  Table 1. 
The physical examination comprises a routine medical examination.  
The routine medical examination will be recorded as “normal” or “abnormal”.  
7.2. Haemodialysis -related Events  
The following  events are known to occur during dialysis treatments:  
• Hypotension  
• Muscle cramps  
• Disequilibrium syndrome  
• Nausea and vomiting  
• Headache  
• Chest pain  
• Itching  
• Fever and chills  
• Pyrogen reaction  
• Hypertension  
Occurrence of these events during the dialysis treatment procedure should be recorded in the CRF and indicated as 
haemodialysis -related events.  If any of these events are considered to be unrelated to the hemodialysis treatment 
procedure, they should be recorded as standard adverse events.

7.5. Scores  and Evaluations  
Several different scores and evaluations will be performed throughout the study (see  Table 1).  
The assessment of th e degree of pain a patient feel s will be measured with the VAS.  
To assess the course of healing of the ulcers, the Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool will be used. Of note, 
elements of the Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool which imply probing the wound or measuring its depth are left 
to the discretion of the treating physician at the site and are not compulsory.  
Quality of life will be assess ed with the Wound  QoL score .

7.5.1. Pain Score -VAS 
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to assess pain , as per the patient . A VAS is a measurement instrument 
that aims to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot 
easily be directly measured. For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none 
to an extreme amount of pain.  
Operationally , a VAS is usually a horizontal line, [ADDRESS_1171181] descriptors at each end, as 
illustrated in 
 
Figure  4The patient marks on the l ine the point that he feels represents his perception of his current status. The VAS 
score is determined by [CONTACT_842739]

7.5.2. Lesion Score – Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment Tool  
The site investigator will use the  Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) to assess the course of the lesion. 
BWAT is a measuring instrument used to assess and monitor healing in pressure ulcers and other chronic wounds [49]. 
It is not, however, specific for CUA. It uses a numerical scale to rate wound characteristics from bes t to worst possible. 
It consists of 15 items, two of which (location and shape) are not scored. Scored items are:  
• Size 
• Depth  
• Edges  
• Undermining or pockets  
• Necrotic tissue type  
• Necrotic tissue amount  
• Exudate type  
• Exudate amount

(light, angle, etc .) as the baseline one  so that the course of the wound can be assessed . Color reference cards with an 
individual barcode (unique patient identifier) which will be recorded into the CRF an d optimized for automatic detection 
and reading should be placed next to the lesion before any image is taken.  
Similar rules apply for the secondary  and tertiary  lesions.  
All pi[INVESTIGATOR_842698]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_842699]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Image Analys es 
Lesion images  will be analysed using the following methods.  
1.       Two reviewers will independently perform a two -step review of the lesion images:  
a.       The first step is a patient -level analysis in which the baseline and final images for each patient are de -
identified with respect to order and are randomly labeled as image A or image B. Each reviewer will 
compare the images to assess whether image A is worse, image B is wors e, or if there is no difference 
between images A and B.   If there is discordance between the reviewers’ assessments, the reviewers 
will discuss the case together to attempt concordance.  
b.       The second step is a review of all patient images taken as baseline and every two weeks during the 
12-week trial. Each on -treatment analysis will be compared to baseline and scored as worsened, 
improved, or no change. The aggregated categorical scores across all patients for each time point 
will be correlated with  the aggregate BWAT total score for each corresponding time point. If there is 
discordance between the reviewers’ assessments, the reviewers will discuss the case together to 
attempt concordance.

8.3.1. Contraception Requirements  
The use of highly effective contraception methods to prevent pregnancy, of a female participant or a female partner of 
a male participant, from the day o f dosing and for 3 months after  the follow -up visit, is necessa ry.  
•       Male patients:  
o   Male patient who have not had a vasectomy and have a female partner of childbearing potential, must 
use a condom with spermicide when having heterosexual intercourse, from the time the consent form 
is signed until [ADDRESS_1171188] dose of study drug  
o   If the male patient’s partner is of childbearing potential or if she has had a tubal ligation without having 
had her ovaries taken out and she is taking a hormonal contraceptive, she may choose to continue 
takin g the hormonal contraceptive but it is strongly recommended to add 1 non -hormonal method of 
contraception (i.e., male condom with spermicide, female condom, diaphragm with spermicidal jelly 
or a cervical cap). We strongly recommend the partner, must use re liable forms of contraception 
during the study and for [ADDRESS_1171189] dose of study drug  
•       Highly effective contraceptive methods are:  
o Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) oral, intravaginal or transdermal contraceptive 
associated  with inhibition of ovulation + condom with spermicide  
o Progesteron -only oral, injectable or implantable hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation + condom with spermicide  
o   Intra uterine device (IUD) + condom with spermicide  
o   True abstin ence: When this is in line with  the patient´s preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal (monitoring of your body temperature), post -
ovulation methods), and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of c ontraception.  
o   Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the 
ejaculate).  
•       Female patients must be in one of the cases described below:  
o   Absence of menstruation for 12 consecutive months ( menopause) and the doctor confirms they are 
postmenopausal  
o   Both ovaries and uterus have been removed by [CONTACT_44850]  
o   Cannot get pregnant due to having ovarian problems (confirmed by a doctor ) 
o   If of childbearing potential, the female patient and their partner have to use highly effective forms of 
contraception (see above) during the study and for [ADDRESS_1171190] dose of study drug

Before database lock, a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed 
methods for the analyses outlined below.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses as mentioned in detail in the SAP will be described and justified in the final 
integrated Clinical Study Report.  
9.1. Clinical Trial Populat ion  
9.1.1. Disposition of Patients  
Disposition data will be listed and summarised overall. A listing of withdrawals will also be presented including the 
primary reason for withdrawal.  
9.1.2. Protocol Deviations  
Deviations from the Clinical Trial Protocol, including dev iations of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed as “minor” 
or “major” in agreement with the Sponsor , prior to database lock . 
9.1.3. Analysis Populations  
Safety population:  All patients who receive at least 1  dose of IMP will be included in the safety 
population.  
Efficacy  Population:  All patients who receive at least 75% of SNF472 doses and for whom at least 
baseline and Week 12/EOS images are readable will be part of the Efficacy 
Population.  
9.2. General Considerations  
All efficacy ( ulcer size, Bates -Jensen  Wound tool assessment s, pain scale , and w ound Q oL), PK and safety parameters 
as well as population characteristics will be listed and described using summary statistics. Descriptive statistics (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for each quantitative variable (unless 
otherwise stated).  Frequency counts (number of subjects [n] and percentages) will be made for each qualitative 
variable.  
All listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_56324], time -point, and parameter (if  applicable).

9.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The plasma SNF472 PK  parameter, Cmax, will be ca lculated , individual and mean .  
9.5. Determination of Sample Size  
Based on recent historical data from a U.S. large dialysis provider organization, approximately 25% of calciphylaxis 
skin lesions are considered to be improved over a 3 -6 month period (data unpublished; personal communication). A 
total of 15 subjects  who c omplete 12 -week of treatment  was determined necessary to show with 80% power that the 
percentage of subjects for which the primary ulcer is totally or partially healed after 12 weeks of treatment  is greater 
than 25%. For these calculations, it was assumed that the percentage of totally or partially healed subjects for SNF472 
will be 60%.

10.2. Data Collection  
Paper CRFs will be distributed to the clinical sites.  Once the CRFs are source data verified, the originals are sent  to 
the sponsor. The sponsor digitizes the CRFs for data entry. The data from the digitized CRFs will be entered into a 
database using DataFax software hosted by [CONTACT_102927]/net Research, Inc.    
Once the original CRFs are sent to the sponsor, all data additions, changes or corrections will be captured on the query 
reports.  
The responsible Clinical Monitor will check source data during the monitoring visits to the Clinical Unit. The Investigator 
will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete and legible.  
All clinical work conducted under this Clinical trial Protocol will follow Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles  [54]. 
10.3. Source Documents  
All data obtained during the clinical trial should be promptly recorded in the CRF, as is described in section 10.[ADDRESS_1171193] source documents. The review of medical records will be handled 
confidentially to ensure clinical trial patient anonymity.  
Checking of CRF entries for completeness and clarity and veri fying with source documents, will be required to monitor 
the clinical trial for compliance with GCP and other regulations. Moreover, Regulatory Authorities of certain countries 
and ECs/IRBs may wish to carry out source data inspections on -site, and the Spo nsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance

10.5. Data Management  
Data management activities will be performed by [CONTACT_102927]/net Research, Inc.  
A data management plan (DMP) will describe  the work - and data -flow within this clinical trial. Versions for the computer 
systems and the coding will be defined in the DMP.  
10.6. Archiving Clinical Trial  Documents  
According to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents should be retained  for 
a minimum of [ADDRESS_1171195] elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinic al development of the IMP. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period 
if required by [CONTACT_200518].  
10.7. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this Clinical trial Protocol are designed to ensure that the Spons or and the Investigator abide 
by [CONTACT_611163] [54], and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version  1996) [55]. The clinical trial 
will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_73934].  
10.8. Informed Consent  
Before each patient is enrolled in the clinical trial, written informed consent will be obtained from the patient according 
to the local regulatory and legal requirements. The Patient Information Sheet and ICF must be signed and dated; one 
copy will be handed to the patient and the Investigator will retain a copy as p art of the clinical trial records. The 
Investigator will not undertake any investigation specifically required for the clinical trial until written consent has been  
obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the CRF.  
The Investigator must ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, 
purpose, possible risk and benefit of the clinical trial. Patients must also be notified that they are free to withdraw from 
the cl inical trial at any time without prejudice to future care. The patient should be given the opportunity to ask questions 
and allowed time to consider the information provided.  
If a Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment is required, the Patient Information Sheet  and ICF may need to be revised to 
reflect the changes to the Clinical Trial Protocol. If the Patient Information Sheet and ICF are revised, they must be

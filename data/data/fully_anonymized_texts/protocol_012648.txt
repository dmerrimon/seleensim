NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 9 of 114 Statistical Methods  Sample Size:  
A total of approximately 74 participant s: 
Viltolarsen 80 mg/kg/week (n=37)  
Placebo (n=37)  
Analysis Populations:  
The safety population will consist of all randomized participants 
who received at least [ADDRESS_1166622] .  
Participants will be analyzed as treated.  This will be the primary 
analysis population for the evaluation of exposure and safety.   
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population will consist of 
all randomized participants who received at least [ADDRESS_1166623] baseline efficacy assessment.  Participants will be 
analyz ed as randomized.  This will be the primary analysis 
population for the evaluation of efficacy.  
General Statistical Considerations:  
For TTSTAND (calculated as a velocity, defined as rise per 
second), the sample size of 74 participants has been calculated 
using the following values :  
• Mean difference = 0.0 5 
• Standard deviation = 0.075  
• Type I error level (two -sided) = 0.05  
• Power level = 0.8  
• Allocation ratio (N1: viltolarsen/N2: placebo) = 1  
The mean difference and the SD were set based on the result of 
comparison between viltolarsen group and natural history control 
group at 25 weeks in the Phase 2 Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 
(mean difference between 2 groups: 0.0395, SD: 0.[ZIP_CODE] and 
0.[ZIP_CODE]).  As the mean difference between the [ADDRESS_1166624] 
model repeat measurement  for the calculation method due to lack 
of prior information.  
When approximately 90% of participants are enrolled in the 
study, an unblinded review will be conducted and sample size 
re-estimation will be considered.   An additional unblinded review 
and re -estimation will be performed when  approximately  
[ADDRESS_1166625] completed the Week 49 evaluations for the 
primary outcome measure .

The primary efficacy outcome of TTSTAND will be summarized 
descriptively at each visit using actual values and change from 
baseline values.  The time measured for TTSTAND will be 
converted to a velocity expressed as rise  per second.  
The primary efficacy outcome measure  of TTSTAND velocity 
will be compared between participant s treated with viltolarsen or 
placebo using mixed -effects linear models .   
Secondary and exploratory outcomes are detailed in the protocol 
and statistical analysis plan.  
Safety Evaluation:  
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population .  
All safety assessments will be based on actual treatments 
received by [CONTACT_839491].  
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation:  
Population PK analysis will be presented in a separate report .

Note: Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the 
following order: [ADDRESS_1166633] a telephone call conducted by [CONTACT_233528], 30 days (±  3 days) following the last study drug administration.   
b. If a participant returns to the clinic for a visit outside of the protocol evaluation time points, the visit and any assessme nts and/or tests performed 
will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF as an Unscheduled Visit.  
c. Medical and surgical procedures will be reviewed.  
d. Concomitant  medication  and treatment s will be reviewed .  
e. Height will be collected without shoes.  The participant’s legs should be kept as close as possible and the participant’s heels should be placed 
back as close to the wall as possible.  Participant may hold on to an object to facilitate balance.  Weight will be collected with the participant 
wearing no shoes and light -weight clothes . 
f. For each visit that includes a study drug administration, vital signs will be measured at predose  as well as  1 hour ( up to 20  minutes following 
completion of the infusion ) and 2 hours ( ± 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion.  If a clinically significant change from predose  is observed at 
2 hours after initiation of infusion, the parameter will be  measured again at 6 hours ( ± 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion.  Vital signs will be 
measured prior to any blood collection scheduled at the same time point and will include: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and temperature.  
g. Physical and neurological examinations will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nos e, and throat 
(HEENT), skin, lymph nodes, heart, including rhythm, heart sounds and presence of cardiac abnormalities, lungs, abdom en, extremities/joints, 
nervous system, and any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evaluate symptoms or adverse experie nces as detailed in 
Section 9.11. 
h. ECGs will be performed with the participan t having rested for at least 5 minutes, and the participan t should remain in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_47342] -recumbent position.  A consistent position should be maintained for each individual participant.  At Week s 25, 37, 49, and ET,  single ECGs 
will be collected (predose  is recommended at Weeks 25 and 37) . 
i. Renal  ultrasound will include imaging of the kidney s, ureters , and bladder .  Except for the screening assessment, renal ultrasound can occur up to 
2 weeks prior to or after the scheduled week, as needed for scheduling purposes.  
j. Refer to Table 3 for additional details on the clin ical laboratory tests, including the laboratory analytes  that will be measured  for hematology, 
serum chemistry, and urinalysis.

o. To be collected predose and will be performed on serum blood samples.  
p. Viltolarsen levels in plasma will be assessed at predose  (within 60  minutes  prior to dose ) and 2 hours (± 20 minutes) after initiation of infusion at 
Week 25, Week 37 , and Week 48 as well as at 6 hours (± 20 minutes)  after initiation of infusion  at Week 48.   Postdose PK should not be drawn 
from the cannula that was used for the infusion.  These samples can be drawn from the arm opposite the infusion or can be fro m a separate  distal  
access point in the same arm as the infusion.  This postdose PK  draw  requirement is in place to prevent any contamination with viltolarsen 
derived from the dosing cannula.

2.1 Rationale  for Study Design, Control Group, and Dose Selection  
2.1.1 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose (80 mg/kg/week for 48 weeks) for this study was based on the successful treatment of 
participants at 80 mg/kg/week in Study NS -065/NCNP-01-201 for up to a total of 24 weeks of 
treatment, as well as in the Phase 1/2  Study NS -065/NCNP-01-P1/2 conducted in Japan  
(Japan  P1/2) .  Results are  detailed below.   
Viltolarsen dystrophin levels and exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_233494] P1/2 
(Study  NS065/ NCNP01 -P1/2) and  Study NS-065/NCNP -01-201.  The results are summarized 
below:  
1. Highest dystrophin production measured by [CONTACT_233532] 20 to 24 weeks in both 
Japan P1/2 ( Study NS065/ NCNP01 -P1/2 [n = 4]) and Study NS-065/NCNP -01-201 
(n = 8) studies were observed at 80 mg/kg . 
2. Average dystrophin production by [CONTACT_839492] 24 weeks in 
Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/ NCNP01 -P1/2)  was higher at 80 mg/kg (n  = 4). 
3. Average dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233531] 45 -52 mutation  measured by 
[CONTACT_233532] 20 to 24 weeks in both Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/ NCNP01 -P1/2) and 
Study NS-065/NCNP -01-201 (n = 3) were higher at 80 mg/kg.  
a) Dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233533] 45 -52 mutation were lower than 
those with other mutation types in both Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/ NCNP01 -P1/2)

2.1.[ADDRESS_1166655] on enrolling for a placebo -controlled trial after an accelerated 
approval is granted in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) and Japan.  The Food and Drug Administration  
(FDA ) explained the complexity in interpreting a study with natural history as a control group 
due to the heterogeneity of the disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ), 
unless the drug effect is very large.  Therefore , the FDA reiterated their position that a placebo 
controlled study would be required.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_1166656] (TTSTAND ).  The rationale for 
using TTSTAND as the primary endpoint is:  
• TTSTAND is an objective endpoint that can be measured in a standardized way,  
• TTSTAND is well validated,  
• TTSTAND is clinically meaningful as a measure of patient function, and  
• TTSTAND is an important prognostic factor and more generally can predict disease 
progression.  
TTSTAND is the first functional milestone lost in DMD disease progression  (McDonald et al , 
2018 ; Arora et al, in press ).  The sponsor intends to use velocity rather than time (seconds)

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 29 of 114 because the velocity measure is superior to the time (seconds) measure in handling large values 
as patients begin to lose the ability to stand.  
In consideration of boys with DMD who could perform functional tests  (Arora et al, in press ), 
age range with 4 to <8 years is selected.  
2.1.4 Rationale for Study Duration of 48 Weeks  
Individual participant study duration is 48 weeks, which takes into consideration the feasibility 
of patient enrollment and retention in the proposed placebo -controlled study.  
2.2 Disease  and Treatment  
2.2.1 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy – Epi[INVESTIGATOR_180107]/Biochemical Basis  
DMD is a disorder of progressive weakness leading to  severe disability and ultimately death  
caused by a deficiency of the dystrophin protein .  The reported prevalence of DMD is 15.9 cases 
per 100,000 live male births in the US and 19.5 cases per 100,000 live male births in the [LOCATION_006] 
(Ryder et al, 2017; Mendell et al , 2012; Moat et al, 2013 ).  The symptoms of DMD are often first 
noted at about [ADDRESS_1166657] year of life.  Proximal leg weakness impairs mobility and precludes the ability to run or to 
rise from a squatting posi tion.  Complete loss of ambulation follows, with a progressive decline 
of upper extremity strength and function.  Declines in respi[INVESTIGATOR_839474], ultimately culminating in early lethality  (Bushby [CONTACT_2297] [Part 1], 
2018; Birnkrant et al , 2018 .)  The impact of this debilitating condition on those affected by [CONTACT_839493].  
The biochemical basis of DMD is the absence of a functional dystrophin  protein  in striated 
muscle tissue that is essential for healthy muscle function and muscle fiber integrity.   In normal 
striated muscle the cytoplasmic dystrophin protein links intracellular actin  with the extracellular 
matrix to provide structural stability of the muscle cell membrane.  In the majority of patients 
with DMD, dystrophin protein is not produced because of out -of-frame mutations characterized 
by a deletion of one or more exons from the dystrophin gene , which is located on the short arm 
of the X chromos ome.  Dystrophin mutations in which some dystrophin protein function remains 
are associated  with a similar , but often milder phenotype , classified as Becker muscular 
dystrophy (BMD).  DMD and BMD exhibit  X-linked recessive inheritance.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 30 of 114 2.2.2 Current Natural History, Disease Management , and Treatment Recommendations  
The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group  (CINRG)  conduct ed the largest 
prospective multi -center natural history study to date in DMD, the CINRG Duchenne Natural 
History Study (DNHS)  (McDonald et al, 2013 ; Henricson et al, 2013; McDonald et al , 2018 ).  
The study includes >400 boys and men with DMD, with variable amounts of longitudinal 
follow -up over the course of  a decade  (2006 to 2016) .  The study has annual follow -up visit s that  
include timed function tests, muscle strength, questionnaire functional assessments, pulmonary 
function tests , and quality of life assessments.   
Since there is currently no cure for DMD, the goal of care is to provide the best quality of life 
through all stages of the disease.  To date, treatments focus on  optimizing strength and function 
through the use of pharmacological interventions, physical therapy , and assistive and adaptive 
devices.  
2.2.3 Glucocorticoid Treatment  
At present, treatment with glucocorticoid (GC) medication is the only pharmacological 
intervention that has been shown  to slow the decline of strength and function in DMD patients.  
The two main GCs used in DMD are prednisone and deflazacort  (EMFLAZA ™).  Daily oral 
administration of prednisone or deflazacort stabilizes or improves strength and prolongs 
ambulation  (Drachman et al, 1974 ; Brooke et al, 1987 ; Griggs et al, 1993 ; Mendell et al, 1989 ; 
Griggs et al, 1991 ; Fenichel et al, 1991 ).  The mechanism by [CONTACT_839494], including anti -inflammatory actions.  The 
immunosuppressive effects of GCs may not be beneficial, and other immunosuppressants have 
not shown benefit  (Griggs et al, 1993 ).  On Feb ruary 9, 2017, the US FDA approved 
EMFLAZA ™ for the treatment of patients 5 years of age and older with DMD.   
In 2005, the American Academy of Neurology issued a practice parameter regarding GC 
treatment in DMD and recommended that GC should be offered as treatment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_233498]  (Moxley et al , 2005).  The significant side effects of GCs include Cushingoid features, 
adverse behavioral changes, obesity, growth retardation, increased risk for bone fractures, 
gastritis, delayed puberty, cataracts, hypertension, glucose intolerance, susceptibility to infection, 
and masking of response to stress  (Matthews et al, 2016 ).

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31 of 114 2.2.4 Dystrophin Restoring Interventions  
New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839475] .  Small molecules that can read 
through nonsense mutations could potentially treat approximately 1 3% of DMD patients  
(Bushby [CONTACT_2297], 2014 ).  Exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which uses antisense oligonucleotides to alter the splicing 
pattern of the genes is designed to bring out -of-frame deletions into frame.  The technology of 
exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_839476] a specific sequence in the 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to alter splicin g of exons.  By [CONTACT_77203], specific exons 
can be excluded from the final transcript that is exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus; 
hence the term ‘exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ .  By [CONTACT_180159], the out -of-frame deletion 
can be enlarged to include the adjacent exon such that the resulting deletion is in -frame  
(Kole  and Krieg, 2015 ).  
This new type of treatment could potentially treat 8 0% of DMD patients who have large -scale 
deletion or duplication m utations in the dystrophin gene  (Aartsma et al, 2009 ).  The full 
characterization of DMD patient mutations and further development of the technology will be 
crucial to fully realize these novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_180113].  
To date, [ADDRESS_1166658] been brought to the stage of human clinical trial : 
2’O-methyl phosphorothioate (2’O -Me) antisense oligonucleotides (Voit et al, 2014 ) and 
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) for skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 51 in the dystrophin 
gene  (Mendell et al , 2013 ; Cirak et al, 2012; Cirak et al, 2011 ). 
A 48 -week study of the 2’O -Me compound drisapersen did not reach significance in the 
Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT), which was its primary outcome measure for this Phase 2 study 
(Voit et al, 2014 ).  The PMO compound eteplirsen was tested in a 48 -week study , with the 
number of muscle fibers showing  restored dystrophin as its primary outcome measure  
(Mendell  et al, 2013) .  Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®) was approved by [CONTACT_839495] 19, 2016.  
2.3 Background on Viltolarsen  
Viltolarsen  is a novel antisense oligonucleotide for the treatment of DMD, which has been 
discovered jointly by [CONTACT_180161] (NCNP) which is a National 
Research and Development Agency in Japan  and Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.   Details of data 
summarized in the following sections can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_1166659] with the dystrophin gene ribonucleic acid (RNA) and alter the 
exon/intron splicing patterns.   The mechanism of action is for viltolarsen  to bind to a specific 
sequence in or near exon 53 of the dystrophin pre -RNA transcript and block the exon/intron 
splicing of exon 53, leading to mature mRNA transcripts that lack exon 53.   Viltolarsen  is 
thought to be effective on DMD patients with exon deletions amenable to skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 53 
such as 43 -52, 45 -52, 47 -52, 48 -52, 49 -52, 50 -52, or 5 2.  The loss of exon 53 restores the mRNA 
reading frame, thus converting a DMD (out -of-frame) deletion mutation to a Becker -like 
(in-frame) deletion mutation.   In-frame deletion mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_233501]  a shortened  dystrophin protein, although the resulting Becker -like dystrophin 
protein will be smaller in molecular weight compared to the normal dystrophin protein, and 
likely lower in abundance (quantity) compared to normal muscle , and thus may have lower 
function than normal amounts of wild -type dystrophin protein.  
2.3.2 Summary of Non -Clinical Findings  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology  
Viltolarsen (0 to 10 μmol/L) demonstrated sustained exon [ADDRESS_1166660] 2 weeks in cells from a DMD patient with deletion of exons 45 –52 and in 
cells from a DMD patient with deletion of exons 48 –52.  In cynomolgus monkeys, a dose of 
60 mg/kg viltolarsen resulted in exon 53  skippi[INVESTIGATOR_233502] a 12 -week intermittent intravenous ( IV) toxicity study.  
The potential off -target effect of viltolarsen and its n  ± 1 mers among all human mRNA 
sequences was assessed by [CONTACT_839496].  Taken together, while CX3CL1 , 
APCDD1 , FUT1 , CNTNAP2  and MYT1  showed some predicted and statistically -significant 
changes on mRNA expression, the clinical relevance for these moderate differences in terms of 
protein expression or predicted effects on physiology in vivo  is questionable.  
Viltolarsen  did not display any adverse effects in in vitro  and in vivo  cardiovascular, in vivo  
central nervous system , or in vivo  respi[INVESTIGATOR_9012].

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 33 of 114 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic ( PK) and toxicokinetic  (TK) analyses revealed no apparent species differences 
for viltolarsen .  None of the in vitro  or in vivo  metabolism studies showed any distinct evidence 
of metabolism of viltolarsen .  After IV administration, time of maximum plasma concentration 
(Tmax) occurred at the first sampling time after the injection or at the end of the infusion for mice, 
rats, and monkeys.  Maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) and area under the curve ( AUC ) 
increased with dose, and most increases were approximately proportional to dose,  with some 
increases being greater than dose proportional.  For rats, the mean values for t 1/2 were 1.19, 1.19, 
and 10.5 hours for 6, 20, and 60  mg/kg.  For monkeys, the mean values for t 1/2 ranged from 
1.7 to 3.5 hours.  For mice and monkeys, exposure did not change with 12 or 13 weeks of repeat 
dosing.  
The fraction of viltolarsen  bound to rat, monkey, and human serum proteins was low, ≤40%, for 
all species and was independent of concentration.  The distribution of viltolarsen  into red blood 
cells was ≤2.5%, ≤6.7%, and ≤3.5% for rat, monkey, and human, respectively, indicating low 
distribution of viltolarsen  to red blood cells.  Quantitative whole -body autoradiography  (QWBA ) 
studies showed wide tissue distribution of [14C] viltolarsen  in both mice and monkeys, with the 
highest concentrations observed in th e kidney, and general distribution to muscle tissues.  For 
both rats and monkeys, renal excretion was the major route of elimination, with less than 10% in 
the feces.  No radioactivity was in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_180116].  Most of the radioactivity was 
excreted within the first 24 hours.  However, small measurable amounts continued to be excreted 
in the urine and feces throughout the seven -day collection periods.  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to cytochrome ( CYP ) 3A4 (Ki value: 1.44 mmol/L), while 
no inhibitory effects were observed to other CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6).  Viltolarsen did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to UGT1A1 (Ki value: 0.642 mmol/L), while no inhibitory 
effects were observed to UGT2B7.  Viltolarsen was not a substrate of transporters (P -gp, BCRP, 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 -K).  Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to  
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3 and BCRP (respective IC 50 value: 0.485, 0.448, 0.176 and 
1.97 mmol/L), while no inhibitory effects were observed to other transporters (P -gp, OAT1, 
OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2 -K and BSEP).

Histopathological evaluations following a single IV dose of 600 mg/kg in monkeys resulted in  
vacuolation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_233503].  No other renal changes were noted.  
Repeated administration of viltolarsen via the clinically relevant route of administration (weekly  
IV injections) in mice, rats and monkeys resulted in decreases in red blood cell parameters,  
increased values for cytokines and histopathological effects in the kidney and urinary bladder.  
The kidney is the primary target organ in mice, rats and monkeys, as shown by [CONTACT_839497] (1000 mg/kg in 4 -, 13- and 26 -week  
mouse studies, ≥500 mg/kg in 4 - and 13 -week rat studies, and 600 mg/kg in a 12 -week monkey  
study) and by [CONTACT_180163] (≥240 mg/kg in 4 -, 13- and 
26-week mouse studies, ≥250 mg/kg in 4 -week and 13 -week rat studies ≥200 mg/kg in 12 - and 
39-week monkey studies) accompanied by [CONTACT_180164].  An additional 
histopathological finding in a 26 -week mouse study was  the presence of cytoplasmic 
eosinophilic material in the transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_839477] 60 mg/kg and above.  
An increase in blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) was observed in all toxicity studies with all species 
mainly at the higher  doses.  The main causes of an increase in BUN are high protein diet, 
decrease in glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) (suggestive of renal failure) and in blood volume 
(hypovolemia), congestive  heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, and increased 
catabolism.  In the toxicity studies  with viltolarsen, BUN increases were considered to be 
attributable to a decrease in GFR.  Based on these data, the no observed adverse effect levels 
(NOAELs ) were concluded to be 60 and 15 mg/kg in 13 -week and 26 -week mouse studies 
respectively and 60 mg/kg in 12 -week and 39 -week monkey studies  respectively.  
Results from in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxicity studies were negative, and studies showed no  
evidence of chromosomal aberrations.  
In a study of the effects of viltolarsen on fertility and early embryonic development to  
implantation by [CONTACT_233542], no toxicologically  significant changes were noted 
in copulation rate, copulatory interval, fertility rate, necropsy,  organ weights (testes or

Viltolarsen administered to juvenile male mice (from postnatal day 7) at (SC or IV) doses up to

suggested tolerability up to 240 mg/kg, after which evidence of toxic effects to the kidney were  
observed (tubular degeneration, basophilia, and vacuolation and chronic progressive nephropathy  
in the kidneys at ≥ 240 mg/kg).  The NOAEL for general toxicity of viltolarsen is 60 mg/kg, and 
for bone  growth/geometry and juvenile neurotoxicity of viltolarsen is 1200 mg/kg.  No toxicity 
specific to juvenile animals were noted.  
IV injections of 200 mg/kg showed acceptable local tolerances in cynomolgus monkeys, but  
600 mg/kg IV injections induced signs of inflammation at the injection site in to SC tissue.   
Similarly, IM injections of 100 mg/kg were not suitable for administration of viltolarsen,  
showing inflammation of the injection site.  
No anti -viltolarsen antibodies were detected in the 4 -week, 13 -week or 26 -week mouse studies,  
or in a 39 -week monkey study.  Anti-viltolarsen antibodies were detected in 1 male at 200 mg/kg

Viltolarsen was administered once weekly for 26 weeks at dose levels of 
0 (vehicle:  physiological saline), 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg (51 mice per group) in male 
CByB6F1 -Tg(HRAS)2Jic mice via IV administration with a bolus injection.  After the terminal

subsequent histopathological examinations on these 3 mice, transitional cell carcinoma s were  
noted.  Histopathological examination of the ureters for the other mice was conducted and no 
further tumorigenic changes were identified.   Additionally, no treatment -related tumors were 
noted in any other organs.

2.3.3 Summar y of Clinical  Findings  
A Phase 1 investigator -initiated study (Study NCNP/DMT01)  (ClinicalTrials.gov 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of viltolarsen  injection was conducted in DMD patients (aged 5  to 18 years) to 
investigate the overall usefulness of viltolarsen  injection in the treatment of DMD, based on 
evaluations of safety, exploration of predictive markers of treatment response, and assessment of 
PK.  A total of 10 DMD patients were enrolled and randomized.  IV administration of viltolarsen  
injection in doses of 1.25 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to DMD patients once weekly for 
[ADDRESS_1166662] one AE.  Moreover, neither SAE s nor incidences of Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0-JCOG  (Japanese translation, published by [CONTACT_839498]  [JCOG] ) Grade 3 (severe) or worse were reported.  
Among the mild and moderate AEs, an increase in beta-N-acetyl -D-glucosaminidase  (Grade 1)  
was found in all patients in both cohorts 1 and 2 [Cohort 1 (n  = 3) Cohort 2 (n  = 3)] and in all but 
one patient in Cohort 3 [Cohort 3  (n = 4)].  
Initially, testing appeared to reveal proteinuria in 8 of 10 patients.  However, it was subsequently 
determined that there was a cross reaction between viltolarsen  and the pyrogallol red dye -binding 
method , which was used for urinary protein measurement resulting in a false positive result  for 
protein in the 24 -hour pooled urine samples.  To evaluate the 24 -hour pooled urine samples for 
protein, the Coomassie brilliant blue method was used to re -measure urinary protein in the frozen 
urine samples .  None of the retested samples showed urinary protein levels exceeding the normal 
range of the institution (i.e., 31.2 to 120 mg/day).  Current studies utilize a urine protein 
benzethonium chloride  method , using reagents that do not cross react with viltolarsen .  
Viltolarsen  exhibited no cross reactivity with the benzethonium chloride method up to 
500 mg/dL.   
The 24 -hour pooled urine samples did not show increased levels of albumin.  Spot measurements 
of urinary albumin w ere positive in 7 patients (Grade 1).

Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 
Study NS-065/NCNP -01-201 is a Phase 2 study conducted in the US and Canada .   
This was a multi -center, 24 -week dose finding study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics  of viltolarsen  in boys with DMD.  Participants receive d weekly IV 
administration of viltolarsen  injection 250  mg (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) or placebo for the first 
4 weeks, followed by [CONTACT_839500] 250  mg (40  mg/kg and 
80 mg/kg) over the remaining 20 weeks.  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is 
dystrophin protein expression as measured by [CONTACT_27187].  Sixteen  DMD pat ients amenable to 
exon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], aged 4  to <10 years were enrolled.   There were  no apparent drug -related SAEs 
reported, and no AEs led to study drug discontinuation.   There were 59 treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) with 23 TEAEs from participants in the low dose cohort and 36 TEAEs 
from participants in the high dose cohort.  Fifty -four of the 59 TEAEs were reported as mild in 
severity, with 5 from the high dose cohort reported as moderate  in severity .  There were 55 AEs 
deemed unrelated to study drug and 7 as unlikely related.

extravasation) was assessed as drug -related by [CONTACT_093].  There were no treatment -related 
clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
over time or among treatment groups.  Anti -dystrophin antibodies were detected in 2 of the 
16 participants  (273104 at Week 145 and 273106 at  Week 121).  All other samples were judged 
anti-dystrophin antibody negative.  No participants  had anti -NS-065/NCNP -01 antibody results 
at any time.  Treatment with NS -065/NCNP -01 was safe and well tolerated under the conditions 
of this study, for an additional 192 -week time period.  Preliminary evidence for clinical benefit 
of viltolarsen -treated participants  in comparison with the CINRG DNHS  population , matched for 
study criteria, w as observed.  Generally, extended improvement in performance on timed 
function tests was confirmed in the viltolarsen -treated participants  whereas the CINRG DNHS 
historical control group showed deterioration.  The safety profile in Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-202 
confirmed what was seen in the previous 24 -week Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-201, further 
supporting that viltolarsen was well tolerated.  The results of this study appear to be fully aligned 
with the current, FDA -approved viltolarsen product labeling and prescribing information.  
2.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment   
2.4.1 Viltolarsen  
There were no important identified risks of viltolarsen in the current clinical development 
program.  Identified important potential risks from non -clinical studies were renal disorder, 
hepatic dysfunction, anemia, drug allergy, immune activation , and transitional cell carcinoma .  
No serious adverse reactions were recognized in the reporting period of the current Drug Safety 
Update Report ( DSUR ) (May  14, 2017 to May 13, 2018), and there were no actions taken for 
safety reasons, or any significant changes in  the Investigator's Brochure  (IB). 
At present, none of the safety risks identified during the current reporting period were considered 
to be important risks.  Further, nonclinical adverse effects previously identified as important 
potential risks have not been observed in any of the human s tudies conducted to date.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 40 of 114 2.4.2 Procedures  
Risks due to study -related procedures are detailed below.  
Blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, and PK is associated with the usual risks of 
a blood draw which include pain, bruising at the point where the blood is taken, redness and 
swelling of the vein, infection, and a rare risk of fainting.   In order to decrease any of these 
possible risks the sites will employ pediatric trained staff and will use a numbing cream, if 
desired by [CONTACT_2299], to reduce the risk of pain.  
Function and strength tests will be performed during this study.  These include the TTSTAND, 
Time to Run/Walk [ADDRESS_1166667] (TTRW), Six -minute Walk Test (6MWT), North Star 
Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and Time to Climb [ADDRESS_1166668] (TTCLIMB).  All tests 
associated with muscle soreness, fatigue, and falls.  
The 6MWT may also cause feelings of pressure or pain in the participant’s chest, difficulty 
breathing, and shortness of breath.  The 6MWT may also cause an increased risk of muscle 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Quantitative muscle strength by [CONTACT_35681] -held dynamometer  may cause fatigue and muscle soreness.

Viltolarsen administered at 80 mg/kg/week, in comparison to placebo, ameliorates the clinical 
course of ambulant boys with DMD  as assessed by a muscle functional measure.  The 
improvement in function is due to an increase in muscle tissue dystrophin expression.

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This Phase 3 study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study in 
ambulant boys ages 4 to <8 years with DMD receiving 80 mg/kg viltolarsen administered IV 
weekly over a 48 -week treatment period.  See Section 1.1 for study schema.  
5.1.1 Number of Centers  
The study will be conducted at approximately 53 clinical  sites in approximately 1 9 countries, 
predominantly in Europe, Asia, North America, Oceania, and South America . 
5.2 Design Implementation  
5.2.1 Randomization  
Participant s are randomly assigned to either 80 mg/kg/w eek viltolarsen or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.   
Randomization is carried out with dynamic allocation by [CONTACT_839502] -coin method.  The allocation factors are gene mutation and baseline values for 
TTSTAND , and region (North America, South America, European Union [ EU], and Asia) .  Once 
randomized, participants will be stratified to the exon [ADDRESS_1166669] manufacturing organization  (CMO ).  All other parties will be blinded to the 
randomization.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1166670] Dosing  
The dose per participant  (in mg) will be calculated based on body  weight (in kg ) collected per 
the protocol .  Details of dose preparation can be found in the study Investigational Product 
Information Manual ( IPIM ).  Doses will be administered by [CONTACT_839503] a 1 hour period .  
All missed or incomplete doses will be documented.  The dispensed study drug vials will be 
stored at the research site until drug accountability is verified by [CONTACT_839504] . 
In the event it becomes necessary, or at the discretion of the parents/guardian, in consultation 
with the investigator and consulting surgeon and following adequately informed and voluntary 
parent/guardian consent and child assent, a totally implantable ce ntral venous access device 
(TICVAD) may be used, contingent upon approval by [CONTACT_123356]/or country -specific regulatory 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

basis for participants who experience difficulty with peripheral venous access.  Discussions 
regarding implantable ports for participants will include the study site investigator, medical 
monitor, and sponsor.  Be fore final decision, NS Pharma will obtain documentation from the 
investigator that the consulting surgeon who will place the port holds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180120] a 
board eligible/board certified surgeon.  Im plantation should not proceed without sponsor 
approval. Care of the TICVAD (including aseptic access and flushing) and patient monitoring 
must be performed by [CONTACT_233549]’s standard operating procedure.  
An alternative method of CVA  may only be considered in the case of a documented 
contraindication to the placement of a TICVAD.

by [CONTACT_839515].  
AEs may include, but are not limited to:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease.  
• Any deterioration in non -protocol -required measurements of laboratory value or other 
clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from investigational product.  
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of the 
product are not considered AEs after treatment, unless they reoccur after the participant  has 
recovered from the preexisting condition or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , they represent a 
clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency.  If clinically significant worsening 
from baseline is noted, the changes will be documented in the AE source document and the 
eCRF.   
TEAEs are defined as any AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of the 
investigational product and through 30 days after completion of study participation.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of investigational new drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.   
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator’s drug brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously

ongoing basis with new important safety information.   
11.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Even t 
An adverse event is serious when the participant  outcome is:  
• Death , 
• Life-threatening (see below for expanded definition) , 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged) , 
• Disability or permanent damage (see below for expanded definition) , 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect , 
• Important medical events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Life-threatening Experience: Any AE that places the participant , in the view of the site 
investigator , at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e. , does not include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180132].  However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180133] (e.g., life -threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically impo rtant 
event).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839485].   
However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839486].  
Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (e.g., no place to stay, live too far 
away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Disability or permanent damage: Any AE that results in a substantial disruption of a participant ’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., the AE resulted in a significant, persistent or 
permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the participant 's body function/structure, 
physical activities and/or quality of life.

appropriate medical judgment, it ma y jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
11.3 Severity  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.   
The severity of the AE will be characterized  and recorded  as “mild, moderate, severe , 
life-threatening or death ” according to the following definitions:  The CTCAE v4.0 3 guidelines 
for severity assessments will be used to grade AEs for this trial  (available at 
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).  The CTCAE v4.0 3 listed guidelines for severity 
assessment are:  
• Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only or 
intervention  not indicated  
• Moderat e: Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated or limited 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Sever e: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; or disabling; or limiting 
self-care ADL  
• Life-threatening:  Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated  
• Death:  Death related to AE  
Note:  A severe AE need not be serious , and a n SAE need not  be severe.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 86 of 114 11.4 Relationship  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the investigational 
product and the adverse event.  The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the investigational 
product may be described using the following scale:  
Not Related  
• Not Related : No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause.  
• Unlikely : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible).  Diseases or other drugs provide plausible 
explanations.  
Related  
• Possible : Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, 
involvement of the  investigational product  cannot be excluded.  
• Probable : Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the investigational product  is discontinued.  
• Definite : Established temporal association with administration of the  investigational 
product  with no other more probable cause.  The event should resolve when the 
investigational product is discontinued and recur on re -challenge.

Reporting of d isease related or DMD -related signs and symptoms as AEs are based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  However, progression of symptoms and signs associated with 
DMD that is inconsistent to the usual course of the disease should be reported as an AE in the 
eCRF and source documentation.  
11.7 Reportin g 
11.7.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent to 
study completion) will be collected on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, 
severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the investigational product.  For each AE, the 
following information will be recorded:  
• Description of the event (e.g., headache),  
• Date of onset,  
• Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing),  
• Action taken as a result of the event,  
• Seriousness of the event,  
• Severity of the event,  
• Outcome of the event, and  
• Investigator’s assessment of relationship to investigational product.  
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
AE (e.g., fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest x -ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”).  
The investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of the participant  and the response to 
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AE to investigational product administration should be determined by [CONTACT_839516].  
Clinically significant changes from time of ICF will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF.   
Clinically significant  changes are physical findings that have medical relevance and may result 
in an alteration in medical care.

To report the SAE, the investigator is to complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system for the study.  If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible 
to access the EDC system, the investigator is to send an e mail, phone or fax the event to the 
designated CRO within [ADDRESS_1166724] the information to the sponsor, and the medical monitor.  
11.9 Expedited Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The NS Pharma designated CRO  is responsible for reporting all relevant information about 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that are fatal or life -threatening as 
soon as possible to the applicable regulatory authorities in all the Member States concerned, and 
to the Central Ethi cs Committee, and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_941]

The NS Pharma designated CRO will also report any additional expedited safety reports required 
in accordance with the timelines outlined in country -specific legislation.  
The NS Pharma designated CRO will also inform all investigators as required per local 
regulation.  Reports of all applicable S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be communicated as soon as possible to the 
appropriate IRB/IEC and/or reported in accordance with local laws and regula tions.  
Investigators should file written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the 
designated CRO as applicable.  
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction to the study drug, that is both serious 
and unexpected , or any SAEs suspected to be related to the CVA port, to the US FDA , Health 
Canada (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i)  and C.05.014 , respectively ), and other national and local health 
authorities . 
11.[ADDRESS_1166726] be recorded either on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow -up written correspondence, as well as in 
the participant ’s source documentation.  Follow -up laboratory results should be filed with the 
participant ’s source documentation.  
For all AEs that require the participant  to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant ’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_839517], but without further recording 
in the eCRF.  The sponsor and designated CRO  retain the right to request additional information 
for any participant  with ongoing AEs /SAEs  at the end of the study, if judged necessary.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 90 of 114 11.11  General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Lab oratory Finding s 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the results indicating review.  For each laboratory test outside of 
the laboratory normal range, the investigator must ascertain if this represents a clinically 
significant change from baseline for the individual participant .  The investigator may repeat a 
laboratory test or request additional tests to verify results of the original laboratory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and clinically significant change from 
baseline for the participant , the investigator should determine if it qualifies as an AE, and if so, 
an appropriate eCRF will be completed.  All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
occurring during the study and that were not present at baseline should be followed and 
evaluated with additional tests if necessary , until diagnosis of the underlying cause, or resolution.  
11.11.[ADDRESS_1166727] morning void urine dipstick protein 2+, UPCR 0.5 mg/ mg, or 
UPCR  2  baseline , a first morning void urine dipstick protein will be repeated within [ADDRESS_1166728] , a 24 -hour urine sample will be 
collected within 1 week of the results to assess protein and creatinine.  If proteinuria on a 
24-hour urine sample is 300 mg/day, the patient will be referred to a pediatric nephrologist.  
In addition, a ny instances of hematuria or other potentially clinically significant abnormalit ies on 
urinalysis will be confirmed at the following week’s visit,  or sooner at discretion of the 
investigator.   Confirmed clinically significant treatment -emergent abnormalities will be recorded 
as AEs and discussed with the medical monitor.   Abnormalit ies will be monitored and evaluated 
with additional tests or consultations, if necessary, until the underlying cause is determined, or 
the event is brought to an acceptable resolution.   Additional clinical and laboratory information 
may be collected and documented in order to better characterize abnormalit ies and identify 
etiology and appropriate management.   Potential need for interruption or discontinuation of study 
drug should be discussed with the medical monitor and sponsor.  
If serum cystati n C 1.5  baseline, or if serum creatinine 2  baseline and 0.3 mg/dL, the test 
will be repeated within [ADDRESS_1166729].

(or at early termination, if applicable).  This should be done per standard of care at the 
institution.  
11.12  Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Electrocardiograms  
If a clinically significant ECG abnormality occurs that was not present at baseline (screening) 
and the investigator determines that the abnormality is related to investigational product , the 
abnormality will be discussed with the medical monitor.  The ECG abnormality will be 
monitored and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until the underlying cause is 
determined or the event is brought to an acceptable resolution.  Additional clinical and laboratory 
information will be collected and car efully documented in order to better characterize the ECG 
abnormality and rule out alternative causes.  ECG findings determined to be a clinically 
significant change from baseline should be reported as an adverse event regardless of causality.  
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be completed at the discretion of the investigator.  
11.13  Intravenous (IV) Access Considerations  
Investigational product  dosing will be administered through IV infusion.  Peripheral venous 
access (IV catheter that empties into a peripheral vein in the arms, hands, legs or feet) is the 
preferred route of investigational product administration for this study.   
A CVA (IV catheter that empties into a large central vein) will be considered on a case -by-case 
basis for participants who have difficulty with peripheral venous access.  A TICVAD is the 
preferred option of CVA , if necessary, for this study.  The sponsor will decide whether or not to 
approve this option after discussions with the investigator and medical monitor have ensured 
mutual agreement that CVA  will still maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio for the participant in 
this study.  Before final decision,  NS Pharma will obtain documentation from the investigator 
that the consulting surgeon who will place the port holds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180120] a board 
eligible/board certified surgeon.  The decision, rationale and conclusion regarding the maintained 
positive benefit/risk ratio will be detailed in writing and sent to the requesting site.  CVA  should 
not be implemented without sponsor approval.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 93 of 114 12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Considerations  
The statistical analyses described in this section will be performed as further outlined in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock .  The SAP will 
supersede the protocol if there are  any differences between the two documents in the plans for 
data analysis  and the differences will be noted in the SAP .  The SAP will be included as an 
appendix in the clinical study report for this protocol.   Statistical analyses will be performed 
using SAS 9. 2 or higher .  
12.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
For TTSTAND (calculated as a velocity, defined as rise per second), the sample size of 
74 participants has been calculated using the following values :  
• Mean difference = 0.05  
• Standard deviation = 0.075  
• Type I error level (two-sided) = 0.05  
• Power level = 0.8  
• Allocation ratio (N1: viltolarsen/N2: placebo) = 1  
The mean difference and the SD were set based on the result of comparison between viltolarsen 
group and natural history control group at 25 weeks in the Phase 2 Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 
(mean difference between 2 groups: 0. 0395 , SD: 0.[ZIP_CODE] and 0. [ZIP_CODE] ).  As the mean difference 
between the [ADDRESS_1166732] model repeat measurement 
(MMRM ) for the calculation method due to lack of prior information.  
When approximately 90% of participant s are enrolled in the study, a n unblinded review will be 
conducted and sample size re -estimation  will be considered .  An additional unblinded review and 
re-estimation will be performed when  approximately  [ADDRESS_1166733] completed the 
Week 49 evaluations for the primary outcome measure .  See Section  12.8 for details.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_1166734] .  Participant s will be analyzed as treated.  This will be the primary 
analysis population for the evaluation of exposure and safety.  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population will consist of all randomized participant s who 
received at least [ADDRESS_1166735] baseline  efficacy assessment.  Participant s will be analyzed as randomized.  This will be 
the primary analysis population for the evaluation of efficacy.  
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Summaries of participant demographics (age, race, ethnicity and dominant hand), baseline safety 
characteristics (anthropometrics, vital signs, physical examination, hematology, chemistry, 
urinalysis, ECG , and antibodies), and baseline efficacy parameters will be done.  
12.5 Efficacy Endpoints  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent to treat  (mITT ) population.   In 
addition, additional analyses will utilize the placebo treatment group.  
A hierarchical analysis, following a fixed -sequence hypothesis testing method, is used to first 
test TTSTAND and then TTRW, 6MWT, NSAA, TTCLIMB, and hand -held dynamometer, if 
the former was statistically significant.  
12.5.1  Efficacy Objective  
The primary efficacy outcome measure (TTSTAND) will be summarized by [CONTACT_839518].  
The TTSTAND times to perform the test will also be converted to velocities.  Note that a test  
result that is to be converted to velocity that the pa rticipant could not perform due to disease 
progression will have velocity set to zero only at the first visit where this occurs.  After that visit, 
missing observations due to disease progression will be left as missing.  
The TTSTAND will be compared between the viltolarsen treated participants and the placebo 
treated participants using MMRM analysis with treatment group, week of the visit, and the 
treatment -by-week interaction as factors, and age as one covariate, and base line performanc e as a 
second covariate.  The TTSTAND times to perform the test will be converted to velocities.

and TTCLIMB times to perform the test will be converted to velocities.  For a test that the 
participant could not perform, the velocity will be set to zero.  
12.6 Safety Assessments  
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  All safety assessments will be 
based on actual treatments received by [CONTACT_839520] .

Participants are required not to change the GC dose while on study.  Any changes in doses or 
schedule will be listed.  
Other concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_839524].  Each 
medication will be counted once within a participant using it, regardless of the number of times it 
was reported on the eCRFs.  The summaries will note new medications or supplements vs. those 
already given at baseline and study entry.  Any other treatment, surgeries, will be listed and 
described; however, those are expected to be few without a need to be summarized using tables.

12.8 Interim Analyses  
Interim analys is is planned when approximately 90% of participants are enrolled in the study .  
An additional unblinded review and re -estimation will be performed when approximately 
[ADDRESS_1166737] completed the  Week 49 evaluations for the primary outcome measure .  At 
these 2 time  points,  an unblinded data review will be conducted , which will include review by 
[CONTACT_4318].  Based on this review, the DSMB will make a recommendation to the sponsor for 
possible sample size re -estimation , i.e., the additional number of participants to be enrolled to 
increase the conditional power to an acceptable level.    
Denne ( Denne, 2001 ) described the sample size re -estimation procedure for the group sequential 
test by [CONTACT_839525] I error rate for the interim analyses.  
At the point at which the sample size re -estimation is being made for the interim analyses, the 
test statistic 𝑧1 is observed.  The conditional power is the probability of rejection 𝐻0 on the basis 
that 𝑍2≥𝑐2 given 𝑍1=𝑧1, which is denoted by 𝐶𝑃𝜃(𝑛2,𝑐2|𝑧1).  The conditional power is given 
by: 
𝐶𝑃𝜃(𝑛2,𝑐2|𝑧1)=1−𝛷[𝑐2√𝑛2−𝑧1√𝑛1−(𝑛2−𝑛1)
√2𝜎2𝜃
√𝑛2−𝑛1] 
where 𝑛1 is the sample size per treatment group at the interim analyses, the true difference in 
mean response 𝜃 is estimated by [CONTACT_839526]  𝛿, and 𝜎2 is estimated by 
[CONTACT_839527] 𝑠2.  The re -estimated sample size per treatment group 
𝑛2 is obtained by [CONTACT_839528] 80% power as defined in the sample 
size determination.  The re -estimated total sample size is given by 𝑛∗=2𝑛2. 
To preserve study integrity, a small alpha of 0.001 will be spent at the second re -estimation 
resulting in the overall significance level to be 0.049 at the final stage.  
If the re -estimated total sample size from the interim analyses is smaller than the planned total 
sample size of 74, the sample size adjustment will not be needed.   If the re -estimated total

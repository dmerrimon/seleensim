Title of Protocol: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Parallel Group, 
Placebo -and Active -Controlled, Phase [ADDRESS_559137] of Vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg/day vs Paroxetine 20 mg/day 
on Sexual Functioning in Healthy SubjectsIND No.:
76,307EudraCT No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: Vortioxetine -4001 Phase: 4
Study Design:
This is a phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -and active -controlled (paroxetine), 4-arm, parallel 
group, fixed -dose study comparing the effect of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg once daily [QD]) vs paroxetine (20 mg 
QD) on sexual functionin g after 5 weeks of treatment in healthy adult men and women. This outpatient study will be 
conducted at approximately 15 sites in North America. Men and women will be enrolled in approximately equal 
proportions (ie, 50% men and 50% women, overall). Enrollm ent will be capped for each sex when the enrollment 
target has been met for that sex stratum.
Subjects will enter a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks. At Baseline (Day 0), eligible subjects will be equally (1:1:1:1) 
randomized to double -blind vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, paroxetine 20 mg, or placebo and will be treated 
for 5 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_4321]. Subjects allocated to vortioxetine 20 mg will initiate treatment at 
10mg/day  for the first week. Subsequently, the dose will be increased to 20 mg/day and remain at 20 mg/day until 
study completion. Subjects allocated to vortioxetine 10 mg will initiate treatment at 10 mg/day and remain at 
10mg/day  until study  completion. Subjects allocated to paroxetine 20 mg will initiate tre atment at 20 mg/day  and 
remain at 20 mg/day  until study completion. Subjects will be instructed to take their first dose of study drug the day 
after Baseline on Day 1, preferably in the morning. After randomization, subjects will be seen for weekly visits and 
receive a follow -up safety contact [CONTACT_107461] 2 weeks after the end of double -blind treatment. At the end of 5 weeks 
of treatment, or at early termination (ET), all subjects will abruptly discontinue study drug.
Sexual functioning will be assessed at each study visit using the CSFQ -14 (primary variable). The PGI -I scale will be 
administered at each study visit except at Screening and Baseline. Signs of suicidal risk will be assessed at each study 
visit using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and the investigator’s clinical judgment. Safety will 
be assessed throughout the study. A total of 6 sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) samples (trough samples) will be collected 
to measure plasma vortioxetine or paroxetine concentrations at Weeks 3, 4, and 5/ET (2 samples at each time point). A 
pharmacogenomic (PGx) blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation will be collected predose at 
Baseline (Day 0), and 2 PGx blood samples for ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolation will be collected predose at Baseline 
(Day  0) and also at Week 5/ET (ie, [ADDRESS_559138]). 
Primary Objective:
To evaluate the effect of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg QD) vs paroxetine 20 mg QD on sexual functioning in 
healthy  subjects after 5 weeks of double -blind treatment. 
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate the effect of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg QD) vs paroxetine 20 mg QD on sexual functioning in 
healthy  subjects throughout the 5 -week double -blind Treatment Period.
To evaluate the effect of paroxetine (20 mg QD) vs placebo on sexual functioning in healthy subjects throughout 
the 5 -week double -blind Treatment Period.
To evaluate the effect of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg QD) vs placebo on sexual functioning in healthy subjects 
throughout the 5 -week double -blind Treatment Period .

Statistical Considerations:
Primary Analysis
Mean change from Baseline in the CSFQ -14 total score difference for vortioxetine vs paroxetine after 5 weeks of 
treatment will be the primary endpoint. The primary analysis will be based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) technique, with treatment, center, and sex as fixed factors, and 
baseline CSFQ -14 total score as covariate. The comparisons will be between each vortioxetine dose (10 or 20 mg) and 
paroxetine, and both statistical tests will be [ADDRESS_559139] for 
multiplicity and control the familywise type I error rate at a significance level of 0.05. If the smaller of the 2 p -values 
is <0.025, significance is obtained for the associated vortioxetine dose and the other dose will then be evaluated at a 
0.05 significance level. Although vortioxetine will be compared with paroxetine in the primary analysis, paroxetine 
Vortioxetine
Study No. Vortioxetine -4001 Page 14of 88
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 01 10 January 2017
CONFIDENTIALwill also be compared with placebo to validate the study.
Secondary Analyses
Change f rom Baseline in CSFQ -14 total score for vortioxetine vs paroxetine, paroxetine vs placebo, and vortioxetine 
vs placebo at each visit will also be analyzed using ANCOVA and LOCF, with treatment, center, and sex as fixed 
factors, and baseline CSFQ -14 total score as covariat e. Similar analyses will also be performed for the male and 
female subgroups. Comparisons to placebo will be made at the significance level of 0.05 outside of multiplicity 
control.
The percentage of subjects meeting criteria for sexual dysfunction (ie, CSF Q-14 total score ≤47 for men and ≤41 for 
women) at any visit (using LOCF) during the double -blind Treatment Period will be analyzed by [CONTACT_51621], 
adjusting for baseline CSFQ -14 total score, sex, and treatment.
Change from Baseline in CSFQ -14 subs cales 5 dimensions and 3 phases of the sexual response cycle will be analyzed 
at all visits using ANCOVA and LOCF similar to the primary analysis.
Additional Analyses
The percentage of subjects meeting criteria for sexual dysfunction (ie, CSFQ -14 total sco re ≤47 for men and ≤41 for 
women) at any 2 consecutive visits (using LOCF) during the double -blind Treatment Period will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_51621], adjusting for baseline CSFQ -[ADDRESS_559140] method to 
handle ties, with treatment and sex as factors.
CSFQ -14 shift f rom normal (ie, CSFQ -14 total score >47 for men and >41 for women) at Baseline to abnormal 
(ie,CSFQ -14 total score ≤47 for men and ≤41 for women), and CSFQ -14 n egative responders (decrease from Baseline 
in CSFQ -14 total score ≥3) will be analyzed at all visits by [CONTACT_51621], adjusting for baseline CSFQ -14 total 
score, sex, and treatment.
PGI-I will be analyze d by [CONTACT_441018], with treatment, center, and sex as fixed factors.
C-SSRS will be summarized by [CONTACT_441019].
Safety Analyses
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Reg ulator y Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_441020] -blind Treatment Period and the entire study. AEs that were 
reported more than once by a subject during the double -blind Treatment Period will be coun ted only  once for that 
subject at the maximum severity.
Absolute values and changes from Screening/Baseline for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and weight will be 
summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. Clinical laboratory test and vital sign results that are 
outside the normal ranges and potentially clinically significant will be flagged and tabulated. Physical examination 
findings will also be summarized for each treatment group.
PK Analysis
Plasma concentrations of vortioxetine and paroxetine will be presented in the data listings. A population PK analysis 
will only be conducted if deemed necessary. If this analysis is conducted, the results will be reported in a separate 
populatio n PK report.
PGx Analysis
DNA sample s may be used to understand the mode of action of vortioxetine, and RNA samples may be used for 
subsequent pathway analysis. Also, since PGx is an evolving science, many genes and their functions are not yet fully 
understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response, which may lead to additional 
hypothesis -generating exploratory research and diagnostic development using stored samples.

CONFIDENTIALSample Size Justification: 
Approximately 352 male and female subjects will be randomized to 4 treatment arms.
Assuming an SD of 8.5 for the change from Baseline in CSFQ -14 total score, a total of 352 male and female subjects 
(88 subjects per arm) is sufficient to achieve ≥80% power to detect a difference of 4.[ADDRESS_559141] with a 0.025 2 -sided significance 
level. Given the proposed Holm -Bon ferroni method for multiplicity control, the power to achieve the significance for 
each vortioxetine dose is app roximately 85%.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the [LOCATION_002] is 8.3%, based on a 
recent World Healt h Organizat ion (WHO) World Mental Health survey [1]. Furthermore, the 
burden is likely to grow over the coming years. According to the WHO, depressio n alone accounts 
for 4.3% of the global burden o f disease and is among the largest single causes of disabilit y 
worldwide (11% of all years li ved wi th disabili ty globally), parti cularly  for wom en [2].
Depressio n poses an econo mic burden on the patients, their families and friends, and society. The 
abilit y of depressed pat ients or their caregivers to work and m ake productive contributions to the 
economy is reduced, whereas the utilization of treatment and support services is increased. The 
economic consequences of these healt h losses are significant: a recent study  estimated that the 
cumulative glo bal impact of m ental  disorders in terms of lost economic output will amount to 
US$ 16.3 millio n between 2011 and 2030 [2]. 
Unfortunately, most of the currently available ant idepressants produce sexual dysf unction in men 
and wo men and affect all phases of sexual act ivity by [CONTACT_441021], arousal, orgasm, and 
ejaculat ion [3-7]. Such si de effects affect the patient’s qualit y of life, can lead to therapeuti c 
nonco mpliance, and often interfere with recovery  from a depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] [4,8-10] . In a study  
conducted by  [CONTACT_53408]  (2004) [11], patients receiving antidepressant treatment were asked to rank 
which of the side effects they  experienced were the most bothersome. In this population, sexual 
dysfunct ion was ranked as the most bothersome ad verse event (AE), followed by 
[CONTACT_298044]/fat igue, weight gain, and insomnia.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_440997] n, ant idepressant -related sexual dysfunct ion is one of the most under 
reported AEs [11,12]. In a study  by [CONTACT_441022] o-Gonzalez et al (1 997), only 14% of the patients 
spontaneously reported sexual -related AEs; when elicited by [CONTACT_441023], however, as many as 
58% of these patients reported sexual dysfunct ion [13].
Using an object ive measurement to assess the rate of sexual dysfunction in a sample of individuals 
receiving ant idepressant monotherapy, Clayton and Montejo (2006) [14] found that the prevalence 
of sexual dysfunctio n was on average 24% (ranging fro m 7% to 30%, depending on the 
medicat ion).
Vorti oxetine is an ant idepressant agent approved in 66 countries worldwide, including in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) and the European Union since 2013, for treatment of MDD. It differs from 
preexist ing antidepressants in that it combines [ADDRESS_559143] ion: direct 
modulat ion of 5 -hydroxy tryptamine (5 -HT) (serotonin) receptor activit y and inhibit ion of the 
5-HT transporter. Vortioxet ine is an antagon ist at 5-HT 3, 5-HT 7, and 5-HT 1Dreceptors, an agonist 
at 5-HT 1Areceptors, a partial agonist at 5 -HT 1Breceptors, and an inhibitor of the 5 -HT transporter 
[15,16].
During the clinical development program, the efficacy , safet y, and tol erabili ty of vorti oxetine in 
subjects wi th MDD was evaluated at doses fro m 1 to 20 m g/day  in short -term efficacy studi es of  
6to 8weeks’ duration and long -term safety studi es up to 52 w eeks’ duration. Vortioxetine was

CONFIDENTIALsafe and well -tolerated across the dose range evaluated. The efficacy of vortioxetine in the 
treatm ent of subjects with MDD was established in 6 randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, fixed- dose, 6 -to 8-week studies (including 1 study  in the elderly). Efficacy  
was established at doses of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, wit h the recommended starting dose being 
10mg/day [17]. 
The l ong-term efficacy  and mainten ance of effect of vortioxet ine treatment at doses of 5 and 
10mg/day have been previ ously  established in subjects with MDD [18].
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Treatment with ant idepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may 
be associ ated wi th sexual dysfunct ion including AEs at virt ually all phases of sexual response 
(ie,desire, arousal , and orgasm ), which can frequent ly result in poor treatment compliance and 
even ant idepressant treatment discont inuat ion [5].Results fro m phase [ADDRESS_559144] ion 
(TESD) when co mpared with duloxetine, and i s similar to placebo at the 5 and 10 mg doses, as 
assessed by  [CONTACT_441024] (ASEX) 
and by  [CONTACT_441025] 8 weeks of treatment [17].
A subsequent study  was conducted to evaluate the effects of vortioxet ine in improving 
antidepressant -associ ated sexual dysfunct ion compared with another antidepressant using an 
objective measure, the Changes in Sexual Funct ioning Quest ionnaire Short -Form  (CSFQ -14). In 
this study , adul t subjects wi th MDD whose depressive symptoms were well treated with [ADDRESS_559145] igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n was attributed to the subject’s 
current SSRI treatment, were switched to vortioxetine or escitalopram. Vortioxet ine was 
statist ically significant ly superior to escitalopram in improving SSRI -induced sexual dysfunct ion 
as measured by [CONTACT_441026]- 14 total  score at Week 8 [19].
The obj ective o f the current study  is to further evaluate the effects of vortioxet ine on sexual 
funct ioning as compared wit h paroxetine, an SSRI known to cause sexual dysfunct ion, in healt hy 
subjects after 5 weeks of treatment. 
Pharmacogeno mic (PGx) analy sis may  be conducted to evaluate the contribut ion of genet ic 
variance on drug response (eg, safet y and tol erability ). The sam pling of whol e blood for PGx 
analysis is mandatory; every  subject m ust consent to this procedure to participate in this study .

CONFIDENTIAL6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION
6.1 Study Design
This is a phase 4, mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -and active -controlled 
(paroxetine), [ADDRESS_559147] of vortioxet ine (10 and 
20 m g QD) vs paroxetine (20 mg QD) on sexual funct ioning after 5 weeks of t reatment in healt hy 
adult men and wom en. This outpatient study  will be conducted at approximately 15 sites in North 
America. Men and wo men will be enrolled in approximately equal proportions (ie, 50% men and 
50% women, overall). Enro llment will be capped f or each sex when the enro llment target has been 
met for that sex stratum.
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibilit y dur ing a Screening 
Period of  up to [ADDRESS_559148] norm al sexual  functioning (as defined by [CONTACT_441027] -14), have been in a steady  relationship for ≥3 months, are currently sexually active, and 
meet all other study  entry  criteria will be enrolled. At Baseline (Day 0), eligible subjects will be 
equally (1:1:1:1) randomized to double -blind vortioxetine [ADDRESS_559149] acebo and will be treated for 5 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_4321]. 
Subjects allocated to vortioxet ine 20 mg will init iate treatment at 10 mg/day for the first week. 
Subsequently, the dose will be increased to 20 mg/day and remain at 20 mg/day unt il study  
completion. Subjects allocated to vortioxetine 10 mg will init iate treatm ent at 10 m g/day and 
remain at 10 mg/day unt il study co mpletion. Subjects allocated to paroxetine 20 mg will initiate 
treatm ent at 20 m g/day and rem ain at 20 mg/day unt il study  com pletion. Subjects will be 
instructed to take their first dose of study  drug the day  after Baseline on Day  1, preferably in the 
morning. After randomizat ion, subjects will be seen for w eekly visit s and receive a fo llow-up 
safet y contact 2 weeks after the end of double -blind treatment. At the end of 5 weeks of treatment, 
or at Early Terminat ion (ET), all subjects will abruptly  discontinue study  drug.
Sexual functioning will be assessed at each study visit using the CSFQ -14 (primary  variable). The 
PGI-I scale will be administered at each study visit  except at Screening and Baseline. Signs of  
suicidal risk will be assessed at each study  visit using the C -SSRS and the invest igator’s clinical 
judgment. Safet y will be assessed throughout the study . A total  of 6 sparse pharmacokinet ic (PK) 
samples (trough samples) will be collected to measure plasma vortioxet ine or paroxetine 
concentrations at Weeks 3, 4, and 5/ET (2 samples at each time point). A PGx blood sample for 
deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) iso lation will be collected at Baseline (Day  0), and 2 PGx blood 
samples for ribonucleic acid (RNA) iso lation will be co llected at Baseline (Day 0) and also at 
Week 5/ET (ie, [ADDRESS_559150]).
The en d of the study  is defined as the date the last subject completes the Final Visit (Week 5).

The PGI -
I scale is a global self assessment used to rate th e response of a subject’s condit ion to 
therapy  or intervent ion (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Although it was originally developed for assessment  
in wo men with stress urin ary incont inence, it has been used for subject self assessment in other 
condi tions due to i ts lack of specificit y to medical condit ions, and its sensit ivity to change. 
Adequate measures have been implemented in this study  to assess suicidal risk. The sele ction 
criteria exclude the participat ion of subjects at significant risk for suicide. Throughout the study , 
signs of  suicidal risk will be assessed both by  [CONTACT_441030]
e assessment (C -SSRS) and by 
[CONTACT_1697] ’s clinical judgment. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study  in case of such risk.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug
Vorti oxetine is a novel co mpound developed by [CONTACT_441038] H. Lundbeck A/S as an antidepressant 
and treatment for MDD. Vortioxet ine belo ngs to a new chemical class of psycho tropi [INVESTIGATOR_1102], the 
bis-aryl-sulfanyl amines, which possess unique properties co mpared with current ly known 
psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. This new class of co mpounds is structurally different fro m all currently known 
psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].
Vorti oxetine is commercially  formulated as imm ediate -release tabl ets intended for oral 
administration. The study  drug i s film -coated tabl ets containing the hydrobromide (HBr) salt of 
vorti oxetine. The tablets contain vortioxet ine-HBr corresponding to 10 and 20 mg o f vorti oxetine 
base. Well known excip ients are used to manufacture the tablet cores.
Paroxetine 20 mg tablets [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (USP) immediate release are commercially

9.1.4 Physical Examination Procedure
A baseline physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment prior to first dose of study  drug) will 
consist of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) ears, nose, throat; (3) cardiovascular system; 
(4) respi [INVESTIGATOR_36517]; (5) gastrointestinal system; (6) dermatologic system; (7)extremit ies; (8) 
musculoskeletal system; (9) nervous system; (10) lymph nodes; and (11) other. A genitourinary  
examinat ion will not be required. 
All subsequent phy sical examinat ions shoul d assess clinically  significant changes from  the 
assessment pri or to the first dose of study  drug (baseline examinat ion).
9.1.[ADDRESS_559190] ing height is cent imeters without decimal p laces and for 
weight it is kilograms (kg) with [ADDRESS_559191]. BMI should be derived as fo llows: 
BMI = weight (kg)/[hei ght (m )]2
Note that although height is measured in centimeters, the BMI formula uses meters for height; 
meters can be determined by  [CONTACT_441041] 100. Thus, for example, if height=176 cm 
(1.76 m eters) and wei ght=79.2 kg, then BMI=79.2/1.762=25.[ZIP_CODE] kg/m2.
BMI values will be reported to [ADDRESS_559192] by [CONTACT_45323]. The above value should be captured 
as 25.6 kg/m2in the database .
9.1.6 Vital Sign Procedure
Vital signs will  include body  temperature (oral  or tympanic), pulse (beats per minute), and sitting
blood pressure (taken after 5 minutes in the sitting posit ion).
When vital signs are scheduled at the same t ime as blood draws, the blo od draw will take priorit y 
and vital signs will be obtained before or after the scheduled blood draw.
9.1.[ADDRESS_559193]’s ECG trace: heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, 
QT interval, QRS interval and corrected QT interval. The central reade r will  interpret the ECG 
using 1 of the fo llowing categori es: wi thin norm al limits or abnorm al. If  interpreted as abnormal, 
the invest igator will assess the findings as either abnormal clinically significant, or abnormal not 
clinically significant. The int erpretation of the ECG will be recorded in the source documents and 
in the eCRF. ECG traces recorded on thermal paper will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_441004]. Vortioxetine -[ADDRESS_559194] ing and

(2 items), desi re/interest (3 i tems), arousal  (3 items), and orgasm (3 items). Two addit ional items
are included in the total  score, but do not map to a specific phase of the sexual response cycle.
Lower scores are associated with worsened sexual funct ioning [20]. The subject should complete 
the CSFQ- [ADDRESS_559196] -baseline visits .
[IP_ADDRESS] PGI-I Scale
The PGI -I scale is a global self assessment used to rate the response of a subject’s condit ion to 
therapy  orintervent ion. It consists of one question that asks the subject to rate their current 
condi tion compared to how it was prior to beginning treatm ent on a scale of 1 (very much better) to 
7 (very  much worse). It was originally  devel oped for assessment in wo men with stress urinary  
incont inence [21]. However, due to its lack o f specificit y for medical condit ions, and its sensit ivity 
to change, it has been used for subject self assessment in other condit ions. The subje ct shoul d 
complete the CSFQ -[ADDRESS_559197] -baseline visit s.
9.1.9 C-SSRS
The C -SSRS was developed by [CONTACT_441042] y as a t ool to help systemat ically

9.1.15 PGx Sample Collection
DNA form s the basis for the genes that make the body  produce proteins such as enzymes, drug 
transporters, or drug targets, and may be evaluated for the genet ic contribut ion to how the drug is 
broken down or how the drug affects the body . This i s called a “PGx research study .” Specific 
purposes of such a study  include the fo llowing:
Identifying genet ic reasons why certain people respond differently to vortioxet ine.
Finding out more informat ion about how vortioxetine works.
Generat ing informat ion needed for research, development, and regulatory  approval  of tests to 
predi ct response to vortioxetine.
Ident ifying variations in genes r elated to the bio logical target of vortioxetine.
This information may be used, for example, to develop a better understanding of the safet y and 
efficacy of vortioxet ine and other study drugs, and for improving the efficiency, design, and study 
methods of f uture research studies.
In the current study, co llection of PGx blood samples is mandatory for each subject. PGx informed 
consent is a component of the overall study  informed consent. 
One 6 -mL who le blood sample for DNA iso lation will be co llected predos e at Baseline (Day 0) 
from each subject in the study , into pl astic potassium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (K 2EDTA) 
spray -coated tubes, and stored under frozen condit ions. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot 
of blood m ay be co llected if iso lation of DNA fro m the first sample was not successful or possible. 
In addit ion, if the who le blood sample for DNA isolat ion is not collected at Baseline, it may be 
collected at any  point in the study .
Two 2.5 -mL who le blood samples for RNA iso lation will be co llected predose at Baseline (Day 0 ) 
and also at Week 5/ET from each subject in the study  (ie, [ADDRESS_559210]), into a PaxGene 
tube. 
Each PGx sample for a study  subject shoul d be ident ifiable on the requisit ion form with a 8-digit 
subject ID number (the [ADDRESS_559211] number).
The samples will be stored for no longer than 15 years after complet ion of the vortioxet ine study . 
No sam ples will  be stored for l onger than permitted by  [CONTACT_441043]. “Stored samples” are defined as samples that are 
key-coded (the samples are stripped of all personal identifying information but a key  links the 
samples to the clinical data collected fro m the sampl e donor) and are used in the analysis of study 
drug or related drugs.

9.1.[ADDRESS_559214] Treatment Compliance
A digital com pliance techno logy will be implemented in this study , as described below. Subjects 
will also be required to bring study  drug con tainers to each clinic visit, regardless of whether the 
study  drug container is empt y.
Subjects will be mo nitored for com pliance using AiCure’s artificial intelligence plat form. The 
techno logy will be provi ded as a smartphone application. Subjects will use the smartphone 
applicat ion to m onitor them selves taking the study  drug. Subj ects will eit her download the 
applicat ion to thei r own sm artphone, or for subjects who do not have a smartphone or who do not 
wish to downl oad the applicat ion to thei r own device, a smartphone- like device will be issued to 
them and m ust be returned at the end of their participat ion in the study . The Heal th Insurance 
Portabilit y and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) –compliant artificial intelligence so ftware is able to 
ident ify and confirm the subject, the study  drug, and ingest ion of the study  drug. 
The subjects will mo nitor them selves taking the study  drug using the applicat ion each time they 
take the study drug during the study. At the required dosing t ime, the software provides a reminder 
and takes the subject through a mult istep process: (1) subject ident ification; (2) study drug 
ident ificat ion; (3) confirmat ion that the subject has placed the study drug in his or her mouth. After 
determinat ion of medication adherence by [CONTACT_336761], d ata captured will be 
encrypted and transmitted to a secure, ce ntralized, web -based dashboard, which the study  site can 
access through a roles -and-rules-restri cted, HIPAA -compliant system . When a subject is init ially 
registered, a resi dential and/or m obile phone number will be encry pted and stored onto the 
dashboard. Subjects will also be able to manually enter into their device at a later time period if 
they took study drug but di d not have their device on them, or if it was not working at the time.
If the study  drug is not taken or is not taken correctly , the study  site will be notified through the 
dashboard as well as by [CONTACT_441045] (SMS) messaging. Study sites will be able 
to intervene wit h the subject direct ly through the dashboard if the study drug is not taken or not 
taken correctly. In addit ion, subjects will receive an automated message to their device reminding 
them to take their study drug, or if there is a low battery. The device will ring if subjects are late in

and/or <70% compliant between visit s),the medical  monitor shoul d be consul ted to discuss 
whether it may  be appropri ate to wi thdraw the subject fro m the study . All subjects shoul d be 
reinstructed about the dosing requirements during study  contacts. The authori zed study  personnel 
conducting the re -education must document the process in the subject source records. 
9.3 Schedule of Observations and Procedur es
The schedule for all study -related procedures for all evaluat ions is shown in Appendix A.
Assessments should be co mpleted at the designated visit/time po int(s).
9.4 Biological Sample Retention and Destruction
In this study, specimens for genome/gene analysis will be collected as descr ibed in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_559216] the subjects’ personal informat ion to ensure optima l 
confident iality and defined standard processes for sample and data collect ion, storage, analysis, 
and destruction.
The sponsor and researchers working with the sponsor will have access to the samples collected 
and any  test resul ts. All  samples collected during the study  will be stored securely  with limited 
access and the sponsor will require anyo ne who works with the samples to agree to hold the 
research informat ion and any results in confidence.
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample ident ifier similar to labeling in the main study but 
using a code that is different from the code attached to the health information and other clinical test 
resul ts collected in the study . The sample and data are linked to personal health informat ion with

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f a drug whether or not
it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_559219] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_3433] e invest igator for any reason.
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (includin g 
abnorm al laboratory  values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as addit ional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded appropriately as a PTE(s) or 
as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values findings:
Changes in laboratory  values are o nly considered to be PTEs or AEs if they are judged to be 
clinically significant (ie, if so me act ion or intervention is required or if the invest igator judges 
the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physiologic fluctuation). A laboratory  re-test 
and/or continued mo nitoring of an abnormal value are not considered an intervent ion. In

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 01 10 January 2017
CONFIDENTIALaddition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion, or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory v alues are the result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis 
(eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be reported appropriately 
as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at th e time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, X -rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to 
study  procedures. However, i f the subject experi ences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complication occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_39747] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any
occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”) .
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensu re that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be record ed appropriately as an AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complica tion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs /Serious PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y recorded.
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PT Es or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
Vortioxetine
Study No. Vortioxetine -[ADDRESS_559220] ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plications result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The invest igator must make the distinction bet ween exacerbation o f pre-exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any  
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF.
Suicidali ty events:
A co mpleted suicide is always an SAE based on its fatal outcome. Addit ionally , for the 
purpose of this development pr ogram , active suicidal behaviors such as “suicidal intent ion 
with a defini te plan” and “suicide attempt” will also be collected as SAEs. Unless the event 
meets other serious criteria, suicidal thoughts or suicidal ideations that do not include a definit e 
plan or acti on will be collected as nonserious AEs in accordance wit h the standard AE 
reporting requirements (eg, if a pre -exist ing suicidal ideat ion recorded on the screening 
C-SSRS got worse during the study, it should be reported as an AE). A subject pre senting with 
self-mutilat ion or other ty pes of  self-injury  should be quest ioned by  [CONTACT_441048]. If the event was suicidal in intent, the invest igator should 
include suicidal behavior as part of the verba tim term on the eCRF, that is, “slit wrists/suicidal 
behavior.” Such an event will be co llected as an SAE. Acts of self -mutilat ion or self -injury 
without sui cidal  intention, for example, self -imposed cigarette burns, will be collected as 
nonseri ous AEs.
10.1.[ADDRESS_559221] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.

The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications, and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably  be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications, and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of t he AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae, or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTEs (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly  over a peri od of  consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug
Drug withdrawn –a study  drug i s stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not chang ed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  drug.

Recovered/Resolved –the subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the 
AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or

CONFIDENTIAL13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis
Mean change fro m Baseline in the CSFQ -14 total score difference for vortioxet ine vs paroxet ine 
after 5 weeks of treatment will be the primary endpoint. The primary  analysis will be based on 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the last observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF) technique, 
with treatment, center, and sex as fixed factors, and baseline CSFQ -14 total score as covariate. The 
comparisons will be between each vortioxet ine dose (10 or 20 mg) and paroxetine, and both 
statist ical t ests will be [ADDRESS_559243] for mult iplicity 
and control the familywise t ype I error rate at a significance level o f 0.05. If the sm aller of the 
2 p-values is <0.025, significance is obtained for the associated vortioxet ine dose and the other 
dose will then be evaluated at a 0.0 5 significance level. Alt hough vortioxet ine will be co mpared 
with paroxetine in the primary analysis, paroxetine will also be co mpared wit h placebo to validate 
the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analyses
Change from Baseline in CSFQ -[ADDRESS_559244] ion (ie, CSFQ -14 total score ≤47 for 
men and ≤41 for w omen) at any visit (using LOCF) during the double -blind Treatment Period will 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_441051] n, adjust ing for baseline CSFQ -14 total  score, sex, and treatment.
Change from Baseline in CSFQ -14 subscales 5 dimensions and 3 phases of the sex ual response 
cycle will  be analyzed at all visit s using ANCOVA and LOCF similar to the primary analysis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Analyses
The percentage of subjects meeting criteria for sexual dysfunct ion (ie, CSFQ -14 total score ≤47 for 
men and ≤41 for wom en) at any  2consecut ive visits (using LOCF) during the double -blind 
Treatment Period will be analyzed by [CONTACT_441051] n, adj usting for baseline CSFQ -[ADDRESS_559245] m ethod to handle ties, with treatment and sex as factors.
CSFQ -14 shift fro m no rmal (ie, CSFQ -14 total score >47 for men and >41 for women) at Baseline 
to abnormal (ie, CSFQ -14 total  score ≤47 for men and ≤41 for women), and CSFQ -14 negat ive 
responders (decrease from Baseline in CSFQ -14 total  score ≥3) will be analyzed at all visit s by 
[CONTACT_441052] n, adj usting for baseline CSFQ -[ADDRESS_559246] ings.

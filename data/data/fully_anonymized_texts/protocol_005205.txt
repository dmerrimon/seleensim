5.2 Purpose of the Study  
This study will compare the clinical performance of  and DT1 lenses, both made of 
delefilcon A core material but with different manufacturing processes.  The primary endpoint 
was selected to fulfill the primary objective of the study. Procedures for meas urement of 
these endpoints were selected based on common practice for these assessments . The design 
of this study is justified based upon preclinical and clinical testing, as described within the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  DT1 lenses were chosen as the compa rator  product because these 
lenses have the same wear modality  and are made of the same core materia l. 
At the end of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and standards.  
There are no immed iate plans to submit the results of this study for publication; however, the 
results may be offered for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the results relate to 
a product that is subsequently approved or cleared for marketing.  
5.3 Risks and Benefits  
The clinical investigation process risks are managed through appropriate training and 
monitoring according to the protocol -specific monitoring plan . Investigational device risks , 
including risks associated with use of device and methods and procedures for application of 
device , are defined in the investigator ’s brochure and/or product labeling and are managed 
through review of safety assessments outlined in this protocol.

Only after signing the ICF, a subject will be assigned a subject number by [CONTACT_271451].  
A randomization list will be generated using a validat ed system that automates the random 
assignment of treatment (lens sequence)  to randomization numbers in the specified ratio.  
Subjects will be assigned treatment (lens sequence) according to the randomization list 
uploaded in the EDC/ randomization integration system . The randomization list will be 
generated and maintained by  [CONTACT_4530] . 
At Visit 1, all eligible subjects will be randomized via the EDC/ randomization  integration  
system to one of the treatment s (lens sequence s). The investigator  or delegate will access the 
respective system after confirming that the subject meets all the eligibility criteria. A 
randomization number will be automatically assigned to the subject according to the subject

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm  (i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
device deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications ( e.g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging de ficit ( e.g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)  
• Suspect product contamination  
• Lack of performance

Alcon – Business Use Only  clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected  from the time of informed consent . Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the medica l 
history section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.   
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the Investigator must document all device deficiencies repor ted or 
observed with test and control product s on the device deficiency eCRF. The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adve rse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.   
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy Report,  
• Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event  and Adverse Device Effect eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse E vent and Adverse Device Effect  and/or Device Deficiency  
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study Sponsor at [EMAIL_5271]  
according to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported informat ion must be entered 
into the EDC system once it becomes operational.

Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the Study 
Sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have le d to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subje ctive symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interf erence with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
 
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the ca usality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_271456], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly 
related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical 
device or study procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_271457].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or 
simply unlikely to be related ( i.e., there are other more likely causes for 
the AE).  
The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to related .

of subject safety, the Investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_271459] p rior to unmasking the information if there is sufficient time. Dependent upon 
the individual circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to 
contact [CONTACT_125606]. The Study Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which 
the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the Study Sponsor may 
be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  reporting 
requirements.  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The Investigator should provide the Study Sponsor with any new saf ety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of discontinuation , any 
additional information received at follow -up should be  documented in the eCRFs up to study 
completion (i .e., database lock).   Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_330916] 
completed the study should be documented and available upon the Study Sponsor ’s request.  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the postmarket  vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to 
the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.

12.4.1  Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate noninferiority in VA at distance wh en 
wearing contact [CONTACT_271448]1contact [CONTACT_13276], after approximately 4 days of 
wear.  
The primary endpoint is distance VA with study lenses (dispensed power) at Day 4, collected 
for each eye in logMAR.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and al ternative hypotheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority:  
H0: μ(T) – μ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: μ(T) – μ(C)< 0.05  
where μ(T) and μ(C) denote the mean distance VA at Day 4  
on the logMAR scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effects repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model  
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by [CONTACT_23259], sequence , and habitual lens brand

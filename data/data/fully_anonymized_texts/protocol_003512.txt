Study Protocol with Statistical Analysis Plan, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 09/17/2025 Objectives: The purpose of this study was to pi[INVESTIGATOR_485142] a tax ﬁling app within parent-child health programs to test whether such referrals can increase receipt of tax credits among low-income parents.  Design: The study used a single-group, pre/post test design. Methods:  The setting for this project was maternal/child health services in Los Angeles County, [LOCATION_004]. Los Angeles County is the largest metropolitan area of the US with over 12 million residents. Our primary study sites were a community-based non-proﬁt that provided maternal/child health services to low-income parents and a safety net pediatric clinic.  Healthcare workers (i.e. nurses, physicians and community health workers) provided brief information about the potential beneﬁts of tax credits and tax ﬁling during parent or child encounters with eligible participants at program sites. In addition, text-messages were sent to eligible patients recently seen in a pediatric clinic.   The target population was parents making less than $75,000 per year seeking maternal/parental or child health services. Parents were eligible to participate in the project if they were within the income threshold, had one or more children under six years of age, spoke English or Spanish, and had a valid tax ﬁling ID (SSN or ITIN). Parents were ineligible if they had already ﬁled taxes or were experiencing an acute mental health crisis (e.g., suicidality).  Parents were recruited during parent or child healthcare program encounters within program sites during each tax season (January to April. Those who provided informed consent to participate in the project completed a baseline survey and received referral information about tax ﬁling, with the option to use a tax ﬁling platform called Let’s Get Set at no cost. Parents completed the ﬁrst follow-up survey to assess outcome measures and use of tax credit refunds at the end of tax season in May of each year. A second follow-up survey was sent at six months follow-up in October of each year. Reminders for survey completion were sent via phone and text for each study timepoint. We oFered a $30 incentive for survey completion at each timepoint (up to $90 total for completion of all surveys).   
Statistical Analysis Plan: This was a small feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_485143]. Descriptive statistics to describe the sample’s demographic and health characteristics. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical or binary variables. We examined the frequency of tax ﬁling prior to and during the study as the primary outcome, plus exploratory measures of parent and child health using frequencies and means. Bivariate tests were used to compare diFerences in parent and child health status.

 WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?  The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_485144] ‘Let’s Get Set’ during healthcare encounters can help families receive tax credits by ﬁling taxes, what families think of the app, and whether receipt of tax credits after using ‘Let’s Get Set’ improves family well-being. We are interested in understanding the mental well-being of you and your children, as well other ways tax credits might have aDected your life.   HOW LONG WILL THE RESEARCH LAST AND WHAT WILL I NEED TO DO?  Participation will take a total of about one hour, broken down into three 20-minute surveys. If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:  • Review information about the Let’s Get Set app during this healthcare visit • Take a 20-minute, web-based survey before trying the Let’s Get Set app • Take a 20-minute, web-based survey at the end of tax season  • Repeat the survey after [ADDRESS_623318] 45-60 minutes.  ARE THERE ANY RISKS IF I PARTICIPATE?  There are no anticipated risks or discomforts to participating in this study. However, it is possible that you might experience psychological discomfort when answering survey questions about mental well-being. If this occurs, we will provide you with local mental health resources.   ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS IF I PARTICIPATE?  There are no direct benefits to participating in research surveys. The results of the research may help us better understand how to support family financial well-being during healthcare encounters and how to maximize family receipt of tax credits.

2Study Summary:
Study phase:  Phase I
Duration of study:  1-2 years
Methodology: Blood is collected from healthy subjects, processed into packed red blood cell 
units, and either immediately afterwards or 40-42 days later the packed red blood cells are 
labeled with biotin.  The biotin-labeled red blood cells are then transfused back to the donor 
(autologous transfusion), and subsequently blood samples are taken from the subject for up to 
154 days (22 weeks) to track survival of the labeled red blood cells.  
Study Site:  Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735940]:  8
Investigator’s affiliation:  Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University 
School of Medicine
Background Information / Significance:
Name [CONTACT_61144]:  “biotinylated red blood cells (b-RBCs)” 
Active ingredients:  Biotin (that is covalently attached to human adult and red blood cells).
Pharmacological class:  Water soluble B group vitamin.
Structural formula:  We will utilize sulfo-NHS “short chain” biotin (MW=443.43) in a reaction with 
the amino groups on RBC surface proteins as shown in the following reaction diagram:  
Formulation:  Indicated as “Biotinylated Protein” in the reaction diagram above. 
Dosage:  The concentration of sulfo-NHS short chain biotin to be used in each labeling reaction 
will range from 2-18 g / mL of packed RBCs. Previous results suggest that these 
concentrations of biotin will produce RBCs with (on average) 25 – 250 pmol of biotin / mL of 
packed RBCs.  Thus, a study in which 3 aliquots of b-RBCs are infused (25 mL each; labeled 
with 2, 6 or 18 g / mL of packed RBCs) will result in the transfusion of approximately 8.8 nmol 
of biotin (3.8 g).  As a point of reference, this amount is well below the recommended daily 
intake (RDI) of biotin for adults of 100 g; a typi[INVESTIGATOR_735941] 30 g of biotin.  
Thus, this dosage should be safe. 
Route of administration:  Intravenous.
Summary of results from prior clinical studies and clinical data to date:  There is no known 
toxicity of biotin in doses vastly exceeding those we propose [1, 2]. Daily doses up to [ADDRESS_1005493] been given to newborn infants to treat biotin-
responsive inborn errors of metabolism and acquired biotin deficiency.  No toxicity at these 
doses under these conditions has been reported [3-5].  
Based on the growing number of published reports using biotinylated RBCs for measuring RBC 
volume and RBC survival in humans [6-10], the use of biotinylated RBCs is becoming 
Protocol version:  2 Version date: December 12, [ADDRESS_1005494] been used to study RBC volume and RBC survival in humans since 
1988 [1].  Since that time, there have been no definitive risks of biotinylated RBCs noted in 
studies in adults in which a total of [ADDRESS_1005495] been studied [1, 6, 9, 11-16].  In addition 
to these studies in adults, we are aware of [ADDRESS_1005496] been studied with biotinylated red cells also for measurement of red cell volume and red 
cell survival [7, 10, 17, 18].  With the exception of one previous paper [6], none of the other 
reports described any safety problems with biotinylated RBCs.  In the paper by [CONTACT_735955], 
15% of the adult subjects developed antibodies to biotinylated RBCs.  In none of these adult 
subjects were antibodies to biotin per se identified.  Moreover, the antibodies to biotinylated 
RBCs were transient and did not affect RBC survival, a finding which is supported by a study of 
biotinylated RBCs administered to adult baboons [19].  
Risks and benefits to study subjects: There will be no specific benefits to the 8 subjects to be 
studied with this protocol.
The risks are those that may be seen with blood collections and blood transfusions.  These 
include: feeling queasy, throwing up, chills or feeling cold, fainting, feeling light in the head, 
seizures, discomfort around the needle, bruising, infection, swelling around the needle site, 
blood loss, and red cell destruction.  Other risks could include skin rashes and hives. Since only 
a small amount of blood will be drawn, these risks are probably minimal.  
Transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735942] a blood infection when they are transfused with 
the biotinylated red blood cells, although we take a large number of precautions in the lab when 
we label the RBCs to minimize the chances of this problem, which would be a very rare 
occurrence.  
Many volunteers and patients in other centers have participated in a similar study, and they 
have not noted any of these adverse effects.  The main risk they did observe was the 
occasional development of an immune response to the biotin label on the RBCs; in the same 
way that transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735943], 
these recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735944], the 
crosslinker, and the crosslinked target on the RBCs [20].  There appear to be no adverse effects 
of these antibodies by [CONTACT_1029] (eg, no effects of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735945]-
dependent processes). Furthermore, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_735946] (eg, < 18 g/mL such as we propose in 
this protocol).  Nonetheless, under the very specific case where study subjects who have 
developed these antibodies are later transfused with additional biotin-labeled RBCs, the b-RBCs 
in the second transfusion are eliminated from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s circulation with accelerated 
kinetics.  Because of these occurrences, the FDA requires that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735947]-biotin antibodies following their first transfusion of biotin-labeled RBCs, and that 
the subset of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735948]-biotin antibodies be eliminated from future studies where 
biotin-labeled RBCs are transfused. 
Description of the population to be studied:  Healthy adult volunteers.  
Description and justification for the dosing regimen and treatment period:  In this study the 
non-radioactive, multi-biotin-labeling method for labeling RBCs for use in studies of RBC 
survival will be validated in normal, non-anemic adult volunteers.  The dosing regimen and 
treatment period are based on published studies from [CONTACT_735971]’ group at the Unversity of 
Iowa and their collaborators [9, 14, 20-25] previously developed.  Autologous RBCs that are 
collected, processed into packed RBC units, and then either not stored or stored under 
refrigerated conditions for 40-42 days, will be labeled with up to 3 separate densities of biotin (2, 
6 and 18 g per mL RBC), and re-infused into the donor.  Our hypothesis in this experiment is 
that we at Emory will be able to recreate the effective methodology for tracking RBC survival 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_735949].  Specifically, we will be able to measure RBC survival of up to 3 
populations of autologous RBCs in normal adult volunteers using a non-radioactive biotin 
Protocol version:  2 Version date: December 12, 2018     Page 4
4labeling methodology.  We anticipate that RBC survival of the three biotinylated RBC 
populations will agree with one another (and with published determinations using the standard 
51Cr method).  These measures of RBC survival will be conducted in 8 normal adult volunteers 
studied under normal, non-anemic, steady state conditions during the 154days (22 weeks) 
following transfusion.  Following completion of these studies, and after validating the 
methodology, we will be in a position to pursue novel studies in which quantification of 
transfused RBC storage will be an important endpoint.  
Compliance:  The clinical study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, SOPs, and 
the federal, state and local regulations including requirements within the approved FDA IND.  
Objectives / Rationale / Research Question:  Our research group and collaborators at Emory 
study diverse aspects of blood banking and transfusion medicine in order to improve the clinical 
efficacy and safety of RBC transfusion practice. Within this area of investigation, we have a 
number of ongoing and anticipated studies that would benefit from the use of biotinylated RBCs 
to track survival of banked RBCs after infusion:  (1) We are NIH-funded to identify biomarkers 
that can predict survival of transfused RBCs.  Thus, we would like to compare predictions of 
RBC survival after transfusion, which we make using these potential biomarkers, with actual 
RBC survival after transfusion determined by [CONTACT_735956], infusing them into 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and then collecting post-transfusion samples for flow cytometric quantitation of in 
vivo RBC survival (this IND application specifically covers these studies).  (2) For anemic 
patients with antibodies against RBCs, in particular either auto-antibodies or broadly reactive 
allo-antibodies of indeterminate specificity, we would like to develop methods for an “in vivo 
crossmatch” where small aliquots of donor RBCs that appear to be least-incompatible in vitro 
(using a standard Coombs crossmatch) are each labeled at different biotin densitites and are 
then infused simultaneously to determine, in vivo, which donor RBCs survive the longest; the 
remaining unit from that donor will then be transfused (to be the subject of a future IND 
application).  (3) Addtionally, we would like the ability to study endogenous RBC survival in 
healthy volunteers and patients (for example, those with sickle cell disease) by [CONTACT_740] a small 
amount of blood, labeling the RBCs with biotin, and then re-infusing that blood back into the 
donor to track their endogenous RBC survival (to be the subject of a future IND application).  
In order to pursue these and other important clinical transfusion studies we need to first validate 
the biotin-labeling procedure in human subjects at Emory. This is the goal of the present 
protocol.
The Research Hypothesis is: We will be able to use biotin-labeling to track RBC survival in 
volunteers, and the methodology will be validated for later studies by [CONTACT_735957] (below).   
The Primary Objective is:  To confirm that we can label RBCs with biotin, at up to [ADDRESS_1005497] been transfused back to the donor, allowed to 
circulate, and then re-identified in phlebotomy samples.   
The Secondary Objective is:  To demonstrate that b-RBCs can be safely transfused back to 
autologous subjects without any adverse reactions (other than possibly the development of 
antibodies against biotin-labeled RBCs).  
Clinical Study Design:
Primary endpoints: Determination of the length of time biotin-labeled RBCs can be detected 
Protocol version:  2 Version date: December 12, 2018     Page 5
5following infusion; determine the length of time that differentially labeled RBCs can be 
distinguished from one another after transfusion.  
Secondary endpoints:  Measure the occurrence of adverse effects, including development of 
anti-biotin-RBC antibodies.
Information needed to answer the research question:  Samples of peripheral blood collected at 
designated times after transfusion of biotinylated RBCs.  
Study design:  Single-arm study.
Intervention:  The intervention is transfusion and subsequent tracking of autologous biotinylated 
RBCs (b-RBCs; the investigational product).  Specifically, the steps include:  collection of blood 
from the subject (up to 500 mL), processing of blood into a packed RBC unit (of the type used 
for transfusion), storing the unit at 2-6C for 40-42 days (or, in some cases, not storing the unit at 
all), withdrawing blood from the unit under sterile conditions, sterilely labeling aliquots of this 
blood with up to 3 pre-defined concentrations of biotin labeling reagent (2, 6, 18 g / mL of 
RBCs), re-infusing the b-RBCs back to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and then taking serial blood samples from 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], weekly for up to 154 days) to track the survival of the infused b-RBCs.  
Although under ideal circumstances the subject would agree to participate for the maximal study 
duration of 112 days (from day of blood collection through maximum blood storage period [42 
days] and then, after receiving transfusion of b-RBCs on day 42, for another 154 days of weekly 
blood collections) the subject may elect to discontinue their participation at any time.
There is no randomization for this study.  The first [ADDRESS_1005498] their blood stored after 
collection; they will receive transfusion of b-RBCs on the same day blood was collected in order 
to more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_735950]-labeling and post-transfusion detection 
procedures.  The next [ADDRESS_1005499] blood bank conditions prior to biotinylation 
and transfusion. All confidential information will be stored in locked cabinets.
As described above, the risks are those that may be seen with other studies in which blood 
collections and blood transfusions are performed.  These include: feeling queasy, throwing up, 
chills or feeling cold, fainting, feeling light in the head, seizures, discomfort around the needle, 
bruising, infection, swelling around the needle site, blood loss, and red cell destruction.  Other 
risks could include skin rashes and hives. Since only a small amount of blood will be drawn, 
these risks are probably minimal.  Transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735942] a blood 
infection when they are transfused with the biotinylated red blood cells, although we take a large 
number of precautions in the lab when we label the RBCs to minimize the chances of this 
problem, which would be a very rare occurrence.  
An additional possible risk specific to transfusion of b-RBCs is the occasional development of an 
immune response to the biotin label on the RBCs.  Since the initial studies performed using b-
RBCs in the early-1990’s, the biotinylation protocol has been optimized; recent evidence 
suggests that the risks of making these antibodies can be reduced through the use of lower 
concentrations of biotin during the labeling reaction (eg, < 18 g/mL, as we propose to use in 
these studies). Should a study participant develop these antibodies, there appear to be no 
adverse effects of the antibodies by [CONTACT_1029] (eg, no effects of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735951]-dependent processes). Nonetheless, the FDA requires that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735952]-biotin antibodies following their first transfusion of biotin-labeled 
RBCs, and that the subset of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735948]-biotin antibodies be eliminated from 
future studies where biotin-labeled RBCs are transfused. 
The study subjects will experience no specific benefits during the course of this study.  
However, we may learn things about blood transfusion by [CONTACT_735958].

6Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria of the Subjects:
Inclusion Criteria: Adult subjects of 18-65 years of age will be considered for enrollment;  
subjects will be enrolled without preference to gender, race or ethnic background. The subjects 
must be in good health.   
Exclusion Criteria:  Anemia (Hb < 8 g/dL), chronic diseases (diabetes, heart or lung disease, 
hypertension [if poorly managed], peripheral vascular disease), ongoing consumption of biotin 
or raw egg supplements, a history of bleeding disorder or evidence of anemia on initial 
screening will be excluded.  Any subjects who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant will be 
excluded.  
Informed Consent Process:  We plan to recruit subjects from our existing registry of 
transfusion research donors. Most of these donors have previously consented to participate in 
multiple transfusion research studies, which include studies in which they donate blood and also 
studies in which they are transfused with blood.  Either [CONTACT_735972] or [CONTACT_735973] will 
present the study to potential subjects, describing the procedures (blood draw, transfusion of 
their autologous blood after it has been labeled with biotin, and subsequent small volume blood 
draws to track circulation of b-RBCs).  Compensation will also be described (up to $40 for the 
initial donation, $10 for transfusion of b-RBCs, and then $[ADDRESS_1005500]-transfusion).  The subjects will be instructed that 
they can withdraw from the study at any time. The subjects will then have an opportunity to ask 
any questions, after which they will have the opportunity to review and sign the consent.  
Procedures:
Interventions: Collection of up to 500 mL blood; preparation of the b-RBC investigational product 
(labeled using concentrations of either 2, 6 or 18 g/mL biotin reagent); IV infusion of up to 75 
mL packed RBCs (25 mL of pRBC at each of the 3 labeling densities), and sequential blood 
draws (< 5 mL each) to track b-RBC survival over the course of up to 154 days.   
Medications:  the only restriction is the use of biotin or raw egg-containing supplements which 
by [CONTACT_735959] b-RBCs.  All other medications 
may be taken during the study.  
Compliance:  as the investigational product will be administered is by [CONTACT_15328], there are not 
expected to be any compliance issues.  
Adverse Events:
Definition of adverse events and anticipated types of adverse events: For the purposes of this 
study, we define adverse events as those events that the subject encounters (during the blood 
collection, during the transfusion, or following the transfusion) which cause pain, discomfort, 
other morbidities, or mortality.  Anticipated adverse events during blood collection include: 
feeling queasy, throwing up, fainting, feeling light in the head, seizures, discomfort around the 
needle, and bruising.  Adverse events that might occur during transfusion include skin rash, 
hives, fever, chills or feeling cold, infection, swelling around the needle site, and red cell 
destruction. Possible adverse events that may occur following transfusion include the detection 
of a new antibody against biotin-labeled RBCs. 
Protocol version:  2 Version date: December 12, 2018     Page 7
7Plan for collection of adverse events:  Subjects will be monitored closely during the blood 
collection and transfusion procedures by [CONTACT_735960].  If such 
events occur, they will be entered into the case report forms (CRFs).  The detection of 
antibodies against biotinylated RBCs will be based on testing performed on each sample 
collected following transfusion;  these results will likewise be entered into the CRFs.  
Follow-up treatment: Follow-up is dependent on the adverse event, and can range from 
elevating the legs and applying a cold compress to the back of the neck (fainting and light 
headedness) to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (infection or red cell destruction).   
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:
Meeting reporting requirements: All adverse events will be collected on each volunteer. We 
will report  adverse events to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_1744] P&P and as part of regular progress 
reports. In addition, we will submit IND safety reports as required by [CONTACT_735961].
Plan for reviewing data for safety:  Given that other investigators have performed similar 
studies using b-RBC infusion with no safety  problems, we believe this single-site clinical trial 
presents only minimal risks. As such, we propose  that the PI ([CONTACT_735972]) will monitor data 
and safety, ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis.  Monitoring will occur in real-time 
(or within 1-2 hours of the occurrence of any adverse events).  Thus, initially we will not use 
an independent Safety Officer (SO) or Data and Safety Monitoring  Board (DSMB). Should 
unexpected risks or problems occur, we will either appoint an SO or DSMB  to review study 
records. In addition, we will arrange for an impartial observer with knowledge of clinical trials to 
assess the study for data quality and protocol compliance both mid-way through the study 
(after [ADDRESS_1005501] completed the study) as well as at the conclusion of the study.  This 
observor will also monitor the study to ensure protocol compliance as well as accuracy and 
completeness of documentation.
Data Collection, Monitoring and Access:
Overview: All data will be collected, stored and analyzed in consultation with Kirk Easley from 
Biostatistics. [CONTACT_735974] is a co-investigator on one of the grants supporting this study (National

interface to the server using X-ming. Professional system administrators maintain and operate 
the servers and are responsible for ensuring performance, uptime and system maintenance, 
including security and application-layer patching. In addition, their services comply with Emory 
University Information security practices and controls.
The core of our computer services is provided by [CONTACT_735963]. Storage 
is provided through our SAN (storage area network) over a fiber channel network, with 54 
teraby[CONTACT_473643]-protected HIPAA-compliant storage local on the cluster. The server hosts

Information security: The Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) information technology 
environment is a HIPAA covered entity and complies with HIPAA and Emory information 
security and privacy policies and practices. In compliance with these policies and practices, 
RSPH aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special 
publications (800 series) for identifying, assessing, and managing information security risk 
within a technology environment. Drawing on federal and industry best practices, RSPH has 
implemented a series of multi-layered security controls to protect the integrity, reliability, and 
confidentiality of data. A sample of the key security controls includes:
An annual risk assessment of all RSPH information technology assets with their level of
risk, potential impact, probability, and controls evaluated based on NIST SP 800-30 Risk
Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.
RSPH and Emory network are protected by [CONTACT_473645].
Rules on these devices are set to deny all traffic by [CONTACT_473646] "allows" are written as
exceptions. These devices are updated as appropriate through Emory University's
change management process and evaluated to ensure they provide the appropriate level
of protection based on the sensitivity level of the data.
Servers are housed within a secured network operating center (NOC). The NOC has
environmental controls (fire, water, temperature), is accessible only through a two-factor
authorization system (key card and passcode), and is accessible only by [CONTACT_735964]. In the event of a power outage, the NOC devices will
draw UPS power then from a backup generator.
All servers are configured based on RSPH and Emory University best practices. Only
authorized, trained system administrators have administrative privileges on the servers.
System administrators monitor security mailing lists and sites and patch/update systems
based on priority of the patch. All servers are periodically scanned for vulnerabilities and
any identified vulnerabilities are assessed and managed.
All information technology personnel go through background checks before gaining
access to administrative privileges. At point of termination with Emory, all information
technology personnel's administrative privileges are removed.
Protected health information (PHI) data and the services that manage them are stored
on separate network and server infrastructure with limited access and additional security
controls.
Data are backed up daily. Backups are stored in a tiered structure for disaster recovery
purposes and include local, off-site, and out-of-state storage. Data stored off-site are
encrypted to prevent compromise and can only be retrieved by [CONTACT_4144].
Data written to any RSPH file servers are checked with server-based anti-virus software.
Access to data is verified with a local single point of contact [CONTACT_735965]. Principle Investigators are required to review
access control lists each year to ensure continued accuracy.
All RSPH desktops are configured based on best practices in industry as well as those
outlined in NIST SP 800-69 Guidance for Securing Microsoft Windows XP Systems for

tapes are encrypted and moved out of state for disaster recovery protection.
Statistical Methods:
Statistical methods:   Circulating RBC volume and and RBC survival will be determined by [CONTACT_735966] [26-28] with the following modifications.  The binding of 
fluorescent-tagged streptavidin to the biotinylated RBCs is terminated at 10 min by [CONTACT_68016] 
1 mL of 10 nM biotin in washing buffer to prevent cross-linkage of the heavily biotinylated RBCs 
with biotin binding sites on tetrameric streptavidin.  Each population of biotinylated RBCs will be 
discretely enumerated using a histogram relating number of RBCs to the log of fluorescent 
intensity.  For this analysis, up to six windows will be set separately by [CONTACT_735967].  For each 
population of biotinylated RBCs, “% biotinylated” will be calculated by [CONTACT_735968] (biotinylated plus unlabeled).  A standard curve will 
be constructed by [CONTACT_735969]. 
Initially, a simple paired t-test will be used to identify significant differences in cirulating b-RBC 
concentrations between different time point.  Additionally, we are discussing more detaield 
analyses with [CONTACT_735974].  
Number of subjects:  8 adults
Sample size rationale:  Sample size was determined based on conversations with [CONTACT_735975]’ group at University of Iowa, who pi[INVESTIGATOR_735953].  Rather than using a 
power analysis, since this is just a single-site single-arm study directed at validating the 
biotinylation methodology in our laboratory, the proposed recruitment of [ADDRESS_1005509]. Widness’ estimate of how many repetitions of the procedure we should perform prior to 
moving onto the second phase of the study (not included herein), which is turn was based on 
his experience in working with the FDA to receive IND approvals for clinical trials with b-RBCs.

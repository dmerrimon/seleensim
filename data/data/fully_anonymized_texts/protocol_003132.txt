4) Objectives*
This is a prospective, randomized, physician and subject blinded controlled clinical trial. This will be 
conducted to determine whether sub-dissociative dose Ketamine can improve pain control in subjects 
with chronic pain syndrome presenting to the emergency department with exacerbation of their chronic 
pain. We also aim to determine whether use of SDDK can reduce the amount of subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_551989]. We hypothesize that there will 
be a statistically significant decrease in pain using SDDK versus placebo and subjects will require 
overall less opi[INVESTIGATOR_551990].
5) Background*
Pain management is a significant issue for many subjects presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) 
as increasing numbers of subjects present with this complaint. In the ED, treatment of acute pain is a 
primary concern both for the provider and the subject; recent data suggest that visits for pain-related 
complaints are rising (1). Subjects with chronic pain account for 12-16% of total ED visits (2,3) with 7% 
of subjects with chronic pain presenting multiple times (4). Both the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) have identified pain as a significant public health 
problem in the [LOCATION_002] (5). Currently, the vast majority of painful conditions within the ED are 
treated with either opi[INVESTIGATOR_161128]-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) analgesic medications. 
Treatment of chronic pain syndromes in the ED can be particularly challenging, since many subjects
with these conditions are tolerant to the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_551991].
Ketamine [2-(o-chlorphenyl)-2-methylamino  cyclohexanone] is a phencyclidine derivative with unique 
analgesic, amnestic, and dissociative properties that acts primarily as a competitive antagonist at the 
NMDA receptor within the limbic system to modulate autonomic responses to stimuli. Advantages of 
ketamine include its stable hemodynamic profile and lack of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (unlike opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539]). Ketamine is frequently used for moderate sedation in the ED; recently, it has been 
suggested that sub-dissociative dose ketamine (SDDK) may be used in the ED for successful primary 
treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic pain syndromes, or as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_551992]. 
Such treatment has primarily been studied in pain clinic settings and thus far has not been evaluated in

Controlled Trial
Rev. 4/24/[ADDRESS_725501] care in the ED as a moderate sedation 
agent in both pediatric and adult populations (6-8), it has not been widely utilized for its specific 
analgesic qualities. While there is extensive evidence on SDDK's safety and efficacy within the 
anesthesia and palliative care literature, there is very little written about the use of SDDK within the ED 
setting. Most studies published thus far describe ketamine's use either for procedural sedation or in a 
palliative care setting, primarily among subjects with cancer-related pain, phantom limb pain, or other 
pain types (9-12).  Indeed, very few studies specifically address SDDK's analgesic uses in the ED.
There is promising evidence of SDDK's safe and effective use for the treatment of traumatic pain in the 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (13), and a randomized, double-blind trial demonstrated that SDDK was safe and 
reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_551993] (14-15).  One retrospective case series noted SDDK's 
safe use in subjects presenting to the ED for medical pain (16).  A randomized controlled trial compared 
SDDK to fentanyl as an adjunct to procedural sedation and found its side effect profile and analgesic 
properties to be superior to standard treatment (17-18).  The use of SDDK has also been suggested as 
effective within wilderness and operational settings, with obvious applications to military populations 
(19).
6) Setting of the Human Research
This is a prospective, randomized, physician and subject blinded controlled clinical trial, conducted at
Harbor UCLA Medical Center Emergency Department
7) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research
This is a local research study to be conducted in the Emergency Department at Harbor UCLA Medical 
Center which treats 75,000 patients per year and is located in a brand new facility consisting of 80 beds. 
This study will include only adult patients and all patients for our study will be identified through triage 
when they are initially assessed. If they meet inclusion criteria they will be approached for possible 
enrollment in the study.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigators will devote approximately 3 - 4 hours per week conducting the trial during 
the time period from July 1, 2015 – June 30, [ADDRESS_725502] research at this institution. He also is well-versed in the 
Federal regulations as he is a member of one of the institution’s IRBs.
The coinvestigators, Drs. Horeczko, Huang and Paulsen have assisted in conducting research studies in 
the past and will look to [CONTACT_552003] and the LA BioMed Compliance Monitor for assistance and 
guidance in carrying out this study. They have also completed the training requirements to conduct 
research at the institution. [CONTACT_552004] has assisted the investigators in the development of the study and

Committee. Subsequently, [CONTACT_552003] submitted a request for funding (grant) to the U.S. Air Force to 
support this research; he was awarded the grant in Aug. 2016.
9) Study Design
a) Recruitment Methods
Screening for eligibility will occur as follows:
Subjects who present to the Harbor UCLA Medical Center Emergency Department(ED) will be 
screened by [CONTACT_551997]. Once a subject is 
identified we will meet with their treatment physician and review their medical record to see if they 
meet the inclusion criteria. A pregnancy test will be administered, after consent obtained, before the 
female subject is randomized.
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*
Inclusion Criteria:
- All adult subjects over the age of 18 with chronic pain* presenting to the emergency department 
with exacerbation of their chronic pain as their primary complaint
- Subjects who are willing and able to provide informed consent.
* Chronic pain defined as greater > 3 months of symptoms and an initial VAS pain score > 70
Exclusion criteria:
History of overt psychosis, severe HTN as defined by [CONTACT_11557] > 180 or DBP > 110, unstable angina, 
CAD, CHF, porphyrias, thyroid disease, seizure disorder, inability to provide informed consent: 
dementia, non-English/Spanish speakers, subjects in custody, suicidal, or clinically intoxicated.
c) Local Number of Subjects
We look to enroll a total of 106 subjects meeting the study criteria.
Protocol Modification 4/24/2018: 
We are requesting the enrollment of an additional [ADDRESS_725503] Tim Horeczko, the 
original group size analysis of 96 (32 in each of three groups) did not account for potential loss 
of data or subjects withdrawing from the study and we should have asked initially for 106 
subjects with the expectation of a 10% loss of data due to incomplete records or withdrawal of 
subjects in the study.

This is a single center study done at the Harbor UCLA Emergency Department
e) Study Timelines*
Duration of an individual subject’s participation in this study is [ADDRESS_725504] 24-48 hours after discharge from Emergency Department.
The estimated date for the start of enrollment of subjects will be September 2015, and it will be 
continued till the enrolled subjects’ number reach the goal of 106.
f)  Study Endpoints*
Primary endpoint: To compare pain relief between the [ADDRESS_725505] 20mm on the VAS will be considered “significant” pain relief (20)
Secondary endpoint:
(a) To compare total dosage of IV hydromorphone needed as rescue therapy to achieved 
adequate pain relief
(b) To assess the risk for complications of sub-dissociative dose ketamine
g) Procedures Involved in the Human Research*
1.   The informed consent process will be initiated by [CONTACT_551998].
2.   All potential subjects will be informed that participation in the study could lead to a positive 
urine drug test that could remain positive for up to a month after the conclusion of the study.
3. Female subjects of child bearing age, will have a pregnancy test performed prior to enrollment;
any subjects who are pregnant will be excluded from this project.
4. Each subject will be asked to grade his/her pain severity on a 100mm non-hatched visual analog 
scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst, maximum pain).
5. Each subject will be asked to fill out a baseline pain questionnaire
6. Each subject will be placed on monitors for continuous pulse oximetry, Heart Rate, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_18083], and blood pressure every [ADDRESS_725506] will be sequentially assigned to one of three treatment groups, based on a computer- 
generated randomization schedule, to receive an intravenous infusion of sub-dissociative Ketamine 
(0.25mg/kg), sub-dissociative dose Ketamine (0.5mg/kg), or an equal amount of normal saline.
9. All medications will be prepared by [CONTACT_551999]: [ZIP_CODE]-01
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 05/16/2018PROTOCOL TITLE: Subdissociative Dose Ketamine for Treatment of Acute Pain in Patients with Chronic Pain: A Randomized
Controlled Trial
Rev. 04/24/[ADDRESS_725507] will again be asked to grade his/her pain on a VAS. Additionally, they 
will be asked if they experienced any other adverse effects over the treatment period, specifically: 
rash, hallucinations, anxiety, disorientation, burning at the injection site.
13. Subjects will be asked if they require additional pain relief. Those who request further pain relief 
will be administered hydromorphone IV, the dosage and frequency will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Total hydromorphone administration will be documented on the
data collection sheet.
14. All subjects will receive a follow-up phone call from one of the investigators between 24 – [ADDRESS_725508] effects 
and if so, will be asked to detail them.
15. Any study patient returning to the Emergency Department for any reason will be fully evaluated 
and the study team will be notified. If there is evidence of any psychotic reaction (persistent or 
delayed presentation after the administration of the medication, the patients will be treated with 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (shown to be effective in the emergence reaction sometimes seen after dissociative 
doses of ketamine are used) and a psychiatric consult will be obtained. The medical monitor will also 
be notified because this would be an adverse event.
h) Data and Specimen Banking*
No data collected for banking purposes.
i)  Data Management *
Descriptive statistics will be used. Tests for significance will be conducted using the t test for 
continuous variables and chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.
We estimated the sample size needed for the primary end point of significant pain relief as defined 
by a decrease in the VAS of 20mm. A power analysis based indicated that a sample size of [ADDRESS_725509] a statistically significant difference with a power of 90% ( =
0.05).
Data from the patient examinations will be stored in an excel spreadsheet or compatible 
REDCAP database after being de-identified of all unique information to the subject. The 
study source documents (including consent forms, etc.) will be stored in a locked filing 
cabinet in a locked office only accessible by [CONTACT_2792]. It will be stored until this

There is a slight risk of a breach of confidentiality.
Subjects will be asked to rate their pain throughout the study which may cause them some anxiety.
11) Potential Benefits to Subjects*
Possible pain relief. If randomized to placebo (saline solution) subjects pain is monitored and pain relief 
provided if pain is not subsiding.
12) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Data confidentiality is maintained as above. Only research investigators will have an access to this data.
The enrollment will be performed at emergency department.
We will not discuss private medical information in a setting with other than a health care provider or in 
other than a private clinical setting.
For the follow up phone call, we will ascertain from the subject, that they are willing and able to any 
questions and that they feel they have adequate privacy to do so.
We will limit the information being collected to only the minimum amount of data necessary to 
accomplish the research purposes.
13) Compensation for Research-Related Injury
There is no commitment to provide any compensation for research-related injury. In the event that 
subjects are injured as a result of participating in this research, emergency care will be available. But 
subjects will, however, be responsible for the charges for the emergency care.
14) Economic Burden to Subjects
The cost for the care provided during the emergency department visit is the responsibility of the 
subject. The subject will not be charged for the study medication (ketamine or saline).
15) Consent Process
Consent process will take place in the Emergency Department. Patients will be presented with
the risks and benefits of participating in the study when being introduced to the study. During the 
consent process, patients will be asked to explain to the investigator or research associates the 
following aspects of the study, based on the UC San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to 
Consent (UBACC): What is the purpose of the study? What makes you want to participate in the 
study? Do you have to be in the study if you do not want to participate? If you withdraw from the 
study, will you be able to receive regular treatment? Please describe some of the risks and 
discomforts for being part of this study? If patients are unable to answer the questions with an 
appropriate, or correct response, they will be informed of the correct response, and will not be able 
to proceed unless they are able to express, in their own words, the correct, or appropriate, 
response.

BACKGROUND, RATIONALE, AND CONTEXT  
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) passed in [ADDRESS_734975] importantly, in July 
2017, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb announced he was “directing our Center for Tobacco Products 
to develop a comprehensive nicotine regulatory plan premised on the need to confront and al ter 
cigarette addiction. ” This announcement was followed on March 16, 2018 by [CONTACT_559559] “ Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Level 
of Combusted Cigarettes ” (ID: FDA-2017 -N-6189- 0001) “to obtain information for consideration 
in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a tobacco product standard to set the maximum  nicotine level for  cigarettes .”  
 
Effects of Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes  
Studies of very low nicotine content  (VLNC)  cigarettes (e.g., <2.4 mg/g) sugg est that, acutely, 
they produce many effects in smokers that are qualitatively similar to normal nicotine content 
(NNC; e.g., 15.8 mg/g) cigarettes, but with somewhat reduced efficacy.  VLNC cigarettes reinforce 
behavior10,11 and maintain similar rates of self-administration as NNC cigarettes in brief sessions 
even though participants prefer NNC cigarettes when given a choice11 Compared to not smoking, 
VLNC cigarettes increase ratings of satisfaction and liking12,13,14, although the magnitude of these 
effec ts is typi[INVESTIGATOR_172453]15,16,17. VLNC 
cigarettes also reduce withdrawal and craving18 although some symptoms (e.g., restlessness, 
impatience) may be more effectively alleviated by [CONTACT_172555]19.   
 
Studies in  which VLNC cigarettes were utilized over a longer period suggest potential benefits in 
terms of reduced smoking. When only VLNC cigarettes were available in an inpatient setting, the 
number of cigarettes smoked and the motivation to smoke during periods o f abstinence 
decreased over time12. Longer, outpatient studies have either found no change in smoking 
rates20,21,22,13, or a significant decline in smoking rates. 23,[ADDRESS_734976] reported 
significant decreases in expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514] (CO). 13,[ADDRESS_734977] studies to date provide smokers with only two options: smoke study cigarettes  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_559540])  or abstain from using tobacco, with clear instructions to not use non -
study products. In this context, most smokers not only continue to smoke, but, despi[INVESTIGATOR_559541], continue to use non -study cigarettes. Based on self -report, more than 75% of 
participants assigned to VLNC cigarettes use at least one non -study (normal nicotine) cigarette 
during trials that last [ADDRESS_734978] of the days.23,32 Consequently, nicotine exposure (as measured by [CONTACT_172556]) only decreases by [CONTACT_2902] 60% compared to the 97% reduction of nicotine content in 
the product. [ADDRESS_734979] standards were enacted for combusted tobacco. Some may seek out black market cigarettes or tamper with cigarettes to increase nicotine deli very, but many others may turn to 
easily accessible alternative products.   
 
Reducing the nicotine content of combusted products: the role of e -cigarettes  
 
E-cigarettes have rapi[INVESTIGATOR_243721] a commonly used non -combusted product in the U.S.
34, 35 
with a p roposed rule by [CONTACT_559560] a "tobacco product” and regulated as such.[ADDRESS_734980] VLNC use and, conversely, how 
nicotine reduction in cigarettes impacts the us e of e -cigarettes with different characteristics. Both 
nicotine and non -nicotine factors may be important.  
 
Nicotine. Nicotine delivered via e- cigarettes may serve a variety of functions that support its 
actions as a reinforcer and an appealing alternative to smoking VLNC cigarettes. Some e-
cigarettes can deliver as much or more (among experienced users) nicotine as a traditional 
cigarette with a relatively rapid rate of absorption (T max < 5 min).[ADDRESS_734981] greater positive reinforcing effects than VLNC cigarettes.39 
E-cigarettes can also be used throughout the day to maintain nicotine levels that would otherwise 
fall by 95% or more once participants start using VLNC cigarettes.40 Indeed, e- cigarettes reduce 
withdrawal symptoms in cigarette smokers,41-45 and this suppression is dependent on the nicotine 
concentration of the e- liquid.45 Relatedly, greater nicotine delivery may also result in increased 
risk of dependence on e - cigare ttes.46 Finally, nicotine also acts peripherally on receptors in the 
oropharyngeal cavity which may contribute to sensory effects (discussed below) that might 
generalize across products. Together, these data suggest that e- cigarettes that more effectively 
deliver nicotine may be more likely to function as both positive and negative reinforcers and more 
able to compete with the reduced reinforcing effects of VLNC cigarettes.  
 
Non-nicotine factors. E-cigarettes have a somewhat unique feature relative to other  alternative 
products - they provide sensorimotor stimuli similar to combusted cigarettes, including a smoke-
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_734982] often 
in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Overview D.2) and why they attenuate abstinence in cigarette users even if they do not deliver nicotine.
[ADDRESS_734983] of flavors on e -cigarette use is still unknown, but it seems likely that 
the availability of non -tobacco flavors influences the likelihood of use. Recent estimates are that 
53% of adults use e -cigarettes with flavors other than tobacco.
[ADDRESS_734984] choice and decision- making. In behavioral economics, 
“price” is typi[INVESTIGATOR_559542]. The Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT) is an 
example of a behavioral economic assessment for smoking. In the task, participants are asked to indicate how many cigarettes they would purchase as the price of these products increases. From 
these data, a number of measures can be calculated including demand intensity (consumption at the lowest price) and demand elasticity (sensitivity to increases in price). A variation of the CPT 
is a cross- price task, which can be used to ex amine how changing the price of one commodity 
affects consumption of another commodity.  
 
The Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) task is an extension of the cross -price task and 
allows researchers to examine the effects of cigarette price increases on alternative product 
purchasing within a complex tobacco marketplace. In this paradigm, participants use account 
balances to buy tobacco products from an online store. Across multiple task iterations, the price 
of cigarettes increases while the prices of the other tobacco products remain constant.
 Assessing 
cigarette substitution across multiple tobacco products is more informative to tobacco regulatory 
science than simple cross -price tasks because it more closely simulates real world decision-
making from re tailers selling multiple tobacco products. Recently, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_559543] a nicotine reduction policy  on tobacco product 
purchasing.  
 
Discrete Choice . Interdisciplinary research describes choice as a function of  the relative 
expected value of the options at hand.61, 62 Further, an option’s anticipated value is derived from 
the integrated values of its individual attributes.63, 64 Widely used in consumer research, discrete 
choice experiments (DCEs) reveal the extent to which individual product attributes determine 
choice.65 In DCEs, across several trials, participants chose their preferred option from a selection 
of products, each described as a set of attributes. The products/combinations of attributes 
presented i n each trial are experimentally varied such that the relative importance of each attribute 
can be discerned using logistic regression. In tobacco regulatory science DCEs have been used 
   
 
Page 4 of 23 
 frequently to evaluate general preferences for cigarette and vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559544].66-69 
Here, we will use the DCE method to investigate the contribution of nicotine content and flavor 
availability to choices between cigarettes and vapi[INVESTIGATOR_84412].  
 
 
OBJECTIVES  
 
We are proposing a four condition ETM study to determine if banning NNC is sufficient for 
encouraging smokers to switch to potentially less harmful products  or if the availability of higher 
nicotine and/or  flavored alternative products (specifically e -cigarettes) are needed to achieve 
maximal reductions in smoki ng.   
  
METHODS AND MEASURES  
 Overall Study Design  
 
We propose to conduct a within- subjects, multi -session virtual lab study and validation field 
assessment to determine how the availability of flavored  e-liquids affects product purchasing 
among cigarette smokers. Adult daily cigarette smokers (N= 64) will be recruited for this study. 
After initial eligibility is assessed, participants will complete six virtual sessions (1 baseline, 4 
experimental, and 1 follow -up) and  three in person sessions with one field assessment to evaluate 
their tobacco use.  
 Design and Setting  
 Participants will be recruited from Winston -Salem, NC and the surrounding area using 
advertisements on public transit, community flyers, and social media.. In-person lab visits to drop 
off biosamples and pi[INVESTIGATOR_559545].  
 Subject Selection Criteria  
 
We anticipate recruiting up to 100 participants to achieve 64 completers.          
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. 21+ years of age  
2. Self-report smoking at least [ADDRESS_734985] year  
3. Breathe carbon monoxide (CO) level > [ADDRESS_734986] once in their lifetime  
 
Exclusion criteria :  
1. Currently seeking treatment to quit smoking 
2. Self-reported serious medical or  psychiatric condition(s) including cardiovascular and 
chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748]  
3. Body temperature > 100.[ADDRESS_734987] 30 
days  
5. Currently pregnant, breastfeeding or intending to becom e pregnant for the duration of the 
study or unwilling to agree to use adequate protection to avoid pregnancy  
6. CO reading > [ADDRESS_734988] a participant’s ability to complete the study  and how they make decisions about what 
tobacco products to use. We will exclude those indicating immediate readiness to stop smoking, 
as participation in this study may not lead to reductions in smoking.  We will exclude pregnant 
people, those trying to become pregnant and those currently breastfeeding due to the potential 
harmful effects of tobacco use on developi[INVESTIGATOR_559546]. Because participants are 
required to complete portions of the protocol independently during the virtual lab sessions, they 
will need to be able to independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
 Those who report past [ADDRESS_734989] been symptom -free for more 
than 30 days.   
 
Telephone Screening Survey  
 
Interested individuals will complete a telephone screening interview. The screener will assess: 
current cigarette smoking; cigarette flavor prefer ence; past 30 day use of tobacco products; 
pregnancy/breastfeeding; current health status, and intention to quit smoking.  The interviewer will 
record the potential participant’s responses in REDCap, web- based data collection platforms 
hosted by [CONTACT_559561]. The phone screening data will be used to establish 
preliminary eligibility. It will not be used for research purposes. Identifying information will be stored separately in a password- protected Excel spreadsheet on the Tobacco Control C enter of 
Excellence server.  
 
Potential participants will be instructed to show a valid, state issued photo ID during the virtual 
screening visit.  Acceptable forms of identification include a Driver’s License, State Photo ID Card, 
State Voter ID Card, Pass port, or Military ID. If the potential participant does not have a valid, 
state issued photo ID, the interviewer can provide them  with information on obtaining one. 
Participants will be given the option of receiving study information or visit reminders by [CONTACT_648], 
email, and/or text message.  
 
A participant must complete their Virtual Visit [ADDRESS_734990] ID number in the participant screening database.  
 
Visits   
 
Virtual Visit 1  
 
Research staff will schedule video calls (e.g., WebEx or Zoom) with the participants. At thei r 
scheduled call time, research staff and participants will complete the consenting procedures (more information available below) and electronically sign the consent form via DocuSign. 
Participants will complete one verbal assessment with research staff vi a REDCap to collect  their 
identifying information.  Participants will then be sent a link to  complete the eligibility surveys. 
   
 
Page 6 of 23 
 Research staff and participants will remain on video while the participant completes the REDCap  
survey. This will enable participants the ability to ask questions and share computer screens, if 
needed.  
 
The following form s will be administered verbally by [CONTACT_559562]:  
1. Identifying Information Form  will include the participant’s Subject Identifier, name, address 
(including the county of residence), email address, phone number, age, and date of birth.  
2. Tobacco Use History and Exposure Questionnaire, which measures variables such as 
smoking amount, cig arette brand, age of initiation of smoking, number of quit attempts, 
duration of quit attempts and duration of smoking.  
3. Concomitant Medications Form will assess current medication usage.  
  The following screening surveys will be self -administered via REDC ap: 
1. Brief Medical History Questionnaire to query current diagnoses, symptoms and past health 
problems.  
2. Demographic History Questionnaire, which will assess age, gender, ethnicity, race, 
education, income, marital status, living situation, and employment history.  
3. Contemplation Ladder34 to assess intention to quit smoking.  
 
Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence35 (FTCD) to assess nicotine dependence levels. In 
the event that the REDCap websites are not functioning, the virtual visits will be rescheduled to a 
later date and time.  
 
Eligibility Determination  
 
Research staff will determine eligibility after reviewing all criteria, sans the expi[INVESTIGATOR_559547]. Researchers will pay ineligible participants $20 for their 
time spent completing the screening surveys. Eligible participants will complete additional surveys 
and will receive an extra $10 for their time.  
 
The following baseline assessments for eligible participants will be administered as an interview 
and entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_20679]:  
1. Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) Questionnaire,[ADDRESS_734991] use. If a participant’s reported cigarette use on the TLFB conflict with their reporting on the Tobacco Use History and  Exposure Questionnaire, the RA will point out 
the discrepancy to the participant and ask whether they would like to modify their responses on the Tobacco Use History and Exposure Questionnaire or clarify why they 
are discrepant (e.g., participants had an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_559548]).  
 
The following surveys will be self -administered using REDCap:  
1. Tobacco Policy Questionnaire (adapted from International Tobacco Control (ITC) –  Four 
Country survey) w hich assess support for various tobacco control policies, including 
banning menthol flavoring in cigarettes and e -cigarettes.  
2. Perceived Health Risks Scale,  a measure of the perceived addictive potential and other 
health risks associated with cigarettes, e -cigarettes and nicotine gum  
3. Tobacco Product Interest Scale, a visual analog scale assessing interest in use of various 
tobacco and nicotine products  
4. Enviro nmental/Social Influence on Tobacco use to assess environmental and social 
impacts on tobacco use.  
 
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_734992] a mask, one will be provided to them to use for the r emainder 
of the study. Temperature checks will be conducted immediately upon arrival using a thermal heat 
scanner.  
 Participants will provide carbon monoxide (CO) readings at least [ADDRESS_734993].  
 
The following surveys will be self -administered using REDCap:  
1. Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale a measure of nicotine withdrawal symptoms  
2. Questionnaire of Smoking Urges -Brief – Usual Brand Cigarette,  which measures the urge 
to smoke 
3. Cigarette Evaluation Scale,  which measures responses to cigarettes (e.g., reward, 
satisfaction)  
 
Discrete choice task 1: The Sawtooth Lighthouse Studio platform will host a discrete choice task 
(See DCE Questionnaire). First, participants will rate t he appeal of cigarettes and e -cigarettes 
characteristics, which helps familiarize them with the product features that will be manipulated in 
the choice task. Next, the choice task will begin, and they will make several choices between a 
cigarette option and an e -cigarette option responding to a prompt that asks which they would 
rather use exclusively for the next week. Each cigarette vs e- cigarette trial will present different 
combinations of cigarette nicotine content, e -liquid nicotine content, and e- liquid flavor. Finally, 
the participant will complete follow -up questions about which characteristics most informed their 
choices. The data from this task will reveal how participants prioritize and make tradeoffs between product type, nicotine content, and fl avor when forming preferences.   
After completing the discrete choice procedure, p articipants will also be given the opportunity to 
sample the low and normal nicotine Spectrum investigational cigarettes available during the ETM  
(up to 4 puffs each) . Other products  will also be available on the ETM, but will not be available for 
sampling.  These include: fruit, dessert, menthol , and tobacco flavored e -liquids; and mint , fruit  
and cinnamon flavored nicotine gum.  
 
 
Virtual Visits 2 -5  
Participants will complet e Virtual Visit 2 between 1 and 21 days after completing In -Person Lab 
Visit 1. Virtual Visits 2 -5 will ideally be conducted four days in a row to reduce online task fatigue. 
However, visits may be scheduled up to 7 days apart.  
 
The following assessment wi ll be administered as an interview and entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_172561]:  
1. Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) Questionnaire, which will assess tobacco and nicotine 
product use since their last virtual visit.  
 
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_734994] the items that they would like to purchase. The products available on the ETM 
include:  
● Spec trum cigarettes  
● Fruit, dessert, mint and tobacco e- liquids (e.g., Vaporesso Xross Mini ) 
● Mint, fruit, and cinnamon nicotine gum (e.g., Nicorette).  
 
Participants will undergo one of four marketplace conditions during Virtual Visits 2- 5, with the 
order of administration randomized across participants.  
● Marketplace Condition 1  includes moderate  nicotine content vape with all flavor e- liquids .   
● Marketplace Condition 2  includes  moderate nicotine content vape with tobacco e- liquids.   
• Marketplace Condition 3  includes low nicotine content vape with all flavor e -liquids .  
• Marketplace Condition [ADDRESS_734995] participants to complete the ETM task as if they are purchasing the products 
from a retailer, and that one iteration of the task will be randomly selected and will determine 
which products they will use during the field assessment . In reality, we will randomly assign which 
condition is used (Condition 2 or 4)  but will assign products based on when NNC were not 
available to simulate a nicotine content reduction policy.   
 
For each marketplace condition, participants will complete 7 iterations of the ETM task in 
ascending order. The prices for NNC cigarettes on the ETM will be set at: $0.12, $0.25, $0.50, 
$1.00, $2.00 per cigarette ; in the 1st ETM condition, NNC cigarettes will be set at $0.25 with no 
VLNC available to purchase to simulate current market status; while in the 6th ETM condition, 
NNC will be eliminated from the marketplace to simulate a nicotine content reduction policy . The 
costs for the other products will reflect average prices in NC and will not change during the task.  
For each task iteration, participants will receive individually -tailored account balances 
approximately equal to the money they would spend on cigarettes for seven days. They can 
purchase as many or few products as their account balance allows. Participants are not required 
to buy products from the ETM or can buy nicotine gum if they prefer. If they do not buy products 
from the ETM and do not use tobacco products during the field assessment , then they will receive 
their ETM account balance at Virtual Visit  6. This payment is delayed to reduce the likelihood that 
they will use this money to buy their preferred brand cigarettes, thus decreasing the validity of the ETM task.  
 Participants will be instructed to use only the products purchased from the ETM durin g the 
subsequent 7- day period after Virtual Visit [ADDRESS_734996] condition.  
 
 
Virtual Visit 6  
 
Participants will complete Virtual Session 6 seven days after completing In -Person Lab Visit 2.  
 
The following baseline assessments will be administered as an interview and entered into 
REDCap by [CONTACT_20679]:  
1. Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) Questionnaire which will assess past tobacco and nicotine 
product use since Virtual Visit 5.  
 
The following surveys will be self -administered using REDCap:  
1. Tobacco Policy Questionnaire  
2. Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale  
3. Questionnaire of Smoking Urges -Brief – Usual Brand Cigarette  
4. Product Evaluation Scale – VLNC, E -Cigarette, Gum (whichever product(s) they select)  
5. Perceived Health Risks Scale 
6. Tobacco Product Interest Scale  
7. Health Changes Questionnaire  
 
Participants will complete the ETM task under the sam e marketplace condition from which they 
received their field assessment products. Exploratory pre -post field assessment analyses will 
examine how actual use of the products affects subsequent purchasing of those products.  
 
Research staff will conduct in- depth interviews with the participants to assess the following 
constructions: 1) decision- making during the ETM task; 2) use of alternative products during the 
field assessment; 3) product risk perceptions and; 4) opi[INVESTIGATOR_559549].

nicotine equivalents)  and all of their used/unused products.  
 
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_734998] adherence  
 
To verify self -reported tobacco use, all used and unused products will be collected and counted 
at In-Person Lab Visit 3.  Discrepancies between consumption stated on the TLFB versus 
consumption based on the products returned will be addressed. Non- adherence (i.e., using 
products not purchased from the ETM) will be assessed via the TLFB and qualitative interview 
with the importance of honest self -reporting emphasized. If participants report not using 
combusted tobacco, then CO readings < 6 ppm will verify their self -report.   
 
Compensation  
 Participants will be paid $160 for completing the study. They will earn $3 0 for complet ing Virtual 
Visit 1, $15 per visit for completing Virtual Visits 2 -5, $20 for Virtual Visit 6,  plus a $50 bonus for 
completing the study. Participants who do not meet enrollment criteria at Virtual 1 will earn $2 0 
for attending the visit. Participants who start but do not complete the study will receive payments 
for the virtual visits attended. They will not receive the $50 completion bonus. Participants will 
also be reimbursed up to $20 per in- person lab visit for transportation costs.

Page [ADDRESS_734999] 
of the two factors – e-liquid nicotine content (moderate vs. low) and e -liquid flavors (all flavors 
available vs. only tobacco flavor) –  on purchasing behavior during virtual visits 2 –  5. Product use 
behavior, biomarkers of exposure, and other measures of smoking behavior during the field 
assessment will be evaluated in exploratory analyses.  
Analysis of the Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome will be the number of cigarettes purchased during the vi rtual visits. These 
data will be analyzed both in their raw form (i.e. the raw number of cigarettes purchased) and 
using derived behavioral economic measures. This is a within- subject design, with each 
participant providing data under all four factor combi nations, and, for the raw data, each 
participant will be provide data for all price combinations nested within a visit.  
Raw data will be analyzed using a linear mixed- effects model that includes main effects for e -
liquid nicotine content (low vs. moderate), e -liquid flavors (all vs. tobacco only), visit, price 
condition (analyzed as a categorical variable), and a carryover effect for the previous visits 
condition (treated as a four -level categorical variable, and random effects for participant and visit 
nested within participant. This will account for correlation from multiple observations from the 
same participant, both within and across visits. We will also evaluate whether there is an 
interaction between the e- liquid nicotine content and e -liquid flavors  factors. If significant, the 
interaction will be included in the model; otherwise, it will be removed. The analysis of derived 
behavioral economic measures will follow an analogous approach, except that for each measure, 
there will only be a single outcom e for visit. As a result, our linear mixed- effects model will not 
include a main effect for price condition, and there will only be a single random effect for each 
participant. Behavioral economic measures will be derived by [CONTACT_559563]. Specific measures considered will include: Alpha -  the rate of 
change in demand, and Q0 – peak consumption. For all analyses, assessments of key model 
assumptions will be completed and we will considering transformations or alternate analytic 
approaches if these assumptions are violated.   
Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  
The analysis of secondary endpoints will be analogous to the analysis described above for the primary endpoints. The amount of e- liquid purchased will be analyzed both as the raw data for 
each price condition and using derived behavioral economic measures. The analysis of these endpoints will be completed using linear mixed- effects models with the fixed and random effects 
terms described above. The analysis of  the various scales and scores collected at each visit will 
follow the same approach as the analysis of derived behavioral economic measures described above. As before, assessments of key model assumptions will be completed and we will 
considering transfor mations or alternate analytic approaches if these assumptions are violated.   
Cross -price elasticity estimates will be calculated as the slope of the regression line (B 1) fit to 
log-transformed purchasing of each alternative product when offered at fixed prices (C) versus 
log-transformed menthol cigarette price (P): logC = B 0 + B 1logP. Exploratory paired t -tests will 
compare product purchasing during the pre-  and post -field assessment ETM task.  
Attribute -importance will be generated from discrete choice response data using logistic 
regression. A utility range (the difference between a characteristics highest and lowest estimated part-worth utility) will be calculated for device type, cigarette ni cotine content, vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559550]. Part -worth utility refers to the relative 
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_735000] characteristic on choice (ie, as approximated by [CONTACT_559564] ). The relative importance of each characteristic on making a 
choice will be calculated as the utility range for each characteristic, divided by [CONTACT_559565]’ utility ranges.  
Analysis of Exploratory Outcomes  
Product use and biomarkers  of exposure during the field assessment will be analyzed using linear 
regression or other appropriate regression models. The model for primary analysis of these data 
will include main effects for each of the two factors (for the ETM condition carried into the field 
assessment), and the corresponding baseline measure to improve precision. We will also test the 
two-way interaction between the two factors. If significant, the interaction will be included in the 
model; otherwise, it will be removed. We will al so complete a secondary analysis that adjusted 
for age, race, sex, and other covariates that vary between treatment conditions. Biomarkers of 
exposure will be natural -log-transformed before analysis due to skewness. Key model 
assumptions will be evaluated for other endpoints and appropriate transformations will be 
considered if model assumptions are violated.  
For the qualitative data, we will use grounded theory to develop hypotheses related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_23254]. Interviews will be audio- recorded and transcribed verbatim. Audio transcriptions will 
be reviewed for accuracy and entered into Atlas.ti or another qualitative data management 
software program. Two research staff members will code the first five interviews to achieve greater 
than 90% interrate r reliability and then every 10th interview to ensure integrity. The research team 
will analyze the interviews using iterative analyses including qualitative research techniques of open and axial coding; major thematic categories; analytical domains; trian gulation of data; 
comparisons within and between groups; and documenting analytical pathways. Saturation will 
be achieved when no new themes emerge.  
Missing Data  
 
Study staff will make every effort to minimize missing data in the proposed study . Nevertheless, 
we plan to complete a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of missing data on trial 
conclusions.  We will compare subjects with and without missing data in order to identify baseline 
covariates associated with missing data. Our primary approach to handling missing data will be 
multiple imputation where missing values are imputed using regression models developed from 
baseline covariates (Little and Rubin, 2002). In addition, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis of 
the primary and secondary endpoints using a complete- case analysis, baseline- carried- forward 
and last -observation carried forward. The results of these analyses will be compared to the 
primary analysis to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions.  
Power calculation 
Our obj ective is to enroll [ADDRESS_735001] size for 
the main effects and interactions, and the within- participant correlation ( see Figure below ). For 
the main effects of e -liquid nicotine content and e- liquid flavor, we have 80% power to detect an 
effect size of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_735002] 80% power to detect an effect size of

Informed Consent  
 

   
 
Page 14 of 23 
 Prior to Virtual Visit 1, participants will be briefly screened over the phone to determine initial 
eligibility. For this process alone, we will seek a waiver of signed informed consent. This part of 
the research procedure presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no  
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.  
 
Before beginning the informed consent process during Virtual Visit 1, participants will need to 
show a valid, state issued photo identification. The interviewer will confirm the age and identity of 
the participant via video (e.g., WebEx, Zoom).  The intervi ewer  will then present a PowerPoint via 
screen share of the main takeaways of the informed consent form. Participants will be asked 
follow up questions to ensure comprehension of the informed consent form.   
 
In order to ensure adequate informed consent, pa rticipants will be asked to read the first several 
lines aloud to determine literacy. If the interviewer determines that the participant is not literate, 
they will be dismissed from the study but will receive $20 for attending the screening visit. The 
participant will be instructed to read several open -ended questions aloud and discuss the answers 
with the researcher. Only after the participant and the researcher are fully satisfied that the 
participant understands the purpose of the study, the confidentiality of the data, the procedures, 
the risks/benefits and his/her rights as a research participant will the consent form be signed 
electronically via DocuSign a nd the participant undergo screening procedures. The participant will 
be emailed a signed electronic copy of the consent document for their records.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy 
 
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner.  To help ensure subject privacy 
and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form. Any 
collected patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be 
maintained on a linkage file, stored separately from the data. The linkage file will be kept s ecure, 
with access limited to designated study personnel. Following data collection subject identifying information will be destroyed ( three years after closure of the study; paper documents will be 
shredded, electronic documents will be securely deleted using software that will delete and overwrite sensitive disk space),  consistent with data validation and study design, producing an 
anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be 
kept locked and secured, with any computer data password protected.  No reference to any 
individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigators will be  responsible for the overall monitoring of the 
data and safety of study participants. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigators will be 
assisted by [CONTACT_428077].  
 
Potential risks of participation 
1. Survey Questionnaires : The intervi ews will include questions about medical history, 
tobacco use, and questionnaires about mood. Answering these personal questions could 
make the participant feel uncomfortable.  
2. Breach of Confidentiality :  The risk of the interview is loss of privacy if other people find 
out the results.  
   
 
Page 15 of 23 
 3. Smoking Cigarettes : All cigarettes are detrimental to a person’s health and can lead to 
severe or fatal medical problems including:  
a. Cardiovascular diseases: Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, peripheral 
vascular disease, reduced blood circulation, abdominal aortic aneurysm  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748]: Emphysema, bronchitis, tuberculosis and chronic airway 
obstruction  
c. Cancers: Lung, bladder, liver, colon, cervical, esophageal, kidney, larynx, mouth, 
pancreatic, throat, stomach cancers and acute myeloid leukemia  
d. Diabetes  
e. Abnormal immune function, rheumatoid arthritis  
f. Other health risks including but not limited to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, lower 
bone density in postmenopausal women, hip fracture in women, male sexual 
dysfunction, age -related macular degeneration, blindness and cataracts.  
4. Use of Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_172515]:  can exposure users to several chemicals including nicotine, 
carbonyl compounds, and volatile organic compounds, known to have adverse health 
effects. The healt h effects and potentially harmful doses of heated and aerosolized 
constituents of e- liquids, including solvents, flavorants, and toxicants, are not completely 
understood. Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559551] “water vapor” although it generally 
contains fewer toxicants than combustible tobacco products. Specific potential known 
risks include  
a. Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559552] 
b. The most common side effects related to vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559553] i n taste, 
mucus in throat/sinus, dry mouth, dry cough, throat irritation, sore throat, mouth ulcers, dizziness, headache, and nausea.  
c. On rare occasions, batteries from vapi[INVESTIGATOR_172519]/ignited and injured users  
d. Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559554]. Participants are told to be careful if storing the device in a place 
where the button might accidentally be pressed often.  
e. Ingestion of e- liquids containing nicotine can cause acute toxicity and  possible 
death if the content of the cartridges containing nicotine are consumed.  
f. Participants are told to keep study vapi[INVESTIGATOR_559555] e- liquids away from 
children and pets.  
5. Use of Medicinal Nicotine : Most common adverse effects for medicinal nicotine include 
irregular heartbeat/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], high blood pressure, mouth sores, mouth or throat 
irritation, heartburn, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, dizzy or lightheadedness, and 
hiccups or belching. Additional adverse effects associated with nic otine gum include teeth 
or jaw problems. There may also be a risk of nicotine toxicity including symptoms such as 
nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness.  
6. Dual use of tobacco or nicotine products : There is also the chance of use of more than 
one product and/or continued use of the products; however, cessation of all tobacco 
products will be strongly recommended to the participants at the end of the study.  
7. Smoking Withdrawal:  Participants may experience smoking withdrawal symptoms during 
this stu dy if they decide not to purchase tobacco products. The symptoms can be 
uncomfortable but are typi[INVESTIGATOR_127328]. Smoking withdrawal symptoms include:  
a. Anger, irritability, frustration  
b. Anxiousness, nervousness  
c. Depressed mood or sadness  
d. Desire or crav ing to smoke 
e. Difficulty concentrating  
   
 
Page 16 of 23 
 f. Increased appetite, hunger or weight gain 
g. Insomnia, problems sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_559556]  
h. Restlessness  
i. Impatience  
j. Constipation 
k. Dizziness  
l. Coughing 
m. Dreaming or nightmares  
n. Nausea 
o. Sore throat  
8. Returning to Regular Smoking: It is possible that if participants return to smoking their 
usual brand of cigarette at the end of the study they may experience mild and transient 
nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
9. Changes in Mood, Emotions and Psychiatric Symptoms : Smoking and nicotine can affect 
a person’s mood and emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including 
major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders. 
Any changes in nicotine use or cigarette consumption could adversely affect mood, 
emotions and the symptoms related to psychiatric conditions in some individuals.  
10. Smoking and Oral Contraceptives in Women: Women who smoke and are over the age 
of 35 should not take oral contraceptives that contain estrogen without consulting their physician. Smoking while using oral contraceptives can increase the risk of having a 
cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke. Additionally, there is a potential risk 
of thrombosis associated with hormonal therapy (including contraceptives) and smoking.   
 
Avoiding Risks during Pregnancy  
 
Smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, birth defects, and 
other problems. To avoid risks to the participant and fetus, female participants will be tested for 
pregnancy at the Screening Visit.  
 
Expected benefits of participation 
 There are no immediate benefits from participating in the study.  The information obtained from 
this study may ultimately help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decide how best t o 
regulate tobacco products with the goal of improving public health.  
 
Reporting Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
 
Identifying Adverse Events  
 
While participating in the study, adverse events will be assessed at Virtual Visit [ADDRESS_735004] on the participant’s daily life, caused a major disruption of 
functioning, or took any medication for it.  
● Health Changes Questionnaire:  If the participant answers “YES” t o Questions 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_735005] virtual visit? If yes, briefly describe.  
   
 
Page [ADDRESS_735006] you received any form of medical care?  If yes, 
briefly describe.  
3. Have you had any changes in medication since your last visit? 
 
Physiological data that will be reviewed:  
1. CO level: The ‘Adverse Event Form’ will be completed if the average of two (or three) 
consecutive measureme nts in the same visit is:  
o   CO is greater than 50 ppm if CO at Screening/Baseline Visit is < 20 ppm.  
o   CO is greater than 60 ppm if CO at Screening/Baseline Visit is 20 –  34 ppm.  
o   CO is greater than 70 ppm if CO at Screening/Baseline Visit is 35 –  49 ppm.  
 
For the participant’s protection, participants will be withdrawn immediately from the study if any 
of the following occur:  
1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) event : Typi[INVESTIGATOR_127701] (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), by[CONTACT_4897], stroke, peripheral vascular disease (arterial blockages in arms or legs leading to procedure or surgery).  Less common CVD problems 
would be new cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., new atrial fibrillation) or new valvular disease 
(e.g., mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2. DVT/PE  (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, i.e., blood clots in the venous 
system).  
3. Suicide Attempt :  A participant will be withdrawn if they  attempt suicide at any time during 
participation in the study  
4. Psychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: A participant will be withdrawn if they are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146047].  
5. Pregnancy : If a participant indicates they are pregnant at Virtual Visit [ADDRESS_735007] the participant to ask a few questions 
about the baby’s health and will update the open ‘Adverse Event Form’.  
 
The fol lowing will be monitored and can lead to the participant being withdrawn by [CONTACT_978]:  
1. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_113179] >[ADDRESS_735008] the primary outcome 
measures, does not follow study instructions, etc., then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_559557]’s discretion.  
4. If a participant fails to attend her/his Virtual Visit 1 within the 21 -day allowable visit window, 
they will not be eligible to reschedule the visit or continue participation in the study.

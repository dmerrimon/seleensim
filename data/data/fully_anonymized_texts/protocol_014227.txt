1. Protocol Summary  
1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  Phase 4, Open -label Study to Evaluate Treatment Satisfaction With 
Erenumab in Patients With Migraine  
Short Protocol Title:   Erenumab Treatment Satisfaction Study  
Study Phase:   4 
Indication:   Preventive treatment of migraine in adults  
Rationale  
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disorder, with a significant impact on 
the individual, family, workplace, and society.  Objectives commonly assessed in 
registrational clinical trials for migraine prevention include changes in monthly 
migraine days and use of acute migraine -specific medications.  These parameters, 
however, do not fully capture the whole breadth of the impact of migraine preventive 
treatments on the daily lives of patients and their families, including their satisfaction wi th 
treatment.  
There is interest in the migraine provider community not only for clinical outcomes data, 
but also associated patient -centric data (eg, treatment satisfaction and global impression 
of change in migraine from different perspectives such as th ose of patients, providers 
and key family members).  Health systems are also tracking patient satisfaction as a 
metric for quality of care delivery.  These factors begin to define a new treatment 
paradigm for migraine management that includes both clinical  and treatment -related 
satisfaction outcomes.  
The Erenumab Treatment Satisfaction Study is a phase 4 [LOCATION_002] (US), 
open -label, interventional, prospective 24 -week study evaluating treatment satisfaction 
with erenumab as a preventive treatment in adul t subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) 
or chronic migraine (CM) currently on [ADDRESS_289737]’s migraine 
condition over the life of the study.  
This study seeks to mirror real -world US clinical practice by [CONTACT_238947] e xisting migraine prevention therapy (ie, standard of care).  
 
Objective(s) and Endpoint(s)/Estimands  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
 To evaluate the effect of erenumab 
on medication -specific treatment 
satisfaction   Change from baseline in the 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire

Primary Estimand  
The estimand for the primary efficacy objective c onsists of:  
 The target population, which includes subjects with EM or CM currently on [ADDRESS_289739] 
of care migraine prevention therapy  
 The endpoint, which is the change from baseline in TSQM overall satisfaction scale 
score at week 24, as measured by [CONTACT_177599] 1 2 to 14 of the TSQM  
 There are [ADDRESS_289740] (IP) due to 
lack of efficacy or adverse event, and discontinuation of IP due to other reasons.  The 
treatment effect of interest will be assessed for all subjects who receive  least [ADDRESS_289741] postbaseline value observed up to IP discontinuation (inclusive).  A 
hypothetical strategy will be used for those subjects who discontinued IP due to other 
reasons with data collected after IP discontinuat ion censored.  
 The treatment, which is erenumab 70 or 140 mg every 4 weeks  
 The summary measure, which is the mean change from baseline in TSQM overall 
satisfaction scale score at week 24, as measured by [CONTACT_177599] [ADDRESS_289742] postbaseli ne value 
observed up to IP discontinuation (inclusive), while a hypothetical strategy will be used for 
those subjects who discontinued IP due to other reasons with data collected after IP 
discontinuation censored.

CONFIDENTIAL    
Overall Design  
The study will comprise the following periods:  
 A combined screening/baseline period consisting of the following:  
 A screening visit (which may coincide with the first day of the baseline period) for 
the assessment of eligibility criteria  
 A baseline period of approximately 4 weeks (no less than 28 days ; up to 35 days) 
to collect data on migraine headaches and acute headache medication use using 
electronic diary (eDiary) and to assess compliance in eDiary usage  
 A 24-week open -label treatment period  
Subjects will sign the informed consent and be screened  at the screening visit; eligible 
subjects may enter the baseline period at the same visit or may delay baseline 
procedures up to 3 weeks after the screening visit.  At completion of the baseline period, 
those who meet eligibility criteria and choose to pr oceed will be enrolled and will enter 
the open -label treatment period.  
The treating clinician and a key family member (if available) for each participating 
subject will be invited to complete an mGI -I at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24/End of Study 
(EOS).  The ke y family member must sign an informed consent before completing any 
study -specific procedures.  The same clinician and key family member of each subject 
should complete the mGI -I across all visits.  If the clinician or key family member is 
unable to comple te a visit, the assessment for that visit should be noted as missed.  
Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a selected subset of subjects, their treating 
clinicians, and key family members as part of an optional substudy.  These interviews 
will be u sed to provide qualitative information on satisfaction/improvement and details 
into the drivers of satisfaction and improvement that might not be captured by 
[CONTACT_6270]-assessment alone.  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 322 subjects will be enrolled into the  main study.  The ratio of EM:CM will 
be approximately 1:[ADDRESS_289757] sites, their clinicia ns, and key family members will be invited to 
participate in an optional qualitative interview -based substudy with interviews to be 
conducted at the start and end of the study.  
Summary of Eligibility Criteria  
Subjects eligible for the study include tho se who are ≥  [ADDRESS_289758] a history of 
migraine with or without aura for ≥ [ADDRESS_289759] ≥  [ADDRESS_289760] 75% compliance with the eDiary during 
the baseline period.  
Key family members eligible for the study should  be a family member/caregiver of an 
enrolled patient  and a person in the subject’s life with whom s/he interacts significantly 
on a day -to-day basis.  
Clinicians eligible for the study must be l icensed and practicing healthcare practitioners 
(HCPs) in the US and b e currently treating the subject on Study [ADDRESS_289761]:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)  
Protocol Number:   20190389

CONFIDENTIAL    
Treatments  
Subjects will receive e renumab 70 or 140 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) by 
[CONTACT_6567] (SC) injections during the 24 -week open -label treatment period.  
Erenumab will be packaged in a SureClick Autoinjector (AI)/Pen(s) containing 1 mL of 
70 mg/mL or 140 mg/mL of erenumab for SC injection.  
All subjects will be started on a [ADDRESS_289762] -baseline, at their and the investigator’s discretion, 
subjects will be allowed to remain on their standard of care preventive treatment, or they 
may fully discontinue standard of care therapy.  Any changes to standard of care 
preventive treatment, including dose adjustments or tapering off medication, should be 
completed by [CONTACT_68069] [ADDRESS_289763] of care dose adjustments are not permitted 
after week 12.  
Statistical Considerations  
Sample Size Considerations:   
The total sa mple size of approximately 322 subjects (effective sample size of 
289 assuming 10% dropout at Week 24) is driven by [CONTACT_238955], which target a half -width of around 5% for 
estimated 95% confi dence intervals (CIs) (see Table 9 -1). 
Planned Analyses:   
The final analysis will be conducted when all enrolled subjects have completed the week 
24/EOS visit and the data have been entered, cleaned, and locked . 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a repeated measures mixed effects model, 
including baseline TSQM overall satisfaction scale score, visit, the prevailing erenumab 
dose from week [ADDRESS_289764], and baseline monthly migraine days (MMD)  based on 
observed d ata.  The least -squares  mean (LSM) change from baseline in the TSQM 
overall satisfaction scale score at week 24 will be estimated, and the corresponding 
95% CI will be provided.  
Analysis of all secondary proportion endpoints will be descriptive only, where  point 
estimates of the proportion and the corresponding 95% CI will be provided for each 
endpoint.  All other secondary endpoints will be analyzed in a similar manner to the 
primary endpoint.  
For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section  9. 
Statistical Hypotheses  
The study is descriptive in nature without a comparator arm, and as such no formal 
statistical hypothesis is defined.

Date:   [ADDRESS_289773], and society.  Objectives commonly assessed in 
registrational clinical trials for migraine prevention include  changes in monthly 
migraine days (MMD) and use of acute migraine -specific medications.  These 
parameters, however, do not fully capture the whole breadth of the impact of migraine 
preventive treatments on the daily lives of patients and their families, in cluding their 
satisfaction with treatment.   
There is interest in the migraine provider community not only for clinical outcomes data, 
but also associated patient -centric data (eg, treatment satisfaction and global impression 
of change in migraine from dif ferent perspectives such as those of patients, providers, 
and key family members).  Health systems are also tracking patient satisfaction as a 
metric for quality of care delivery.  These factors begin to define a new treatment 
paradigm for migraine managem ent that includes both clinical and treatment -related 
satisfaction outcomes.  
The Erenumab Treatment Satisfaction Study is a phase 4 [LOCATION_002] (US), 
open -label, interventional, prospective 24 -week study evaluating treatment satisfaction 
with erenumab as  a preventive treatment in adult subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) 
or chronic migraine (CM) currently on [ADDRESS_289774]’s migraine 
condition over the life of the study.  
This study seeks to mirror real -world US clinical practice by [CONTACT_238958] (ie, standard of care).  
The study will be the first to evaluate patient satisfaction in a real -world migraine setting 
using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), a questi onnaire 
validated in the migraine population.  It will also be the first to validate the migraine 
Global Impression Item (mGI -I) in migraine patients, their treating clinician, and key 
family member.  With this validation work, it will be the first study t o allow the capture of 
information on impression of improvement in the patient’s overall condition from multiple 
perspectives: patient, clinician, and key family member.

2.2 Background  
2.2.1  Disease  
Migraine is a disabling disorder characterized by [CONTACT_238959] (referred 
to as attacks) with or without aura (ie, visual, sensory, and/or speech symptoms that 
occur just before or at the onset of migraine headache), lasting 4 to 72 hours (if not 
treated) with at least 2 of the following pain character istics: unilateral, pulsating, 
moderate or severe intensity, or aggravated by [CONTACT_238960].  Migraine 
attacks are often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, and sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).  Migraine affects more tha n 10% of the world’s 
population (Robbins and Lipton, 2010), and the prevalence of migraine is approximately 
11.7% in the [LOCATION_002], 14.6% in Canada, and 14.7% in Europe (Stovner and 
Andree, 2010; Lipton et al, 2007).  
The patient burden and disability, as well as the societal impact, increase with higher 
attack frequency.  For this reason, migraine is categorized in 2 major classifications, 
according to frequency of migraine days per month: EM is typi[INVESTIGATOR_135160] 0 to 
14 headache days per month ( Katsarava et al, 2012) .  According to the International 
Classification of Headache Disorders ( ICHD )-4 interim recommendations in 2020, 
EM is better defined as “Headache occurring on  [ADDRESS_289775] 
3 months, which on some days is migraine” (Goa dsby & Evers, 2020).  Chronic 
migraine is defined as [ADDRESS_289776] 
to be typi[INVESTIGATOR_238933] , with m igraine prevention typi[INVESTIGATOR_238934] ≥ 4 MMD  (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache 
Society, 2018).  All patients suffering from migraine can be treated with acute 
medications, and those suffering from frequent/long -lasting attacks and/or significant 
disability induced by [CONTACT_238961] (The 
American Headache Society Position Statement On Integrating New Migraine 
Treatments Into Clinical Practice , 2018; Antonaci et al, 2010; Evers et al, 2006).  
Reports suggest that out of the approximately 25% of patients with migraine in need of 
migraine prevention, only half of them receive migraine preventive treatments (Lipton et 
al, 2007).  
2.2.[ADDRESS_289777] Background:  Erenumab  
Erenumab is a human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that is directed against 
the canonical calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) receptor complex and inhibits the 
action of CGRP.  
Product:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)

CONFIDENTIAL    
Calcitonin gene -related peptide belongs to the calcitonin family of p eptides and is 
expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.  It is prominently involved 
in the pathophysiology of migraine through nociceptive modulation in the 
trigeminovascular system (Goadsby [CONTACT_2297], 2002; Tajti et al, 1999).  
As of the date of approval of this protocol, erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg subcutaneously 
(SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) or once monthly (QM) has been approved in more than 
60 countries, including the US, Australia, Switzerland, and the European Union.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety  of erenumab 
is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Benefits  
Globally, the totality of data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies in subjects with CM and 
EM provides substanti al evidence for the efficacy and safety of erenumab in adults with 
migraine.  The key benefits of erenumab include reduction in MMD, reduction in acute 
migraine -specific medication use, as well as improvements in a range of other patient -
reported outcomes (PROs), favorable tolerability, low treatment discontinuation rates, 
convenience (Q4W injections with the option of self -administration), and rapid onset of 
effect.  
Risks  
The safety profile of erenumab has been favorable in clinical trials and in the 
post-marketing setting.  A limited number of adverse drug reactions (injection site 
reactions, constipation, muscle spasm, and pruritus) have been identified at low 
frequencies (  5) in clinical trials.  In the long -term use of erenumab, the safety profile  
remained consistent through [ADDRESS_289778]-marketing  
settings, hypertension, hypersensitivity reactions (including rash, angioedema and 
anaphylactoid reactions), and constipation with serious complications have been 
reported.  In addition, oral sores ( eg, stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral mucosal 
blistering) , alopecia and rash ( eg, rash papular, exfoliative rash, rash erythematous, 
urticaria, blister)  have been observed in post -marketing surveillance .   
The above benefit risk a ssessment supports the conduct of this clinical trial.  Reference 
should be made to the currently approved  Investigator’s Brochure and Prescribing 
Information, where Aimovig is approved, for further data on erenumab.

4. Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a phase 4 open -label study that will enroll subjects with EM or CM in an 
approximately 1:1 ratio.   The study will compri se the following periods:  
  A combined screening/baseline period consisting of the following:  
 A screening visit (which may coincide with the first day of the baseline period) for 
the assessment of eligibility criteria  
 A baseline period of approximately 4  weeks (no less than 28 days; up to 35 days) 
to collect data on migraine headaches and acute headache medication use using 
electronic diary (eDiary) and to assess compliance in eDiary usage  
 A 24-week open -label treatment period  
Subjects will sign the info rmed consent and be screened at the screening visit; eligible 
subjects may enter the baseline period at the same visit or may delay baseline 
procedures up to [ADDRESS_289796]:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)  
Protocol Number:   20190389  
Date:   [ADDRESS_289797] self -administration.  Subjects will be provided the doses necessary to 
continue erenumab monthly treatment at a non -investigative site (eg, subject’s home) 
between onsite visits, as detailed in the Schedule of  Activities ( Table 1 -1).  Site staff will 
contact [CONTACT_238965] a remote visit 
as described below and determine potential need for an onsite visit.  Changes in 
erenumab dosing may require an onsite visit.  Subjects may also contact [CONTACT_238966].  
For visits not performed onsite, safety assessments, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54482] , and 
standard of care migraine preventive medication status will be performed by [CONTACT_218918] 
a telephone call with the subject and recorded in the subject’s medical record and 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  After speaking with site staff, subject or designee 
will administer investigational product to subject at a non -investigative site (eg, subject’s 
home).  The subject will record dose and lot number in their eDiary.  The dose data will 
be transcribed into the subject’s medical record and eCRF at the next onsite visit.   
All clinical outcomes assessments (COAs) detailed in the Schedule of Activities 
(Table  1-1) will be performed on the subject’s eDiary device regardless of visit location.  
The treating clinician and a key family member (if available ) for each participating 
subject will be invited to complete an mGI -I at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24/EOS.  The key 
family member should be a person in the subject’s life with whom s/he interacts 
significantly on a day -to-day basis.  This person should have a deep understanding of 
the impact migraine has on the subject.  They should also be able to provide their 
perspective of change in the subject’s migraines over time.  The person the subject 
chooses to nominate can be anyone such as a spouse, daughter or son , parent, sibling, 
or other relative or the person with whom the subject is in a de facto relationship.  The 
key family member must sign an informed consent before completing any study -specific 
procedures.  The same clinician and key family member of each subject should 
complete the mGI -I across all visits.  If the clinician or key family member is unable to 
complete a visit, the assessment for that visit should be noted as missed.

4.2 Patient Input into the Study Design  
The overall study design is describe d by a study schema in Section 1.2.  The endpoints 
are defined in Section 3. 
Approximately 322 subjects will be enrol led in the study.  The ratio of EM:CM will be 
approximately 1:1 to allow for qualitative assessments of satisfaction and impression of 
change in migraine for the 2 migraine types.  A subset of approximately 20 enrolled 
subjects at selected sites, their cli nicians and key family members will be invited to 
participate in an optional qualitative interview -based substudy with interviews to be 
conducted at the start and end of the study.  
Subjects in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects.”   Clinicians and 
key family members will be referred to as “participants.”  For the sample size 
justification, see Section 9.2.

 For subjects who are lost to follow -up, the investigator should search publicly 
available records where perm itted to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the 
data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as 
possible.  
8. Study Assessments and Procedures  
Study procedures and their time points are summarized in the Schedule of Ac tivities 
(see Table 1 -1).

8.1 General Study Periods  
8.1.1  Screening, Enrollment and/or Randomization  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any screening procedure.  After 
the subject has signed the informed consent form, the site will register the subject in the 
IRT and screen the subject in order to assess eligibility for participation.  Th e screening 
window is up to [ADDRESS_289837] reasons for 
screening failure, (see Section 5.4) as applicable.  
The baseline period can begin on the same day as th e screening visit or up to [ADDRESS_289838] be 
repeated.  
8.1.2  Treatment Period  
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1).  On -study visits may be 
completed within  [ADDRESS_289839]:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)

8.3 Efficacy Assessments  
8.3.1  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication  
The TSQM version 1.4 is a 14 -item instrument designed to measure import ant 
dimensions of patients' experiences with their medication.  It has 4 domains: 
effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.  Scores range from [ADDRESS_289844] used.  
8.3.2  Migraine Global Impression Item  
The mGI -I is a single item instrument designed to measure improvement/worsening in 
migraine.  The [ADDRESS_289845] s, 
key family members, and treating clinicians measured on the following scale: much 
improved; a little improved; no change; a little worse; or much worse.  The recall period 
is the past [ADDRESS_289846] of 
migraine on broader functioning including 4 domains: Impact on Physical Functioning 
(5 items), Impact on Usual Activities (10 items), Impact on Social Functioning (5 items), 
and Impact on E motional Functioning (5 items).  In addition, there is [ADDRESS_289847] 7 days.  
8.3.4  Expectation of Treatment Scale  
The Expectation of Treatment Sc ale (ETS) is a 5-item questionnaire.  Responses 
are scored  on a 5 -point Likert  scale, and subjects’ item  scores  are summed to provide a 
total score  ranging between 5 and 20.  Higher  scores  indicate higher perceived 
expectations.  
8.3.5  Migraine Symptom Severity Scale  
The MSSS is a 7 -item questionnaire that assesses frequency of pain and other 
symptoms associated with migraines.  Responses are as follows: “never,” “rarely,” 
“less  than half the time,” “half the time or more,” and “all or nearly all of the time.”  T he 
responses are given a value from 1 to 3 as follows: Never = 0, Rarely = 1, Less Than

CONFIDENTIAL    
Half the Time = 2, Half the Time or More = 3, and All or Nearly All of the time = 3.  The 
MSSS score is the sum of the 7 items and has a range from 0 to 21.  
8.3.6  Migraine In terictal Burden Scale  
The MIBS -4 measures  interictal migraine -related  burden  with 4 questions that assess  
impairment in work or school, impairment in family and social life, difficulty making plans 
or commitments, and emotional/affective and cognitive dis tress.   Each of the 4 questions 
is responded to using 1 of 6 response categories: “Don’t know/NA” (Score=0), “Never” 
(Score=0), “Rarely” (Score=1), “Some of the time” (Score=2), “Much of the time” 
(Score=3) or “Most or all of the time” (Score=3).  Each que stion is multiplied with its 
score and summed up to produce total score ranges from 0 to 12.  The MIBS -4 total 
scores are categorized into 4 level of interictal burden: None (0), Mild (1 to 2), Moderate 
(3 to 4) and Severe (5 or higher).  
8.3.7  Generalized Anxiet y Disorder Scale  
The GAD -7 is a self -administered 7 -item instrument that uses some of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual (of Mental Disorders) fifth edition (DSM -V) criteria for general 
anxiety disorder (GAD) to identify probable cases of GAD along with  measuring anxiety  
symptom severity.  Responders are asked to rate the frequency of anxiety symptoms in 
the last 2 weeks on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). 
Items are summed to provide a total score.  Score interpretation  is as follows: 1 to 4 
minimal symptoms, 5 to 9 mild symptoms, 10 to 14 moderate symptoms, and 15 to 21 
severe symptoms.  Changes of 5 points or more are clinically meaningful.   
8.3.8  Patient Health Questionnaire  
The PHQ -9 is a self -administered questionnaire, w idely used for diagnosis and severity 
assessment of depression in primary care settings.  The PHQ -9 is a 9 -question, 
self-administered instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the 
severity of depression.  It incorporates Diagnostic an d Statistical Manual (of Mental 
Disorders) fourth edition (DSM -IV) depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major 
depressive symptoms into a brief self -report tool.  The tool rates the frequency of the 
symptoms which factors into the scoring sever ity index.  The PHQ -9 scores each of the 
9 DSM -IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day).  The score is calculated as 
the sum of the item responses and corresponds to 1 of the 5 severity categories: 
Minimal or None = 0 to 4, Mild = 5 to 9, Moderate = 10 to 14, Moderately Severe = 
15 to 19, and Severe = [ADDRESS_289848]:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting and Reporting Safety 
Event Information  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Adverse Events  
The adverse event grading scale to be used for this study will be the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_289853]  through th e end of study  are reported using the Events eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_289854] that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through end of study  are reported using the Events eCRF.  
All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24  hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event, as indicated in 
Section 11.4.  The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the 
sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
Since the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for 
serious adverse events,  if adverse events correspond to grade  4 CTCAE toxicity 
grading scale criteria (eg, laboratory abnormality reported as grade  4 without 
manifestation of life -threatening status), it will be  left to the investigator’s judgment 
to also report these abnormalities as serious adverse events.  Laboratory abnormality 
with clinical significance will be reported as an adverse event .  If an adverse event 
associated with a laboratory abnormal ity meets the criteria of a serious event, it 
will be reported as a serious adverse event based upon the investigator’s 
judgment.  For any adverse event that applies to this situation, comprehensive 
documentation of the event’s severity must be recorded in  the subject medical 
records.

reported to [COMPANY_010] within  24 hours following the  investigator’s awareness of the 
event .  Per local requirements in some countries, investigators are  required to 
report serious adverse events that they become aware of  after end of study.  If 
serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report  them to [COMPANY_010] 
within 24  hours following the investigator’s awareness of the event .  Per local 
requirements in some countries, investigators are required to report serious adverse 
events that they become aware of aft er end of study.  If serious adverse events are 
reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s awareness of the event .   
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period w ill be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based 
on relationship to investigational product.  If further safety related data is needed to 
fulfill any regulatory reporting requirements for a reportable event, then additional 
information may need to be collected from the subject’s records after the subject 
ends the study.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events, 
adverse device effects,  and serious adverse events and the pro cedures for completing 
and transmitting serious adverse event reports are provided in Section 11.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open -ended and non -leadin g verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse event  occurrence.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).  
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 11.4. 
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to

[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
If subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_238977] s ponsor of serious adverse events is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of 
subjects and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory auth ority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator wh o receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse 
events) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify 
the IRB/I EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Monitoring Plan  
Subject safety will be routinely monitored as defined in [COMPANY_010]’s safety surveillance and 
signal management processes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy and Lactation  
A urine pregnancy test should be comple ted at screening and within [ADDRESS_289858] for females of childbearing potential.  
Note:  Females who have undergone a bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion should have 
pregnancy testing per protocol requirements.  (If a female  subject, or the partner of a 
male subject, becomes pregnant it must be reported on the Pregnancy Notification 
Form  (Figure 11 -2).  Refer to Section 11.5 for contraceptive requirements.   
Additional pregnancy testi ng should be performed at intervals of every 12 weeks 
(+/- 7 days) during treatment with protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_238941].

Additional on -treatment pregnancy testing may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion,  if there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a female subject is pregnant,  or as required per local 
laws and regulations.  
Details of all pregnancies and/or lactation in female subjects  will be collected after the 
start of study treatment and unt il [ADDRESS_289859] . 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in 
Section  11.5.  [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding 
additional information that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death , stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Section 11.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Device Effects  
In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is 
responsible for the detection and documentation of any adverse device effects that occur 
during the study with such devices.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from 
insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any 
malfunction of the device, or adverse events res ulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the device.  
All adverse device effects are to be reported as adverse events following the same

experiences of the risk -benefit related to new interventions being tested in clinical trials 
(FDA, 2017 ).  Qualitative interviews at the start and end of clinical trials help to 
understand the patient experience of the treatment in the trial setting: their experience of 
the convenience of treatment, changes they perceive as result of treatments, and 
informal assessments of trade -offs on benefit and r isks they perceive about the 
treatment.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_289862] participated in S tudy 20190389, their 
clinicians, and key family members to provide a more in -depth understanding of patients’ 
experience with migraine and the impact of migraine, including perception of symptoms

member’s perceptions of migraine, associated symptoms, and symptom impact/burden 
and interference on the subject’s life, subject perceptions of meaningful changes in 
experience of migraine, and to explore subject experience with treatment administration.  
8.5.3  Substudy Design  
Qualitative interviews will be conducted with approximately 20 subjects, their clinicians, 
and key family members (collectively referred to as “participants”) who opt in to this 
optional substudy.  The substu dy sample size is based on a convenience sample to 
allow for sufficient numbers of EM and CM subjects enrolled.  Best efforts will be made 
to ensure that the sample includes subjects with diverse demographic characteristics 
from the pool of trial subjects.   
Interviews will be conducted at study entry, within [ADDRESS_289863] dose (Day 1), and at study exit, within 7 days of the week 24 visit or within 
approximately 14 days of the early termination visit.  If possible, within 7 day s from early

study, and the meaningfulness of the changes e xperienced.  During the interviews, 
interviewers will ask participants for specific examples to qualitatively illustrate the 
subjects’ experience.  
Participants will be specifically asked about the subject’s functional abilities during and 
between migraine  attacks after the start of the study; ie, perceptions of migraine, 
associated symptoms, and symptom impact/burden and interference on the subject’s 
life; perceptions of meaningful changes in experience of migraine; and experience with 
treatment administra tion. 
After open -ended questions, if participants do not mention concepts associated with the 
domains of the COA instrument in the clinical trial, the interviewer will specifically probe 
about those concepts.  The interviewers will also explore what aspect s of improvement 
or worsening of the subject’s migraine (eg, frequency, severity, and duration) drove the 
changes, as well as the meaningfulness of change/no change reported by [CONTACT_423].  
8.5.6  Variables

experience will be the  outcome.  Data will be analyzed to achieve the study objectives, 
using qualitative data analysis software (ie, ATLAS.ti).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exposure Variable(s)  
Subjects will be started on the [ADDRESS_289870] of t he study. Dose changes are permitted at the investigator’s 
discretion, but are not recommended unless medically necessary.  
8.5.7  Substudy Data Analysis  
Audio recordings from the interviews will be transcribed for qualitative analyses.  Evidera 
will develop a sep arate data analysis plan that will detail how the qualitative data will be 
analyzed.  The analyses of interview data will help to illustrate subjects’ perceptions of 
meaningful change or difference, migraine functional impacts, and treatment efficacy or 
benefit.  Subjects will be grouped by [CONTACT_238978], and other exploratory subgroups 
may be determined based on the characteristics of the final sample.  The qualitative 
report will discuss perceived treatment benefit and changes, if any, in relation to 
entry-interview discussion of the functional impacts of migraine.  
A qualitative content analysis approach will be used to analyze data collected from 
qualitative interviews using coding dictionaries and ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis 
software.  The cleane d transcripts will be entered into ATLAS.ti qualitative analysis 
software version 7.0 or higher ( Friese and Ringmayr, 2013 ).  Qualitative data coded in 
ATLAS.ti can be systematically organized into analysis outputs.  ATLAS.ti software is 
designed to facili tate the storage, coding, and retrieval of qualitative data.   
Coding will be an iterative process that marks the beginning of the qualitative analysis 
process.  Concept codes will be used to capture symptoms or impacts of the disease 
most important and re levant to participants.  Qualitative data will be coded according to 
the coding dictionary as outlined in the analysis plan.  The initial coding dictionary will be 
based on the structure of the main themes and content of the discussion guide to allow 
the text data to be coded with key concepts codes.  The coding dictionary will be 
iteratively updated with emerging themes and concepts from discussions.   
Evidera proposes to conduct longitudinal qualitative research analyses ( Calman et al, 
2013 ; Saldana, 2003 ), which is distinguished from a traditional qualitative approach by

Date:   [ADDRESS_289871] experiences/ 
perceptions change over time.  This innovative approach will be used to characterize 
changes in subjects ’ perceptions and experiences over time, particularly in concepts the 
subjects perceive as most important.  
A list of each key concept identified at analysis of entry interviews will be provided to 
interviewers ahead of the follow -up interviews, so that th ese may be probed at the 
follow -up interviews.  For each concept, a category will be assigned to show changes in 
concepts that occurred between the 2 time points (newly emerged, not changed/stable, 
improved, worsened, not experienced anymore, and missing) in the concept tracker.  
Each of the concepts probed during the follow -up interviews will be categorized and 
compared to the entry interview.  An analysis will then be conducted on the data from 
groups of participants to document the changes observed over time.  
All analysis and reporting will be conducted by [CONTACT_238979].   
Subject characteristics collected in the clinical trial will be summarized for describing the 
sample.  Descriptive statistics (eg, n, mean, SD, and/or frequency) will be used to 
characterize the sample in terms of questionnaire data, sociodemographic, and clinical 
characteristics.  
The results of this sub -study will be reported separately from the main study.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_289872] of an 
interview will be reported to [COMPANY_010] and to investigational sites wit hin 1 business day of 
awareness.

9.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
The study is descriptive in nature without a comparator arm, and as such no formal 
statistical hypothesis is defined.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
The total sample size of approximately 322 subjects (effective sample size of 
289 assuming 10% dropout at week 24) is driven by [CONTACT_238955], which targets a half -width of 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) around 5%. The half -width of the 95% CI will be the widest 
when the estimated percentage is 50% given a fixed sample size and will become 
narrower if the percentage moves further away from 50% (see  Table 9 -1).

9.3 Populations for Analysis  
The following populations are defined:  
Population  Description  
Full Analysis Set  The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all subjects enrolled 
in the study.  Analysis of disposition, demographic and 
baseline characteristics, and important protocol deviations 
will utilize the FAS.  
Efficacy Analysis Set  The respective efficacy analysis set consists of a subset of 
subjects from FAS who receive at least [ADDRESS_289874]. 
Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
(except for the global impression Patient Reported 
Outcomes [PRO] endpoints) will u tilize the respective 
efficacy analysis set.  
Global Impression PRO 
Analysis Set  The global impression PRO analysis set consists of a 
subset of subjects from FAS who receive at least [ADDRESS_289875] . 
Analysis of each of the 3 global impression PRO endpoints 
will utilize this analysis set.  
Safety Analysis Set  The safety analysis set (SAS) will consist of a subset of 
subjects from FAS who received at  least [ADDRESS_289876] administration will 
utilize the safety analysis set.  
 
9.3.1  Covariates  
All model -adjusted analyses of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will include the 
corresponding baseline value for the endpoint being analyzed, if applicable, and 
baseline MMD.  
9.3.2  Subgroups  
The primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed in th e following subgroups:  
 Whether remained on standard of care migraine preventive treatment throughout the 
study (yes vs no)  
 Migraine type (EM vs CM) based on eDiary collection during baseline  
The subgroups will be re -examined for appropriateness and may be re-categorized (due 
to small sample size, for example, if there are < 10% of subjects within a subgroup) 
before final analysis.

9.4 Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock.  Below 
is a summary  of the timing and methods for the planned statistical analyses.  
9.4.1  Planned Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Analysis and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_238942].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis  
Not applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final Analysis  
The final analysis will be conducted when all enrolled subj ects have completed the 
week  24/EOS visit  and the data have been entered, cleaned, and locked . 
9.4.2  Methods of Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Considerations  
Summary statistics will be computed at each timepoint of interest.  For continuous 
endpoints, the following desc riptive statistics will be computed: number of observations, 
means, standard deviations, standard errors, medians, first and third quartiles, 
minimums and maximums.  For categorical endpoints, the summaries will contain the 
number and percentage of subject s in each category.  
Due to lack of a control arm, all analyses should be considered as descriptive in nature.  
Data on any endpoints collected after treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or 
adverse event will be defined based on the worst observed value (for continuous 
endpoints) or non -response (for binary endpoints) using a composite strategy.  Data 
collected after treatment discontinuation due to other reasons will be censored based on 
a hypothetical strategy and not be used in efficacy analyses as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analyses  
 
Endpoint/ 
Estimand  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  In the event of IP discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
event, the TSQM overall satisfaction scale score  after treatment 
discontinuation will be defined as the worst postbaseline value 
observed up to IP discontinuation (inclusive).  Any TSQM data 
collected after treatment discontinuation due to other reasons will be 
censored and not included in the analysis.   
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a repeated measures 
mixed effects model, including baseline TSQM overall satisfaction 
scale score, visit, the prevailing erenumab dose from week  [ADDRESS_289877] -squares mean (LSM) of the 
mixed effects model, and the corresponding 95% CI will be provided.  
The nominal p -value will be reported by [CONTACT_238980] n change 
from baseline in TSQM overall satisfaction scale score at week 24 to 
zero with a two -sided 5%  significance level.  
Secondary  In the event of IP discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
event, the binary secondary endpoint after IP discon tinuation will be 
classified as not achieving overall satisfaction or global impression on 
improvement; and the continuous MFIQ domain scores after treatment 
discontinuation will be defined as the worst postbaseline value 
observed before treatment disconti nuation.  Data collected after IP 
discontinuation due to other reasons will be censored and not included 
in the analysis.   
A generalized linear mixed effects model with the appropriate link 
function will be used to analyze each secondary endpoint based on  
observed data .  The model will include the corresponding baseline 
value for the endpoint being analyzed (except for the global 
impression endpoints), visit, the prevailing erenumab dose from week 
12 onwards, and baseline MMD.   
For binary secondary endpoi nts, logit link function will be used, and 
the proportions and the corresponding 95% CI at week 24 will be 
estimated from the LSM (with inverse link function) of the mixed 
effects model.  
For the continuous MFIQ domain score endpoints, identity link functi on 
will be used, and mean change from baseline in each domain score at 
week 24 with the corresponding 95% CI will be estimated from the 
LSM of the mixed effects model, and p -values comparing with zero at 
a 2-sided 5% significance level will be reported.  
Exploratory  Will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) finalized before 
database lock

Informed Consent Process  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the sample 
informed consent form are to be communicated formally in  writing from the [COMPANY_010]  Trial 
Manager to the investigator.  The written informed consent form is to be prepared in the 
language(s) of the potential participant population.  
The investigator or his/her delegated representative will explain to the participant  (ie, 
study subject or key family member) the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of the study and optional sub -study before any protocol -specific 
screening procedures or any investigational product(s) is/are administered, and answer  
all questions regarding the study and substudy.   
Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  Participants will then 
be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 
[ADDRESS_289889] requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC  or study site.  
The subject’s medical record must include a statement that written informed consent 
was obtained before the subject was enr olled in the study and the date the written 
consent was obtained.  The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also 
sign the informed consent form.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study unless it is a local requirement.  The 
investigator shall then inform the primary care physician.  If the subject agree s to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, th e investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.

notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and t he informed consent form is to be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_177157].  Subject 
withdrawal of consent or discontinuation from study treatment and/or procedures must 
also be documented i n the subject’s medical records; refer to Section 7. 
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the informed consent 
form(s) during their participation in the study.  
The original signed informed consent form is to be retaine d in accordance with 
institutional policy, and a copy of the informed consent form(s) must be provided to the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative.  
Data Protection/Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject ’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
The subject will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456].  Any subject records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject names 
or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.  
On the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) demographics page, in addition to the 
unique subject identification number, include the age at time of enrollment.  
For serious adverse  events reported to [COMPANY_010], subjects are to be identified by [CONTACT_21969], initials (for faxed reports, in accordance with local 
laws and regulations), and age (in accordance with local laws and regulations).  
Documents that are  not submitted to [COMPANY_010] (eg, signed informed consent forms) are to 
be kept in confidence by [CONTACT_093], except as described below.  
Subject data should be kept in a secure location.  Access to subject data will be limited 
to authorized individuals, as  described below.  
In compliance with governmental regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines , it is required that the 
investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the 
regulatory agency(s), and the IRB/IEC  direct access to review th e subject’s original 
medical records for verification of study -related procedures and data.  Direct access 
includes examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that 
are important to the evaluation of the study.

information.  
[COMPANY_010] complies with all relevant and applicable laws and regulations that protect 
personal information in order to ensure subject confidentiality and privacy.  Subjects are 
designated by a unique subject identification number in the Sponsor’s systems.  The  
Sponsor uses  access -controlled systems to house, review, and analyze subject data.  
These systems are backed up regularly to minimize the risk of loss of subject data; 
procedures are also defined for data recovery in the event of data loss.  The Sponsor 
has standard operating procedures in place that restrict access to subject data to those 
who require access to this data based on their role and have also completed the 
required training.  These procedures also outline the process for revoking access to 
such data when it is no longer needed.  In the event of a security breach, the Sponsor 
has procedures in place for notification of privacy incidents and to address these 
incidents, via its Business Conduct Hotline.  
Publication Policy  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct of 
Reporting, Editing, and  Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states:  
Authorship credit is to be based on:  (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article 
or revis ing it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to 
be published; and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in 
ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work  are 
appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors need to meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group is to identify the 
individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These indi viduals must 
fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. Acquisition of funding, collection of 
data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.  All 
persons designated as authors must qualify for authorship,  and all those who qualify are 
to be listed.   Each author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. All publications (eg, manuscripts, 
abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book c hapters) based on this study must be

11.4 Appendix 4.  Safety Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting  
Definition of Adverse Event  
Adverse Event Definition  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment.   
 Note:  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device or procedure.  
 Note:  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be defined in the SAP.  
 
Events Meeting the Adverse Event  Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, 
not related to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possib le suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.  
  “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Such instances will b e 
captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse  event.  
 
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy):  the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

CONFIDENTIAL    
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Eve nt is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately life -threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospit alization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155967].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the ad verse event is to be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85766] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, i nfluenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere 
with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other medically important serious event  
Medical or scien tific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious adverse 
event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155968] [ADDRESS_289894]:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)  
Protocol Number:   20190389  
Date:   [ADDRESS_289895]  
The detection and documentation  procedures for adverse device effects described in 
this protocol apply to all [COMPANY_010] medical devices provided for use in the study (see 
Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_289896] of [COMPANY_010]  medical devices).  
Adverse Device Effect Definition  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adverse  device effects include, but are not limited to, 
adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse 
events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from 
use error or from intentional misu se of the device.  
A combination product is a product composed of any combination of a drug, a 
device, and a biological product.  Each drug, device, and biological product 
included in a combination product is referred to as a “constituent part” of the 
combination product.  
Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Event electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 The investigator must assign the following mandatory adverse event attributes:  
 Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptom s); 
 Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);

Date:   18 March 2022  Page 80 of 91 
CONFIDENTIAL    
 Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product, other protocol -
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
 Assessment of seriousness;  
 Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
 Assessment of relatedness to investigat ional product, devices, and/or study -
mandated activity and/or procedures;  
 Action taken; and  
 Outcome of event.  
 If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event eCRF . 
 It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the Event eCRF page.  
 If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical records.  In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_238945]. 
 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious 
adverse event.  
Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of severity will be 
based on: 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.03, which is 
available at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product , device(s), and/or study -mandated activity and/or procedure(s) and each 
occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship 
between investigational product and the event.  
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relatio nship.

Date:   18 March 2022  Page 81 of 91 
CONFIDENTIAL    
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will also consu lt the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigator must document in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious ad verse 
event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the investigat or always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by 
[CONTACT_54558]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fu lly as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.  
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] 
a seri ous adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
 If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_010] with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopatholog y. 
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event 
eCRF.  
 The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to [COMPANY_010]  
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system.  
 If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will report 
the information to [COMPANY_010] using a paper -based Serious Adverse Event 
Contingency Report Form (see  Figure 11 -1) within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness  of the event.

CONFIDENTIAL    
 The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as 
soon as it becomes available.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line to 
prevent the entry of new data or changes to  existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study subject or 
receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the 
EDC system has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a 
paper Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form (see  Figure 11 -1). 
 Once the study has ended, serious adverse event(s) suspected to be related 
to investigational product will be reported to [COMPANY_010] if the investigator 
becomes aware of a serious adverse event.  The investigator should use the 
paper -based Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form to report the 
event.  
Adverse Device Effects:  Recording, Evaluating and Reporting  
 Any adverse event resulting from an adverse device effect that occur during the 
study will be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the Event eCRF page.  
 It is very important that the investigator provides his/her assessment of causality 
(relationship to the medical device provided by [CONTACT_11337] ) at the time of the initial report 
and describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurr ence of the 
incident.

Females in the following categories are not considered female of childbearing potential:  
 premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
o documented hysterectomy;  
o documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]; or  
o documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
Note: Site personnel documenta tion from the following sources is acceptable:  
1) review of subject’s medical records; 2) subject’s medical examination; or

 premenarchal female  
 postmenopausal female  
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses fo r 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy 
(HRT). Howe ver, in the absence of [ADDRESS_289900] discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Methods for Female Subjects  
Acceptable Methods of Effective Contraception  
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen -only hormonal 
methods given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route)

 Vasectomized partner (pr ovided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse  during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual 
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject)  
 Male or female condom with or with out spermicide  
 Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide  
 Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose either 
a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an option due 
to the risk of tearing when both partn ers use a condom)  
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Female Subjects  
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:  
 Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods)  
 Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  
 Spermicides only  
 Lactational amenorrhea method  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
 Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while taking protocol -required th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817]  [ADDRESS_289901] 
dose of protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form (see  Figure  11-2).  
The form must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the 
site’s awareness of a subject’s pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not required to provide 
any information  on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or 
regions local privacy laws).  
 After obtaining the female subject’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant hea lth 
information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who 
becomes pregnant while taking IP through [ADDRESS_289902] dose of the study 
drug.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.  Generally, 
infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth of the child (if 
applicable).  
 Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will 
be report ed as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an elective 
termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation or maternal 
Product:   Erenumab -aooe  (AMG 334)  
Protocol Number:   20190389  
Date:   [ADDRESS_289903] be reported 
to [COMPANY_010] as a pregn ancy exposure case.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbir th, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event.  
 Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to  the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be 
reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety as described in Section 11.4.  While the 
investigator is n ot obligated to actively seek this information in former study subjects, 
he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous reporting.  
 Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study 
treatment (see Section 7.1 for deta ils). 
Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
 In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 
16 weeks after  discontinuing protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the information will be 
recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form.  The form ( see Figure 11 -2) must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of 
the pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on t he 
Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws).  
 The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain 
additional pregnancy information.  
 After obtaining the female partner’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant 
health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_1629] d complete the 
pregnancy questionnaires.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global 
Patient Safety.  
 Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the 
child (if applicable).  
 Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.  
Collection of Lactation Information  
 Investigator will collect lactation information on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_289904] dose of study 
drug.  
 Information will be recorded on the Lactation Notification Form (see below) a nd 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.  
 Study treatment will be discontinued if female subject breastfeeds during the study 
as described in exclusion criterion 218. 
 With the female subjects signed consent for release of mother and infant health 
information, the investigator will collect mother and infant health information and

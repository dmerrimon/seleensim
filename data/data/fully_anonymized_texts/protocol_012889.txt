2 Background and Specific Aims  
 
With t he growing elderly population, the number of total shoulder arthroplasty  (TSA)  surger ies is 
increasing. Nationwide, the total and partial shoulder replacements increased from about 18,000 in 2000 to 
over 45,000 in 2013 according to the American Academy of Orthopedic surgeons  (AAOS) . One of the greatest 
drivers of cost following TSA  has been shown to be disch arge disposition . Effective pain control after 
surgery is paramount because  it facilitates rehabi litation and decreases  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110756].  Additionally, 
it may increase the likelihood of patient s being discharged to their  home rather tha n a rehabilitation o r 
skilled nursing facility .  
 
TSA  is a procedure that is well confined within the dermatomal distribution of an interscalene  brachial 
plexus nerve block  (ISB) , making it an ideal procedure to both evaluate and compare the regional potential  
of varying agents. Although the analgesic coverage is typi[INVESTIGATOR_110757] , single shot injection  of the long  acting

CONFIDENTIAL

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_110810]: [ADDRESS_123422], require  daily maintenance, and often dislodge or migrate from the desired position.   
These limitations make  interscalene perineural  cathe ters  problematic .  In order to offer the longevity of an 
appropriately positioned cathe ter while preserving the simplicity  of a single injection nerve blockade, this 
group proposes to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110758] ® in the setting of TSA.    
 
Exparel ® is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, preservative -free liposomal formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110759] a 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_110760] 72 hours with single shot injection into the 
perineural space.  The chemical and pharmacological nature of Exparel ® allows for the encapsulated 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110761] . The FDA has recently approved  Exparel ® in its use for shoulder surgery 
via the interscalene nerve block . Exparel ® has shown great potential with both its analgesic benefits and 
side effect profile; however, adequately powered trials are still necessary in order to compare its ben efits t o 
that of standard Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110762].  
 
To date, only one study has been published comparing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110763] (1). In that study, the reduction in pain scores was minimal. However, there are several 
methodological issues  with that study: 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110764] 0.5%, resulting in a nerve 
block that was less dense, and making it mandatory to use general anesthesia; the study was probably 
underpowered; and analgesic use was not quantified.  
 
2.1 Specific Aims  
AIM 1:  To determin e if Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110765] 0.5 % bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110766] -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_110767] [ADDRESS_123423] -
operative period . This will be evaluated by [CONTACT_110811] 0.5% Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_110768] 0.5% with Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110769] . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_110770] -operative period , up to [ADDRESS_123424] op  and for  up to  4 weeks after 
surgery . 
 
AIM 2:   To determine if the addition of Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110771] B upi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% in an interscalene nerve 
block prolongs post -operative nerve block and hence reduces post -operative pain  from during the initial [ADDRESS_123425] -operative period.   Usin g the same groups as above, the patient stated d uration of block  (record 
time of onset of pain)  and p ost-operative  VAS  Pain scores will be recorded in both  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110772].  Physical therapy endpoints will also be monitored and recorded.  
 
2.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that  adding Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110773] 0.5% for the interscalene  nerve  block 
prior to TSA surgery will prolong the sensory block and  reduce post -operative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_110774]’ inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l stay but also after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] u p to [ADDRESS_123426] the null 
hypothesis would signify that E xparel® has no clinically relevant impact on post -operative outcomes in TSA  
surgery  as compared to plain Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] .  
2.2 Objectives and Purpose  
The  goal o f this study is to determine the effectiveness of Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110775] 24 -72 hours when used along with Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% for single shot ISB for total 
shoulder arthro plasty . In addition, we w ould also like to determine if Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110776] -operative pain in patients after TSA surgery. We would also

Primary outcomes measures will be opi[INVESTIGATOR_14076] (in morphine milligram equiva lents [MME])  during a 
72-hour post -operative period .  Secondary outcomes include patient  reported  pain scores , VAS .  While it is 
expected that the greatest benefit of Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110778]  0.5% will be seen within  24-
72 hours  after surgery , it is possible that there will be in an overall  reduction in long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_20856] (up to 
4 weeks) . Secondarily, function/rehabilitation, length of stay, and complications may be impacted by

3 Study Design  and Endpoints  
 
ARM 1: Experimental  Sample Size:  
92 10 mL Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%  
+ 
10 mL Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110780] 2:  Control  Sample Size:  
92 20 mL Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%  
 
 
3.1 Description of Study Design  
 
PRE -SCREENING PHASE /CONSENTING PHASE : 
Surgeons will inform eligible patient s of the study during their pre -surgical visit in their office.  The surgeons 
will use an IRB -approved recruitment flyer to help explain the study to the eligible patient. If the patient is 
agreeable, a member of the research team will provide further details and ask the patient to participate  on 
day of surgery.  Inform ed consent will be obtained on DOS when the patient is in the pre -operative holding 
room by [CONTACT_110813].  
 
BASELINE ASSESSMENTS:  
After informed consent has been obtai ned, participants will complete a total of 3 PROMIS assessments 
(Upper Extremities, Pain Intensity and Global Physical Health) before undergoing their TSA surgery.  
 
RANDOMIZATION PHASE:  
Subjects scheduled to undergo TSA  will be rand omized to either the Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.5%  plus Liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110781]  0.5% group. Randomization of each subject will be done on day of surgery using 
randomization.com software to generate the assignment.  
 
TREATMENT PHASE:  
Subjects in the Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_110782] 
10mL 0.5% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 10mL  of Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . The co ntrol group will receive an int erscalene  
nerve  block with 20mL 0.5% Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_110783] . The anesthesiologist  will NOT  be blinded to what solution is 
being injected, as liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110784] a white fluid while bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110785] . All other stakeholders 
(patient, surgeon, other caregivers, and research staff collecting the data) will be blinded to the patient ’s 
group assignment.  
 
POST -OPERATIVE PHASE:  
After initial recruitment, subjects’ pain will be assessed via vi sual analog scale (VAS) by [CONTACT_110814] -operative period  as per standard of care . The VAS pain score s are collected and documented i n the 
patient’s electronic medical record . Additionally, a  standardized regimen of pain medication will be given to 
all subjects who are enrolled.  The pain medications given to patients are standard  of care medications and 
vary based on pain level . The clinical staff determines this  for each patie nt.

the staff member will call the patient  within 1 -2 business days  to obtain th e remaining opi[INVESTIGATOR_110786].  
 
After discharge , the research staff wi ll continue to follow up with the patient on POD 7, POD 14 and POD 30  
to assess pain scores , opi[INVESTIGATOR_110787] , and functional status. The pain intensity PROMIS assessment 
will be administered during each phone call. Additionally, on POD 30, participants will complete the Upper 
Extremity PROMIS form. Research staf f will verify documented opi[INVESTIGATOR_110788].

6 Statistical Analysis  
6.1 General Approach  
Intent ion-to treat . The prim ary analysi s will follow the intent ion-to-treat ( ITT) principle in order to evaluate 
the true outcome of the intervention as experienced by [CONTACT_110817].  
 
Missing Data . It is anticipated that the data for some subjects will be incomplete for various reasons:   
missing daily -diary entries,  refusal to answer a sensitiv e question on a questionnaire, onset of illne ss, loss-
to-follow -up, etc. All occurrences of incomplete data will be investigated to carefully document the  reasons 
for the missing data. If the primary outcome (amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_110797] 24 and 72 hours after surgery) 
cannot be ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty, the patient will be excluded from the study.

The analysis of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] u se, VAS, and PROMIS assessments  will rely o n a univariate  analysis of variance model 
for mean score.   This model is in the class of models commonly known as unirep -ANOVA models.   It assumes 
that the mean score is a function of elaps ed time and the treatment regimen assigned .  This model considers  
the fact that the subject’s repeated measures are correlated.   The fitted model will provide statistical 
estimates of the mean levels, the treatment -effect differences between mean levels, t he standard deviation, 
the intra -class correlation coefficient, 95% CIs,  standard errors (SE), and statistical hypothesis tests.   The 
estimates of means will be used to compute summary criteria such as area under the curve (AUC) for each 
regimen.   All esti mates reported will be presented their 95% CIs.  
 
All endpoints will be evaluated as fits the data set with graphical figures such as scatter plots, box -and-
whisker plots, and frequency histograms to visualize the distribution of these outcomes and their 
relationships to covariates and treatment assignment. When appropriate descriptive graphi cal and tab ular 
methods  will also be estimated and presented in a graphical figure.  
 
6.2.1  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
The following patient data will be recorded: age, gender, height, weight, date of admission, date of disc harge , 
laterality , surgical approach, implants used, du ration of surgery, contamination , ASA, comorbidities 
(smok ing, cardiac history, diabetes etc.), CBC ( WBC, PCV, HGB, RBC, indices, p latelet count, differential), and 
medications.  All of this information will be accessible in the patient’s medical record.  
 
6.3 Sample Size  
184 subjects will be enrolled  
6.4 Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
We will utilize randomization.com  to generate a randomization assignment for all [ADDRESS_123436] pre -operatively by [CONTACT_110818].  
6.5 Breaking the Study Blind/Participant Code  
If there is any adverse event  related to the drug , we will br eak the blind for the subject and randomization  
will be disclosed to the patient . 
7 Assessment of Safety  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.   Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.   
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
  Page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_110810]: 28 APR 2017  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
 
7.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.   A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110798].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet a ny of the criteria for serious will  be regarded as non -serious adverse 
events .  
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1  Severity of Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
 
1. Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
2. Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with func tioning.  
3. Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
 
7.2.2  Relationship to Study Agent  
The clinician’s assessm ent of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observ ation is an AE, th e event will  be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study agent assessed. For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the 
participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical ju dgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
1. Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, includin g an abnormal laboratory test result, 
occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_64716].  
2. Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors 
is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable 
  Page 17 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_110810]: 28 APR 2017  
time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent  disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal ).  
3. Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors ma y have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to “proba bly related” or  “defin itely related,” as appropriate.  
4. Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the  event did no t occur 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  participant’s clinical 
condition,  other concomitant treatments).  
5. Not Relat ed – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence  exists 
that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy 
documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
[CONTACT_110821]  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study agent.  
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. Al l AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate 
RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequ ate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will b e recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. AEs characteri zed as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46183] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   
 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject 
is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.   At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
will instruct each subject to re port any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal 
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   The investigator will notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time aft er a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.   The sponsor will also be 
notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in 
a subsequent ly conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.

7.4 Safety Oversight   
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.   This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan . Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
8 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.   Sourc e data are contained in source 
documents.   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing

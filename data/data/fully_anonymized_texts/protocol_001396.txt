SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  Evaluating the Use of Preemptive Pharmacogenomic Testing to 
Personalize  Supportive Oncology  
STUDY POPULATION  Adult cancer patient s ≥ 18 y /o presenting with  moderate to high pain (≥ 
4/10) and /or depression (≥3/[ADDRESS_1111113] depression  medications ) on the Edmonton 
Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) during the initial  consultation  or a 
follow -up visit that occurs more than [ADDRESS_1111114] visit  in the 
palliative medicine clinic,  able and willing to sign informed consent, and 
able to provide a buccal sample  for pharmacogenetic testing .  
SUMMARY OF STUDY 
RATIONALE  Over 90% of cancer patients  experience cancer - or treatment -related 
symptoms,  including pain and depression. A t least 50% have uncontrolled 
symptoms throughout their lifetime. This significantly impacts patients ’ 
quality of life, response to  therapy, and potentially survival. Many 
medications used to treat these symptoms are plagued with a system of 
trial and error, with prolonged time to symptom control or improvement. 
Objective tools are needed to improve drug selection and reduce symptom 
burden. Pharmaco genetics  (PGx) allows for personalized medical 
decisions based on patient -specific genetic s and provides a unique 
opportunity to reduce arbitrary drug  selection and improve personalized 
prescribing , especially for pain and depression medications . By [CONTACT_804873] a PGx test to alter drug prescribing patterns and 
improve treatment outcomes in supportive oncology , these results will 
provide critical information to understand  the feasibility and utility of 
performing preemptive, real -time PGx testing. We believe this study will 
help shift supportive care prescribing paradigms from a trial-and-error 
approach to a personalized, genomics -driven method. Ultimately, using 
PGx to optimize medication selection and control cancer -related 
sympto ms may improve quality of life throughout the cancer care 
continuum, potentially extending overall survival.  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a prospective clinical trial of adult cancer patients presenting with 
pain and depression, newly referred to the Department of Supportive 
Oncology ’s palliative medicine clinic  (or previously established patients 
without a visit in the past year) and receiving PGx testing for genes 
related to supportive care prior to their Baseline study  visit. Patients will 
be screened and identified for eligibility after their initial consultation in 
palliative medicine. If meeting the ESAS score cutoffs for pain a nd 
depression and meeting all other eligibility criteria, patients will be 
approached for consent and undergo buccal swabs collection  after 
informed consent is obtained . Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_804843] [ADDRESS_1111115] ’s medical chart. A consultation note will  also 
be placed in each subject ’s chart detailing the pharmacogenomics results.  
Supportive Oncology clinicians will be instructed to consult a pharmacist  
to evaluate PGx test results prior to prescribing supportive care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , 
especially pain and depression medications . The number of consults and 
recommendations will be documented, in addition to test results, 
demographic data, medical/medication history, ESAS symptom scores, 
PHQ9 depression scores, and side effects of supportive therapy. The 
Protocol: LCI-SUPP -NOS -PGx-001

 number of ambulatory clinic visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804844]. Subjects  will complete a short 
survey at the end of the study period regarding their knowledge about 
PGx, and whether access to PGx information improves satisfaction with 
care and communication.  
OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective:   
•  To estimate the proportions of subjects undergoing PGx testing 
who receive at least one drug/dose selection or modification based 
on their test results within any of the study visits where PGx 
results are available . 
•  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To determine the impact of PGx on treatment outcomes by 
[CONTACT_804874] (ESAS) ( Appendix  A) and depression scores using the 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9 ( Appendix B) at study visits 
after the Baseline study visit. Symptom scores will also be 
compared between those receiving PGx testing and a matched 
control receiving clinical management alone.  
• To describe subject perspectives ( Appendix C ) of PGx testing 
using a survey administered to subjects after/at the Final visit (or 
sooner if withdrawn).  
•  
Exploratory objectives:  
•  To determine the types & frequencies of actionable genotypes that 
result in drug/dose selection or modification(s) and those that do 
not result in drug/dose selection or modification(s).  
• To describe the types of new medications prescribed (using 
medications of interest list; Appendix D ) or medication/dose 
adjustments based on the PGx results.  
• To determine the type & frequency of drug/gene interactions 
present at the Baseline and the Final study visit using CPIC 
guidelines and FDA’s pharmacogenomics table.  
• Summarize PGx best practice advisory alerts among participants 
enrolled after the transition to Epic to describe the proportion of 
participants that had a BPA fire in the EMR, the number and type 
of BPAs per participant, and any actions taken from the BPA.  
KEY INCLUSION 
CRITERIA  • Adult cancer patient s ≥ [ADDRESS_1111116] had either an 
initial visit in  the Department of Supportive Oncology ’s palliative 
medicine clinic  or a re-establishment of care visit with the last 
visit being at least 1 year prior , able and willing to sign  the 
informed consent  and provide a buccal sample for PGx testing . 
• Hematologic malignancy or any stage solid tumor malignancy . 
Presenting with pain score ≥ 4/10 and /or depression score ≥ 3/10 
on ESAS  (or patients diagnosed with depression with a clinical 
need to adjust depression  medications ) 
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
 The evaluable population for the primary objective is defined as enrolled  
subjects with confirmed malignancy (per provider documentation ) 
completing an on-study visit  with PGx results available . We anticipate 
enrolling 80 eligible subjects, of which we estimate 65 will be evaluable.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
 
Early palliative care after diagnosis with incurable cancer improves quality of life (QOL) 
and may prolong overall survival [1 -7]. However, there is large inter -individual variability 
in response to supportive care  medication s, such as those for pain and depression  [6,8]. 
Pain affects more than 75% of cancer patients with advanced disease . Less than one -third 
of all patients achieve pain improvement with conventional strategies  within one month of 
presentation  [9]. Depression affects about one -third of canc er patients and has been linked 
to poorer prognosis and survival [1 0-13]. Pain, depression, and fatigue often coexist as a 
symptom cluster in cancer patients [14,15]. The combined effects of pain and depression is 
a significant public health crisis, particularly in the era of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817]. Patients 
with moderate to severe depression are more than twice as likely to misuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_804845]-pain symptoms compared to non -depressed patients [16]. Improper  opi[INVESTIGATOR_804846] (CDC) to issue guidelin es for 
improving prescribing  to mitigate abuse and addiction concerns  [17]. Suboptimal 
management of cancer -related symptoms like pain and depression compromises potential 
cancer therapy benefits, disrupts clinic workflow, increases emergency room visits, and 
impacts patient satisfaction [1 8]. 
 
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) – the impact of genetic variation on drug response – is well 
document ed [1 9] and can significantly impact re sponse to supportive therapy , especially 
pain and depression medications  [18,20]. Data suggests >90% of individuals carry a PGx 
variant c ontributing to drug response [ 21]. As this data grows along with more affordable 
analytic technology, it will soon be standard of care to perform routine PGx testing prior to 
treatment. The truest value of this data can only be fully realized when it is implemented 
preemptively into the routine workflow and embedded within care pathways, as d iscussed 
in previous reviews [ 21,22]. The Clinical Pharmacoge netics Implementation Consortium 
(CPIC) has thus far published approximately [ADDRESS_1111120] apply PGx to guide therapy (at  least a dozen of which are related to supportive 
care medications ) [23]; however, there is also an emerging level of relevant genes not 
currently covered by [CONTACT_44097]. Effective integration of PGx -guided treatment 
pathways can help personalize medication sel ection in supportive oncology [1 8,20] and 
help determine the magnitude of drug -drug and drug -drug-gene interactions [ 24]. Several 
genes have been implicated with response to supportive care  medications  (Table 1).

 Table 1. Summary of potential drug-gene interactions  
 
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_804847]: CYP2D6 activates codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone to 
stronger opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]: morphine, o -desmethyltramadol, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone, 
respectively. CYP2D6 polymorphisms can significant ly alter opi[INVESTIGATOR_804848] [25 ]. 
For example, codeine -related deaths reported in ultra -rapid metabolizers (UMs) resulted in 
a black -box warning recommending against its us e [26 -32]. Alternatively, poor 
metabolizers (PMs) may have ineffective analgesia due to impaired activation to morphine. 
Similar mechanisms are noted with tramadol , oxycodone, and hydrocodone [33 -37]. CPIC 
recommends CYP2D6 UMs and PMs avoid codeine, tramadol, oxycodone and 
hydrocodone due to increased toxicity or lac k of anal gesia, respectively [38 ]. A base -pair 
substitution in the gene coding the mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736], OPRM1, can result in 60% –100% 
more morphine required for equal analgesia [3 9-41]. Analgesia can also be enhanced by 
[CONTACT_804875], which are metabolized by [CONTACT_804876]. A base -pair 
substitution in COMT reduces enzyme activity by [ADDRESS_1111121] doubling of the dose 
[39,42,43 ]. 
 
Antidepressant PGx: CYP2C19 metabolizes and inactivates citalopram, escitalopram, and 
sertraline. CYP2C19 PMs have increased toxicity risk with these medication s, including 
QT prolongation [44,45 ]. Alternatively, UMs have lower plasma concentrations and 
increased risk of not responding [4 6]. CPIC recommends a 50% dose reduction in 
citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline for CYP2C19 PMs an d avoiding the drugs in UMs 
[47]. Paroxetine is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6; thus, PMs are at increased risk of 
adverse effects, p articularly gastrointestinal [48,49 ], while UMs are a t risk of poor drug 
response [50 ]. CPIC recommends avoiding paroxetin e in CYP2D6 UMs and PMs [47 ]. 
Fluoxetine is metabolized by [CONTACT_097] 2D6 and CYP2C19, thus similar mechanisms can 
influence drug response. Vortioxetine is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 and the FDA 
label recommends a maxi mum dose of 10 mg/day in PMs [51 ]. Polymorphisms in the 
serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4, and/or serotonin receptor gene, HTR2A, may result 
in reduced response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Randomized trials have Gene  Polymorphism(s)/variant(s)  Supportive care medications potentially affected

Version v7.0 02/20/[ADDRESS_1111122] ion [52 -54] and tools 
have been developed to assist with PGx -based antidepressant prescribing [55,56 ]. 
 
PGx tests are now commercially available; however, due to their novelty, healthcare 
payors are reluctant to reimburse preemptive PGx screening and mandate further proof -of-
concept and efficacy trials before coverage. Nonetheless, preemptive PGx testing inc reases 
the value proposition and prior studies suggest improved medication adherence and cost 
savings with PGx [57,58 ].  Further, many of the genes discussed earlier can affect non -
oncology or non-supportive  oncology medications that may be prescribed by o ther 
providers within the same health system (e.g. , clopi[INVESTIGATOR_804851]2C19). PGx results 
may be informative for management of other medications. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_804852], there is little data on the practicality of using 
PGx to improve supportive cancer care.  
 
The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) ( Appendix  A) is a validated 10-item 
questionnaire assessing self -reported perceptions of pain, fatigue/energy, nausea, 
depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing, and shortness of breath. Each item is 
ranked from [ADDRESS_1111123] symptom. ESAS is rout inely 
performed during all palliative medicine clinic visits. ESAS can be used to identify cancer 
patients presenting to palliative medicine with uncontrolled symptoms  and can also be  
used to track symptom improvement or progression over time.   
 
In a prior analysis  we identified 46% of cancer patients at Levine Cancer Institute were 
prescribed a supportive  care medication within 90 days of intake  to the cancer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , 
mainly for pain (69%) and/or nausea (46%). Of these, 86% received at least  one supportive 
care medication with PGx evidence and 84% received a CYP2D6 -metabolized drug. Based  
on reported CYP2D6 allele frequencies conferring altered metabolism, 650 (20%) were 
expected to have altered  drug response, suggesting preemptive PGx testing ma y have 
broad applicability in this population . PGx testing in this high-risk population may 
improve medication management and symptom control.  
 
1.2 Study Rationale and Study Design  
 
Over 90% of cancer patients  experience cancer - or treatment -related symptoms, and at 
least 50% have uncontrolled sympto ms throughout their lifetime . This significantly 
impacts patients’  QOL, response to therapy, and potentially survival. Thus, guidelines 
recommend early palliative intervention for all cancer patients with advanced disease ; 
however, many medications used to treat these symptoms are plagued with a system of 
trial and error, with prolonged time to symptom control or improvement.  
 
Objective tools are needed to improve drug selection and reduce symptom burden. PGx 
allows for personalized medical decisions based on patient -specific genetic s and provides a 
unique opportunity to reduce arbitrary drug selection and improve personalized 
prescribing. By [CONTACT_804877] a PGx test to alter drug prescribing patterns for 
pain and depression and improve treatment outcomes in supportive cancer care, these 
results will provide critical information to understand the feasibility and uti lity of

11 
 performing preemptive, real -time PGx testing in a busy, outpatient clinic.  This study will 
help shift supportive care prescribing paradigms from a trial -and-error approach to a 
personalized, genomics -driven method. Ultimately, using PGx to optimize medication 
selection and control cancer -related symptoms may improve QOL , as measured by 
[CONTACT_804878],  throughout the cancer care continuum, potentially extending 
overall survival.  
 
We propose a prospective clinical trial of adult cancer patients at Levine Cancer Institute 
presenting to the Department of Supportive Oncology’s palliative medicine clinic with 
moderate to  high pain and depression  (screened using ESAS at initial  palliative medicine 
visit). Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_804853]. A PGx specialist will 
provide detailed clinical interpretations to the palliative medicine clinic and upload a copy  
of the results as well as a clinic note  into the subject’s  medical chart. Each subject  will also 
be counseled on their test results. A note will be placed in each subject ’s chart alerting the 
provider that the subject  is on study and should be referred for pharmacy consul tation to 
evaluate PGx test results prior to prescribing supportive therapy  during the study period . 
The number of pharmacy consults for subject s undergoing PGx testing, type of medication 
recommendations, actionable genotypes, and rate of acceptance by [CONTACT_804879] . Other data elements to be collected include all PGx test results, demographic 
data, medical/medication history, ESAS  (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System)  
symptom scores, and PHQ9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) scores . The num ber and 
duration of emergency department  visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804854]. Subject s will complete a short survey at the end of the 
study period  (from enrollment  [day of the buccal swab] to the Final visit) regarding their 
knowledge about PGx, and whether access to PGx information improves satisfaction with 
care and communication.

Accrual is expected to be 80 eligible  subjects. All patient s will complete ESAS  during a 
regularly scheduled visit to  the Department of Supportive Oncology’s palliative medicine 
clinic  (Palliative medicine clinic) .  Potential candidates will be identified by [CONTACT_804882] ≥ 4/10 and/or depression  ≥ 3/10 (or 
diagnosed with depression with a clinical need to adjust depression  medications ).  
 
It is expected that [ADDRESS_1111126] meet all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health 
information   
2. Completion of ESAS at initial palliative medicine clinic visit , presenting with 
moderate to high pain (≥ 4/10) and /or depression (≥ 3/10) or diagnosed with 
depression with a clinical need to adjust depression  medications identified by [CONTACT_172336] . 
3. New patients ≥  [ADDRESS_1111127] had  either  an initial visit in the Department 
of Supportive Oncology’s palliative medicine clinic  or a re -establishment of care visit 
with the last visit being at least [ADDRESS_1111128]  one additional palliative medicine clinic visit per protocol.  
5. Able to provide a buccal sample for PGx testing  
3.3 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:  
  
1. Psychiatric illness , social situations, or active/re cent (within 30  days) history of illicit 
substance ( e.g., cocaine, heroin)  abuse that would limit compliance with study

Protocol: LCI-SUPP -NOS -PGx-001 
Version v7.0 02/20/[ADDRESS_1111129] Withdrawal  
 
Subjects MAY be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• More than  8 weeks  pass between the completion of  ESAS  and the Baseline  study visit. 
• Subject withdraws consent from study procedures. A subject will be removed from the 
trial at his/her own request. At any time during and without giving reasons, a subject may 
decline to participate further. The subject will not suffer any disadvantages as a result.  
• If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], compliance with study procedures is compromised and 
affects the integrity of the trial.  
• Death . 
 
Subjects MAY be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• The s ubject is unable to undergo one or more study visits .  
• Use, or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_804855], of illicit drugs or substances  (i.e., positive urine drug screening)  
that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], have a reasonable chance of contributing to 
medication non -compliance  
• Develop ing a concurrent illness or situation that would, in the  Investigator ’s judgment, 
significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints . 
• DNA from buccal swabs is not viable , and the laboratory cannot perform PGx testing . 
Subjects may be asked to provide additional swabs  if recollection performed no later than 
one week prior to the Baseline study visit . 
 
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision per standard of care 
procedures until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable.  
3.[ADDRESS_1111130] who, for any reason ( e.g., failure to satisfy the eligibility criteria  or withdraws 
consent ), terminates his/her study participation before being enrolled to the study is regarded as a 
screen failure. All screen failures will be tracked . Reasons for screen failure (e.g., specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  not met ) will be recorded in the CTMS/Subject Console.  
4. REGISTRATION   
4.1 Sequence  Number Assignment  
Following informed consent, subjects will be registered by [CONTACT_804883] a Sequence  Number.  
 
The study intervention  (PGx testing)  is not blinded to the subject or the Investigator.  
5. STUDY  PLAN  
 
The study design is a prospectiv e interventional clinical trial designed to investigate the 
application of PGx testing to personalize  cancer symptom management , particularly pain and 
depression.

Potential candidates will be presented with consent ; screening data for these patients, including 
ESAS symptom scores , will be captured and used for analysis ( Section 11.4.5 ). A full waiver of 
consent and  HIPAA  for data collection will be requested for the control cohort , which includes 
patients (with p ain ≥ 4/10  and/or depression ≥3/[ADDRESS_1111131] not  been  presented with consent 
and who were  presented with consent but decline participation in the study (i.e., do not consent). 
Study subjects who consent and subsequently screen fail for any reason will  also be included in 
the control cohort. Patient s who agree will  undergo the informed consent process , and subjects 
who consent  will be screened for eligibility . Those meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled 
and undergo buccal swab collection.  Enrollment day  will be considered at the buccal swabs 
collection day .  If the collected buccal swabs do not contain enough viable DNA for PGx 
testing , subjects may be asked to provide additional swabs. No less than [ADDRESS_1111132] ESAS completion and the date of the Baseline study 
visit. The Baseline study  visit may be completed  during a  clinic  visit (in person or virtually)  or 
over the phone . It is estimated that PGx results  will be available within  five business days of 
swab  receipt  by [CONTACT_25699] , and a detailed report will be sent to the clinic. A copy of the test 
results  in PDF (Portable Document Format) format  and PGx consultation note will be uploaded 
to the subject ’s medical chart. Apart from the availability and use of PGx test results to guide 
pharmacotherapy, subjects will receive standard of care treatment and undergo ESAS screenin g 
during the palliative medicine visit s. PHQ9  will be collected  by [CONTACT_804884], 
during the study  visit by [CONTACT_29160] , or by [CONTACT_648] . Data , including symptom scores and medications,  at 
each visit , will be captured until the Final study  visit. Subjects  will be asked to complete a short 
survey within 30 days afte r the Final study visit to assess their perspectives on PGx testing  and 
the care they received  (administered preferably electronically, alternatively via paper during the 
Final visit at a clinic  or over the phone) .  
Subjects presenting with depression score 3 or greater and/or experiencing depressive symptoms 
during the clinical trial are highly encouraged to receive treatment in the LCI psycho -oncology 
clinic.  
Subjects  will be offered  the option to complete study visits  during  a clinic visit  (in-person or 
virtually)  or over the phone . 
Subjects will not be reimbursed for study participation; however, they will receive PGx testing at 
no cost and will receive a full copy  of their test result s at their request .   
5.1 Study Intervention  and Pharmacogenomics Testing  
• After obtaining the informed  consent, t wo buccal swabs will be collected  at least one 
week prior to the Baseline study visit  (the next  palliative medicine visit after informed 
consent ). Buccal swabs may be collected by [CONTACT_804885].  
• Buccal swabs  will be transferred to the Levine Cancer Institute’s Molecular Biology 
Laboratory on the same or following day of collection  for DNA extraction and  
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Subjects who collect samples at home will be instructed to collect and ship 
overnight only on Monday through Thursday ( samples should not arrive at the lab on the  
weekend or on holiday).  
• Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_804856].   
• Raw data will feed into an online HIPAA compliant web portal for translation of results 
into genotype -phenotype data. Each test result will be reviewed by [CONTACT_804886]: LCI-SUPP -NOS -PGx-001 
Version v7.0 02/20/2024  
 
16 
 results and quality control. The lab oratory  director and/or Sponsor -Investigator  (S-I) or 
sub-investigator if S-I is not available will approve final genotype calls.  
• Pharmacists  will interpret genotype and phenotype results and translate PGx results into  
actionable prescribing decisions. Guidelines, including CPIC  (https://cpi[INVESTIGATOR_804857].org/ ) and 
FDA ( https://www.fda.gov/medical -devices/precision -medicine/table -pharmacogenetic -
associations ), and clinical  judgment will be used to make  medication  recommendations. 
A test report will be developed for each subject . The pharmacist  will send a copy of the 
report to the referring provider  and upload a copy into the medical chart  along with a PGx 
consultation note.  
• Subject s will continue  to receive supportive care and undergo scheduled study  visits 
throughout the study. Changes to medications can be made during schedule d study  visits, 
on-call visits, or virtually over the phone to mimic standard practice. Providers will be 
encouraged to refer a ll study subjects  requiring pharmacologic intervention  for pharmacy 
consultation to  evaluate PGx results prior to drug prescribing . However, this is not 
protocol -mandated, and a deviation will not occur if a provider modifies treatment 
regimens without consulting the pharmacist. The number of pharmacy consults , types of 
medication recommendations , actionable genotypes, and acceptance rate by [CONTACT_804887]. Data will be collected up to the completion of the Final visit.  
5.1.1 Schedule of Clinic Assessments  
Every  visit can occur  during a clinic visit  (in-person  or utilizing virtual care ) or over the phone . 
A subject can be assessed by a trained and delegated Palliative care provider, PharmD, study 
coordinator, or RN : 
• Baseline (day 0) study visit  should be no earlier than [ADDRESS_1111133] ESAS completion . 
• A total of 3 subsequent  study  visits and the Final visit  will occur  every 4 weeks (± 1 
weeks)  after the Baseline visit . Additional ly, non -protocol -directed  visits may occur on an 
as-needed basis (e.g. , an emergency due to uncontrolled symptoms).   
 
5.1.2 Symptom Assessment Tools  
• ESAS  (Appendix A) is a 10 -item questionnaire assessing self -reported perceptions of 
pain, fatigue/energy, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing, and 
shortness of breath. Each item is ranked from [ADDRESS_1111134] 
symptom.  ESAS is routinely performed during all palliative medicine clinic visits.  
 
• PHQ9  (Appendix  B) is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, 
and measuring the severity of depression. PHQ9 incorporates depression diagnostic 
criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self -report tool.  PHQ9 
scores of 0 -4 indicate normal or no depression, 5 -9 mild, 10 -14 moderate, 15 -19 
moderately severe, an d 20-27 severe depression.  PHQ9 will be collected for this study, 
preferably electronically, within 2 business days prior to the study visit or by [CONTACT_804888] 2 business days prior to the study visit.  Alternatively, PHQ9  can be collected 
during a cl inic visit on paper.  
 
Protocol: LCI-SUPP -NOS -PGx-001 
Version v7.0 02/20/[ADDRESS_1111135]  Survey  (Appendix C) 
The patient survey is intended to assess the subject ’s perspective of pharmacogenomics testing. 
The survey will be administered preferably electronically , alternatively over the phone  or on 
paper during a clinic  visit at the Final visit time -point  or sooner if withdrawn . 
  
If data from ESAS, PHQ9 questionnaires , and Subject survey are missing, when possible, the 
reason for the missing data will be categorized and documented as follows:  
• the subject felt too ill;  
• clinician or nurse felt the subject was too ill;  
• the subject felt it was inconvenient or took too much time;  
• the subject felt it was a violation of privacy;  
• the subject didn't understand the actual language  or was  illiterate;  
• administrative failure to distribute the questionnaire;  
• other, specify;  
• unknown .

13HCRU (defined as any encounter classified as an outpatient (OP), inpatient (IP), or emergency department (ED) encounter) occu rring during the study period will be collected by a research designee. Each 
encounter will be counted as unique per classification . IP encounters that result from an emergency department presentation will be classified as both an ED encounter and IP encou nter. Any encounter lasting 
longer than 24 hours will be considered an IP encounter. Insurance status and/or type and reason for presentation at each encounter will also be collected.  
14Survey will be preferably administered electronically (distributed to the subject`s email within 30 days after the Final visi t). Alternatively, a research designee can collect a survey via paper during the Final 
visit at the clinic (or sooner if withdrawn)  or over the phone as an option.

results may result in emotional distress; however, the American College of Medical Genetics 
have identified pharmacogenes as “low risk” as they are not related to hereditary disease 
conditions, but rather how a person may m etabolize or process various medications.  There is a 
low likelihood of emotional distress caused by [CONTACT_804897].  All subjects will 
be counseled on their test results by a trained pharmacist.  
 
10.2 Unanticipated Problems (UAP)  
10.2.1  Definition  
A UAP is any incidence, experience or outcome that is unexpected  (e.g.,  a lost or stolen laptop 
computer that contains sensitive study information) given the information provided in research -
related documentation (e.g ., informed consent) and the study population characteristics , that is 
related or possibly related to participation in the research study and places the participant at an 
increased risk .

Protocol: LCI-SUPP -NOS -PGx-001 
Version v7.0 02/20/[ADDRESS_1111150] been identified (Section 
11.3). 
 
We anticipate enrolling 80 eligible subjects, of which we estimate 65 will be evaluable (defined 
in 11.3). With this sample size, the width of the 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence interval will be 
≤25%, regardless of the observed DDSM rate.  
11.3 Analysis Populations  
Analyses of the primary objective s and secondary objectives concerning counts of PGx -guided 
drug/dose selections or modifications based on their test results will be conducted on the 
evaluable population, defined as the population  of enrolled subjects with confirmed malignancy 
(per provider documentation) and completing  at least one study visit  where PGx results are 
available (including the baseline visit) . 
 
Analyses of secondary object ives concerning the impact of PGx on pain and depression scores 
will be conducted on the primary evaluable population with valid pain and/or depression scores 
for at least one post-Baseline Study visit.    
 
Analys es of secondary objectives concerning health care utilizations, costs, and subject  survey  
responses  and all exploratory objectives will be conducted on all enrolled subjects.  
11.[ADDRESS_1111151] demographics will be completed . 
11.4.4  Primary Analysis  
The proportion  (the denominator being  the number of evaluable subjects ) of evaluable subjects 
undergoing PGx testing and receiv ing at least one  drug/dose selection/modification based on 
their test results  at any study visit  where PGx results are available  will be calculated , alongside 
95% Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals .

Version v7.0 02/20/2024  
 
15 
 11.4.5  Secondary Analysis  
 
Total counts and descriptive statistics of the number of drug/dose selection/modification s made 
due to subject PGx test results at all visits where PGx results are available will be summarized . 
 
A single -arm analysis for the PGx cohort will be performed: Descriptive statistics of ESAS pain 
scores and PHQ -[ADDRESS_1111152].   
 
The following analysis will be performed for both the PGx and control cohort s:  
 
A matched analysis for ESAS pain and depression  scores will be carried out , comparing the 
study cohort to a matched cohort of  unique patients  receiving clinical management alone 
during the same time period the trial is enrolling. Standard -of-care patients with ESAS pain 
≥4 and/or depression scores ≥ [ADDRESS_1111153] 1 year prior —these visits 
occurring within the same time period the trial is enrolling —will be identified  and 
considered  in the matched analysis . 
 
Enrolled subjects will be matched to a similar case in cohort by:  
• ESAS pain and depression symptom  score s at first visit to  palliative medicine clinic (i.e., 
study screening for study cohort)  
• Age 
• Sex 
• Race  
• Clinic visit schedule.  
 
Between -group comparisons of those study subjects and control patients  will be  performed 
estimating r epeated -measures linear mixed models for pain and depression, separately, to 
estimate the effect of PGx testing (i.e., treatment effect) on symptom scores  adjusted for 
baseline clinicodemographic characteristics , a main effect for treatment, for time, an effect 
for treatment by [CONTACT_6491],  and a random effect for subject.  
 
Additionally, the average post-baseline symptom score  will be calculated for each individual  
(separately for pain and  depression). The distributions of the average post -baseline symptom 
scores will be compared between the cohorts using analysis of variance techniques with 
adjustments for clinicodem ographic characterist ics.

 Health care utilization (e.g., instances of participant presenting at an emergency department, 
admitted as an inpatient, any outpatient encounter , or medication prescription ) and reason for 
encounter will be assessed during the study per iod (starting on the Baseline to the Final study 
visit)  for those undergoing PGx testing . HCRU in year prior to start of study  enrollment  will be 
collected for patients from institutional enterprise data warehouse  (EDW) via raw billing and 
medical record data . Insurance status and/or type at each encounter will also be collected.  An 
encounter resulting from another (e.g., ED presentation leading to IP) will be counted separately. 
Any ED encounter lasting longer than [ADDRESS_1111154] 6 
months followin g study closure to allow for final bills to accrue for HCRU encounters , for those 
that underwent PGx testing and matched controls . Diagnosis and procedure codes used in billing 
for each encounter will be used to estimate  institutional costs  or reimbursement  and/or to 
publicly available sources (e.g., CMS fee schedule)  and to obtain patient’s historical prescription 
drugs . Endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_804898] -level and patient -level data files  for 
frequency of HCRU and descriptive analysis of associated cost. Once data files have been 
constructed, data will be fit to appropriate  statistical analyses and multivariate regression will be 
employed to interrogate the relationship between costs, resource utilization PGx results, 
sociodemographi c, and clinical patient characteristics. Sensitivity a nd scenario a nalyses will be 
conducted to assess the robustness of model estimates.  
 
Subject  responses to survey tool administered at the  Final visit (or sooner if withdrawn) will be 
summarized and described. Regression models may be estimated to describe the association of 
response and responder characteristic, both univariately and multivariately, adjusted for relevant 
baseline characteristics.   
 
11.4.6  Exploratory Analysis  
• Frequencies of actionable genotypes that guide drug/dose selection or modification 
will be summarized and described  alongside types of mutations/phenotypes  for each of 
the test genotypes . 
• New medications prescribed and medication/dose adjustments based on PGx results 
will be summarized and described by [CONTACT_804899]/adjustments, respectively.

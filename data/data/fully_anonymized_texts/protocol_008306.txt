1.1 Purpose:  
SCI is associated with severe neuropathic pain that is often refractory to all 
pharmacological intervention. Our preliminary data suggest brivaracetam is a mechanism- based pharmacological intervention for neuropathic pain in SCI. In 
this project we will conduct a randomized, placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_595089] a [ADDRESS_785613].  
 
Specific Aims:  
1. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether a 3 -month course of daily brivaracetam is 
safe and effective at reducing severe below- level neuropathic pain after SCI.  
2. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether a 3 -month course of daily brivaracetam 
decreases periaqueductal gray activity in SCI.  
3. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether baseline microRNA levels are associated with response to brivaracetam treatment.  
 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for severe neuropathic 
pain in SCI. Identification of an oral medication that is effective, safe, and well 
tolerated would represent a major  improvement in the clinical approach to 
neuropathic pain in SCI. Additionally, there are no validated predictive biomarkers of response to pharmacological therapy in neuropathic pain after SCI. This work is innovative as it seeks to develop a new, mechanis m-based 
pharmacological intervention for neuropathic pain in SCI. Additionally, this project seeks to identify novel biomarkers of neuropathic pain and response to 
therapy. Development of a  reliable, easy to measure biomarker that  
distinguishes responders from non- responders would dramatically improve 
clinical care for this condition. Successful completion of this work will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_595090].

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  2.2 Preliminary Data:  
SCI is  associated with a high prevalence of severe below- level neuropathic pain 
that is often refractory to therapeutic interventions. Our preliminary work 
demonstrates overexpression of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in 
electrically hyperactive substant ia gelatinosa surgical samples in patients with 
neuropathic pain. The  FDA-approved antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_595091]2A protein with greater binding affinity than other drugs targeting 
SV2A. We have used brivaracetam off -label for compassionate reasons in severe, 
refractory neuropathic pain with sustained pain relief. We have identified multiple brain networks altered in SCI and modulated by [CONTACT_595143]. Neuropathic pain also increases local brain activity of the periaqueductal  gray. 
miR-[ADDRESS_785614] that reduced levels of miR -485 may contribute to 
the pathophysiology of SCI -induced neuropathic pain by [CONTACT_595144]2A and neural network activity in noci oceptive neurons. Collectively, these 
findings provide the scientific rationale for the following hypotheses to be tested 
in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833]: compared to placebo, treatment with brivaracetam 
reduces severe below -level SCI neuropathic pain  with co rresponding reduction in 
periaqueductal gray brain activity by [CONTACT_595145] (Aim 1). We also hypothesize that either periaqueductal gray brain activity or circulating miRNA -485 may be 
candidate predictive biomarkers of response to brivaracetam therapy. 
Collectiv ely, the results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595092].  
 
We performed extensive proteomic analyses of electrically hyperactive and normal substantia gelatinosa surgical samples using the SOMAscan platform [Shi et al., 2019]. These spi[INVESTIGATOR_595093] -level neuropathic pain refractory to all pharmacological 
management, including Lyrica, Neurontin, and Oxycontin. Proteomic analyses of over 4000 proteins yielded 12 proteins substantially overexpressed in the electrically hyperactive tissue relative to the normal tissue, 5 of these 12 
proteins markedly so. One of the 5 proteins found to be markedly overexpressed 
is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). This protein has  been implicated in 
models of both partial and generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and the drug brivaracetam (Briviact), which targets and binds SV2A, is used as an FDA approved drug to treat partial -onset seizures. Brivaracetam’s effectiveness at treating  epi[INVESTIGATOR_595094]2A binding and the binding affinity

Clinical Success with Off -label treatment of SCI Neuropathic Pain with Brivaracetam. 
Because epi[INVESTIGATOR_44445] -like neuronal hyperactivity and elevated SV2A expression is 
identified in the hyperactive substantia gelatinosa  of our SCI patients with below- level 
neuropathic pain, we elected to treat 2 such patients with brivaracetam for compassionate reasons  who had severe pain refractory to all medications, including  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (e.g. Oxycontin), neuroleptics (e.g. Lyrica, Neurontin), and antidepressant medications (e.g. Cymbalta). These 2  patients were not candidates for our specialized 
pain surgery because of the risk surgery  posed to neurologic function, although they did 
meet typi[INVESTIGATOR_595095]. Both patients  experienced sustained reduction in pain 
intensity. Patient 1 experienced a 40% (2 point) reduction in average pain intensity and Patient 2 experienced a 66% (6 point) reduction in average pain intensity (fi gure). This 
clinical success provides the scientific rationale for the dosing and treatment duration to be tested in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833].  
Resting State Brain Functional Connectivity and Neuropathic Pain. In our ongoing SCI 
studies, we observe that participants display a wide range of pain levels. As hypothesis -
generating preliminary data for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we evaluated how variations in 
neuropathic pain levels impact resting state functional connectivity after SCI. We 
studied 29 participants with chronic SCI (level C6 or lower) and 11 healthy control participants  using 3T MR imaging. A high resolution structural (MPRAGE) dataset and 
two se ts of 6 -minute resting state EPI [INVESTIGATOR_595096] (TR 3 sec) were collected in each 
participant. Prior to the neuroimaging session, participants rated their current pain 
levels on a 0 to 10 VAS scale. MRI data was analyzed using the SPM12 based Conn toolbox [Whitfield -Gabrieli and Nieto -Castanon, 2012] (Version 17f, Matlab R2018b). 
Preprocessing steps included realignment and  unwarpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], slice -timing correction, ART 
based identification of outlier scans for scrubbing, segmentation and normalization to MNI space, and 8 mm smoothing. Denoising steps included scrubbing, aCompCor, ICA -
based denoising, Global Regression, and 0.008 to 0.09 Hz band- pass filtering. Two main 
comparisons were evaluated: SCI participants versus uninjured  controls, and the effect 
of concurrent pain ratings on rsfMRI measures. First, we evaluated region- of-interest 
(ROI) based functional connectivity in a set of anatomically defined regions known to be 
impacted in SCI and neuropathic pain: the periaqueductal  gray, the bilateral thalamus, 
the amygdala, the hippocampus, the insula, anterior cingulate, the precentral and the 
post -central gyrus. Second, we evaluated, on a voxel -by-voxel basis, amplitude of low 
frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and intrinsic resting state functional connectivity. ALFF measu res the total power of the BOLD signal within the low- frequency range between 
0.01 and 0.1 Hz and is a measure of intensity of low frequency oscillations. Intrinsic resting state connectivity is a measure of how connected a voxel is to other voxels but 
does not provide information on the regions with which this voxel is connected.

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  SCI participants reported an average VAS pain of 3.0 (±2.5), ranging from 0 to 8, while 
uninjured control participants reported an average of 0.26 (±0.64), ranging from 0 to 2. The difference in pain ratings was significant (p=0.[ZIP_CODE]).  
When considering differences between SCI and uninjured controls, we found increased 
connectivity in the following networks: right amygdala to the left posterior temporal 
fusiform cortex (pFDR =0.032), left hippocampus to the right frontal pole (pFDR =0.036 ) 
the right occipi[INVESTIGATOR_595097] (pFDR =0.025), the right temporal occipi[INVESTIGATOR_548599] (pFDR =0.036), and the left cerebellum 6 (pFDR =0.036). We also found significantly increased regional brain activity (ALFF) in the paracingulate gyrus (pFDR=0. 004).  
When considering differences based on the presence of neuropathic pain, we found decreased connectivity in the following networks: right thalamus to the left frontal 
operculum, (pFDR=0.0002) and left amygdala to the vermis of the cerebellum (pFDR=0.0001). We found increased connectivity in the left amygdala to cerebellum 3 
(pFDR =0.0001).  
We considering pain rating as a continuous variable, we found a significant positive linear correlation between pain rating and intrinsic connectivity of the post- central 
gyrus in the somatosensory area of the torso and lower body (pFDR =0.003). We also found a significant positive linear correlation between pain rating and brain activity 
(ALFF) in the periaqueductal gray area (pFDR=0.0009) .  
These preliminary findings suggest that SCI disrupts multiple brain networks, along with significant alteration of resting state function of the paracingulate gyrus. Pain may 
modulate some of these properties, and notably disrupts local brain activity of the periaqueductal gray. The frequency band of ALFF alterations are similar to those of calcium channels and astrocytes, consistent with findings in post- traumatic neuralgia 
[Alshelh et al., 2016]. Further, the primary somatosensory region representing the lower 
torso displayed an increase in intrinsic connectivity in parallel with increased pain 
ratings. This may be consistent with phantom limb like pain, or an increased processing of denervated lower body sensations. Collectively, this work demonstrates fe asibility 
and our expertise with the proposed imaging methodology. ALFF has high test- retest 
reliability and is thus suitable for longitudinal evaluations [Zuo et al., 2010]. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that brivaracetam  treatment will normaliz e pain -related 
changes identified above, with ALFF of the periaqueductal gray being the primary 
outcome. Therefore, these findings provide the scientific rationale for the fMRI studies 
proposed in Aim 2.

hyperactive neuronal activity in the substantia gelati nosa (SG) corresponding to 
classical somatic dermatomal innervation of the regions of pain experienced. These regions of neuronal hyperactivity are believed to be mediated through 
classical pain pathways, e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_595098], to brain pain centers. Below -
level pains are believed to originate substantially from electrically hyperactive 
neurons in the substantia gelatinosa at the cord level of intermediolateral cell column end organ innervation of perceived pain regions, resulting in a novel somatotopic  map of SG below -level pain generators. It is believed that these 
regions of neuronal hyperactivity are mediated wholly or in part through sympathetic nervous system pathways to brain pain centers (J Neuros urgery 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 2002, 2018).  
 
Dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning is a surgical method performed only at our center involving operative neurophysiological targeting and ablation of regions of hyperactive substantia gelatinosa that has met with excellent success 
at relieving severe below -level pains refractory to all forms of pharmacological 
management (see appendix, J Neurosurgery Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 2002, 2018). With this surgical method, 85% of patients with severe below- level neuropathic pain refractory to 
all pharmacological management achiev e essentially 100% pain relief. It is 
because of this excellent surgical outcome that an IRB study was approved, allowing biopsy of regions of electrically hyperactive substantia gelatinosa and subsequent proteomic analysis, in patients with severe SCI bel ow-level 
neuropathic pain. Because regions of substantia gelatinosa with normal electrical activity are typi[INVESTIGATOR_595099], (these normal regions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_595100]), biopsies of these normal regions are able to be obtained for 
proteomic comparison.  
SCI-related Changes in Resting State Brain Connectivity. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) leads to

sensorimotor network is disrupted after SCI [Hou et al., 2014] and that the development of chronic pain has a physiologic basis in altered brain structure and function. Specifically, individuals with SCI display decreased inter- hemispheric functional 
connectivity between the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex, as well as increased 
intra -hemispheric functional connectivity within the motor network. Further, Nictora et 
al [Nicotra et al., 2006] found that people with SCI displayed enhanced responses within 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray during the processing of threat. 
After SCI, there are also rapid and extensive reductions in gray matter volume in the primary somatosensory cortex lower body, leg, and foot areas [Solstrand Dahlberg et al., 2018]. The degree of atrophy likely depends on the level and completeness of the lesion, the time since injury, and on the presence of pain, but there is disagr eement as 
to how these factors may interact. In a longitudinal study over the first [ADDRESS_785616] SCI, Freund et al. found gray matter volume reductions in the leg area of the primary motor cortex, but not the somatosensory cortex [Freund et al., 2013], a nd progressive 
reductions over time were observed in the thalamus, anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory cortex, insula and pons [Ziegler et al., 2018]. Such changes in volume related quantitatively to sensory deficits, but there were no correlations  between 
neuropathic pain and volumetric declines during the first year of injury. On the other 
hand, Jutzeler et al. reported reductions in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, 
secondary somatosensory cortex, and thalamus volume in SCI patients with a nd without 
neuropathic pain compared to controls. Neuropathic pain was associated with increases in ACC and primary motor cortex gray matter, as well as reductions in primary somatosensory cortex and thalamic gray matter [Jutzeler et al., 2016]. Although 
inconclusive, the above studies indicate that structural reductions rapi[INVESTIGATOR_595102] (sensorimotor cortex, ACC, insula) and subcortical (hippocampus, thalamus,

state (i.e. presence of neuropathic pain).  
microRNA and Neuropathic Pain. microRNAs (miRNA) have emerged as important 
biomarkers and molecular mediators in numerous physiological and pathological settings. miRNAs are short, non -coding single -stranded RNA molecules with the ability 
to exert post- transcriptional modulation of larg e sections of the genome by [CONTACT_595149] [Bartel, 2009; 
Lagos- Quintana et al., 2001]. They bind to untranslated regions of genes with 
sometimes imperfect com plementarity, which allows for one specific miRNA molecule 
to inhibit the translation of multiple genes. They are found in every human tissue and 
biofluid, are resistant to RNAse degradation and have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier making them an excellent choice as a biomarker for neuro -trauma related 
conditions, neuro -recovery, and response to various therapeutic interventions [Liu and 
Paroo, 2010].

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  Significant alterations in microRNAs expression (together with the resultant changes in 
protein expression) have been reported in both the affected tissues and in the blood from patients suffering from several pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, cystitis -induced chronic pain and irritable bowel disorder. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] -
induced neuropathic pain represents a significant clinical challenge that affects 20 -77% 
of injured persons. Specific changes in protein expression in peripheral nocic eptive and 
central neurons are thought to contribute to the development of hyper -excitability 
which is at the basis of the genesis and persistence of chronic neuropathic pain [Gold and Gebhart, 2010]. Because SCI -induced neuropathic pain is mediated by, am ong other 
factors, neuronal protein expression, the process can potentially be regulated by [CONTACT_595150]. Many studies have been conducted in rodent models of neuropathy investigating changes in miRNA expression both centrally and peripherally. Most of 
them have  demonstrated dysregulation in numerous miRNAs [Bali et al., 2014; Genda et 
al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011]. In one particular study [Imai et al., 2011], the authors found 
that a lesion in the periphery (sciatic nerve) caused downregulation of specific miRNA centrally (in post- synaptic neurons of nucleus accumbens). Furthermore, the authors 
proposed that these changes may be involved in the development of co -morbid 
conditions like anxiety and sleep disorders, typi[INVESTIGATOR_595103]. D espi[INVESTIGATOR_595104], 
there is a general consensus in that miRNA alterations that occur both in the CNS and the PNS mediate or are associated with neuropathic pain.  
The study of miRNA in neuropathic pain is a relatively new field of research. However, the significance of miRNA alterations in a variety of rodent pain models and in clinical conditions characterized by [CONTACT_595151] (there are more than 30 
publications in 2019 alone). The majority of these studies have been conducted in animal models. However, a few studies also describe changes in miRNAs -signatures in 
complex regional pain syndrome [Orlova et al., 2011] and irritable bowel syndrome -
patients [Zhou et al., 2010]. There is evidence that a specific miRNA might play a role in 
the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in SCI. miR -485 regulates presynaptic expression 
of SV2A and regulates dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_595105] [Cohen et al., 2011]. Synaptic plasticity is a homeostatic response essential to adapt neural circuit connectivity and excitation in response to neurotrauma. miRNA -485 
expression is regulated in a number of neurological diseases and after brain trauma. Fo r 
instance, miRNA -485 is down -regulated in Huntington disease [Packer et al., 2008], 
Alzheimer’s disease [Cogswell et al., 2008], and traumatic brain injury [Redell et al., 2009]. These disease studies, together with our findings that SV2A expression is increased in individuals with neuropathic pain, suggest that decreased levels of miR -485 
with corresponding increased levels of SV2A and neural network activity in nociceptive neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of SCI -induced neuropathic pain.  
Because miR -485 regulates SV2A expression, the target of brivaracetam, we hypothesize 
that circulating miR -485 may be a valuable predictive biomarker of response to therapy.

participant’s physician to fax the lab report to  the study coordin ator. The 
instructions for faxing will be on the screening eligibility sheet the participant brings to their doctor’s appointment and available to be emailed for the participant upon request.  
CDE-recommended questionnaires relating to pain, mood, active 
suicidality, satisfaction with life, kinesiophobia, sleep quality, and community integration will be administered. Participants will then begin 3 
months of active treatment (100 mg BID) or place bo. All participants will 
receive a medication diary to track study drug compliance and to record 
medication use. Blinded data collectors will perform weekly check -in calls 
to assess for medication -related adverse events including the PHQ -9 for 
changes in mood and suicidality. Reported AEs identified in these calls will be documented and immediately shared with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294].

blood serum.  
Clinical data will be stored on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) , 
physical paper files will be kept in a locked file drawer in the study coordinator’s office, and on encrypted servers  (Box) . Participant 
confidentiality will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_595160]. Research records will be stripped of all identifying information, with keys identifying individual participants available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595115]. Further, access to identifiable 
private information from study participants will only be accessible to study -
related personnel who have met the training requirements for the 
responsible conduct of research, Good Clinical Practice, HIPAA, and data security, and who have completed all initial and annual study specific training.  
Blood samples will be collected in the Fairview Clinical Research Unit (CRU), and stored locally in a - 80 freezer at UMN. Blood samples will be labeled by 
[CONTACT_79166], type (plasma or serum), and date of draw. A password-protected tracking sheet will be used to link participants’ blood samples 
with identifiable information (i.e., date of birth).  This sheet will only be accessed by [CONTACT_1201] -approved study staff.  
At the baseline  and final evaluation, we will draw 38 ml of blood (20 mL 
plasma, 18 mL serum) after an overnight fast  and store it at - 80° Celsius 
until batch processing in the lab of the PI.  
6.2 Data:  
All clinical assessments, quantitative proprioceptive recordings, standardized patient- rated questionnaires will be stored on Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap ) and on encrypted servers.  
Imaging of brain activation (fMRI), and brain networks via functional resting -state (functional connectivity), and task- based (effective 
connectivity) will be preprocessed using the HCP preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. 
MRI data will be stored in digital form on enc rypted servers.  
We will bank blood serum and plasma for long term storage.  To minimize 
the risk of loss of privacy all records will be kept confidential and identified 
by [CONTACT_472575]. Blood samples will be stored without identifiers using only the study code.

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  8.3 Screening:  
A prescreening checklist will be administered to confirm basic eligibility 
prior to consenting. This includes confirming age, pain level, medication 
use, implanted medical devices or retained metal fragments, and other 
medical conditions. If participant meets basic eligibility requirements, we 
will request that they obtain medical clearance for study participation from their primary care provider or other me dical professional, including 
collecting 3 -4 tablespoons of blood for screening blood work and 
comple ting a physical exam and health history. T he participant’s insurance 
will be charged and they will be responsible for any associated copays or costs.    
The participant’s provider will provide UMN research staff with results via fax or email, or the participant may carry a hard copy. If the participant is a patient of Fairview, their medical records will be accessed directly by 
[CONTACT_595161]- Fairview employed 
research staff (NERS) application process for conducting research tasks in 
Fairview facilities and systems.   
Screening for hepatic cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, and pregnancy . 
Brivaracetam treatment is not safe for those who are pregnant, have hepatic cirrhosis, or kidney dysfunction. Therefore, in order to be medically cleared to enter the study, participants must complete a fasting blood draw 
through their primary care clini c for analysis of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total 
bilirubin, albumin, GFR, calcium, corrected calcium, and human chori onic 
gonadotropin (hCG) ; urine hCG test will also be accepted.  INR will be 
collected at the discretion of the participant’s primary care provider if the 
participant is on anticoagulation or has abnormal LFTs. The blood lab report and medical clearance form will be faxed from the medical provider 
to the study coordi nator within one month of draw. People who are 
menopausal and have not had a menstrual period for at least [ADDRESS_785631] had a hysterectomy will not be required to take pregnancy tests. We will use lab work performed clinically during any 
recent visit (within one month of testing) for screening labs when available. Any participant found to have renal insufficiency (GFR<60ml/minute), hepatic cirrhosis, Child -Pugh grades A, B, and C,  or pregnant (positive hCG) 
will be considered a screen fail and will not progress in the study.

9.2 Additional Safeguards :  
This project aims to research an intervention that may help vulnerable adults with spi[INVESTIGATOR_595117], a severe health condition, 
and non- English speakers. To provide additional safeguards to protect individuals 
that may be vulnerable we:  
• Will provide assurance of confidentiality, freedom to decline to 
participate, right to withdraw at any time without penalty.  
• Engaged the SCI community in the planning of this proposed research.  
• We have assessed the permissibility of the physician- investigator 
to obtain consent for research.  
• We will emphasize the risks and demands of this study participation to potential participants.  
• We will provide consent forms and a translator to individuals who are unable to read or speak in English.  
• Groups included in the research where participant status in the group might be unknown (Incidental enrollment), as group status is not solicited by [CONTACT_5051] (ex: military status, if study 
teams don't ask and it doesn't impact the research):   
The vulnerable population groups that are allowed to participate  will not be 
identified and information will not be collected as to a patient’s vulnerable 
population status.   This research does not add risk to this group.

11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process:  
We anticipate screening 30 individuals with SCI to recruit and enroll 20 
participants.  The UMN healthcare system treats hundreds of patients with SCI each year.  Given the large pool available for recruitment, we anticipate no difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of persons with SCI who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Recruitment material will accurately reflect the study and will not be coercive.  
 
For self -referrals from recruitment materials:  
Participants may self -refer if they become aware of the study through 
recruitment materials, clinicaltrials.gov  (or similar websites), or word of 
mouth referrals.  A study -specific webpage will be published 
(www.z.umn.edu/ SCIPain
). A link to a RedCAP online survey will be shared 
for individuals to indicate their interest and preferred contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183]. 
Participants will self -enter their contact [CONTACT_595162].  
Potential participants will be identified by [CONTACT_24478] -Principal Investigators 
from among patients under their care and their colleagues. Potential 
participants will be asked about their interest in the study at the time of a routine care visit. The patient will be given the choice, if interested, to be approached by [CONTACT_34651], over phone or e -mail or have 
them reach out to the investigator.  A flier or recruitment card about the 
study may be sent to potential participants, asking them to contact [CONTACT_595163].  
Individuals who respond to the recruitment materials will be taken through a phone screening questionnaire with the study coordinator. If following the phone screen, the potential participant is eligible and interested; the study coordinator  will schedule the screening study visit.

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
There is a risk of drug intolerance including allergy, suicidal behavior and 
ideation, somnolence and fatigue, psychotic symptoms, irritability, depression, loss of coordination/balance, constipation, aggressive 
behavior, and anxiety. All participants and caregivers will be educated to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a health care provider if mood changes or suicidal behavior are observed.  There is the risk of lowered seizure threshold for rapid drug withdrawal witho ut tapering. There is some discomfort with venipuncture  
and there is the possibility of swelling and bruising at the site. There is also a slight chance that individuals become dizzy or faint. There are potential risks of loss of privacy and confidentiality. All participants will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_9137] , or an investigator regarding 
any side effects or adverse events that occur.  
 
MRI risks  
There are minimal risks or side effects of MRI testing for participants who do 
not have medical devices or implants.   These risks include magnetic objects 
being turned into projectiles by [CONTACT_45853], claustrophobia in the scanner, and hearing damage if hearing protection is not worn in the scanner.   
 Venipuncture  
There is some discomfort with venipuncture and there is the possibility of swelling, inflammation, and bruising at the site, and, in rare cases, the risk of 
infection. There is also a slight chance that individuals become dizzy or faint. All blood draws co mpleted at the study site will be performed by a trained 
technician at the UMN in the Fairview Clinical Research Unit (CRU), following standard clinical protocols to minimize risks.  
 
Risks Associated with Breach of Confidentiality  
There is a risk of breach of confidentiality.  Multiple measures will be taken 
to minimize this risk. All information that could be used to identify a 
participant will be kept in secure and locked space with accessible only by [CONTACT_595170]. All of these 
documents will be kept in locked file cabinets, in locked offices, at all times. Also kept secure and separate from other files will be the unique ID code number for each participant. Information collected will  be stored on Box

Version 8.0 03/18/2024   Template  Revised On: 6/2/2021  15.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
For aim 1, t he main outcome variables of interest include various 
dimensions of pain, mood (PHQ -9), life  satisfaction (SWLS), resting state 
brain connectivity, and community integration (CHART -SF) measured at  
baseline and again at [ADDRESS_785635] is 
whether there is a difference in pain reduction from baseline to end of 
study between the treatment and control groups; this will be analyzed in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595123]. We note that many of these instruments have 
bounded scores and we will include analyses that recognize these (via, e.g., non-  linearities or recognize the bounds such as Tobit regression) Further 
exploratory analyses will examine the  relationships (correlations) between 
changes in pain and changes in mood, life satisfaction, resting state brain connectivity, and community integration using linear regression.  
 
For aim 2, we will use the same analytic approach we have refined in our 2 active rsfMRI studies. MRI data will  be analyzed using the SPM12 based 
Conn toolbox 3 (Version 17f, Matlab R2018b). Preprocessing steps include  
realignment and unwarpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], slice -timing correction, ART based 
identification of outlier scans for scrubbing, segmentation and 
normalization to MNI space, and 8 mm smoothing. Denoising steps include scrubbing, aCompCor, ICA- based denoising, Global Regression, and 0.008 
to 0.09 Hz band- pass fil tering). Three main  comparisons will be evaluated: 
The effect of drug treatment on rsfMRI measures, the effect of pain intensity on rsfMRI measures (each via linear regression as in Aim 1), and 
the differences in rsfMRI measures between active drug responders and 
non- responders; this last will also be analyzed via linear regression; note, 
however, that this will be limited to those in the active group and people in 
the placebo group will not be included. First, we will evaluate region -of-
interest (ROI) base d functional connectivity in a set of anatomically defined 
regions  known to be impacted in SCI and neuropathic pain: the 
periaqueductal gray, the bilateral thalamus, the  amygdala, the 
hippocampus, the insula, anterior cingulate, the precentral and the post-central gyrus. Second,  we will evaluate, on a voxel- by-voxel basis, 
amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and intrinsic resting
 state 
functional connectivity.  
 
For aim 3, we will analyze miRNA expression profiles for raw cycle 
threshold (Ct) values using real -time  Statminer software (Integromics, Inc) 
to identify significantly altered miRNAs. For relative quantification of  
miRNAs between placebo and brivaracetam- treated samples, the following

biological replicates, filtering of miRNAs expression having Ct values  below 
cycles and the detection of expression in all biological replicates of 
calibrator and target. Statistically  significant miRNAs will be selected based 
on stringent parameters such as Benjamin -Hochberg false discovery rate 
(FDR) and data will be conservatively selected with adjusted p- values and 
p-value lower than 0.[ADDRESS_785636] Analysis

mutations, or chromosomal changes.  For clinical correlation analysis, data 
comparing changes in miRNA expression will be described as means with 
standard error of the mean. In order to analyze the differences  between 
group means w e will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) after the assessing 
for distribution and variance.  Multiple comparisons will be performed using

15.2 Power Analysis:  
Part of the goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595125], including effect sizes and standard error estimates; therefore, analyses are included here that may not be included in a non- pi[INVESTIGATOR_338084] -up (including the randomization analyses described 
below); further, some of the analyses here are exploratory to help in the design of a follow- up study. Also, (1) robust standard errors will be used in 
all cases to help guard against the effects of heteroskedasticity; (2) 
although there are a number of outcomes and, therefore, analyses, no 
adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595126] a follow -up. Of course, when 
disseminating our findings we will report the number of tests performed and the actual p- values so that readers can make their own adjustments if 
wanted.

15.4 Data Integrity : 
Study staff will collect and store data. Data will be collected electronically 
or on paper forms. All electronic data will be stored on Box Secure Storage or REDCap. Paper forms will only be accessible by [CONTACT_5984], trained study coordinator, and the principal investigator. All paper documents will be kept in locked file cabine ts in locked offices at all times. Participant 
names, contact [CONTACT_3031], health history, and other information that can be traced back to the participant will be kept separate ly from data 
collected for the study. Personal information will be kept in a locked office and away from data or in a separate folder on Box Secure Storage. Collected data will have the participant’s identification code and some computer software used to c ollect data will have the date and time marked 
on the file. Protocol sheets used during data collection will only have the 
participant’s ID.  
 Imaging data (MRI scan results) will be identified by [CONTACT_595174]. Some institutions consider MRI of the brain to contain identifiers due to the presence of facial features.  We will not use software to mask facial features, therefore identifiable MR I data 
will be shared with [CONTACT_595187] for analysis.  All computers are password -
protected and will only be used by [CONTACT_595171].  
 All study records will be kept indefinitely after the study is closed. Research records will be stored in a manner to protect the confidentiality of participant  information.  
 
[CONTACT_584786]  will review data monthly. She will be responsible for monitoring 
the completeness of  all data and source documents as well as monitoring 
the informed consent procedures. Checklists  and note pages are used to 
note any deviations or omissions from the protocols. Any deviation to the protocol that may have an effect on the safety  or rights of the volunteer or 
the integrity of the study will be promptly reported to the IRB .

Minneapolis SCI system of care treats over 200 newly injured individuals with SCI every year. Given the large pool available for recruitment, we anticipate no difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of persons with SCI 
who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
23.3 Study -Wide Recruitment Materials:  
We will use flyers to recruit participants.  
 
23.4 Communication Among Sites:  
The site PIs (Falci, Morse) will communicate in person daily with their 
local teams to discuss experimental design, data analysis, and all administrative responsibilities. The research team (all key personnel across the 2 sites) will meet virtually on a we ekly basis to monitor project 
progress and to trouble -shoot.  
 
23.5 Communication to Sites:  
Communication to sites will occur between the site PIs and study coordinators.   
 
24.0 Coordinating Center Research  
24.1 Role:  
[CONTACT_584786] will serve as PI [INVESTIGATOR_595]. As such, she will oversee implementation of all aspects of this proposal. [CONTACT_595192]  (UMN) will 
serve as co -investigator and will oversee the miRNA studies. [CONTACT_584786] will 
oversee UMN recruitment, study coordination, data management, regulatory compliance, and dissemination activities. The UMN will serve as 
the statistical/data center for  the study.  
 
24.2 Responsibilities:  
Each  PI [INVESTIGATOR_595136] -investigators, key 
personnel, and consultants. Publication authorship will be based on the 
relative scientific contributions of the personnel. Each PI [INVESTIGATOR_595137].  
 
24.3 Oversight:  
[CONTACT_595190] will be the external medical monitor. As PI, [CONTACT_584786] will oversee the study.

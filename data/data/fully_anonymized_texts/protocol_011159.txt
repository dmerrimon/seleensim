Introduction: Persistent postoperative pain affects up to 60% of patients after breast cancer surgery.  Breast 
sparing surgical options such as lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy are still associated with persistent 
postoperative pain rates above 20%.  This ca n lead to limitations in ability to function and work as well as 
deterioration of quality of life  and higher medical care costs .  Paravertebral nerve blocks have been shown to 
significantly decrease this risk, but paravertebral blocks are difficult to perf orm and can be associated with 
significant morbidity.  In 2012 [CONTACT_32032] introduced the pectoral nerve block  (PECS) as an alternative 
method of decreasing pain after breast surgery.  While it has been shown to decrease acute postoperative pain, it is 
unknown if it decreases chronic postoperative pain in the longer term.   
 
Methods : In this double blinded randomized placebo -controlled trial, [ADDRESS_31305] surgery 
involving the axilla will be administered a multimodal pain regimen including acetaminophen, dexamethasone, 
celecoxib, and gabapentin.  Eighty  subjects will also be randomized to receive a PECS I and II block preoperatively.  
All patients will receive general anesthesia including fentanyl for analgesia (or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_31973]) .  
Subjects will be assessed at baseline  and 1 year postoperatively with a modified Brief Pain Inventory to look for 
differences between cohorts (with PECS block or without), for  incidence and severity of persistent postoperative 
pain.   All patients will also be assessed at baseline  and 1 year  using Veterans RAND 12 questionnaire collected  with 
the SATISFY SOS survey fo r difference in quality of life  (WUSTL IRB#  201203088, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .

PECS Block  Vers 5.0 2/26/[ADDRESS_31306] common cancer among women in the [LOCATION_002] with approximately 2 50,000 
new cases each year. (1) The primary treatment is surgical intervention , which can lead to high rates of persistent 
postoperative pain  (PPP) .(2)  Twenty -five to 60% of patients will experience chronic  pain depending on 
treatment. (3)  For modified radical mastectomy , 50% of patients develop chronic pain with impaired quality of 
life.(4)  Breast conserving therapy (partial mastectomy) is associated with less  pain overall, but still results in a 
significant PPP rate of 25%.  Due to an average 5 -year survival rate of 89% , there are nearly  [ADDRESS_31307] cancer. (5) Consequently , chronic pain followin g breast cancer surgery 
likely affects over 5 00,000  women , leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs as well as loss of 
ability to work  and deterioration in quality of life . (6) Paravertebral nerve blocks have been shown to substantially 
decrease the incidence of PPP by 44-86%. (7,8,9) However , paravertebral blocks are difficult to perform and can be 
associated with significant morbidity.   In 2012 the Pectoral Nerve  blocks I and II (PECS I and II) were introduced as 
safer and easier method s of decreasing pain after breast surgery. (10)  While PECS blocks  have  been shown to 
decrease acute postoperative pain, (11) it is unknown if they  decrease pain in the longer term.  
 Our long- term goal is to optimize the perioperative pain management of brea st cancer surgery , to both minimize 
acute and chronic postoperative pain and maximize patient satisfaction in the most cost effective manner.  Our 
hypothesis is that PECS blocks, compared with multimodal analgesia, will decrease persistent postoperative pain and improve patient reported quality of life.  The rationale is that since paravertebral blocks have been shown to 
decrease both acute and chronic postoperative pain, and PECS blocks have been shown to decrease acute pain, it is 
likely that PECS blocks also decrease chronic postoperative pain.

anesthesiologist, data collection team, anesthesia team, surgeon, and postoperative acute care unit ( PACU ) team 
will be blinded  to group a ssignment.   The regional anesthesiologist will also be provided with a sealed envelope 
that indicates the study drug, if it should be considered in the subject’s best interest to break the blind. The blinding will be opened  to the statistician fo llowing s tudy completion for all  subjects. The blind will be opened completely

will be randomized to receive either preoperative PECS blocks or sham placebo PECS blocks.  Both groups will 
receive multimodal analgesia in addition to  the study procedure.  Participants will be assessed at enrollment with 
baseline surveys, then later at 2 weeks, 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.  The primary outcome measure 
will be the severity of postoperative pain at 12 months by [CONTACT_32011] (BPI).  Study patients will also be enrolled in the Systematic Assessment and Targeted Improvement of Services Following Yearly Surgical 
Outcomes Surveys (SATISFY -SOS) trial clinicaltrials.gov (HRPO# 201203088 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  Data from the SATISFY -
SOS s tudy will be used to assess patients’ quality of life at 1 year and to provide  additional baseline information  for 
confounder adjustment .  Figure 1 outlines the study design of this proposed research.  The trial will be registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov after IRB approval. Data reports from the SATISFY -SOS study will be generated atvarious time points 
throughout the study  for subjects enrolled to this protocol . 
 
5.1 Primary Intervention – PECS Blocks  
 
Preoperative performance of PECS blocks is the primary intervention to which patients will be randomized.  For 
patients in the PECS group , a PECS I and II block will be administered with standard monitoring per usual protocol in 
either the preoperative hol ding area, or in the operating room after administration of general anesthesia before 
surgical incision .  For unilateral surgeries , a PECS I block will be performed with 0.15mL/kg of 0.375% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31979] 5.0 2/26/19  
9 
 (maximum 10mL).  The PECS II block will be performed w ith 0.3 mL/kg of the same solution (maximum 20mL).  If 
there is a contralateral surgery (simple mastectomy) a PECS II block will also be performed on the other side with 
0.2mL/kg of 0.375% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (maximum 20mL).  It is common for patients scheduled fo r a modified radical 
mastectomy to also be scheduled for a prophylactic simple mastectomy on the other side.  For patients in the 
multimodal group a sham block  (normal saline) will be placed either in the preoperative holding area, or in the 
operating room , with timing based on maximizing operating room efficiency .  Timing of block placement will not be 
randomized.  The regional anesthesia team will be responsible for all block and sham block placement.  To ensure 
blind integrity, study drug syringes will b e marked only “study drug” and subject number.  If the anesthesia team 
suspects local anesthetic toxicity , the regional anesthesia team will break the blind and be asked to assist with 
evaluation and treatment.  
 5.2 Multimodal Analgesia and Perioperative Protocol  
 
In order to minimize treatment variability , the perioperative analgesic regimen will be encouraged, but not 
mandated for research subjects  at the discretion of the anesthesia and surgical teams . Gabapentin 300mg, 
celecoxib 200mg , and acetaminophen  1000mg will be administered  to all patients following  arrival to the 
preoperative holding area.  If the patient is allergic to celecoxib or sulfa, naproxen 500mg PO  will be substituted . If 
the patient is intolerant to NSAIDs or has a GFR <60 (not includin g GI upset for celecoxib), celecoxib/naproxen  will 
be held .  If the patient is >65 years old but has a GFR >60 celecoxib/naproxen  will not be held , but a reduced dose 
of celecoxib 100mg or naproxen 250mg  will be administered .  If the patient is over 65 years old or has a GFR <[ADDRESS_31316] of care intraoperative pain medication  
for all surgeries at BJH and is administered to over 95% of patients.  All patients will receive the same postoperative order set for the PACU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13334]. The PACU postop order set consist s of fentanyl followed by [CONTACT_32012] s with anticipated same day discharge to home. If the patient is scheduled for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31980], hydromorphone may also be administered follow ing fentanyl administration. This is the most 
commonly used opi[INVESTIGATOR_31981].  Patients will receive a standard antiemetic regimen 
including scopolamine patch preoperatively ( if age < 65  and no  history of glaucoma), 4mg IV ondansetron 
intraoperatively, [ADDRESS_31317] 
3 days  as needed . Gabapentin 300mg will be administered at bedtime while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31982] . Home o xycodone will be prescribed  per the discretion of the surgical 
attending who will also be blind ed to group  assignment . If the patient is intolerant to oxycodone, 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen may  be substituted and scheduled acetaminophen will be held. After the first three 
days, adjuvant doses will be decreased to acetaminophen 1000mg Q8 hours and cele coxib 100mg BID  as needed .  
This dosage will continue until the first postoperative visit (2 weeks  postoperatively ) as long as the patient is 
experiencing pain . Gabapentin will not be prescribed for any patient with preexisting kidney disease (GFR < 60) or 
with age > 65 years. Celecoxib will be administered at a reduced dose (100mg) for any patient with age > 65 and a normal GFR (>60)  as long as the patient is experiencing pain . Naproxen 500mg or 250mg (age >65) BID will be 
substituted for celecoxib in pati ents with sulfa allergies. Naproxen will be held for any patient with history of NSAID 
PECS Block  Vers 5.0 2/26/[ADDRESS_31318] real world practice. Patients who  are not able to take gabapentin, 
acetaminophen, dexamethasone, ondansetron, celecoxib, or scopolamine will not be prescribed these medications , 
but may still participate in the study. Medications and dosages may  be modified by [CONTACT_32013]’s  pain if the patient is intolerant to any study medications , has 
preexisting chronic pain , or if the surgeon or blinded acute pain service determines that modified  medications and 
dosages is the best treatment for the patients’ pain .

performed at Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31983].  As part of the informed consent process for 
this study, patients will be informed of the rare risk s of hematoma, infection, or drug reaction . In the unlikely event 
that serious side effects occur, they will be documented and will be reported to the human research protection 
ofﬁce and to the study’s data safety monitoring board. Participants will not be ﬁnancially compensated for their 
participation.   The patients’ insurance will be billed for PECS blocks if performed as they are a standard procedure  
for prevention and treatment of acute pain.  Those that choose not to participate will receive standard treatment 
per surgeon discretion.  There is also a rare risk of breach of confidentiality.

8 DATA COLLECTION  
 
Baseline data will be collected  during the CPAP visit, including demographics, age, radiation  and chemotherapy  
history, a modified Brief Pain Inventory  (Appendix A) , Pain Scale  (Appendix C) , pain medication history, history of 
other sources of pain, and medical history (anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia).  The modified brief pain inventory  
will be administered following surgery at approx imately 2 weeks , 6 month s, and 12 month s postoperatively  in 
coordination  with routine follow up  visits to the surgeon’s clinic . In the event that a survey is missed a backup 
survey will be administered by [CONTACT_32017] .  The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31993] ( HCAHPS)  pain domain questions will  be added to the modified BPI [INVESTIGATOR_31994]  (Appendix B) .  The staff administering the survey will be blinded to the patient’s group.  As part of the 
SATISFY SOS study, which tracks long term postoperative outcomes, patients complete a 30 -day and 1 -year 
postoperative survey that includes the Veterans Rand 12 Item Health Survey (VR12) and the Barthel index, validated measures of quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living.  Additional data collection  will 
include surgical procedure, medications, treatments, vital signs and any adverse events or serious adverse events that may occur in the preoperative holding area, operating room, postoperative care unit, and medical floor 
throughout the initial hospi [INVESTIGATOR_31995] .  Some of this data may be utilized for substud y analyses .  
Electronic medical record data will be extracted after completion of the primary intervention  and subject’s 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

 11 OUTCOME MEASURES 
 
11.1 Severity of postoperative pain 
 Pain is inherently subjective and only quantifiable by [CONTACT_32019].  By [CONTACT_32020]’ perception of their pain and its effects on their life with a validated survey, this design most closely mirrors how 
outcomes are assessed by [CONTACT_32021] S and what is most important to patients themselves.  The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is 
a validated assessment routinely used for measuring chronic pain and recommended by [CONTACT_7902], 
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMP ACT) consensus statement. (12)  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_31996], and its interference with the patient’s life.  This allows a more complete 
characterization of the pain than a simple VAS score.  Since the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_31997] [ADDRESS_31328] modified the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_8178]  a 7 day benchmark. (Appendix A and B) We have also modified the language to focus  on 
surgical site pain, neglecting pain from other areas of the body. (Appendix B) The one year BPI [INVESTIGATOR_31998].   
 
At the same time as the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_31999].  These questions are used by [CONTACT_32022][INVESTIGATOR_32000], and are published online as part of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32001] .gov.  The HCAHPS scores are also used to adjust payment to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  The two 
questions directly related to pain on the survey will be asked in order to assess if PECS blocks are associated with improvement in outcomes that CMS is directly measuring.   
 
11.2 Quality of life  
 
Gross level of pain or pain scores are not necessarily the only relevant measure of pain for surgical patients.  It is 
more important to both the patient and payers if pain affects the patient’s quality of life.  Quality of life will be 
assessed based on  the Veterans’ Rand 12 questi onnaire collected as part of the SATISFY -SOS study .   
 
 
12 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an independent Data  
and Safety Monit oring Committee (DSMC) will be specifically convened for this trial to review toxicity data at least 
every [ADDRESS_31329] to the trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or appropriate universi ty officials, in accordance with 
institution policies. Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSMC must also be 
disclosed.  
 The DSM report will be prepared by [CONTACT_32023], will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6802], and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC).  This report will include:  
 •         HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator [CONTACT_2300], data coordinator name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
•         Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of HRPO expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study

13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Statistical  Analysis and Power  
 BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32004] U and adjusted for known confounders and 
baseline pain by [CONTACT_32025].  HCAHPS pain domain scores will be analyzed similarly.  Change in the 1 
year VR12 score from baseline results will be compared between study groups  by [CONTACT_32026] U and adjusted for 
known confounders using ANCOVA regression analysis.  For the purpose of powering the study a decrease in 
Modified BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] ( average severity  domain, 0-10) of 50% ( 3  1.5) will be conside red clinically significant.  A 
sample size of [ADDRESS_31330] deviation of 3  points  and using two tailed Student’s T test.  Our target sample size is  increased 
to 80 patients per group to account for  dropout and  possible confounders including surgery type, age, radiation 
history, chronic pain history, and ASA score.  By [CONTACT_32027] (Quade’s test) we hope to 
decrease the within  group error variance and minimize the impact of these confounders.  Our goal of a 50% 
reduction in score is realistic  for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32006] 86%. ( 8)   
 
13.2 Limitations  
 
We recognize these analyses rely on subjective patient reporting of pain scores and pain’s effects on quality of life .  
We do not intend to verify this with objective examinations of pain and decreased range of motion of the affected extremity  because it is the subjective outcomes that are of importance to patients .  Our sample size is powered to 
look for a 50% reduction of PPP by [CONTACT_32028]  [INVESTIGATOR_32007] .  While this is relatively aggressive, our 
projected sample size of 80  patients p er group is double previous studies examining paravertebral nerve block’s 
benefits on persistent postoperative pain. ( 13, 8,9) Since we are powered for an outcome larger than would be 
clinically relevant (50% vs 20% decrease in PPP) this could be considere d a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32008] a clinically 
significant but not statistically significant outcome.

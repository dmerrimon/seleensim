3 Primary  Objectives:   
1. To assess  the effects of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  85 mg and 170 mg on the prevention  of vomiting  from  motion  
sickness  during vehicle  travel  as measured  by [CONTACT_88583]  (VA).  
Secondary  Objectives:   
1. To assess the effects of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  85 mg and 170 mg on nausea severity  as measured  by 
[CONTACT_88584]  (NA).  
2. To assess the effects of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  85 mg and 170 mg on the symptoms  of motion  sickness as 
measured  by [CONTACT_88585].  
3. To assess the effects of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  85 mg and 170 mg on the symptoms  of motion  sickness as 
measured  by [CONTACT_88586]-S.  
4. To assess the safety  and tolerability  of a single  oral dose of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  85 mg and 170 mg . 
Overall  Design:  This  is a randomized, double -blind,  placebo -controlled trial  to investigate  the efficacy  
and safety  of a single  [ADDRESS_96733]  of the participant  taking  the motion  sickness  eligibility  questionnaire  
(MSEQ)  to assess their susceptibility  to motion  sickness.  Following  this questionnaire, the  participant 
will be interviewed  to understand their history  of motion  sickness.  If the participant meets  pre-defined 
criteria  as being  eligible  based  on the motion  sickness  eligibility  questionnaire  and interview,  they will  
proceed to the next  step of a screening  visit at a clinical site  with  a physician, and simultaneously, a  lab 
visit for a blood draw.  If the participant  passes the medical  visit  screen  and blood  draw  based  on 
inclusion and  exclusion criteria  they  will proceed  to the evaluation  phase.  
 
Eligible  participants  will be randomized  1:1:[ADDRESS_96734] approximately  120- 300 minutes.  The Vomiting  
Assessment  (VA)  and Nausea Assessment  (NA) questionnaires  will be completed  approximately  every  
30 minutes  of vehicle  travel , and upon return  to port.  
 
After  the completion  of the vehicle  travel,  the participant  will complete  the Patient  Global  Impression  
of Severity  Questionnaire (PGI- S) and the  Motion Sickness  Assessment  Questionnaire  (MSAQ).  
All questionnaires will  be submitted  for analysis.  Participants  will then  return  for an EOS  visit  within  7 
days of Visit  2.  
Statistical  Methods:  Prevention  of vomiting will  be assessed  by [CONTACT_41309],  with  the other  questionnaires  
serving  as secondary  endpoints. The  percentage of vomiting  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_88587],  and nausea  severity  measured  by [CONTACT_88588].  The primary  efficacy  analysis  will be based  on the  ITT 
population.  
The statistical  analyses  will be  detailed  in the statistical  analysis plan.

4 1. STATISTICS  
1.1. Sample Size and Accrual  
A sample size of 100 participants per arm (300 total) will provide around 96% power to detect 
a 26% difference in vomiting between tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_88580] 50% of participants on placebo will vomit and 24% of participants on tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_88581].   
1.2. Statistical Methods and Analysis Plan  
1.2.1. General  
This section describes the planned statistical analyses in general terms. A complete description of the methodology will be specified in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized 
prior to unblinding. Any changes in the statistical methods described in this protocol that occur 
prior to unblinding will be documented in the statistical analysis plan and will not require a protocol amendment.  
Statistical hypothesis testing will be performed at two sided alpha level of 0.05 unless specified otherwise. For continuous variables, population size (N for sample size and n for available data), the mean, the standard deviation (SD), the median, the minimum and maximum values 
will be tabulated.  For categorical variables, population size and frequencies in each category 
will be tabulated.  
Multiplicity adjustments will be used to control study wise type I error at 5%. The details will be provided in the SAP. 
1.2.2. Participant Populations for Analysis  
Three participant populations will be defined:  
Intent -To-Treat population (ITT population) : Any participant randomized that received a dose 
of study drug and had post baseline V A data.  ITT population are analyzed as they are 
randomized, regardless of which treatment a participant received.  
Safety population (Safety population) : Any participant randomized that received a dose of 
study drug. Safety population are analyzed based on the actual treatment received.  
Per-Protocol population (PP population) : Any participant who was randomized and received 
the protocol required study drug exposure and required protocol processing. Blinded clinical 
data will be reviewed prior to data lock to finalize the list of PP population.  
The primary analyses will be performed in the intent -to-treat population. Analyses of efficacy 
endpoints in the PP population will provide supportive evidence. Safety summaries will be based on the Safety population. 
1.2.3. Participant Disposition  
Study completion and reasons for discontinuation for all randomized participants in the double -
blind phase will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_88589]. 
Discontinuations by [CONTACT_88590].  
VP-VLY- 686-[ADDRESS_96735] and current medical history will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_88591] (SOC) as coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary.  
1.2.5. Study Medication  
Exposure and compliance will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6660]. 
1.2.6. Prior/Concomitant Therapy  
Prior/concomitant therapy will be summarized.  
Any medications or therapy present before the first dose of study medication will be considered 
as prior medications. Concomitant medications (medications present while on study 
medication) will be recorded throughout the study and at early discontinuation. These 
medications will be coded using the WHO -drug dictionary. The number of participants from 
the Safety Set using prior or concomitant medications will be categorized by [CONTACT_14300] -drug 
category and preferred term, and presented for each treatment group. In any given category 
(e.g., drug category) a participant will be counted only once.  
1.3. Efficacy Data Analysis 
1.3.1. Primary Outcome and Methodology 
The primary endpoint is the percentage of vomiting as assessed by [CONTACT_88592].  The 
primary analysis method is CMH test adjusting for trips. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population. 
As there are two active doses, the higher dose [ADDRESS_96736] in 170 mg group is positive.  
The statistical analyses will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
1.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The continuous secondary endpoints from NA as well as those from other questionnaires 
(MSAQ, PGI -S) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12359] (ANOVA) model with the main 
effects of treatment group and trip. The categorical secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the 
same way as the primary endpoint. Other statistical methods may also be used as deemed appropriate.  The details will be provided in the SAP. 
1.4. Safety Data Analysis  
1.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study and at early discontinuation. Adverse events and medical conditions will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary. Treatment -emergent adverse events will  be defined as 
those events, which are newly occurring or worsening from baseline. In all cases, only treatment emergent adverse events will be summarized.

Confidential  
6 Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_88593] -emergent AE, having an AE in 
each body system, and having each individual AE. (Note: In any given category [e.g. body 
system] a participant will only be counted once.) Similar displays will be provided for prior 
(conditions ending prior to the first dose of study medication) and current (conditions present 
while on study medication) medical conditions.  
Adverse events will further be categorized by [CONTACT_926], relationship to study medication, and 
action taken. Other information collected will be listed, as appropriate. Any event starting more 
than 3 days after the final dose of study medication will be exc luded from the above tables and 
only listed, unless the event caused discontinuation. 
The proportions of participants experiencing SAEs and AEs resulting in discontinuation from 
the study will also be summarized.  
1.4.2. Laboratory Data  
The summary statistics of raw data (hematology and chemistry) and change from baseline 
values (means, medians, standard deviations, ranges) will be presented, as well as shift tables 
from baseline to post -baseline values using normal ranges. For urinalysis parameters, the 
number and percentage of participants falling under each category of the test will be presented.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_88594]. Clinically notable values (Appendix 20.1) will be identified according to the criteria identified in the FDA's 
"Supplementary Suggestions for Preparing an Integrated Summary of Safety Information in an Original NDA Submission and for Organizing Information in Periodic Safety Updates" (Revised 2 -APR -87) provided by [CONTACT_88595] 
(DNDP).  
1.4.3. Vital Signs and Body Measurements  
Data from vital signs will be listed, clinically notable values as previously defined ( Section 
11.1.3) will be flagged, and any other information collected will be listed. Data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_88596], and values that were clinically notable.  
1.4.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Results from the ECG will be listed for each participant. These data will also be summarized 
for each treatment group by [CONTACT_88597]; shift tables; 
summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline values (means, medians, standard deviations, ranges).  
1.5. Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analysis (such as, gender, age, race etc.) for efficacy variables and safety variables may be conducted.

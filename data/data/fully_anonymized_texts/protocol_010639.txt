 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Bipolar disorder (BD) is an impairing neuropsychiatric condition with high rates of relapse, morbidity, 
and mortality. Treatment of BD is challenging due to its complex clinical presentations and variable response to traditional pharmacologic treatments across individuals. Effective, personalized interventions are severely hindered by [CONTACT_713061]. 
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
Recent groundbreaking work showed that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non-
invasive neuromodulation, can be programmed such that its wave patterns mimic natural theta- gamma 
coupling, a critical neural mechanism of cognitive control
 4,16. Critically, applying frontal tACS targeting 
individualized peak theta /gamma coupling frequencies is able to enhance theta-gamma coupling and 
improve cognitive control performance among healthy non-psychiatric participants. These findings provide support for tACS’s ability to modulate the neural underpi[INVESTIGATOR_713045]. This study will pursue critical next step towards realizing this potential therapy by [CONTACT_713062] (safety and tolerability) and efficacy of personalized tACS in engaging the neural target of affective cognitive control-related neural synchrony in BD patients. 
1.[ADDRESS_970436] shown in a series of EEG studies that frontal theta-band (4-8 Hz) neural oscillatory activity and phase-amplitude coupling with gamma (30-60 Hz) activity are reduced in bipolar disorder during socio-emotional processes requiring cognitive control. This provides support that theta-gamma coupling is a promising neural target to engage for BD.

5.2 Procedures  
The following procedures will be conducted in-person following the University of Michigan ’s Covid safety 
protocols.  
 Pre-Visit Preparations. Participants who meet criteria  after initial phone screening, will be scheduled for 
three in -person sessions at the Rachel Upjohn Building. Participants will be emailed  a blank copy of the 
consent form to review prior to their visit.  
 
Session 1: Screening & Assessment (~ 2-3 hours) 
 
1) Informed Consent. Formal consent will be obtained at the beginning of the visit. The participant will arrive at the Rachel Upjohn Building at the University of Michigan East Ann Arbor Health Campus. A study coordinator or a trained research assistant will greet the participant and take them to a private interview room where the study w ill be explained , the consent form reviewed , and any questions 
answered . Participants will have the option to electronically consent (using SignNow, according to 
IRBMED guidelines) prior to the in person visit through a Zoom meeting with one of the study team members.  
Pregnancy Screening . All woman of childbearing age will be  asked during their screening whether 
they are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant and will not be  enrolled in the study if they 
are. They will be given an option for a urine pregnancy test at the start of each session. Woman with 
a positive pregnancy test will not be permitted in the study. They may decline this option and sign a pregnancy attestation form at each session indicating that they do not believe they could be pregnant. 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
7      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 Sexually active women of childbearing potential will be required  to use a reliable birth control 
method for the duration of this study. 
 
2) Clinician  Administered Assessments. This interview process will be conducted to determine a 
participant’s inclusion/exclusion eligibility. If the participant is ineligible to participate in the study, the rationale for their exclusion will be explained to them.   
 
3) Urine Drug Screening (UDS) . Participants who screened positive for current substance use disorder 
will be administered a UDS . If their  UDS indicate s the presence of a substance, they will not undergo 
that day’s visit. At the PI’s discretion, the participant may be given the option to abstain from all substance use and be rescheduled to provide another urine sample. If they have a clean UDS at that time, they will be able to continue with the visit at that time . Those that are not given the option or 
who ref use to do the UDS will be a screen fail.  Participants who have no active current substance use 
will not be required to provide a urine sample.  
 
4) Self-Rated Assessments. Participants deemed eligible will complete self -rated assessments  and 
computerized tasks through Qualtrics, using an anonymous survey link. No identifiable information will be collected within the survey.  
 
5) Baseline EEG . EEG will be recorded using a 64-channel electrode cap using EEG procedures that are 
standard in cognitive ERP and time- frequency analysis research. The cap is an elastic cap that fits 
snugly over the scalp of the participant, holding the electrodes in place. A standard conductive electrode gel will be inserted into each electrode using a blunt -needle syringe. The scalp will be 
gently rubbed with a swab to improve electrode impedance (i.e., to lower the electrical resistance). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_713050] 30 minutes. The electrode for monitoring 
eye movements will be affixed with adhesive collars. The skin will also be cleaned with an alcohol swab for this electrode. The cap and electrodes will be disinfected after each use with a disinfectant recommended by [CONTACT_713069] (e.g., Cavicide). Other items will be disposed of after each use. The experimenter will wipe the residual electrode gel from the participant’s hair and skin  after 
the EEG session .  
 Emotion Go-NoGo Task. Participants will undergo an EEG and perform a cognitive control task (Emotion Go-NoGo task; described below).   Flanker Task.  After completing the Emotion Go- NoGo task, participants will perform a separate 
cognitive control task (i.e., Flanker task; described below ). Accuracy and reaction time will be used 
to index cognitive control behavior as outcome measures. EEG recorded during the Flanker task will be used to assess neurological indicators of attention control. Participants will then be [ADDRESS_970444] at Session 2.  
 
7) Randomization. Subjects will be randomized on a 50-50 basis to receive active vs. sham stimulation . 
If participants are randomized to the active group at Session 2 , they will go to the sham group at 
Session 3, and vice versa. The participant will not be told which group they were randomized to. The randomization schedule will ensure an equal distribution across the group.  Randomization lists 
tACS Study (HUM00208557)

 will be generated by [CONTACT_713070].  
 
Sessions 2 and 3: Sham vs. Active tACS Session ( ~ 2-3 hours) 
These sessions will occur at the University of Michigan Rachel Upjohn Building. Participants will undergo two sessions, separated by ~ 1 week.  Procedures will be identical for each  session .   
 
1) Pre-Visit Preparations. Research staff will contact [CONTACT_713071]. If yes, the participant will be re -scheduled for an appointment time in which the criteria for a stable dose of at least two 
weeks has been achieved . Additionally, participants will also be asked if they have had any 
recreational drug use since their last study visit. If yes, the participant will have to be re-scheduled 30 days out. 
 
2) Arrival on scheduled session day. Participants will arrive at the Rachel Upjohn Building where they will be greeted by a member of research staff and escorted to the treatment room. Pregnancy urine test will be given if  participant opted out of signing the Pregnancy  Attestation F orm. 
 
3) Clinician  Administered Assessments. In-person clinical assessments will be completed by a trained 
member of staff . All study clinicians are blinded to the treatment arm.  
 
4) Self-Rated Assessments.  Participants will fill out BDI , ASRM , and PSWQ questionnaires. Any 
additional questionnaires not completed at the previous visit may be completed at this time or given to the participants to complete at home.  
 5) EEG and brain stimulation. EEG procedures will be repeated from Session 1. CF  (cross frequency) -tACS targeting theta -gamma PAC 
will be administered in accordance to Consultant Frohlich’s published protocol
4, which has successfully enhanced theta- gamma PAC and 
cognitive control in non- psychiatric individuals. Participants will be 
fitted using a montage consisting of 9 electrodes placed over the left  
frontal scalp.  
 Soterix Medical High -Definition Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation device (HD -tACS) 
will be used to deliver current to the electrodes to generate tACS resembling theta -gamma PAC
4,10,11. 
The impedance of each stimulation electrode will be kept below [ADDRESS_970445] of a theta component (5 Hz) delivered at 0. 96 mA (1. 92 mA peak -to-peak) delivered in a 
constant sine wave and a gamma component (50 Hz), 3.[ADDRESS_970446] delivered at 0.64 mA (1.28 mA peak -to-peak) superimposed on the theta component and centered on the peak of each 
cycle. For both tACS and sham conditions, the stimulation will slowly ramp up over the course of [ADDRESS_970447] the risk to the participants.

 Previous literature suggests that participants are sensitive to stimulation until the sensory neurons in 
the skin acclimate to the stimulation. Thus, we will use sham stimulation as an active control condition. We will inform our participants that they wil l sense the stimulation in the skin but will 
acclimate to the stimulation soon after it begins. They will be informed that they will receive two version of the stimulation, to facilitate blinding in case the participant does not acclimate to the stimulatio n. For sham, a genuine cross-frequency waveform will be delivered at maximum strength 
for 12 s, followed by a ramp-down. The ramp-up and ramp-down during the sham stimulation is designed to mimic the feeling of acclimation that is experienced with verum stimulation due to sensory adaptation.  Published data from Consultant Frohlich’s lab indicate that this procedure provides sufficient participant blinding to the condition
4. 
 
6) Cognitive Control Task (Emotion Go-NoGo Task ) 
Participants will engage in an Emotion Go-NoGo task to activate affective cognitive control during the baseline EEG as well as the stimulation sessions. In this task, participants view facial images exhibiting different emotions (neutral, happy, sad, or angry). For each face (150 ms), they are to press a button within 1500 ms if the face expresses the target emotion (Go trials; 80%) and withhold the response if the face expresses the distractor emotion (NoGo trials; 20%); the pairing of target and distracto r emotions vary across blocks. The task includes a total of 640 trials, divided into 8 blocks of 
80 trials each. Half (4) of the blocks include original face images (Easy condition), and the other half (4) include visually degraded images (Difficult condition). The two difficulty conditions are presented in alternating order (counter-balanced across participants). Accuracy (particularly on NoGo trials) and reaction time (on Go trials) will be used to index cognitive control behavior as outcome measures. [*N ote: the timing and trial parameters of the actual task may be modified slightly 
depending on initial testing results]. 
 
7) Stimulation Side Effects Questionnaire. Participants will complete this questionnaire regarding their 
experience following each stimulation session. They will also be asked to rate how much the stimulation improved cognitive performance as well as if they experienced any side effects (e.g., headache, neck pain, tingling).   
8) Flanker Task.  After completing the Emotion Go-NoGo task, brain stimulation, and Stimulation Side 
Effect Questionnaire, participants will perform a separate cognitive control task  (i.e., Emotional 
Flanker t ask).  Participants will complete  the Emotional Flanker task to evaluate the impact of brain 
stimulation on cognitive control after stimulation has been completed (i.e., offline effects).  
Participants will perform a modified Eriksen flanker task in which gray-scaled unpleasant (e.g., injured limbs, barking dog), pleasant (e.g., cute animals, erotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]), and neutral stimuli (e.g., lamp, spoon) images from the International Affective Pi [INVESTIGATOR_2980] (IAPS) will appear on a 
computer display. There will be two parts to this task: (1) Unpleasant vs Neutral and (2) Pleasant vs Neutral. Three images will be presented with congruent (e.g., unpleasant - unpleasant - unpleasant) and incongruent (e.g., unpleasant - neutral - unpleasant) conditions. Participants will be instructed to 
respond by [CONTACT_713072] (i.e., unpleasant versus neutral), while ignoring the adjacent images, and to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. The stimuli will remain on the scree n for ~400 ms in the initial block, with an interval of 
about ~4000 ms between consecutive stimuli. Following a practice block of 30 trials, each participant will complete 10 blocks of 30 trials for a total of 300 trials for each part (Unpleasant vs Neutra l and 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
10      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 Pleasant vs Neutral), and a grand total of 600 trials. Performance feedback will be provided and the 
stimuli presentation time will be adjusted based on performance after each block (e.g., if performance is above 90%, a 40ms shorter presentation time will be used in the next block) to ensure adequate number of errors and consistency in performance across participants within each part. Actual presentation and interval time may differ slightly in implementation from that described above. Estimated to take ~40  minutes. This task is designed to assess error and response monitoring within 
emotional contexts, which has been shown to be different from monitoring in other contexts, such as emotionally neutral context using arrows. Accuracy and reaction time will be used to index cognitive control behavior as outcome measures. EEG recorded during the Emotional Flanker task will be used to assess neurological indicators of attention control . [*Note: the timing and trial parameters of the 
actual task may be modified slightly depending on initial testing results. In order to reduce subject burden, experimenters may shorten the task and drop the display of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (neutral and valenced), using simple arrow cues instead to indicate a right or left button press ]. 
 Follow-up Phone Call (~ 5 -
 10 min) 
Approximately 4 weeks  (+/- ~7 days) following the completion of Session 3, r esearch staff will call to 
administer  the Stimulation Side Effect Questionnaire as a final safety check  and evaluate for any other 
possible side effects.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_713051] a participant reports intolerable discomfort during the tACS  procedure, the session will be discontinued. 
Immediately after each stimulation session ends, participants will complete a t ACS side effects 
questionnaire. A study team member will review the responses and will immediately consult the PI [CONTACT_39646] a participant reports a high (3) to very high (4) rating for any of the side effects  rated to be related to the 
stimulation (4=probable or 5=definite).  Subjects may also be withdrawn by [CONTACT_713073] (e.g., worsening symptoms, suicidal thoughts, etc.).

6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is done to 
ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected after Sessions [ADDRESS_970449] study 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
[ADDRESS_970450] also be reported. Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until: 
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event return to 
baseline.  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study procedure for the changes observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_713052].  
 Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study procedure is considered to be pre-existing in nature. Any known pre-existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical history.  All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 6.2, occurring from the initial study procedure through [ADDRESS_970451]’s source documents and on the clinical research file (CRF)  regardless of 
frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study procedure.   In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of a pre-existing condition that occurs after the subject begins study procedure is also considered an adverse event . Review of AE and SAE data will be performed  and documented on a routine basis by [CONTACT_713074] [INVESTIGATOR_713053].  
6.2 Definitions  
6.2.1 Adverse Event s 
Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an investigational study or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product. 
 
6.2.2 Serious Adverse Event The study will comply with IRB and FDA reporting requirements and guidelines for SAEs. An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
• A life -threatening adverse event 
An adverse even is considered ‘life-threatening’ if, in the view of either the investigator [or sponsor], its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
13      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] > 24 hours. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition of “ Serious Adverse Event .” Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16498]. 
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713054]’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for the administration of stud y therapy or other 
protocol-required procedure) should not be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened during the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE. 
 
6.2.3 Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” in clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.   
 
6.2.4 Unexpected Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if the  event  is not listed at the specificity 
or severity that has been observed. 
6.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
6.3.1 Terms and Grading The severity  or
  grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following definitions: 
 Mild:  Noticeable to the subject, but does not interfere with subject’s expected daily activities, usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study.  Moderate:   Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some 
additional therapy or intervention but does not require discontinuation of the study.  Severe:  Extremely limits to the subject’s daily activities and may require discontinuation of 
study therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention to resolve and may be life-threatening of fatal.

14      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 6.3.2 Attribution of the AE 
The investigator or co-investigator is responsible for assignment of attribution. Definite  – 
 The AE is clearly related to the study treatment/intervention.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment/intervention.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment/intervention. 
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment/intervention. 
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment/intervention.  
6.[ADDRESS_970452] be notified within ONE b usiness day of study team’s knowledge of any event meeting 
the criteria and definition of a serious adverse event, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within [ADDRESS_970453] administration of the study related treatment/intervention.  The investigator must report all events meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse event as per the IRB MED  reporting guidelines.  
 
6.5 Other Reportable Information or Occurrence (ORIO)  
There are types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that occur during the conduct of human subject research that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered adverse events. For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  Unanticipated problem: Per FDA Procedural Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs 
(January 2009), an unanticipated problem is defined as a serious problem that has implications for the conduct of the study (requiring a significant and usually safety-related, change in the protocol (such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring requirement), informed consent or investigator’s brochure). 
 
U
pon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse event) that 
may represent an ORIO , the investigator should assess the incident and follow IRBMED’s reporting 
guidelines.  
6.6 Unblinding Procedures  
In the event of any adverse event requiring unblinding, the study staff can be made immediately aware of intervention assignment and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718] . 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Aim 1  -
 Acceptability and Tolerability. Neuromodulation studies typi[INVESTIGATOR_713055], respectively.12 We will compare 
the percentage of participants requesting to discontinue the session and the severity of side effects  
reported following the tACS vs. sham procedure using Bayes factors (BF).  
 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
15      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 Aim 2  -  tACS Effects on Neural Synchrony and Cognitive Control Behavior. EEG data 
preprocessing and spectral analyses will be conducted using custom MATLAB scripts and EEGLAB 
following the general methods described in PI [INVESTIGATOR_713044] ’s published work.7 Briefly, data will be 
downsampled to 500 Hz, filtered (0.1 – 100 Hz), re-referenced to common average, segmented into short epochs (for task data, -400 to 1800 ms time-locked to onset of stimuli; for rest data, 2 s epochs), applied independent component analysis to reject non-neural artifacts, baseline adjusted, followed by [CONTACT_713075] ±[ADDRESS_970454] power of different frequencies from 2 to 60 Hz. Theta-gamma PAC will be computed using the Kullback-Leibler Modulation Index (KLMI)
8 implemented in the PAC Tools plugin for EEGLAB.9 Neural 
synchrony (theta -gamma PAC) during the rest EEG blocks and cognitive control performance 
(sensitivity d’, response bias β , and reaction time on the Emotion Go- NoGo  task) will be analyzed in 
separate repeated -measures ANCOVAs, with stimulation (tACS, sham) as within -subjects factor.  
 P
otential Problems & Alternative Strategies  
Participants Dropout. The study design entails each participant completing all 3 sessions. Our 
experience of conducting multiple-session neuromodulation studies suggests that average dropout rate for each subsequent session is 10-15%. We  will enroll [ADDRESS_970455] 20 
participants will complete the study even with an overall dropout of 30%. Statistical Power.  Fo
 r the repeated -measures ANOVAs in Aim 2, assuming a conservative within-
subjects correlations of 0.8, a sample size of 20 would provide 80% power at alpha level of .[ADDRESS_970456] sizes of f=0.21. Although N  = [ADDRESS_970457]. Tso’s publication
[ADDRESS_970458] 50:50 distribution of male:female.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_970459] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and with applicable regulatory requirement(s)  
 
8.2 Roles & responsibilities for regular operations  
PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_713056] a weekly basis to monitor the progress of the study. During 
phases when subject recruitment is occurring, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713057], as well as strategies to improve recruitment yield  at weekly meetings  with the study 
team .  Issues such as maintaining confidentiality and privacy of participants during screening, 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
16      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 assessment and data collection , protocol deviations and adverse events will be reviewed.  For serious 
adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713058].  
  Study coordinator/research assistant:  T
 his bachelors level individual will carry out the screening 
and informed consent, and they will provide additional study information, all under the supervision of the PI.  The individual will be trained in screening, administering consent and information to the participants. Questions about eligibility will be discussed with the PI. This individual will administer surveys and neuropsychological tests, monitor the participants during the procedure and administer the tACS stimulation.  They will receive training in the administration of tACS  to ensure they can 
safely operate the device and are aware of potential side effects. They will conduct any necessary follow-up safety  review s. 
 Clinical Assessor:   S
 creenings will include thorough assessment of psychiatric health by a masters-
level clinician with experience in administration of psychiatric interviews.  They will ensure the absence of any neuropsychiatric conditions in the subjects, as well as health conditions that would be a contra -indication to TMS or MRI procedures. 
 
8.3
 Frequency and type of other study monitoring:  
Institutional Review Board monitoring: Approval of all procedures, advertisements and materials 
given to subjects will be secured from the University of Michigan IRBMED.  Annual reviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_113877], including the number of subjects screened, enrolled and withdrawn.  The IRB will also review protocol deviations, adverse events (according to the reporting timetable of IRBMED) and complaints that arise in connection with the study.  Data monitoring:  D
 ata entry will be audited by [CONTACT_464], who were not involved in primary data 
entry. Patient questionnaire data will be entered largely through electronic data capture, e.g., REDCap.  Research data will be maintained on password protected computers, behind UM firewalls. 
All enrolled participants will receive participant identifiers, which will be used to code all research records for this project.  Paper records with no identifying data beyond the research code are stored in locked cabinets in the PI’s office. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_713059]. Demographic data will be entered into spreadsheets, and behavioral data will be merged into files. Password- protected electronic files separated from the research data will track consents, 
including the link between the research identifier and individual participants. This tracking file will be the sole link between participant identifiers and research data. By [CONTACT_713076], research records can be effectively anonymized.  
8.4 M
anagement of withdrawals and drop- outs:  
When participants drop out during the assessment, but before enrollment, all data including consent form will be destroyed. However, if a participant would agree to be re-contact[CONTACT_7678], the consent form will be retained. Limited, de- identified data regarding ethnicity, age, gender, and 
diagnosis will be retained through the screening process in order to establish the sampling frame. If a participant drops out due to substance use but would otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, all data will be retained until the closing of the project, in case the participant becomes eligible and wishes to be reconsidered for the study before conclusion of recruitment. When participants drop out after 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
17      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 enrollment, data may be destroyed, depending upon the wishes of the participant. However, consent 
forms and the research number will be retained.  
 
9.0 BENEFITS /RISKS  
9.[ADDRESS_970460] patient privacy. Study staff will make every effort to limit identifiable information on potential subjects during recruitment.  Conversations in which a patient's name [CONTACT_242356], e.g. to determine potential eligibility, will occur in private settings of the clinic.  The minimum amount of information will be recorded, and staff are alerted to the dangers of printing, faxing and emailing sensitive information.  Phone conversations with potential research subjects will occur behind closed doors, and staff will ask callers if they are in a location where sensitive 
information can be discussed without danger of revealing confidential information.  Any information gathered on subjects who prove ineligible will be destroyed as soon as possible (a list of patients who have declined or screened out will be maintained through the recruitment phase to avoid contact[CONTACT_713077]).  
9.2.2 Known Potential Risks and Minimization of Risks 
(1) Confidentiality risks and Protected Health Information (rare) - Loss of confidentiality around sensitive information such as psychiatric status, history of substance abuse, etc.  
Minimization of Risk : 
• Investigators and research staff who are responsible for conduct, management, and oversight 
of the study will be required to fulfill all training requirements for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). All investigators and research staff will be required to handle protected health information as outlined by [CONTACT_154213] (HIPAA).  
• Confidentiality of participant records is assured by [CONTACT_20526] a research code and identifying all computer and paper files only by [CONTACT_273995], except for a single tracking file. Paper records are kept in locked drawers in a locked room and electronic recor ds are kept on secure server, 
to which only authorized research personnel have access.  
• Screening forms for subjects who do not qualify for the study will be destroyed, except for anonymous information (such as age, gender and education).  
• After the completion of data analysis, the record linking subjects to the research codes will be destroyed, thereby [CONTACT_713078]. 
(2) Risk of psychological discomfort, stress, or symptom exacerbation (infrequent) - Risks of psychological discomfort associated with the questions asked in the clinical interview or on some of the questionnaires. 
Minimization of Risk : 
• During the assessment process, subjects are reminded that they do not have to answer questions that make them feel uncomfortable. 
tACS Study (HUM00208557) 
 
18      v.3 3- 23-2023
  
  
 • Participants are also reminded during the study that they may choose to terminate 
participation at any time throughout the study. 
• Staff will check in with the participant frequently to if they are alright. Breaks will be offered 
to reduce any fatigue or stress . 
(3) Risk of symptom worsening, suicidal thoughts, plans, and intentions (rare). 
Minimization of Risk : 
• Clinically trained study staff will be alert for the emergence of new suicidal thoughts 
amongst enrolled subjects during the course of participation.  
• In the event of concerns about suicide risk (revealed during the assessment phase), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713060], and plans will be formulated for additional emergency evaluation at the psychiatric emergency room (University of Michigan Psychiatric Emergency Services), if appropriate (see Appendix A – MiScanlab Suicide Protocol) 
Risks
 associated with completing the EEG:  
 
(4) Discomfort or anxiety with EEG (infrequent) - The electrode application procedure involves putting gel on your head to help the wires measure brain signals. The gel will seem wet, which some people find slightly uncomfortable. There is also a minor risk of discomfort or anxiety/panic from being in the confined space for the EEG measurement. 
Minimization of Risk:  Participants can check the EEG measurement equipment and room to 
check if they will feel comfortable before agreeing to participate. They are also free to stop the study at any time if they become too uncomfortable.  
(5) Risk of boredom, fatigue, or discomfort (likely) - It is possible that participants will become 
fatigued, frustrated, or uncomfortable.  
Minimization of Risk:  Participants are reminded during the study that they may choose to take 
a break or terminate participation at any time throughout the study. 
 Risk associated with tACS:  
 
(6) Risk of Injury and Discomfort (mild and temporary) - The side effects of tACS are mild and transient; the participant may report mild tingling, burning, or itching under the electrode sites.  
Minimization of risk:  
• To monitor mild side effects, we will be administering a stimulation questionnaire after each stimulation session to determine whether these effects were experienced and at what intensity.  
• Research personnel present during these sessions will also check in with the participant periodically during the stimulation to see whether they are comfortable. If participant is experiencing severe discomfort (as determined by [CONTACT_187927]- report), the 
stimulation will be stopped immediately.   If procedure becomes intolerable for the participant, the stimulation will be stopped. They may request a break from the procedures and/or may decline to answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable.

 10.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND AUDITS  
10.1  Audits and Inspections  
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its conduct 
or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory authority, the study staff must immediately inform IRB, Medical School Re gulatory Affairs, MIAP, etc.   
10.2  Event Windows, Missed Assessments, Missed Sessions and Protocol Deviation Reporting 
Any safety -related assessments ( AE Questionnaire, etc.) which are missed will be reported to the IRB 
as a protocol deviation. For the other assessments, missing assessments will not be reported as protocol deviations unless they constitute > 10% of the total assessments. The time elapsed between the initial a ssessment and tACS  sessions are intended to be approximately 1 week, but scheduling 
logistics may mean this is not possible for all subjects , and may be longer for some (~ 30 days). 
These deviations are expected to be minor and will not be reported, although they will be recorded. These allowances should affect neither the scientific integrity nor the safety monitoring provisions of the protocol. 
11.[ADDRESS_970461] (IRB) 
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information to be provided to subjects, must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted IRB. Any amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
11.[ADDRESS_970462] will be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
 This informed consent will be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it and should be given a copy  (electronic or paper form)  of the signed document. No subject can enter 
the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol and will be submitted for IRB approval.

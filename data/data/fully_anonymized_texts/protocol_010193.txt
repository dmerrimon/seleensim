U1 Technical Plan 9 -25-17 clean   Page 2 of 13 OVERVIEW  
Protocol U is a short -term evaluation of combination intravitreous corticosteroid + anti -VEGF 
treatment for persistent central -involved diabetic macular edema following anti -VEGF therapy.  
 
All potential study participants were required to participate in a 12 -week run -in phase. In order to 
enter the run -in phase, all eligibility criteria were assessed and met. During the run -in phase, 
study eyes received 3 study ranibizumab 0.3mg injections appro ximately 4 weeks apart. At the 
end of the run -in phase, eligible study eyes that still met eligibility criteria were randomly 
assigned to one of the two treatment groups: A) sham + intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3mg  
[ranibizumab group] , or B) dexamethasone int ravitreal implant + intravitreous ranibizumab 
0.3mg  [combination group] . Study participants may have one or two study eyes. Study 
participants with two study eyes were randomly assigned to receive continued anti -VEGF 
therapy (ranibizumab) in one eye and de xamethasone intravitreal implant + ranibizumab in the 
other eye. Study duration was [ADDRESS_484651] randomization.

(100 imputations) for change in visual acuity at [ADDRESS_484653] randomization follow -up visits, 
accounting for treatment group  assignment , randomization visual acuity  
value , laterality and improvement in visual acui ty during run -in phase.

group comparison of mean change in visual acuity at 24 weeks from 
randomization . (%MIAnaly zeMeanMixed  macro)  
 Truncated c hange in visual acuity letter scores at 24 weeks will be 
fitted as the dependent variable, and the treatment group as the 
independent variable, adjusting for randomization visual acuity 
value, randomization stratification factors (laterality and 
improvement in visual acuity during run -in phase as defined in the 
protocol) by [CONTACT_386809] a fixed effect in the model. A 
random subject effect will be included to adjust for the correlation 
between eyes of participants who have two randomized eyes  
(assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure) .

assumption s including residual analysis , goodness of fit and 
influence d iagnostics  [not in text ]

adjusted mean difference, 95% confidence interval, and P-
value from treatment group comparison  [Table 2 ] 
 Assessment of confounding : Impute the outcome accounting for 
additional pre -specified potential co nfounding factors, including 
age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c levels, retinal thickening on 
OCT, and diabetic retinopathy severity on clinical exam. All 
categorical covariates with more than [ADDRESS_484654] hoc assessment: impute the data with additional 
factors including lens status (pseudophakic vs. phakic) and 
number of anti -VEGF injections  (3 vs. more than 3 
injections)  within 20 weeks prior to run -in. Mimic the pre-
specified anal ysis above by [CONTACT_386810] a time . [Table 2 Footnote ]

visual acuity at 24 weeks by [CONTACT_386811]. [ not in text ] 
 Per-protocol analysis  [eTable 2 ] 
o As specified in the statistical analysis plan, the per -protocol 
analysis will mimic the primary analysis limiting the cohort 
to 24 -week completers who had available data and received  
all required injections at the completed visits without 
receiving any non -protocol treatment.  No imputation will 
be performed.  
U1 Technical Plan 9 -25-17 clean   Page 7 of 13 o Report mean ± SD and median [IQR] by [CONTACT_1570] ,

o All sensitivity analyses will mimic the primary analysis 
model using imputed data .  
 Pre-specified sensitivity analysis will be performed 
and stratified by [CONTACT_386812].  
 Post hoc sensitivity analysis will exclude all 
patients at Site 194.  
 Note: this was at recommendation of 
DSMC, after review of cases of ineligible 
participants  enrolled at that site discovered 
at a site visit.  
 Subgroup analysis  (%subgrpMixed  macro):   
o Pre-specified subgroup analysis will evaluate the  effects of  
following baseline factors: lens status  [eFigure 2 ], 
improvement in visual acuity during run -in phase  [eFigure 
3], and improvement in OCT during run -in phase  [eFigure 
4]. [eTable 3 ] 
o Post hoc subgroup analysis will mimic the pre -specified 
subgroup analysis to examine the effect of  the following 
baseline factors: randomization visual acuity ( <64 vs. ≥64 
letters), and number of prior anti -VEGF injections within 
20 weeks prior to run -in (3 vs. 4 or more  injections) . 
[eTable 4] 
o The subgroup analysis will mimic the primary analysis 
adding an interaction between subgroup and treatment to 
the primary mixed model  using observed data only . 
 Report the P-value for the interaction term. Report 
mean ± SD and median [IQR] by [CONTACT_386813].  
 Report adjusted treatment group mean difference  
and 95% confidence interval from treatment group 
comparison within each subgroup. Only in the 
presence of a significant interaction term ( P<0.05) 
the within -group  P-value will be reported.  
o The effect of gender and race/ethnicity will be explored  in 
the same way as the subgroup factors listed above. [ not in 
text] 
iii. Secondary outcomes  [Table 2] :

adjustment for same covariates in the  primary analysis and use  
U1 Technical Plan 9 -25-17 clean   Page 8 of 13 generalized estimating equations to account for correlation 
between eyes of bilateral participants. All will  be analyzed using 
imputed data  (%MIAnalyzeBinary  macro) . 
o When binomial regression model failed to converge, a 
hierarchy is used to remove the covariates: laterality  
improvement in visual acuity during run -in phase  
randomization visual acuity letter score.  
 This hierarchy was chosen based on judgment 
regarding theorized existence and strength of 
association with the outcome (least important  
most important)  
o Report the observed No. (%) by [CONTACT_1570], adjusted 
difference in proportions, 95% confidence interval, and P-

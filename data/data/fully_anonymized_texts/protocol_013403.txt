Study treatments and 
visits: Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis (permuted blocks of four)  to 
receive either api[INVESTIGATOR_199025]-la bel fashion. 
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_199026]: orally administered, at the dose of 10 mg bid for 7  days, 
followed by 5 mg bid (total period of treatment: si x months) 
 
Dalteparin group: subcutaneously administered, at a dose of 200 IU/kg 
SC o.i.d  for 1 month. Thereafter, dalteparin will be adminis tered at a 
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 7dose of 150 IU/kg o.i.d. for 5 months (total period of treatment: six 
months). The maximum daily dose allowed for daltepa rin is 18,000IU.  
 
Randomization will be centralized and stratified by : 
 
1) symptomatic vs. unsuspected VTE 
2) active cancer vs. history of cancer  
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 5mg will be supplied by [CONTACT_199070]-coated tablets.  
 
Dalteparin will be supplied by [CONTACT_199071]-use pre- filled 
syringes. 
 
The study requires the following scheduled visits: at enroll ment, at 4 
weeks, at 3 months, at 6 months, at the end of study treatment whenever 
it occurs, and at 7 months from randomization. 
Addi tional visits will be performed if new symptoms and /or signs of 
VTE or major bleeding develop. A clinical examination and objective 
tests will be performed if the patient develops symptoms or signs 
suggestive of recurrent VTE.  
Planned Sample Size: The study has been designed to test the hypothesis that  api[INVESTIGATOR_199027]- inferior to dalteparin with respect to the primary efficacy 
outcome. 
The criteria for non-inferiority require that the u pper limit of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval of the Hazard ratio i s below the pre-
specified margin of 2.00. 
With the use of an estimated incidence of the prima ry efficacy outcome 
of 7% at [ADDRESS_237414] 80% po wer to show the non-
inferiority of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], at a one-sided alpha level  of 0.025. This sample 
will be increased to 1168 patients to account for u p to 20% lost in total 
patient-years. This estimate is consistent with a d rop-out rate of 40% 
assuming patients discontinued uniformly during the  follow- up (mean 
discontinuation time equal to 3 months) 
 
Statistical Analysis:  Analysis of the Primary Study Outcome 
 
The primary efficacy data set will consist of all r andomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of the study drugs ( modified intent-to 
treat population) with a non-missing primary outcom e. Subjects will 
be categorized to the group to which they were assi gned at 
randomization , reg ardless of the treatment actually received.

 8The secondary efficacy data sets will consist of a)  all randomized 
subjects (intent-to treat population) and b) the pe r-protocol population 
(defined in the SAP). 
The safety data set will consist of all treated sub jects (randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study dr ug).  
The primary efficacy variable, i.e. the time from r andomization to the 
first recurrent thromboembolic event, will be analy zed after adjusting 
estimates for the competing risk of death unrelated  to VTE.  
The evaluation of the primary objective will be don e by [CONTACT_199072] (event of interest) or to the occurrence of d eath unrelated to 
VTE (nuisance/competing event) or to the last follo w-up if neither a 
recurrent thromboembolic event nor a competing even t occurred 
within the intended 6-month study treatment period (censored time).   
 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be p erformed using the 
modified intent-to-treat principle, the intent-to t reat principle and the 
per protocol principle. The modified intent-to-trea t and the intent-to-
treat analyses of the primary endpoint will include  endpoints that occur 
at any time from randomization until the end of the ir originally 
intended treatment period regardless of whether sub jects were 
receiving study medication.  
A per protocol analysis of the primary endpoint wil l include endpoints 
that occur in patients who complete the study fully  compliant with the 
protocol and without any major violation or deviati on (defined in the 
SAP). 
For the secondary efficacy outcomes, analyses will be performed 
using the primary efficacy data set.  
 
The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-comparator Hazard Ratio adjusted fo r the competing 
risk of death unrelated to VTE will be computed wit h associated two-
sided 95% Confidence Interval by [CONTACT_199073] F ine & Gray 
regression model (Fine and Gray, 1999) using treatm ent group and 
center as dummy covariates.  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_199028]-inferior to the com parator dalteparin 
if the upper two-sided 95% confidence limit of haza rd ratio is < 2.00. 
Superiority of api[INVESTIGATOR_199029]. dalteparin will be test ed as a secondary 
analysis of the primary endpoint, only after non-in feriority has been 
demonstrated for the experimental treatment group ( api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) relative 
to the standard treatment group (dalteparin). Accor ding to 
CPMP/EWP/482/99 document entitled: "Points to consi der on 
switching between superiority and non-inferiority",  switching the 
api[INVESTIGATOR_199029]. dalteparin contrast from the non-infer iority objective to 
the superiority objective is feasible because the t rial is properly 
designed in accordance to the strict requirements o f a non-inferiority 
trial.

 9For the purpose of safety analyses, subjects will b e categorized to the 
group to which they were assigned at randomization unless incorrect 
study treatment was received throughout the study, in which case the 
subject will be categorized according to the treatm ent received. 
All safety analyses will be conducted on the safety  population. The 
term “treatment period” refers to the period betwee n the first 
administration of study drug and [ADDRESS_237415] administration 
of study drug. This period will be the basis for th e summaries of 
safety.

 14 2.  INTRODUCTION 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common clinical e vent in patients with cancer. The 
development of VTE is presumed to be due to the pro duction of pro-coagulant molecules 
by [CONTACT_199074]-coagulant effect of cancer cells spread into the circulation. It 
should be taken into account that cancer surgery an d chemotherapy are associated with a 
substantial increase in the risk of VTE. Moreover, the risk for recurrence both while on 
anticoagulant therapy and after its discontinuation  was shown to be particularly high in 
patients with cancer associated VTE (1). The risk f or bleeding complications on 
anticoagulant treatment is also higher in cancer pa tients than in non-cancer patients such 
making crucial the balance between benefit and risk  (1).  
The CLOT study, performed more than 15 years ago, s howed that in patients with cancer-
associated VTE, anticoagulant treatment with the lo w-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 
dalteparin was more effective and similarly safe co mpared to vitamin K antagonists (2). 
These results were confirmed in studies with a more  limited number of patients (3). Thus, 
current guidelines recommend the use of LMWH, given  subcutaneously, for the acute and 
long-term treatment of VTE in cancer patients (4-5) . In the recently published CATCH 
study in cancer patients, the LMWH tinzaparin was a ssociated with a non-significant 35% 
risk reduction in recurrence of VTE compared to vit amin K antagonists (6). In the CATCH 
study, there were no differences in the incidence o f major bleeding between the two 
treatment groups.  
Due to the high risk for recurrence, cancer patient s who experience VTE are candidates to 
indefinite treatment duration or to prolong treatme nt until cancer is completely cured (4-
5).  The availability of an oral anticoagulant trea tment, as effective and safe as LMWH, 
would be a substantial advantage for patients with cancer who develop VTE. During the 
last years, new oral anticoagulants given at fixed doses without the need of laboratory 
monitoring and dose adjustment were shown to be as effective as and probably safer than 
vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE (7).  The results of phase III clinical trials 
led to their approval for the acute and long-term t reatment of VTE. Unfortunately, the 
clinical trials on the treatment of VTE with the ne w oral anticoagulants included only a 
limited number of patients with cancer. Thus, wheth er the results obtained in the general 
population of patients with VTE also attain to canc er patients remains undefined.  
Subgroup analyses on the efficacy and safety profil e of the anti-Xa oral agent api[INVESTIGATOR_199031] r ecently reported (8-11). In these patients, 
with all the limitations related to a subgroup anal ysis, api[INVESTIGATOR_199032] n K antagonists (10). A recent meta-
analysis in cancer patients showed a similar effica cy and safety profile of new oral 
anticoagulants in comparison with LMWH given with a nd followed by [CONTACT_1996] K 
antagonists for the treatment of VTE (12).

5. STUDY OUTCOMES 
5.1 Efficacy outcomes 
The primary efficacy outcome is objectively confirm ed recurrent proximal DVT or PE 
occurring during the study treatment period, that m eans the composite of: 
 
a)  ipsilateral proximal DVT of the lower limbs (sy mptomatic or unsuspected):  
A recurrent proximal DVT must be distinguished from  the original thrombus by [CONTACT_199077] (compression ultrasonogra phy, venography, CT venography, or 
MR venography). In order to be classified as a recu rrent event, there must be one or more 
new filling defect evident on the second imaging te st not evident on the original images, 
or an interval imaging test clearly showing thrombu s resolution; only in symptomatic 
patients, if the venous segment was non-compressibl e at randomization, a substantial 
increase (4 mm or more) in diameter of the thrombus  during full compression.  
 
b)  contralateral proximal DVT of the lower limbs ( symptomatic or 
unsuspected):  
In order to be classified as a recurrent event, the re must be one or more new filling defects 
at compression ultrasonography, venography, CT veno graphy, or MR venography. 
Unsuspected thrombus must be evident on the second imaging test and not evident on the 
original images.  
 
c)  DVT of the upper limbs (symptomatic)  
 
In order to be classified as a recurrent event, the re must be one or more new filling defects 
at compression ultrasonography, venography, CT veno graphy, or MR venography.  
 
d) pulmonary embolism (symptomatic or unsuspected):   
 
-  Symptoms of PE with one of the following finding s: 
•  a new intraluminal filling defect at CT pulmonary angiography; 
•  a new intraluminal filling defect, or an extension  of an existing defect, or a 
new sudden cut-off of vessels more than 2.5 mm in d iameter at pulmonary angiogram;

FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 19 •  a new perfusion defect of at least 75% of a segmen t with a local normal 
ventilation result (high probability) on ventilatio n/perfusion lung scan (VQ scan); 
•  inconclusive CT pulmonary angiography, pulmonary a ngiography, or VQ 
scan evidence of a new or recurrent PE with demonst ration of a new or recurrent DVT 
in the lower extremities by [CONTACT_199078]. 
 
- Fatal PE defined as PE based on objective diagnos tic testing before death or autopsy; 
death where PE is the most probable cause of a sudd en and unexplained death according 
to central adjudication. 
 
- In unsuspected PE, in order to be classified as a  recurrent event, there must be one or 
more new filling defect in segmental or more-proxim al arteries at CT pulmonary 
angiography evident on the second study not appreci ated on previous images or an interval 
study clearly showing emboli resolution. 
 
The secondary efficacy outcomes of the study are: 
• the individual components of the primary efficacy o utcome ; 
• symptomatic recurrence of VTE; 
• all cause death; 
• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus majo r bleeding; 
• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus majo r bleeding plus all cause death; 
• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus all cause death; 
• any major cardiovascular event, fatal or not fatal (including acute myocardial 
infarction 1 or ischemic stroke 2); 
• all venous thromboembolic events (including splanch nic vein thrombosis and cerebral 
vein thrombosis both objectively assessed); 
• Quality of Life (QoL), assessed by [CONTACT_199079] i-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) 
(see Appendix 2).

6.5. Withdrawn/discontinuation of Subjects from The rapy 
 
6.5.1. Reasons for Withdrawal/Early Discontinuation  
 
A subject may discontinue or interrupt study drug f or a number of reasons including, but 
not limited to, those listed below: 
 
•  Permanent Discontinuation 
- Death; 
- Withdrawal of consent as defined in Section 6.5.2 ; 
- Pregnancy  
- Lost to follow-up as defined in Section 6.5.3 (ev ery attempt will be made by [CONTACT_199090] "lost to follow-u p"); 
- CrCL decrease to < 30 mL/min, confirmed by [CONTACT_199091] 1 week later 
or need for kidney dialysis; 
- Investigator judgment due to: 
SAE or other safety concern e.g., 
- Major life-threatening bleeding 
- Onset of clinical jaundice or other overt signs o f liver toxicity 
- Unfavorable benefit-to-risk evaluation for contin uing anticoagulant 
treatment 
- Termination of all or part of the study by [CONTACT_199092]. 
 
•  Temporary Discontinuation 
Temporary discontinuations of api[INVESTIGATOR_199041] 3 or more consecutive days will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
Potential reasons may include: 
- Short-term use of prohibited concomitant medicati ons (see Appendix 1); 
- Surgical procedures; 
- Any medical condition where continuing study drug  may expose the subject to an  
increased hazard; 
- New onset of elevated liver enzymes in the absenc e of a known cause: 
- ALT > 8 × ULN 
- AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_237429] > [ADDRESS_237430] > [ADDRESS_237431] with TBL > [ADDRESS_237432] 
- New onset or deteriorating renal failure <30ml/h

Proprietary & Confidential 
 27 - Platelet count < 50x10 9/L (50,000/mm 3) 
 
In patients receiving Dalteparin who experience pla telet counts between 50,000 and 
100,000/mm 3, the daily dose of Dalteparin should not be discon tinued but reduced until 
the platelet count recovers to ≥100,000/mm 3. Please refer to your local product package 
insert for dosing reduction guidance for this patie nt population. 
 
During a study drug discontinuation, a subject can be placed on antithrombotic therapy per 
local guidelines and the investigator's discretion.   
Post-randomization changes (other than CrCL decreas ed to < 30 mL/min or need for kidney 
dialysis) in health status related to study exclusi on criteria should not automatically lead to 
study drug interruption or discontinuation unless c ontinuing study drug places the subject 
at undue hazard as determined by [CONTACT_093]. Such situations should be handled on a 
case-by-case basis. It is strongly recommended that  the investigator consults with the 
dedicated Medical Support Line (telephone number: + 39 [PHONE_4292]) if a subject has a 
post randomization change in health status that is associated with an exclusion criterion. 
Also, a decision to stop prematurely the overall re cruitment in the study and/or intake of 
study drug can be taken by [CONTACT_19305]/ Promoter following advice on safety 
aspects of the study by [CONTACT_4318]. The IECs/IRBs wil l be informed of this decision. The 
DSMB stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_199042] t he start of the study. The Promoter has 
the right to close the study and the right to close  a center, at any time, although this should 
occur only after consultation between involved part ies and the Executive Committee. The 
IECs/IRBs must be informed. Should the site be clos ed prematurely, all study materials 
(except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be returned to the Promoter. 
The investigator will retain all other documents un til notification by [CONTACT_199093]. 
If the subject is withdrawn due to an adverse event , the investigator will follow the subject 
until the adverse event has resolved or stabilized.  
 
 
Emergency Surgery 
If an urgent surgical intervention is needed, antic oagulant therapy should be discontinued 
and the surgery should be deferred, if possible, un til at least [ADDRESS_237433] administration of anticoagulant ther apy. There is no reversal agent for 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. Protamine can be used to (partially) reve rse the effect of dalteparin. Depending 
upon the clinical situation and local availability,  the use of coagulation factors or other 
measures can be considered in case of the recent in take of api[INVESTIGATOR_199043]. It is recommended to consult the Medical  Support Line (telephone number: +39 
[PHONE_4292]) in case of urgent surgery.

continuing on study medication (but continuing to b e followed on study) versus withdrawal 
of consent with regards to discontinuing the study all together (i.e., withdrawal of consent 
with regards to continuing on study medication and any further study follow-up). 
Only subjects who refuse all [ADDRESS_237436] withdrawn consent from study participation:

withdrawal of consent to ALL of the above methods o f follow-up. 
The site will complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date 
of consent withdrawal and including the date of the  final dose of study drug. The reason(s) 
for limited follow-up/data collection will be clear ly documented in the medical record and 
eCRF. 
Public databases and subject finder services may be  used to determine subject status and 
to locate potential lost to follow-up patients.

7. DATA QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
7.1.   Requirements for investigational sites and s taff    
The investigator should be able to demonstrate (e.g ., based on retrospective data) a 
potential for recruiting the required number of sui table subjects within the agreed 
recruitment period.    
The investigator should have sufficient time to pro perly conduct and complete the trial 
within the agreed trial period.    
The investigator should have available an adequate number of qualified staff trained on 
protocol procedures and adequate facilities for the  foreseen duration of the trial to conduct 
the trial properly and safely.   
 
7.2. Direct access to Source Data/Documents  
Original data, also known as source data/records, a re those data elements that represent 
the first recording of study data. Original data co ntain all the information that is necessary 
for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.  Examples of original data are 1) 
subject's information used in a clinical trial whet her collected on paper or electronically

 [ADDRESS_237442]'s visit, 2) certified co pi[INVESTIGATOR_63062], 3) observations, 
and 4) laboratory data from clinical laboratories. Clinical investigators maintain control 
over source data from inception to the end of the r egulatory retention period. The 
investigator must permit access to these data durin g Exom Site Monitor’s monitoring 
visits, audits, ECs reviews, and regulatory inspect ions.  
In addition to original records maintained by [CONTACT_941] c linical site as part of their standard 
practices of patient care, this study requires that  certified  electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309]: 
a) the index VTE event (qualifying imaging) and of cancer diagnosis (histology reports)

to be uploaded by [CONTACT_199101] a dedicated  eSource repository, independent from 
the study database, access to which is controlled b y the qualified investigative site staff.  
Only authorized Exom Group users can get access to these eSource documents and 
provide in an anonymized format, to the Clinical Ev ent Adjudication Committee (CEC) 
for review and classification, those documents rela ted to clinical events and diagnoses.   
 
 
7.3. Investigator Site File and archiving   
The investigator will be provided with an access to  an electronic investigator site file 
(eISF) at the start of the trial. The investigator will archive all trial data and relevant 
correspondence in the ISF. The ISF, all source data  and all documents will be kept filed 
according to the requirements of the ICH-GCP guidel ines not only during the study period 
but also after its termination.     
It is responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the subject-identification sheets and 
the originally signed informed consent forms are pr operly stored for at least 15 years 
beyond the end of the clinical trial.   
 
 
 
 
 
7.4. Monitoring   
Monitoring procedures will be followed, in order to  comply with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines. Three different types of monitori ng activities will be performed by [CONTACT_199102]: on site, remote and central monitori ng. 
Each center will be visited at regular intervals by  a CRO Site Monitor to ensure 
compliance with the study protocol, GCP and legal a spects. This will include on-site 
checking of the electronic case report forms (eCRF)  for completeness and clarity, cross-
checking with source documents, and clarification o f administrative matters.

Moreover, remote monitoring by [CONTACT_199103].   
The risk for the occurrence of quality and safety i ssues will be regularly and centrally 
monitored through the use of a “Risk Based Monitori ng & Management” (RBM) 
platform. For each of following six risk categories : 1) site management quality, 2) data 
quality, 3) data timeliness, 4) source documents ve rification, 5) milestone delay, 6) 
subject safety, study specific risk indicators and related scores will be defined and closely 
and centrally monitored during the entire study per iod. This will allow prompt and 
targeted remedial actions.

9. ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1     Definition 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence o r 
worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a c linical investigation subject 
administered study drug and that does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable a nd unintended sign (such as an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of 
study drug, whether or not considered related to th e study drug. 
The causal relationship to study drug is determined  by a physician and should be used to 
assess all adverse events (AE). The causal relation ship can be one of the following: 
•  Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE. 
•  Not related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means the re is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or eli cited during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject (in order t o prevent reporting bias, subjects should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence  of one or more AEs). 
 
9.1.1     Serious Adverse Events 
A S erious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 34 •  results in death; 
•  is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an e vent which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it was more severe);  
•  requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199046] (see 
NOTE below); 
•  results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity; 
•  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
•  is an important medical event (defined as a medica l event(s) that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may je opardize the subject or may 
require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to p revent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or seizures that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical 
event.  
 
Although not always serious adverse events by [CONTACT_199108], the following events 
must be handled as SAEs: pregnancy, overdose, newly  diagnosed cancer, exposure (to 
fetus) during pregnancy, exposure (to infant) durin g lactation, and paternal exposure, 
overdose, abuse, misuse, off-label use, occupationa l exposure, medication error and 
potential medication error, suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., any 
organism, virus or infectious particle pathogenic o r non-pathogenic, via the medicinal 
product). 
 
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199047] S AEs in FADOI Foundation clinical 
studies: 
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199048] 24-hour 
duration, that does not result in admission (unless  considered an important 
medical or life-threatening event); 
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent;  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/su rgical procedure; 
• routine health assessment requiring admission for b aseline/trending of health 
status (e.g., routine colonoscopy); 
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill  health and planned prior to 
entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases;  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance  that carries no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/surgical inte rvention (e.g., lack of housing,

 35 economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circ umstances, administrative 
reason); 
• admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other 
SAEs (applies to protocols involving cancer patient s). 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_237446] (AESI ) 
In this study, the following adverse events of spec ial interest (AESI) are to be reported to 
CRO/Promoter immediately, regardless of whether the se reports are classified as serious 
or unexpected: 
• potential or suspected cases of liver injury includ ing but not limited to liver test 
abnormalities, jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis. 
 
9.1.3 Bleeding Outcomes 
All major bleedings defined as: 
• a decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dl or more; 
• a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red bloo d cells; 
• bleeding that occurs in at least one of the followi ng critical sites    [intracranial, 
intra-spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular (within the corpus of the  eye; thus, a conjunctival 
bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, in tra-articular, intramuscular 
with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal];  
• bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event  that the independent Clinical 
Event Adjudication Committee determined was the pri mary cause of death or 
contributed directly to death);  
• bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention 
 
and all clinically relevant non-major bleedings mus t be reported and will be reviewed 
and classified by [CONTACT_15741].   
 
9.1.4      Adverse Event Severity 
The following categories and definitions of intensi ty as determined by a physician should 
be used for all FADOI Foundation clinical study AEs : 
•  Mild (Grade 1)   Event which is well tolerated by [CONTACT_5363] d oes not 
interfere with normal daily activities; 
•  Moderate (Grade 2)  Event which results in discomfort for the patient and 
impairs his/her normal activities; 
•  Severe (Grade 3)  Medically significant but not immediately life-thr eatening ; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111] ; disabling and 
resulting in substantial impairment of normal activ ities of the subject; 
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 36 •  Very Severe (Grade 4)  Life-threatening consequences ; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
 
9.1.5  Clarification of the difference in meaning between "serious" and "severe" 
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous  but are often used interchangeably. 
The term ‘severe’ is often used to describe the int ensity (severity) of a specific event; the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor s ignificance (such as severe headache). 
This is not the same as “serious”, which is based o n subject/event outcome or action 
criteria usually associated with events that pose a  threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for de fining regulatory reporting obligations. 
9.1.6 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
An adverse drug reaction is any noxious and uninten ded response to an investigational 
medicinal product (the causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse 
event is at least a reasonable possibility). 
9.1.7 Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) 
If there is a causal relationship between a serious  adverse event and trial medication, then 
the event is called serious adverse drug reaction ( SADR). 
9.1.8 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a serious adverse reaction which is unex pected. An unexpected serious 
adverse reaction is any adverse reaction, the natur e or severity of which is not consistent 
with the current Summary of Product Characteristics .

as determined by a physician should be used for all  FADOI Foundation clinical study 
AEs: 
• Certain:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. The event responds to withdrawal of inv estigational product (dechallenge), 
and recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasibl e. 
• Probable:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rech allenge is not required. 
• Possible:  There is reasonable causal relationship between th e investigational product 
and the AE. Dechallenge information is lacking or u nclear.

but there is not a reasonable causal relationship b etween the investigational product and 
the AE. 
• Not related:  There is not a temporal relationship to investigat ional product 
administration (too early, or late, or investigatio nal product not taken), or there is a

the following criteria:  
1) meet seriousness criteria;  
2) result in interruption or discontinuation of the  assigned study drug;  
3) meet criteria as a study outcome; or  
4) an event of special interest. 
All laboratory, vital sign, or electrocardiogram (E CG) values should be evaluated by [CONTACT_199109]. Isola ted abnormal laboratory results or vital 
sign findings or ECG findings should be reported as  AEs if they are symptomatic, result 
in study drug discontinuation, require corrective t reatment, or are otherwise defined as an 
AE of Special Interest (AESI).  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings  associated with the subject’s cancer 
or other pre-existing conditions will not be report ed as AEs or SAEs unless judged by [CONTACT_199110] s ubject’s condition and meet the criteria 
for targeted AE and SAE reporting.  
Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vit al signs that are out of range) that were 
diagnosed or known to exist prior to informed conse nt will be recorded as part of medical 
history.  
All SAEs occurring after informed consent for study  participation has been obtained, 
which are considered not related with the subject’s  cancer or other pre-existing conditions,

 38 are to be reported according to the procedures for Serious Adverse Event Reporting-
Procedure for Investigators. 
A preplanned (prior to signing the Informed Consent  Form) procedure or treatment 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing conditio ns which do not worsen in severity 
should not be reported as SAEs.  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of de ath should always be reported as an 
SAE. When a subject dies from disease progression o f pre-existing cancer with no other 
immediate causes, “disease progression” should be r eported as an SAE. In addition, any 
serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent t o the reporting period that the 
Investigator assesses as related to study drug shou ld also be reported and managed as an 
SAE. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or eli cited during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. In order t o prevent reporting bias, subjects should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence  of one or more AEs. If known, the 
diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder sho uld be recorded, rather than its 
individual symptoms. The following information shou ld be captured for all AEs: onset, 
duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to i nvestigational product, action taken and 
treatment required and outcome. If treatment for th e AE was administered, it should be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  
The Investigator’s assessment must be clearly docum ented in the site’s source 
documentation with the Investigator’s signature. 
Investigator should follow subjects with AEs until the event has resolved or the condition 
has stabilized.  
In case of unresolved AEs including significant abn ormal laboratory values at the end of 
study assessment, these events will be followed up until resolution or until they become 
clinically not relevant. 
The investigator shall supply the Promoter and Ethi cs Committee with any additional 
requested information, notably for reported deaths of subjects. Possible additional 
information on the AE collected/identified during t he study will be reported on the eCRF.  
 
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_237450]’s or the legal representative ’s written consent to participate in the 
study, all AEs, SAEs, AESIs, bleeding outcomes and study outcomes will be captured in

Study outcomes are clinically anticipated events an d will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_199111]. Study 
outcomes (suspected recurrent DVT or PE, major blee dings, clinically relevant non-major 
bleedings, MI, stroke, and venous thrombotic events  at other locations) will be exempted

death, regardless of whether they are waived endpoi nt events, will be captured in the 
Promoter’s global safety database. 
The following types of events whether related or no t related to study drug, must be 
reported  within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness, to  the Contract Research 
Organization Exom Group : 
•   SAEs  
•   AESIs  
•   Severe Hypersensitivity  (Steven-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_199049])  
•   Overdose  
•   Pregnancies  
As a preferred method, all SAEs and Liver Enzyme ab normalities/dysfunction events, 
must be recorded on the eSAE Report Form  of the eCRF; while pregnancies on the 
ePregnancy Surveillance Form .  
The paper SAE/Pregnancy Surveillance forms are only  intended as a back-up option when 
the eCRF system is not accessible. In this case, th e original paper forms are to remain on

SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_3918]  
A SAE Telephone Contact [CONTACT_19649] [PHONE_4293]  is also available, in case of 
additional support.  
The initial SAE Report should be as complete as pos sible including the essential details 
of subject’s identification (Subject ID), the serio us adverse event (medical term, 
diagnosis), the trial medication and the assessment  of the causal relationship between the 
event and the trial medication. The SAE report must  be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_1275]. 
The investigator should provide related additional information on the clinical course and 
the outcome of each SAE as soon as possible (eSAE Follow-up Report). 
 
 
9.2.2 Notifying Regulatory Authorities, Investigato rs, and IRB/IEC   
The study Promoter FADOI Foundation will ensure tha t all legal reporting requirements 
are met, according to local laws and regulations. F urther, according to GCP, the study 
Promoter is responsible for the continuous safety e valuation of the product(s) investigated 
in the clinical trial. 
FADOI Foundation and/or Exom Group will notify the Competent Authorities and Ethics 
Committees of all SAEs that are suspected (certainl y, probably, or possibly related to the 
investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not previously described in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics), the so called Suspecte d, Unexpected Serious Adverse

 40 Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R, see Section 9.1.8). Notification o f these events will be in the form of 
an Expedited Safety Report  (ESR), to be delivered as soon as possible but not  later than 
15 calendar days if the event is non-fatal and 7 ca lendar days if it was fatal. 
All investigators will be informed, too. 
Other important findings which may be reported by t he study Promoter as an ESR 
include:  
• increased frequency of a clinically significant exp ected SAE;  
• a SAE considered associated with study procedures t hat could modify the conduct 
of the study;  
• important safety recommendations from the study Dat a and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB, see below), or  
• Promoter’s decision to end or temporarily halt a cl inical study for safety reasons. 
 
During the clinical trial duration, the Promoter wi ll submit to the Ethics Committee(s) 
and to the Competent Authorities, once a year, a st udy specific Development Safety 
Update Report (DSUR)  including a list of all serious adverse reactions.  
 
FADOI Foundation is also responsible for reporting of safety information to the 
marketing authorization holders (Bristol-Meyers Squ ibb and [COMPANY_007]) of the two 
investigational products.  
 
Work flow, procedures and responsibility concerning  SAE management will be described 
in a separate document named SDEA (Safety Data Exch ange Agreement) . 
 
All potential study outcomes (e.g. DVT, PE) and pot entially major or clinically relevant 
bleedings will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_130450] (CEC).  
The result of the adjudication will be a classifica tion of the event as  
- primary efficacy or safety endpoint or  
- no outcome.  
The classification will be recorded in the study da tabase. 
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will be established for this study, and 
responsible for monitoring of safety and efficacy d uring the course of the clinical trial. 
The recommendations of the DSMB with respect to the  study conduct will be presented 
to the study’s Steering Committee (SC),  in writing.

10.1. Sample Size / Power Determinations 
The study has been designed to test the hypothesis that api[INVESTIGATOR_199051]-inferior 
to dalteparin with respect to the primary efficacy outcome.  
The criteria for non-inferiority require that the u pper limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval of the Hazard ratio is below th e pre-specified margin of 2.00. 
With the use of an estimated incidence of the prima ry efficacy outcome of 7% at [ADDRESS_237454] 80% 
power to show the non-inferiority of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], at a  one-sided alpha level of 0.025. This 
sample will be increased to 1168 patients to accoun t for up to 20% lost in total patient-
years.  
This estimate is consistent with a drop-out rate of  40% assuming patients discontinued 
uniformly during the follow-up (mean discontinuatio n time equal to 3 months).    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2. Rationale for the event rates in the two trea tment arms  
Recurrence rate for dalteparin treated arm 
An event rate of 7% has been chosen according to th e findings of the CLOT and of the 
CATCH trials. 
Both studies used a prospective randomized open bli nded end-point (PROBE) design, 
had warfarin as the comparator vs LMWH, the same de finition for active cancer, the same 
inclusion criteria concerning initial thromboemboli c events, and the same treatment 
duration (6 months). Unlike the CLOT trial, in whic h dalteparin was given at a reduced 
dose after the first month, tinzaparin was given at  a full dose throughout the study period 
in the CATCH study. The primary composite efficacy outcome was symptomatic  HR Non-inferiority margin

 43 recurrent VTE in the CLOT trial and symptomatic rec urrent VTE plus unsuspected VTE 
in the CATCH trial. 
Reported incidence rates of recurrent VTE with LMWH  were slightly different between 
the two studies, being 8.0% with Dalteparin in the CLOT study and 7.2% with Tinzaparin 
in the context of the CATCH trial. The incidence of  recurrent VTE was higher in patients 
receiving warfarin in the CLOT trial (15.8%) than i n the CATCH trial (10.5%); a risk 
reduction for recurrent VTE with LMWH as compared w ith warfarin of 52% and 35% 
was reported in the two studies, respectively. The 6-month mortality was lower in 
CATCH compared with CLOT (32% vs 40%).   
The lower risk for recurrent VTE observed in the CA TCH trial may reflect critical 
differences in patient populations between the two studies. The prevalence of risk factors 
for recurrent thrombosis was lower in the CATCH as compared to the CLOT population 
and in particular fewer patients had metastatic dis ease (55% in CATCH vs 67% in CLOT), 
an ECOG performance status of 2 (23% for CATCH vs 3 6% for CLOT); less patients in 
the CATCH study received anticancer therapy (53% vs  78%), and had a previous history 
of thrombosis (6% vs 11%) compared with CLOT study.  Moreover, differences in 
primary tumor sites and associated anticancer treat ments, and the 10-year time gap 
between the 2 trials (during which cancer treatment s have evolved) might also have 
contributed to the different risk for recurrent VTE . 
From the timing context point of view, our patient population is presumed to be closer to 
that of the CATCH study (published in 2015) than to  the CLOT study (published in 2003). 
So it is plausible that patients enrolled in the Ca ravaggio study will receive less 
thrombogenic anticancer chemotherapy and improved d isease management, as well as 
they will have less frequently a metastatic disease , due to an earlier diagnosis (screening 
improvement), like in the CATCH trial. 
As a further support to our study hypothesis, the O NCENOX trial, published in 2006, 
compared Enoxaparin (1.0 mg/kg bid for 5 days + war farin for 6 months) vs Enoxaparin 
(1.0 mg/kg bid for 5 days followed by [CONTACT_199114] 1. 0 mg/kg od) (low dose – LD) with 
Enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg od (high dose - HD) for 6 mon ths) (13). The study was small with 
limited statistical power, and recurrent VTE was on ly a secondary objective. However, 
the rate of this endpoint was 6.9% with the LD and 6.3% with the HD of enoxaparin, 
therefore comparable to that observed in the CATCH trial. 
 
Recurrence rate for api[INVESTIGATOR_199052] a post hoc analysis of the Amplify study, 169 pa tients (3.1%) had active cancer at 
baseline and 365 (6.8%) had a history of cancer wit hout active cancer at baseline. Among 
patients with active cancer, recurrent VTE occurred  in 3.7% and 6.4% of evaluable 
patients in the api[INVESTIGATOR_199053]/warfarin gr oups, respectively (relative risk 0.56, 
95% confidence interval 0.13-2.37). Among patients with a history of cancer, recurrent 
VTE occurred in 1.1% and 6.3% of evaluable patients  in the api[INVESTIGATOR_199054]/warfarin groups, respectively (relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 
0.04-0.78). Based on these figures, and taking into  account that in the present study more

 44 patients with active cancer will be included, it is  expected that the recurrent VTE rate in 
the api[INVESTIGATOR_199055] 7-8% observed in the LMWH 
treated groups in CLOT and CATCH studies. 
 
10.3. Rationale for Non-inferiority margin (delta) choice 
The goal of this trial is to test a drug that could  lead to the more convenient oral route of 
administration and a trend towards better safety th an the currently recommended LMWH 
treatment for cancer patients with VTE (14), thus f ulfilling a gap within this therapeutic 
indication. In this situation, the choice of a rela tively “large” delta for efficacy might be 
accepted in exchange for the possible safety and co mpliance benefits, provided that a 
putative superiority to placebo is not left in doub t ( EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99 
Document. Guideline on the choice of non-inferiorit y margin. July 27, 2005 ). Based on 
these assumptions, the upper limit of the two-sided  95% confidence intervals of the 
Hazard ratio below the pre-specified margin of 2.00  planned for our study seems to us 
acceptable from a clinical and methodological point  of view.  
Further, it’s worth reminding that the non-inferior ity margins used in pi[INVESTIGATOR_199056] e following: 
•  1.5 for HOK[LOCATION_003]I-VTE (Edoxaban) (15) 
•  1.8 for AMPLIFY (Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) (16) 
•  2.0 for EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE (Rivaroxaban)  (17-18) 
•  2.75 for RECOVER I and II (Dabigatran) (19-20) 
 
All the above mentioned studies were considered val id by [CONTACT_199115] “t reatment of VTE”. 
 
10.4. Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomi zed patients.   
The primary efficacy data set will consist of all r andomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of the study drugs (modified intent-to tre at population). Subjects will be 
categorized to the group to which they were assigne d at randomization, regardless of the 
treatment actually received. 
Secondary efficacy data sets will consist of a) all  randomized subjects (intent-to treat 
population) and b) the per-protocol population. The  per-protocol population will be 
defined in the SAP. 
The safety data set (as-treated) will consist of al l treated subjects (randomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of study drug). For the purpose of safety analyses, subjects 
will be categorized to the group to which they were  assigned at randomization unless 
incorrect study treatment was received throughout t he study, in which case the subject 
will be categorized according to the treatment rece ived. 
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 45 A Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all patients in the FAS population who 
complete the study fully compliant with the protoco l and without any major violation / 
deviation. Patients in the PP population will be an alyzed according to the treatment they 
actually received. Efficacy analyses based on PP po pulation will be considered supportive.   
The Safety population will consist of all randomize d patients with at least one 
documented administration of any study drug. It wil l be the basis for the analyses of safety. 
Patients in the Safety population will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received. Of note, a statement that a patient exper ienced no adverse events also constitutes 
a safety assessment.   
10.5. Demographic and Baseline Data   
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics wi ll be summarized by [CONTACT_199116]. Continuous-scaled vari ables (e.g., age) will be summarized 
with means, medians, standard deviations, quartiles , and minimum and maximum values. 
Categorical variables (e.g., sex) will be summarize d using patient counts and percentages. 
Baseline medical histories and pre-existing conditi ons will be summarized by [CONTACT_199117][INVESTIGATOR_199057] (SOC s) and preferred terms in the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDR A). Medications taken after the 
informed consent form is signed and before randomiz ation will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570], based on mappi[INVESTIGATOR_199058] a nd generic terms in the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. 
10.6. Efficacy Analyses   
Analysis of Primary Endpoint   
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be p erformed using the modified intent-
to-treat and the intent-to treat principle and the per protocol principle. The modified 
intent-to-treat and the intent-to-treat analyses of  the primary endpoint will include 
endpoints that occur at any time from randomization  until the end of their originally 
intended treatment period regardless of whether sub jects were receiving study 
medication.  
The primary efficacy variable, i.e. the time from r andomization to the first recurrent 
thromboembolic event, will be analyzed after adjust ing estimates for the competing risk 
of death unrelated to VTE (21). The competing risk analysis will be performed using the 
SAS macro %PSHREG (22)  while the probabilities of failure for the event of  interest 
(first recurrent thromboembolic event) are displaye d using cumulative incidence plots 
which do account for the competing risk (death unre lated to VTE). 
The null hypothesis to be tested will be that api[INVESTIGATOR_199059] g 6-month follow-up; i.e. H 0 → 
E[HR] ≥ 2.00. 
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 46 The alternative hypothesis will be that api[INVESTIGATOR_199060]-inferior to dalteparin in the 
prevention of recurrent thromboembolic events durin g 6-month follow-up; i.e. H a → 
E[HR] < 2.00. 
Where: E[HR] is the Expected (E) api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-compar ator Hazard Ratio (HR), while 
2.[ADDRESS_237455] recurrent thromboembolic  event (event of interest) or to the 
occurrence of death unrelated to VTE (nuisance/comp eting event) or to the last follow-
up if neither a recurrent thromboembolic event nor a competing event occurred within the 
6-month follow-up (censored time). The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to- comparator Hazard Ratio adjusted 
for the competing risk of death unrelated to VTE wi ll be computed with associated two-
sided 95% confidence interval by [CONTACT_199073] F ine & Gray regression model (23) 
using treatment group and center as dummy covariate s. Api[INVESTIGATOR_199028]-
inferior to the comparator dalteparin if the upper two-sided 95% confidence limit of 
Hazard ratio is < 2.00. 
Superiority of api[INVESTIGATOR_199029]. dalteparin will be test ed as a secondary analysis of the primary 
endpoint, only after non-inferiority has been demon strated for the experimental treatment 
group (api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) relative to the conventional treat ment group (dalteparin). According to 
CPMP/EWP/482/99 document entitled: "Points to consi der on switching between 
superiority and non-inferiority", switching the api [INVESTIGATOR_199029]. dalteparin contrast from the 
non-inferiority objective to the superiority object ive is feasible because the trial is 
properly designed in accordance to the strict requi rements of a non-inferiority trial.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints   
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, analyses will  be performed using the primary 
efficacy data set. 
• The individual components of the primary efficacy o utcome:  The same competing risk 
model (23) defined above for the analysis of primar y efficacy variable will be employed 
for the analysis of the time from randomization to the first recurrent event among those 
included in the primary efficacy outcome recurrent (see 4.1). The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-comparator 
Hazard Ratio adjusted for the competing risk of dea th unrelated to VTE will be computed 
with associated two-sided 95% confidence interval. 
• Symptomatic recurrence of VTE:  The same competing risk model (23) defined above 
for the analysis of primary efficacy variable will be employed for the analysis of the time 
from randomization to the first symptomatic recurre nt thromboembolic event. The 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-comparator Hazard Ratio adjusted for th e competing risk of death unrelated 
to VTE will be computed with associated two-sided 9 5% confidence interval. 
• Composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bl eeding: The same competing 
risk model (23) defined above for the analysis of p rimary efficacy variable will be 
employed for the analysis of the time from randomiz ation to the composite of primary

adjusted for the competing risk of death unrelated to VTE or major bleeding will be 
computed with associated two-sided 95% confidence i nterval. 
• All cause of death:  Event free survival will be estimated according to  Kaplan-Meier 
and the event free survival in the two treatment gr oups will be compared by [CONTACT_3553] a 
Cox’s proportional hazard model with treatment grou p and center as dummy covariates. 
The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-comparator Hazard Ratio will be com puted with associated two-sided 
95% confidence interval.  
• Composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bl eeding plus all cause death:  
Event free survival will be estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and the event free 
survival in the two treatment groups will be compar ed by [CONTACT_3553] a Cox’s proportional 
hazard model with treatment group and center as dum my covariates. The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-
comparator Hazard Ratio will be computed with assoc iated two-sided 95% confidence 
interval.  
• Composite of primary efficacy outcome plus all caus e death:  Event free survival will 
be estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and the even t free survival in the two treatment 
groups will be compared by [CONTACT_3553] a Cox’s proport ional hazard model with treatment 
group and center as dummy covariates. The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]- to-comparator Hazard Ratio will 
be computed with associated two-sided 95% confidenc e interval.  
• Any fatal or not fatal cardiovascular event: The same competing risk model (23) 
defined above for the analysis of primary efficacy variable will be employed for the 
analysis of the time from randomization to the occu rrence of any fatal or not fatal 
cardiovascular event. The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-to-comparator Ha zard Ratio adjusted for the 
competing risk of death unrelated to cardiovascular  event will be computed with 
associated two-sided 95% confidence interval.  
• All venous thromboembolic events (including splanch nic vein thrombosis and 
cerebral vein thrombosis ): The same competing risk model (23) defined above fo r the 
analysis of primary efficacy variable will be emplo yed for the analysis of the time from 
randomization to thromboembolic events at sites oth er than DVT and PE. The api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]-
to-comparator Hazard Ratio adjusted for the competi ng risk of death unrelated to venous 
thromboembolic events will be computed with associa ted two-sided 95% confidence 
interval.  
• Quality of life evaluation (ACTS Scale) (see Appendix 2) : For the total score and  
for each of the subscales, a linear effects model w ill be estimated with treatment group 
and center as dummy fixed effects. Results will be reported as Least-Square Means 
together with associated two-tailed 95% CI and p-va lue. ITT Analyses will be performed 
with missing data imputed using conventional LOCF. 
 
Multiplicity   
Caravaggio Study Protocol 
FINAL Version 3.0, May 22 nd  2018  
 
Proprietary & Confidential 
 48 No adjustment for multiplicity is required for the primary efficacy analysis because it is 
focused on a single time point (6-month) at which o nly two treatments are being 
compared. 
 
Center-to-center variability  
Study center and treatment-by-center interactions a re included in each of the analyses 
described above. To assess center-to-center variabi lity, forest plots will be generated to 
display the results at each center.   
Due to the possibility of small numbers of patients  at some study sites, some sites may be 
combined in order to bring the numbers of patients in each pooled site to at least 12. Upon 
completion of the study and prior to unblinding, st udy statisticians in consultation with 
the Steering Committee will determine the pooling b ased on enrolment numbers and 
geographical proximity.  
 
10.7. Safety Analyses   
The analysis of safety will be based on the Safety Population, comparing patients in the 
two randomized arms: api[INVESTIGATOR_199029]. dalteparin. AEs w ill be mapped to system organ 
classes and preferred terms in MedDRA. Treatment em ergent events, defined as those 
that start or worsen after the start of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/da lteparin AEs, will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570], system organ class, and preferred term, and also by [CONTACT_199118]’s relationship to study treatment. At each level of summation, patients will 
be counted only once, under the greatest severity a nd strongest study-drug relationship 
(as reported by [CONTACT_093]). Clinical laborat ory data will be summarized for each 
treatment group at each measurement time point and for each patient’s final post-baseline 
measurement in the following ways: (1) with descrip tive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) for each measurement time point; (2) with descriptive 
statistics for the change from baseline in the meas urements at each post-baseline time 
point; and (3) with shift tables summarizing the fr equencies of patients below, within, and 
above the normal ranges at each time point as compa red with baseline. All clinical 
laboratory values collected during the study will b e listed, with values outside the normal 
ranges flagged for clinical evaluation. Concomitant  medications will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_199119][INVESTIGATOR_199061] d generic terms in the WHO Drug 
Dictionary.   
10.8. Subgroup Analyses   
Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be planned and  reported in the statistical analysis 
plan before the un-blinding of the study.

11. FEASIBILITY 
Overall, about 140 study centers in Europe and [LOCATION_003],  will participate in the study. Each 
study center is expected to recruit not less than 1 0 patients in the 18-month recruitment 
period. The overall study duration (first patient i n/last patient out) is estimated to be [ADDRESS_237457] i nsurance coverage by [CONTACT_199121], 
which is in line with applicable laws and/or regula tions.

Appendix 1 – Concomitant medications 
1.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Specifically excluded concomitant medications and c autions regarding other concomitant 
medications are provided below. The list in this ap pendix reflects exclusionary 
concomitant medications at the beginning of the stu dy. If there are changes to this list 
during the study, the changes will be provided as a n update to this appendix, but will not 
be considered a protocol amendment. 
1.1. Antiplatelet Drugs 
Dual antiplatelet therapy (any 2 antiplatelet agent s including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199066]) is prohibited while on study drug. If a clinical indication for dual 
antiplatelet therapy arises after randomization (eg , placement of an intracoronary stent), 
study drug should be interrupted and use of open-la bel LMWH/VKA is permitted at the 
physician’s discretion. 
Use of any antiplatelet medication, including aspir in, as single agent antiplatelet therapy 
is allowed while on study drug. 
It is strongly encouraged to restrict the dose of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (if indicated) to ≤ 100 mg daily, 
although higher doses are permitted for a strong cl inical indication (eg, development of 
an acute MI). 
Examples of non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199067]: 
- Thienopyridines: clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Plavix®), ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]  (Ticlid®), prasugrel 
- (Effient™) 
- Dipyridamole: Persantine®, Aggrenox®

1.2. Oral Anticoagulants Other Than Study Drug 
Oral anticoagulants including vitamin K antagonists  (eg, warfarin), Factor IIa inhibitors 
(eg, dabigatran), and FXa inhibitors (eg, rivaroxab an, edoxaban) after randomization are 
prohibited (unless used to bridge a temporary study  drug interruption). The only allowed 
oral antithrombotics are the study drugs. 
1.3. Parenteral Anticoagulants 
Parenteral anticoagulants such as heparin, LMWHs, d irect thrombin inhibitors, and FXa 
inhibitors are prohibited except as specifically ou tlined in the protocol. For instance, 
LMWHs are allowed as lead-in therapy prior to edoxa ban administration. Examples of 
prohibited parenteral anticoagulant medications, wh en used contrary to protocol 
specifications, include the following: 
- Low molecular weight heparins: dalteparin (Fragmin® ), tinzaparin (Innohep®, 
- Logiparin®), reviparin (Clivarin®), nadroparin (Fra xiparine®), ardeparin

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 2
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Summary: This is a Phase II, open label, single arm trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979] (RPV, previously known as TMC278) 25 mg once daily (q.d.) or an adjusted dose of RPV (q.d.) in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen containing 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) (zidovudine [AZT], abacavir [ABC], or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] in combination with lamivudine [3TC] or emtricitabine [FTC], whichever is approved and marketed or considered local standard of care) in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naïve adolescents and children aged !6t o  < [ADDRESS_140042] Week 48 treatment extension 
period of 4 years is removed for Cohort 2, children ≥ 6 to <12 years of age.
Subjects who withdraw from the trial on or before the Week 48 visit or subjects with ongoing (serious) adverse events ([S]AEs), laboratory abnormalities, or viral load increase at the last on-treatment visit in the extension, will be seen for a follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Additional unscheduled visits may be performed for safety/tolerability reasons and for confirmation of plasma viral load results.Recruitment and analyses of the initial 48-week treatment period will be structured into 2 age cohorts: Cohort 1, adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age; Cohort 2, children ≥6 to <12 years of age.
Cohort 1 ( ≥12 to <18 Years of Age):
As of Amendment 10 , Cohort 1, adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age, has 
been completed. Therefore, all sections related to Cohort 1 are removed from the summary and greyed out from the body of text for ease of reading.Cohort 2 ( !
!6 to <12 Years of Age): 
To accommodate regulatory requirements concerning the evaluation of RPV in the pediatric population, overall across studies C213 (Cohort 2; children aged ≥6 to <12 years) and TMC278HTX2002 (children aged ≥2 to <12 years 
with a body weight of ≥11 kg), approximately [ADDRESS_140043] 12 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140044] 7 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140045] 10 subjects in Cohort 2, including PK modeling and simulation to further assess the RPV pediatric dose based on accumulating data, was discussed with and endorsed by [CONTACT_31849]. With this, at the time [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 3
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020of Amendment 10 , the following RPV dose recommendations will apply to 
newly enrolled subjects:
∀RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg 
∀RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg
All ongoing subjects in Cohort 2 (who are already in the post Week 48treatment extension period at the time of Amendment 10 ) will remain on 
the RPV 25 mg q.d. dose + 2 N(t)RTIs (investigator-selected), until their roll-over to study TMC278IFD3004 has been completed (see addendum 7.11). All newly recruited subjects will start treatment with the weight-appropriate RPV dose stated above + 2 N(t)RTIs (investigator-selected), until they reach a total treatment duration of 48 weeks, or discontinue earlier. If newly recruited subjects, with a body weight of <25 kg, increase in weight 
such that they require a 25 mg RPV dose, they can change to the 25 mg tablet formulation.To further evaluate and confirm the RPV dose for subjects with lower body weight, newly enrolled subjects with a body weight of <25 kg require intensive PK evaluation. An overall analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_124693] (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for dose evaluation 
criteria).
∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory, and no alternative RPV dose seems feasible, all subjects will be seen for a Withdrawal visit, treatment with RPV will be stopped, subjects will be switched to local standard of care, and Cohort 2 will be stopped. 
∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory but concerns can be addressed by [CONTACT_124694] (doses of >25 mg q.d. are not allowed) for certain subjects (e.g. up to a certain body weight), those subjects will be switched to an adjusted dose, while those that don't need dose adjustment, will continue their treatment. For all subjects who require an RPV dose adjustment, a 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation after [ADDRESS_140046] 4 weeks or discontinued earlier, an analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data (after 14 to 18 days of RPV dosing), and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy data will be reviewed. If, after review of the data, the RPV dose is still not acceptable, the process will be repeated until an acceptable RPV dose is found or it is deemed necessary to stop [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Post Week 48 Treatment Extension  Cohort 2 ( !!6 to <12 Years of Age):
For subjects enrolling in Cohort [ADDRESS_140047] Week 48 
treatment extension has been removed. Subjects who experience and are expected to continue experiencing clinical benefit from RPV and their background regimen comprising 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs at the end of the initial 48-week treatment period, or ongoing subjects who are already in the post Week 48 treatment extension period at the time of Amendment 10, may continue treatment (i.e., RPV + 
2 N[t]RTIs)  in the roll-over study TMC278IFD3004 or switch to locally available RPV (once commercially available AND reimbursed, OR accessible through another source [e.g. access program or government program]), or other locally available RPV-based regimens.Study Treatment (Cohort 2):All ongoing subjects in Cohort 2 (who are already in the post Week 48treatment extension period at the time of Amendment 10) will remain on 
the RPV 25 mg q.d. dose + 2 N(t)RTIs (investigator-selected), until their roll-over to study TMC278IFD3004 has been completed (see addendum 7.11). For newly recruited subjects as of Amendment [ADDRESS_140048] of RPV (weight-based dosing) and an investigator-selected background regimen containing 2 N(t)RTIs. The investigator-selected N(t)RTIs will be AZT, ABC, or TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC, given as the co-formulation or as the separate components, whichever is approved and marketed or considered local standard of care for children aged !6 to <18 years in a particular country. Only branded versions of the 
N(t)RTIs, or generics with tentative US FDA approval and/or WHO prequalified drugs, are to be prescribed by [CONTACT_093]. If not available,generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124695] (i.e., UNICEF) can be allowed upon approval by [CONTACT_456].

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 12
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS
Amendment GEN-X (Issued Date: 12 December 2019)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
The overall reason for the amendment: The initial RPV dose selected for all subjects, including children aged ≥6 
to <12 years, was 25 mg q.d. Based on accumulating data a new dose has been selected for this subgroup. This amendment is created to include the recommended RPV dose of 15 mg q.d. for children aged ≥6 to <12 years
(Cohort 2) with a body weight of <25 kg. Subjects already enrolled before the implementation of this amendment will remain on their original RPV dose of 25 mg q.d. Other changes are described in the rationales below and are all applicable to Cohort 2 only, as Cohort 1 (adolescents) has already been completed.
Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Based on all the available PK data for RPV at the time of Amendment 10, it was determined through

q.d. dose for children with body weight <25 kg will be evaluated through the current study in combination with data obtained in another ongoing pediatric RPV study TMC278HTX2002 (see further). For subjects with a body weight of ≥[ADDRESS_140059] been gathered. Therefore, for new subjects with a body weight of 
≥25 kg no further intensive PK sampling is needed, and these subjects can follow the Cohort 2 visit schedule with 
sparse PK sampling only. For subjects on the RPV 15 mg q.d. dose, intensive PK data are needed for further dose evaluation and confirmation. Therefore, subjects with body weight <25 kg will undergo an intensive PK visit after 2 weeks (Day 14-18) of treatment (see section 2.2.2 ) and, if the dose is appropriate and no further adjustment is 
needed according to the dose evaluation criteria described in section [IP_ADDRESS].1 , they can continue the Cohort 2 visit 
schedule.

Rationale: It is clarified that, to accommodate regulatory requirements concerning the evaluation of RPV in the 
pediatric population, overall across studies C213 (Cohort 2; children aged ≥6 to <12 years) and TMC278HTX2002 
(children aged ≥2 to <12 years with a body weight of ≥11 kg), approximately [ADDRESS_140061] 12 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140062] 7 subjects with a body weight of <20 kg. The PK data from Cohort 2 will be combined with the data from pediatric study TMC278HTX2002.

Rationale: The requirement for a 4-year follow-up period in this study for subjects enrolled in Cohort 2, has been 
removed from the Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) by [CONTACT_124697] (PIP Decision P/0322/2018, dated 12 September 2018). Therefore the 4-year follow-up is removed from this C213 study and subjects are offered to continue treatment with RPV through a roll-over study or to switch to locally available medication.

Rationale: The ACTH stimulation test at Day 1 and Week 24 has been removed because no clinically relevant 
suppression of cortisol secretion and of the adrenal function was observed in adults or adolescents aged ≥12 to <18 
years (Cohort 1) in the clinical studies with RPV. Additionally, in the first 9 children aged ≥6 to < 12 years in 
Cohort 2 of this study treated with RPV +2 N(t)RTIs, there were no AEs related to cortisol abnormalities or signs orsymptoms related to clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency reported, and no abnormalities in the ACTH stimulation test observed during treatment. Therefore, the performance of the ACTH stimulation test will be limited to cases of confirmed abnormally low cortisol or when signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are observed.

Rationale: The exclusion of “personal history of asymptomatic arrhythmia” and of “syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]” (exclusion 
criterion # 19, Risk factors for QTc prolongation) is adapted. Extrasystoles are common in children (20% to 30% in

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 17
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Amendment GEN-IX (Issued Date: 20-Mar-2018)This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
The overall reason for the amendment: This amendment is created to update the in- and exclusion criteria to
facilitate patient recruitment since the study target population has become scarce. Through this amendment,enrollment of subjects ≥6 to <[ADDRESS_140070] a history of receiving a single dose of nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (sdNVP)
for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) in Cohort 2 of the study will be allowed. The evolution of proviral genotype will be assessed at screening and Week 48 and virologic response will be closely monitored during the treatment period.
Description of Change(s)
Rationale: In order to facilitate patient recruitment, the protoc ol in- and exclusion criteria are adjusted to allow 
enrollment in Cohort 2 of subjects ≥6 to <[ADDRESS_140071] were enrolled. In Cohort 1, 8/[ADDRESS_140072]  use at time of birth were either not available (13/30, 
43.3%) or it was reported that no PMTCT was used (17/30, 56.7%).
aThe emerging mutations observed in these 
subjects with virologic failure were previously identified in the RPV Phase 3 adult studies. Virologic failure was generally associated with the emergence of RPV re sistance-associated mutations (RAMs), most commonly E138K, 
in combination with NRTI RAMs, most commonly M184V. Given the virologic failures observed in Cohort 1, subjects who previously received sdNVP for PMTCT were not allowed in Cohort [ADDRESS_140073] virologic failures (6/8) occurred in Uganda where PMTCT was not widely adopted at the time the Ugandan study participants were infected.The main reasons for adapting the in- and exclusion criteria in terms of prior sdNVP use for PMTCT are: 
1. Infeasibility of recruitment: 
Because of the successful global adoption of PMTCT regimensb, pediatric patients naïve to sdNVP or 
zidovudine (AZT) use for the PMTCT have become increasingly scarce. The Joint United Nations Program on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS) reported that coverage of antiretroviral programs for PMTCT increased from 57% in 2011 to 73% in 2014 
among their 22 priority countries.In June 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued updated HIV-exposed infant prophylaxisguidelines, stating that infants born to mothers with HIV who are at high risk of acquiring HIV should receive dual prophylaxis with AZT twice daily and NVP once daily for the first 6 weeks of life (whether they are breastfed or formula fed). Prior to 2012, th e PMTCT treatment for infants consisted almost 
exclusively of sdNVP. As patients in the age range to be enrolled in Cohort 2 ( ≥6 to <12 years) would have

2. Archived resistance: 
The strongest predictor for carrying NNRTI mutations after PMTCT exposure is young age.cThe 
probability for otherwise treatment-naïve children to have  resistance due to sdNVP use at birth decreases 
with age as resistance against NVP typi[INVESTIGATOR_124607].c,d,eThe decreased incidence of NNRTI resistance in individual infants has 
been confirmed by [CONTACT_28460], showing the fading of sdNVP-induced mutations over [ADDRESS_140074] without decay over a median of 13 months (interquartile range [IQR] 12-16) to a median of 21 months of age (IQR 17-32).

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Rationale: The main PK analyses to characterize the RPV PK properties in children are conducted at the time of the 
Week 4, Week [ADDRESS_140077] on the findings/conclusions of the Week 24/48 PK analyses. Therefore, for Cohort 2, no 
PK sample will be taken beyond Week 48 and the assessment at Week 240 is deleted from the flowchart.[IP_ADDRESS] Flowchart for Assessments From Week 8 Onwards in Cohort 2(Initial Treatment Period From Week 8 Onwards, and Follow-up)
Rationale: The introduction was updated to indicate that, at the time of the Amendment 9 writing, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979] (RPV) 
was approved in several countries, including [LOCATION_003] and Europe, in adolescents ≥12 years of age.

This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The overall reason for the amendment: Based on local practice in certain countries, children younger than 12 
years of age are not consis tently informed of having HIV infection. Ther efore inclusion criterion 3 will be updated 
to remove the requirement that children enrolled in the study are aware of their HIV status. Children that are unaware of their HIV status, but comply with all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are nevertheless allowed to participate in the study.Description of Change(s) Applicable Section(s)
Rationale: See above
6.2.2 Inclusion Criteria
Rationale: An ECG assessment after at least 4 weeks of treatment with RPV (initial dose or adjusted dose) is not 
necessary. An ECG is required after at least 2 weeks of tr eatment with RPV, when RPV plasma concentrations are 
at steady-state (steady-state plasma concentrations of RPV are usually reached within 11 days of dosing). This Week [ADDRESS_140082] Switch Visit

*During the screening period it is allowed to assess the viral load and CD4+cell count before continuing with the other screening assessments. After obtaining informed consent, 
samples will be taken for determination of plasma viral load and CD4+cell count. If plasma viral load results meet the inclusion criteria and the investigator considers initiation 
of ART appropriate (taking into account current treatment guidelines, including CD4+cell count and the subject’s clinical situation), the subject will return within [ADDRESS_140102] will be considered a screen

**Unscheduled visits may be performed for safety/tolerability reasons and for confirmation of plasma viral load results (see Sect ion6.4.1 ).
***If the short-term Part 1 results show a safety concern, that po tentially could be avoided by [CONTACT_124707], as deemed b y the IDMC, subjects up to a certain body 
weight (determined based on the intensive pharmacokinetic results) will be switched to a lower, weight-adjusted dose of RPV. Pl ease refer to the flowchart in Section [IP_ADDRESS]

Samples will be analyzed as long as the viral load is sufficiently high to allow phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Samples collected at other intervals may be selected for the determination of HIV-1 genotype and/or phenotype by [CONTACT_124708]. 
cIn case Cohort 1 is stopped after Part 1, a sample will be analyzed in real time for the determination of HIV-1 genotype (as long as the viral load is sufficiently high to allow 
HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), in order to assist in the selection of a new ARV regimen. When determination of HIV-1 genotype on this sample is not possible due to a too low viral load, 
the new ARV regimen will be based on the screening HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_124619]. 
dSamples for viral phenotype/genotype will only be taken if the plasma viral load at the previous visit was >50 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] /mL. If at a certain visit the plasma viral load, 
after having been < 50 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at a previous visit, has increased to >50 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, samples for viral phen otype/genotype should be taken at an

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 51
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020*For subjects enrolling as of Amendment [ADDRESS_140128] Week 48 treatment extension has been removed. Subjects may continue treatment (i.e., RPV + 2 N[t]RTIs) in the roll-ov er study 
TMC278IFD3004 or switch to locally available RPV (once commercially available AND reimbursed, OR accessible through another sour ce [e.g. access program or government 
program]), or other locally available RPV-based regimens. Subjects from Cohort [ADDRESS_140129], of abnorma l laboratory results or plasma viral load/resistance 
testing, should be captured in this C213 study if  the subjects roll over to the TMC278IFD3004 study.
Unscheduled visits may be performed for safety/tolerability reasons, for reflex ACTH stimulation test in case basal cortisol is  <248 nmol/L (<9 μg/dL) on initial and repeat testing, and 
for confirmation of plasma viral load results (see Section 6.4.1 ).
**For subjects who discontinue the trial before Week 48, this is the Withdrawal visit.
****In the initial treatment period, the 4-week Follow-up visit is performed for subjects who withdraw early from the trial (i.e., before Week 48) (unless consent is withdrawn) or who do not 
participate in the extension after Week 48. In the extension period the 4-week Follow-up visit is only performed if there is an  ongoing (S)AE, laboratory abnormality, or an increase in 
viral load at the last on-treatment visit. Additional unscheduled visits may be performed for safety/tolerability reasons, for r eflex ACTH stimulation test in case basal cortisol is <248 
nmol/L (9 μg/dL) on initial and repeat testing, and for confirmation of plasma viral load results.
aIn case of suspected virologic failure (unconfirmed loss/lack of response, see Section 1) a sample for confirmation of plasma viral load and pharmacokinetics should be taken at an 
unscheduled visit (see Section 6.4.1 ). 
bSamples collected at baseline, at virologic failure (see Section 6.2.5 ), at Week 48 and at the Final/Withdrawal visit will be tested for the determination of the HIV-[ADDRESS_140130] based on plasma viral load.
cSample should be taken fasted (overnight).
dAny previously abnormal chemistry or hematology test should be repeated at this visit.
eWhenever possible, the ECG should be taken at expected C max(i.e., 4 hours after intake of RPV). 
fAssessment does not need to be performed at the withdrawal visit.
gA brief physical examination only.
hGrowth will be followed using the standardized charts (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
iHeight does not need to be measured.
jAs part of the evaluation of pubertal development, for girls who have not yet had their first menses at screening, it will be ch ecked at every visit whether they have had their first menses 
and the date of first menses will be noted. 
kUrine test for girls of childbearing potential.
lA pharmacokinetic sample will be taken at any time during the visit. The date and time of sampling and the date and time of the RPV intake prior to that sample should be recorded on 
the eCRF. Where possible (i.e., if RPV intake occurs during the visit), at least on one occasion, the sample will be taken just prior to RPV intake.
nAssessment of FSH, LH, androstenedione, testosterone, DHEAS, in conjunction with basal cortisol.
oAs of Amendment [ADDRESS_140131] is not scheduled at Week 24, but needs to be performed in case of confirmed abnormally low cortisol ( <248 nmol/L [9 μg/dL]) or 
signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.2 ). 
ACTH stimulation test including measurements of cortisol and 17- hydroxyprogesterone, measured before (T0) and 60 minutes (T60) after ACTH stimulation, needs to be performed 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.2 ). The ACTH stimulation test needs to be conducted in the morning at the indicated visits, between 7h30 and 9h30. If ACTH stimu lation test is abnormal (i.e., the 
cortisol value after ACTH stimulation is <500 nmol/L [18.1 μg/dL]), a retest needs to be performed at the next scheduled visit or at least within the next 8 weeks (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].3.2 ). In case of withdrawal due to pregnancy, no ACTH stimulation test needs to be performed, but basal assessments need to be performed.
pQuestionnaires will only be administered if a certified translation is available in the local language.
qEvaluation should be done according to local standard of care at the site (see Section 6.4.11 for details).
sAEs (including HIV-related events and the occurrence of AIDS-defining illnesses) and the intake of concomitant medication will be monitored throughout the trial from signing of the 
ICF onwards until the last trial-related activity.
tA PBMC sample will be taken to retrospectively characterize archived viral resistance.

Prior to Amendment 10 Flow 1 , as depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393], was followed. All subjects enrolled in Cohort 
2 at the time were treated with 25 mg RPV q.d., and since results of the Week 4 analysis weredeemed satisfactory, no dose adjustments were required. These subjects are currently on 25 mg RPV q.d. as originally planned (no dose adjustments). Only limited data (i.e. 5 subjects) were available for subjects with body weight <25 kg.Based on accumulating data and PK modeling and simulation, at the time of Amendment 10, 
the following RPV dose recommendations were determined and endorsed by [CONTACT_124717] (aimed at achieving similar exposures as in adults): 
∀RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg 
∀RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg
Appropriateness of these doses will be further evaluated in this study in combination with data generated from pediatric study TMC278HTX2002. To this end, as depi[INVESTIGATOR_124623] 2 below, 
newly enrolled subjects with a body weight of <25 kg will require intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Note that as of Amendment 10 the requirement for the 4-year follow-up period in this study for

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTIONAntiretroviral therapy in ARV-naïve children provides evidence that the combination of 2 NRTIs and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) may reduce HIV RNA to undetectable levels in a substantial proportion of children
1,2. 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects are routinely being treated with combinations of 3 or 4 drugs (highly active ARV therapy [HAART]), including N(t)RTIs, NNRTIs, and protease inhibitors (PIs), to reduce the risk of viral resistance development. Development of new potent ARV compounds is urgently needed to prolong suppression of viral replication in subjects infected with HIV-1
1,2,3,51,52.
Approved NNRTIs in the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]) and/or Europe are nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (NVP; Viramune
®), delavirdine (Rescriptor®), and efavirenz (EFV, Sustiva®, Stocrin®). These drugs 
show cross-resistance and are associated with  safety problems (mainly hepatotoxicity, central 
nervous system symptoms, and/or rash)3. Etravirine (ETR, Intelence®), a NNRTI with a higher 
genetic barrier to the development of resistance, is approved for the use in treatment-experienced adults.At the time of Amendment 6 writing, RPV (formerly known as TMC278 or R278474) has been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ARV treatment-naïve adult patients in multiple countries including the [LOCATION_003] and European Union as EDURANT
®. In most countries, including 
the [LOCATION_003] and EU, this indication is further restricted to patients with a HIV-1 viral load ≤100,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. Nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_124624] (aged 15 days and older) but has been shown to 
be inferior to lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir (LPV/r, Kaletra
®)49. Efavirenz is approved for use in children 
from 3 months of age, but there are concerns about the approved dose such as risks to the fetus in females of childbearing age
50. Etravirine is approved for ARV treatment-experienced children 
down to 6 years of age. A medical need still exists for development of new potent ARV compounds and age-appropriate formulations, particularly in adolescents and children. At the time of Amendment 9 writing, in several countries, including the [LOCATION_003] and Europe, the indication of RPV has been extended to include adolescent patients aged ≥12 to <18 years of 
age, based on Week 48 data from Cohort 1 of the current study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Per the 
indication, RPV is approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ARV treatment-naïve patients 12 years of age and older with a viral load ≤100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. At the time of 
Amendment 9 writing, RPV was not approved in children <[ADDRESS_140147] wild-type HIV-1 (50% effective concentration [EC
50] ranging from 0.30 to 0.73 nM for HIV-1/IIIb4) and 
NNRTI-resistant mutants. RPV is able to combine the convenience of once daily (q.d.) dosing with good antiviral effects and a good safety and tolerability profile as compared to most 
currently licensed NNRTIs (with the exception of ETR).[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 61
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Non-clinical safety and toxicology studies de monstrated that RPV is safe for use in clinical 
testing4. In non-clinical studies in rats and dogs, changes in adrenal hormones and histopathology 
have been observed. In those studies, RPV appears to  interfere with steroid biosynthesis, leading 
to decreases in cortisol and increases in progesterone and 17α -hydroxyproges terone and as a 
result to increases in serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Preclinical work with RPValso identified changes in the thyroid glands in rats. Endocrine monitoring was included in the safety monitoring of all RPV clinical trials conducted thus far. However, to date, no clinically relevant effects on adrenal or thyroid function were observed in clinical studies with RPV in adults or adolescents. The effects of RPV on adrenal glands of rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys on the estrous cycle of dogs are not expected to be clinically rele vant for adolescents and children. However, in 
theory, some concerns in adolescents and child ren could be raised by [CONTACT_103495]-clinical findings: 
the possibility of partial adrenal insufficiency, virilization in girls and/or growth retardation due to 21-hydroxylase inhibition and precocious puberty due to ovarian stimulation in girls. In case significant inhibition of cortisol synthesis (partial adrenal insufficiency) would occur, androgen production might increase. In girls, this could result in masculinization and blunted growth. In boys, due to increased levels of testosterone, growth might also be impaired. Since the time of initial protocol writing, additional non-clinical information has become available in cynomolgus monkeys, which did not show evidence of induction of premature ovulation in juvenile animals. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a brief summary of the non-clinical data on effects of RPV on 
adrenal and gonadal hormone biosynthesis. Therefore, in this trial, growth will be followed regularly and evaluated consistently using standardized growth charts. Sexual maturation will be evaluated according to Tanner stages. Finally, hormone testing will be performed, including measurements of testosterone, FSH, LH, cortisol, progesterone (only in the adolescent cohort), androstenedione, aldosterone (only in the adolescent cohort), DHEAS, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone.Rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_124625] a potential for genotoxicity, teratogenicity, phototoxicity, skin or mucous membrane irritation, or delayed-type sensitization.

4. Two exploratory proof-
of-principle (PoP) Phase IIa trials in 83 adults (47 ARV-naïve and 36 ARV-experienced) were performed to evaluate the short-term antiviral and immunologic activity during a 7-day oncedaily treatment up to 150 mg RPV
5,6. One Phase IIb trial (i.e., TMC278-C204) in which 368 
ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected adults were included, has been completed and was set up to evaluate the dose-response relationship of efficacy over 96 weeks of treatment with 3 different dose regimens (25 mg q.d., 75 mg q.d., and 150 mg q.d.) of RPV.

After 240 weeks of treatment, continued access to RPV is foreseen in another trial or program, until RPV becomes commercially available, is reimbursed, or can be accessed through another source. All RPV-treated subjects were switched to RPV 25 mg q.d. (the dose selected for further development) at approximately Week 144, but no later than Week 157, and continued on this dose for the remainder of the trial. Data from the primary analysis at 48 weeks and the analyses at 96, 144, 192, and 240 weeks of treatment in this trial are available
7,8. These data showed that RPV was generally safe and well 
tolerated after long-term treatment. This was confirmed by [CONTACT_124719]-naïve HIV-1 infected adu lts. These trials were set up to evaluate long-
term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of RPV 25 mg q.d. versus efavirenz 600 mg q.d. (each in combination with 2 N[t]RTIs).Rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], formulated as a tablet, was well absorbed after oral administration in humans. The time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (t
max) was consistently around 4 hours in all 
trials. The terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2,term ) was approximately 45 hours across trials, 
supporting q.d. administration. Renal clearance is only a minor route for the elimination of RPV
4.
The relative oral bioavailability of RPV formulated as a tablet increased approximately 1.5-fold when administered with food as compared to administration under fasted conditions. RPV, administered as the Phase II tablet formulation, exhibited linear pharmacokinetics for maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in 
healthy subjects after single- and multiple-dose administration up to a dose of 150 mg q.d.4
The relative oral bioavailability of RPV as the Phase III tablet formulation was shown to be 
comparable to that of the Phas e II tablet. Thes e results support the us e of the Phase III tablet 
formulation for the further clinical development of RPV9. 
The safety data from the pooled Phase I studies showed that RPV was generally safe and well tolerated after multiple dosing in adults up to 150 mg q.d. for 14 days
4. The 2 PoP Phase IIa 
trials5,6demonstrated the safety and efficacy of RP V in HIV-1 infected subjects who were ARV-
naïve as well as in HIV-1 infected subjects who were failing either an NNRTI- or PI-containing (with evidence of resistance to the current NNRTIs) therapy. The primary analysis of the Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, active-controlled trials in adults with RPV (i.e., TMC278-TiDP6-C209 and TMC278-TiDP6-C215) was conducted when all subjects had reached Week [ADDRESS_140150] one dose of study drug were included in this analysis: 686 subjects in the RPV group and 682 subjects in the control group on efavirenz

75 mg q.d., a clinically relevant increase of the QTc interval by [CONTACT_8622] 10.4 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]: 7.7 ms; 13.1 ms) as compared to reference (i.e., baseline) was observed and the effect was dose- and concentration-dependent, with a higher increase at higher exposures obtained with a dose of 300 mg q.d. (i.e., up to 23.8 ms [19.8 ms; 27.8 ms] compared to reference). Besides these recent findings in the thorough QT trial, all single dose as well as multiple-dose trials with RPV in healthy subjects showed no consistent or clinically relevant changes in any particular ECG parameter, including the QTc interval. Also in HIV-1 infected subjects in short-term PoP trials and the Phase IIb trial, the observed changes in ECG parameters are not clinically relevant. In the Phase IIb trial, up to Week 96, 3 female subjects were discontinued from the trial because of QTcF prol ongation (grade 2-3, all considered related to 
RPV), but without clinical symptoms

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020The current trial is the first to be conducted with RPV in the adolescent population (Cohort 1). The purpose of the present trial is first to compare the short-term steady-state RPVpharmacokinetics in a small group of ARV treatment-naïve subjects aged !12 to <18 years with 
that in the adult population (in trials TMC278-C204, TMC278-TiDP6-C209, and TMC278-TiDP6-C215), as well as to evaluate short-term safety and antiviral activity of RPV in the 
adolescent population (Part 1). If the short-term results of Part 1 are deemed satisfactory by [CONTACT_41758] (IDMC), long-term treatment will be evaluated in a larger group of subjects aged !12 to <18 years in the second part of this cohort (Part 2). At the 
time of protocol amendment 6 writing, 48-week resu lts from this adolescent cohort are available.
The 48-week results demonstrated that treatment with RPV 25 mg q.d., in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen, is efficacious, generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents of ≥12 to <18 years of age. For more details about the 48-week results see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], the clinical study report of Cohort 1
53or the abstract54. These 48-week treatment
results are considered adequate to start treatment in children <12 years of age and therefore the protocol has been amended. In addition to adolescents (Cohort 1), the trial was extended to include children ≥6 to <12 years 
of age (Cohort 2). In Part 1 of this cohort, the short-term steady-state RPV pharmacokinetics in a group of ARV treatment-naïve subjects aged ≥6 to <12 years were compared with that in the 
adult population, and an evaluation of safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy of RPVin these children was done.At the time of Amendment 10 , the following RPV dose recommendations were determined 
based on accumulating data and were endorsed by [CONTACT_31849], in order to achieve similar exposure to RPV compared to adults: RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg, 
and RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg. Appropriateness of these doseswill be further evaluated in this study. It is recognized that the pediatric age group deserves specific attention, both towards more intense compliance counseling and, especially for the adolescents, towards sexual behavior and risk of HIV transmission. Specific sections in the protocol will address these.

6.1. Trial Design
6.1.1. Overview of TrialThis is a Phase II, open label, single arm trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of RPV 25 mg q.d. or adjusted dose of RPV (q.d.) in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen containing 2 N(t)RTIs (AZT, ABC, or TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC, age-appropriate formulations are to be used), in ARV treatment-naïve adolescents and children aged !6 to <18 years.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cohort 1: Adolescents Aged ≥12 to <18 Years
ARV treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects, aged !12 to <18 years, with a plasma viral load 
!5,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL could be included in Part 1a of Cohort 1. However, in Part 1b 
and Part 2, recruitment was limited to subjects with a plasma viral load ≥500 HIV-1 RNA 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL but ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. Any previous use of ARVs, with the exception 
of a single dose of NVP at birth to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), is not allowed. Subjects who were infected by [CONTACT_124722], provided the mother was ARV treatment-naïve at the time of delivery with the exception of NVP monotherapy for no more than [ADDRESS_140155] no NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) on their screening HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_124619] (exclusion based on the list of NNRTI RAMs detailed in Section 6.2.3). ABC has been associated with severe hypersensitivity reactions, and the risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_124626]-B*5701 allele. Therefore, subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results for whom the investigator considers to use ABC/3TC as background regimen should test negative for HLA-B*5701 at screening, to avoid hypersensitivity reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details).
Subjects willing and able to give consent (in case the subject’s age is below the cut-off age for consent [according to local regulations], their parent/caregiver should be able and willing to give consent, and the subject will be informed about the trial and asked to give positive assent) and found eligible for the trial at screening, will be required to discontinue specified disallowed medication to allow a washout period of at least 4 weeks prior to baseline. Assessments at screening will be performed as indicated in the flowchart (see Section 2).
The trial will consist of a screening period of maximum 8 weeks (the baseline visit should be scheduled within 4 weeks after the screening visit and within 6 weeks after plasma viral load and CD4
+cell count assessment, if these were assessed separately before continuing with the other 
screening assessments, but in case of unforeseeable circumstances, this period can be prolonged by 2 weeks maximum), an initial treatment period of [ADDRESS_140156] Week 48 treatment extension period of 4 years. Subjects who withdraw from the trial on or before the Week 48 visit [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 67
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020or subjects with ongoing (S)AEs at the last on-treatment visit in the extension, will be seen for a follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Recruitment and analyses of the initial 48-week treatment period will be structured into 2 parts (for a flowchart of the trial visits, see Section 2).
The first part of Cohort 1 (Part 1, consisting of Part 1a and Part 1b) is designed to evaluate the 
steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and the short-term safety and antiviral activity of RPV25 mg q.d. when administered in combination with 2 N(t)RTIs, in adolescents. In Part 1a, agroup of at least [ADDRESS_140157] 5 subjects in the age group !12 to <[ADDRESS_140158] 
5 subjects in the age group !15 to <18 years, were to be enrolled and to receive treatment. 
Eventually, 11 subjects were enrolled, 4 subjects in the age group ≥12 to <15 years and 
7 subjects in the age group ≥15 to <18 years, and enrollment was paused at that time. At Week 2, 
an analysis for pharmacokinetics together with short-term safety and antiviral activity was reviewed by [CONTACT_41774] (for more information on this IDMC, see Section 6.3.9). Based on these 
Week [ADDRESS_140159] more short-term data in 
adolescents before proceeding with the second part of Cohort 1 (Part 2). Therefore, Part 1 wasexpanded by [CONTACT_124723] 12 additional subjects (in order to have at least 10 evaluable subjects at Week 4) in Part 1b, aiming at an equal distribution of subjects between the two age groups (i.e., subjects ≥12 to <15 years of age and subjects ≥15 to <18 years of age). 
Eventually, 14 subjects were enrolled in Part 1b, 8 subjects in the age group !12 to <15 years 
and 6 subjects in the age group !15 to <18 years, to a total of 25 subjects enrolled in Part 1. In 
Part 1b, only subjects with a screening viral load ≥500 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL but ≤100,000 
HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL were to be enrolled. The 4-week interim analysis of Part 1b wasevaluated by [CONTACT_124724] 2. The results indicated that no RPV dose adjustment was needed.When reviewing the Part 1 results, the IDMC took into account the guidelines and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124627].
∀If the mean steady-state exposure of RPV in Part 1 subjects is comparable to that of the adult population (i.e., is within 80-125% of the mean exposure of the 25 mg q.d. dose group in available trials in HIV-infected adults) and the short-term safety and antiviral activity results have been reviewed and deemed satisfactory by [CONTACT_31849], the second part of Cohort 1 will start. 
∀However, if the mean exposure in adolescents is <80% of the mean exposure in adults or the Week 2/Week 4 results are not deemed satisfactory, all subjects will be seen for a Withdrawal visit, treatment with RPV will be stopped, subjects will be switched to a locally available ARV regimen, and the trial will be stopped. In this case, a sample will be analyzed in real time for the determination of HIV-1 genotype (as long as the viral [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 68
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020load is sufficiently high to allow HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), in order to assist in the selection of a new ARV regimen. When determination of HIV-1 genotype on this sample is not possible due to a too low viral load, the new ARV regimen will be based on the screening HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_124619]. 
∀If the mean exposure in adolescents is >125% of the mean exposure in adults, but antiviral activity results are satisfactory and there are no safety concerns, as judged by [CONTACT_31849], the second part of Cohort 1 will start. 
∀If the mean exposure in adolescents is >125% of the mean exposure in adults, the antiviral activity is satisfactory, but there are safety concerns that could potentially be avoided by a lower exposure to RPV, as judged by [CONTACT_31849], subjects up to a certain body weight (determined based on the intensive pharmacokinetic results) will be switched to a lower, weight-adjusted dose; subjects who do not require a dose switch will 
continue treatment with RPV [ADDRESS_140160] been treated for 4 weeks (+/-1 week). When these results are deemed satisfactory by [CONTACT_31849], these subjects will continue treatment with RPV at the weight-adjusted dose and the second part of Cohort 1 will start.
All subjects in Part 1 were to continue th eir ART (RPV plus an investigator-selected background 
regimen of 2 N[t]RTIs) during the review period by [CONTACT_31849]. For more information, see Section 6.1.2.
To ensure that the duration between baseline and the review by [CONTACT_124716] 1awas kept as short as possible, investigators were to identify eligible subjects in advance.
Recruitment was to be started when the majority of the sites had the necessary documentation and approvals in place and were therefore considered activated for enrollment. Recruitment of subjects for Part 1a has already been closed and the enrolled subjects can continue in the trial as judged by [CONTACT_31849]. For Part 1b, recruitment could start at the individual sites as soon as the necessary documentation and approvals were in place, and was completed once the required number of subjects was recruited. Trial sites were informed in advance regarding stop of recruitment.In case of inadequate exposure, dose adjustments of RPV cannot be allowed in order to avoid exposing children to a daily dose exceeding the total adult daily dose (i.e., 25 mg q.d.). The second part of Cohort 1 will evaluate long-term safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 
RPV in combination with a background regimen of 2 N(t)RTIs, in a total of at least 35 adolescents (approximately 12 female subjects will be targetted). All subjects initially enrolled in Part 1 were to continue the initial treatment period until they reach a treatment duration of 48 weeks. Additional subjects were recruited with a screening viral load ≥500 HIV-1 
RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL but ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, so that at least 35 subjects were enrolled 
and also received initial treatment for 48 weeks. The additional subjects were only be recruited after the IDMC had decided that this second part of Cohort 1 could start. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 69
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Subjects who experience and are expected to continue experiencing clinical benefit from RPVand the background regimen comprising 2 N(t)RTIs at the end of the initial 48-week treatment period, will have the option to continue treatment (i.e., RPV 25 mg q.d. + 2 N[t]RTIs) through this trial for an additional [ADDRESS_140161] Week 48 treatment extension period. During this treatment extension, trial visits will occur approximately every 3 months.Formal analyses (with formal database lock) will be performed when all subjects have reached 
Week 24 (or discontinued earlier) (primary analysis time point), when all subjects have reached Week 48 (or discontinued earlier), and when all subjects have completed the trial (after 240 weeks of treatment) (or discontinued earlier). Furthermore, data monitoring for risk-benefit assessment was to be performed when all Part 1 (i.e., Part 1a and Part 1b) subjects had reached Week 12 (or discontinued earlier) and will be performed when all Part [ADDRESS_140162] reached Week 12 of treatment (or discontinued earlier). These analyses will be run based on the accumulated data at that point. The results of all analyses up to Week [ADDRESS_140163] of RPV 25 mg q.d. or weight-adjusted dose, and an investigator-selected background regimen containing 2 N(t)RTIs. The investigator-selected N(t)RTIs will be AZT, ABC, or TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC, whichever is approved and marketed or considered local standard of care for children aged !12 
to <18 years in a particular country. The background regimen will be given as the co-formulation or as the separate components, according to local availability and use in the country (e.g., Combivir
®or AZT/3TC, Epzicom®/Kivexa®or ABC/3TC, Truvada®or TDF/FTC). For those 
subjects who do not tolerate the selected N(t)RTIs, switching to alternative N(t)RTIs (brand name [CONTACT_80378], US FDA tentatively approved generics, WHO prequalified drugs and if not available, exceptionally generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124725]) is allowed for some predefined toxicities (see Section 6.3.5). At all times, the background regimen should consist of 2 N(t)RTIs 
and the subject’s HIV-1 genotype at screening should show sensitivity to the alternative N(t)RTIs. Also in case of switch to ABC, the subject should test negative for HLA-B*5701, to limit the risk of hypersensitivity reactions (in case no prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results are available) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The symptoms of intolerance to the N(t)RTI(s) 
should be reported as AE(s) and should be clearly documented as leading to the change in N(t)RTIs. If the tolerability issue is related to only 1 of the 2 N(t)RTIs, it is only needed to switch that one. The use of PIs, NNRTIs (other than RPV), enfuvirtide (ENF), integrase inhibitors, and investigational ARVs during the trial is not allowed.In the second part of Cohort 1 temporary interruption of all ARVs during the treatment period will be allowed in the event of suspected toxicity, as long as the temporary interruption is associated with and can be linked to an AE or a serious AE (SAE) and this is not one of the cases [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 70
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020listed in Section 6.2.5 or Section 6.5. The maximum allowed duration of a single treatment 
interruption for toxicity reasons will be 4 weeks and the maximum allowed cumulative duration 
of the treatment interruptions for toxicity reasons  will be 8 weeks (interruptions are counted 
cumulatively within a time frame of 48 weeks). Subjects should maintain the regular visit schedule during the treatment interruptions. Additional unscheduled visits may be performed for safety or tolerability reasons. Re-initiation of therapy including the background regimen will 
only be allowed once the event has resolved or decreased to a grade [ADDRESS_140164] be withdrawn from the trial in case the total cumulative duration of treatment interruptions for suspected toxicities is more than 8 weeks (inte rruptions are counted cumulatively within a time 
frame of 48 weeks) or the duration of a single treatment interruption for a suspected toxicity is more than 4 weeks (see Section 6.2.5). Special considerations may be warranted for the 
discontinuation of certain ARV agents (see Section 6.3.5).
During the treatment period, the subject will have regular visits as stated in the flowchart (Section 2) during which the investigator will assess the subject’s medical condition, virologic 
and immunologic response, any AEs, safety and tolerability issues (including blood and urine tests) and study drug compliance, and during which pharmacokinetic samples will be taken. The subject and/or their parent(s) or caregiver(s) will also complete a compliance questionnaire (Study Adherence Questionnaire for Children and Teenagers, Addendum 7; and Study Adherence Questionnaire for Caregivers, Addendum 8). Subjects included in Part 1, or their parent(s) or caregiver(s), additionally were to complete a diary documenting the intakes of RPVfrom the start of treatment with RPV 25 mg q.d. or weight-adjusted dose until the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling.Details on the timing of the treatments and assessments are given in the flowchart (Section 2) 
and in Section 6.4.
Subjects who withdraw from the trial early (i.e., before the Week 48 visit) or subjects who do not participate in the extension after Week 48, will be seen for a follow-up visit. In the extension period, the 4-week follow-up visit is only perfor med if there is an ongoing (S)AE at the last on-
treatment visit.After 240 weeks of treatment, continued access to RPV is foreseen in an open label roll-over trial until RPV becomes commercially available, is reimbursed or can be accessed through another program. Provision of study drug will be stopped in case subjects cease to benefit from the treatment or when development of RPV is discontinued.Note: At the time of protocol amendment 6 writing,  48-week results from the adolescent cohort 
were available and a summary of these results has been provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. For 
more details refer to the clinical study report of Cohort 153or the abstract54.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE].1.1.2. Cohort 2: Children Aged ≥6 to <12 Years
In Cohort 2 of the trial, ARV treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects aged ≥6 to <12 years with 
a plasma viral load ≥500 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL but ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL will be 
included. Any previous use of ARVs, with the exception of a single dose of NVP at birth or up to [ADDRESS_140165], is not allowed. The same exclusion criterion related to NNRTI RAMs (see Section 6.2.3) and precautions related to ABC use applies as in adolescents
in Cohort 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). For a list of all inclusion and exclusion criteria see 
Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_140166] of specific guidelines regarding use of prior and concomitant 
therapy (see Section 6.3.13). For more information about the visit schedule of Cohort 2 see the 
flowcharts in Section 2.2.
To accommodate regulatory requirements concerning the evaluation of RPV in the pediatric population, overall across studies C213 (Cohort 2; children aged ≥6 to <12 years) and 
TMC278HTX2002 (children aged ≥2 to <12 years with a body weight of ≥11 kg), approximately 
[ADDRESS_140167] 12 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140168] 7 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140169] 10 subjects in Cohort 2, including PK modeling and simulation to further assess the RPV pediatric dose based on accumulating data, was discussed with and endorsed by [CONTACT_31849]. With this, at the time of Amendment 10 , the following RPV dose recommendations 
will apply to newly enrolled subjects:
∀RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg 
∀RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg
All ongoing subjects in Cohort 2 (who are already in the post Week 48 treatment extension period at the time of Amendment 10) will remain on the RPV 25 mg q.d. dose + 2 N(t)RTIs 
(investigator-selected), until their roll-over to  study TMC278IFD3004 has been completed (see 
addendum 7.11). All newly recruited subjects will start treatment with the weight-appropriate 
RPV dose stated above + 2 N(t)RTIs (investigator-selected), until they reach a total treatment duration of 48 weeks or discontinue earlier. If newl y recruited subjects with a body weight of
<25 kg, increase in weight such that they require a 25 mg RPV dose, they can change to the 25 mg tablet formulation.To further evaluate and confirm the RPV dose for subjects with lower body weight, newly enrolled subjects with a body weight of <25 kg require intensive PK evaluation. An overall analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_124693] (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for dose evaluation criteria).
∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory, and no alternative RPV dose seems feasible, all subjects will be seen for a Withdrawal visit, treatment with RPV will be stopped, subjects will be switched to local standard of care, and Cohort 2 will be stopped. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 72
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory but concerns can be addressed by [CONTACT_124694] (doses of >25 mg q.d. are not allowed) for certain subjects (e.g. up to a certain body weight), those subjects will be switched to an adjusted dose, while those that don't 
need dose adjustment, will continue their treatment. For all subjects who require an RPV dose adjustment, a 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation after [ADDRESS_140170] 4 weeks or discontinued earlier, an analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data (after 14 to 18 days of RPV dosing), and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy  data will be reviewed. If, after review of 
the data, the RPV dose is still not acceptable, the process will be repeated until an acceptable RPV dose is found or it is deemed necessary to stop Cohort 2.
Note: If in the mini-cohort, subjects discontinue the trial before receiving their first dose of 
study drug, additional subjects can be recruited  to have 5 subjects with a body weight of 
<25 kg starting treatment in the mini-cohort. If subjects discontinue the trial after starting treatment for reasons other than drug tolerability/safety, additional subjects can be recruited to have at least 12 subjects with  a body weight of < [ADDRESS_140171] additional subjects with intensive pharmacokinetic data because interpretation of the data is hampered by e.g., study drug adherence issues prior to the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling time point.
Subjects who experience and are expected to continue experiencing clinical benefit from RPV and their background regimen comprising 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs at the end of the initial 48-week treatment period, may continue treatment (i.e., RPV + 2 N[t]RTIs) in the roll-over study TMC278IFD3004 or switch to locally available RPV (once commercially available AND reimbursed, OR accessible through another source [e.g. access program or government program]), or other locally available RPV-based regimens. Any retest, of abnormal laboratory 
results or plasma viral load/resistance testing, should be captured in this C213 study if the 
subjects roll over to the TMC278IFD3004 study.Formal analyses (with formal database lock) will be performed when all subjects have reached 
Week 48, or discontinued earlier (primary analysis). Furthermore, data monitoring for risk-benefit assessment (no formal database lock) will be performed when all subjects in this C213 study reach Week 12 and Week 24, or discontinued earlier. These analyses will be based on the 
accumulated data at that point. The results of all analyses up to Week 48 will be shared and discussed with the IDMC. Analyses (no formal database lock) will also be performed for subjects with body weight <25 kg (mini-cohort and full group of subjects with body weight <25 kg) for dose finding purposes when the subjects have been treated for at least 4 weeks, or discontinued earlier, with the original and/or adjusted dose. These analyses for dose finding purposes will be based on the intensive pharmacokinetic data after 14 to 18 days of treatment with the original and/or adjusted RPV dose and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy data. Results of these intensive pharnacokinetic analyses, and if applicable, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

The design of the trial is illustrated in Section 3.2.
Information on the study drug and investigator-selected background regimen can be found in Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2. Guidance on temporary interruptions and switching to alternative 
N(t)RTIs in case of toxicities can be found in Sections 6.3.5 and [IP_ADDRESS] , and information on 
study drug discontinuation or removal of the subject from the trial can be found in Section 6.2.5.
Details about the treatment duration and assessments to be performed during the trial are provided in the flowcharts in Section 2and in Section 6.4.
The total blood volume to be collected in this pediatric study has been optimized as much as possible, considering the safety assessments required in this clinical study, and the pharmacokinetic analysis necessary for establishing the appropriate dose. The sponsor considers the total blood quantity drawn clinically acceptable, in view of the age span of the children included in the study i.e., between ≥6 to <12 years old
57.
After 48 weeks of treatment, continued access to RPV is foreseen in the roll-over study TMC278IFD3004 or by [CONTACT_124726] (once commercially available AND reimbursed, OR accessible through another source [e.g. access program or government program]), or other locally available RPV-base d regimens. Provision of study drug will be 
stopped in case subjects cease to benefit from the treatment or when development of RPV is discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Dose Evaluation Criteria for Cohort 2
AUC
24hof a selected RPV dose under fed and steady-state conditions will be the primary
pharmacokinetic parameter for determination of the acceptability of the RPV dose. The target geometric mean RPV AUC
24his between 80% and 150% of the observed geometric mean 
AUC 24hfor RPV in HIV-1 infected adults from the Phase III pha rmacokinetic substudies of 
TMC278-TiDP6-C209 and TMC278-TiDP6-C215 (i.e., between 1426 and 2673 ng•h/mL). While the RPV AUC
24hwill be the primary pharmacokinetic parameter for acceptability of dose

<18 years, recruitment and analyses in this trial will be structured into 2 parts. In Part 1 (consisting of Part 1a and Part 1b), the pharmacokinetics and short-term safety and antiviral activity were to be assessed in a subgroup of adolescent patients, in order to determine the appropriateness of the RPV dose for the remainder of the adolescents. In Part 1a, an analysis was performed when the first 11 subjects (i.e., 4 subjects aged !12 to <15 years and 7 subjects aged 
!15 to <18 years) had been treated for 2 weeks, or discontinued earlier. These Week 2 data 
showed that the mean exposure in adolescents (following intensive pharmacokinetic sampling) was within 80-125% of that in adults (with mean C
0hratio = 105% and mean 
AUC 24hratio = 83%) and safety and short-term antiviral activity were satisfactory. Based on 
these data the IDMC agreed for these subjects to continue treatment with RPV [ADDRESS_140178] that the AUC ratio was at the lower end, the Sponsor decided to enroll the additional subjects in smaller cohorts and gather more intensive pharmacokinetic data in order to increase the precision of the pharmacokinetic parameter ratios, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020an approach which was agreed upon with the IDMC46. Therefore, Part 1 of Cohort 1 was to be 
expanded by [CONTACT_124723] 12 additional subjects (in order to have at least 10 evaluable subjects at Week 4) in Part 1b, aiming at an equal distribution of subjects between the two age groups (i.e., subjects ≥12 to <15 years of age and subjects ≥15 to <18 years of age). 
Part 1b included 14 subjects, 8 subjects in the age group ! 12 to <15 years and 6 subjects in the 
age group !15 to <[ADDRESS_140179] of RPV in adolescents to assess whether continued treatment with RPV 25 mg q.d. was acceptable. The IDMC deemed the results satisfactory and hence, long-term safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated in a larger group of subjects (Part 2). It could have been that the short -term results indicated the need for a switch to 
a lower dose for all Part [ADDRESS_140180] been an additional analysis (pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, antiviral activity) when these subjects had b een treated with the weight-adjusted dose for 
4 weeks (+/-1 week). The appropriate dose for subjects entering Part 2 was assessed based on the data obtained in Part 1. The results indicated that no RPV dose adjustment was needed, as confirmed by [CONTACT_31849]. For more details on the trial design, please refer to Section 2.2and 
Section 6.1.1.
In Part 1a of Cohort 1, subjects with a screening viral load ≥5,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL could 
be included, an inclusion criterion which also applied in the Phase III trials. Data from these Phase III trials showed a higher virologic failure rate at Week 48 in the RPV-treated subjects with a baseline viral load >100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL compared to subjects with a baseline viral load ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, a trend which was also seen in the control group but 
to a lesser extent. Therefore, in line with the anticipated indication in adults in the European Economic Area
47, the Sponsor has decided to limit the recruitment of the adolescent population 
in Part 1b and Part 2 to subjects with a screening viral load ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.
The lower limit for screening viral load was changed as well, from 5,000 to 500 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, as current treatment guidelines in adolescents
48indicate that treatment initiation 
should primarily depend on CD4+cell count and other clinical factors, but not on viral load. So 
in Part 1b and Part 2, only subjects with a screening viral load ≥500 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL but 
≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL will be enrolled. The 4-week interim analysis of Part 1b was to 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_124724] 2.At the time of protocol amendment [ADDRESS_140181] been enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 
of this cohort. A summary of the 48-week results is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. For more details 
refer to the clinical study report of Cohort 1
53or the abstract54.
All subjects in Part 1 will continue their ART (RPV plus an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 N[t]RTIs) during the review period by [CONTACT_31849].To ensure that the duration between baseline and the review by [CONTACT_124716] 1awas kept as short as possible, investigators were to identify eligible subjects in advance. 
Recruitment was to be started when the majority of the sites had the necessary documentation [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 77
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020and approvals in place and were therefore considered activated for enrollment. Recruitment for Part 1a has already been closed and the enrolled subjects can continue in the trial as judged by [CONTACT_31849]. For Part 1b, recruitment could start at the individual sites as soon as the necessary documentation and approvals were in place, and was closed once the required number of subjects was recruited. Trial sites were informed in advance regarding stop of recruitment.The [ADDRESS_140182] typi[INVESTIGATOR_124629]-like activity and the pharmacokinetics in adolescents are often similar to the pharmacokinetics in adults
15. The hepatic metabolism of RPV involves mainly CYP3A4, the 
activity of which has largely matured by [CONTACT_14898] 2 years36,37. The adult dose of RPV (i.e. 25 
mg q.d.) is therefore anticipated to result in similar exposures in adolescents as compared to adults, and to be a generally safe and efficaci ous dose for the adolescent population as well. This 
is currently confirmed in the Week 48 results of the adolescent cohort (Cohort 1).Children with HIV infection are known to often present with a stunted growth and a low bodyweight compared to healthy children, even more so if additional risk factors for growth impairment are present
38. In order to ensure that a representative fraction of the HIV-infected 
adolescent population can be studied in the trial, adolescents with  a body weight as of 32 kg are 
allowed to enter the trial in Cohort 1 (i.e., the 10thpercentile of the growth curve for body weight 
for healthy adolescents aged 12 years)31.
In trial TMC278-C204, adult ARV treatment-naïve HIV-infected subjects weighing between 38.[ADDRESS_140183] of body weight on RPVexposure was found to be not significant within this population, as assessed using the population pharmacokinetic model
39. Based on this, it is anticipated that the RPV exposure with the 25 mg 
q.d. dose would not be significantly different between subjects weighing 32 kg or 40 kg (40 kg being approximately the lowe r body weight limit observed in trial TMC278-C204). However, as 
the effects of body weight  on exposure could become more im portant in the lo wer body weight 
range, the theoretical potential increase in expos ure was estimated by a dding body wei ght as a 
covariate function in the population pharmacokinetic model, with a widely used scaling factor 
for pediatrics of 0.75
14. The RPV exposure for subjects with a body weight of 32 kg is estimated 
to be 16% higher for mean AUC 24hand 20% higher for mean C max, as compared to these 
parameters for subjects of [ADDRESS_140184] linear mixed model was fitted to the pooled data of the 2 thorough QT trials (TMC278-TiDP6-C131

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020C15112), in order to better characterize the relationship between RPV plasma concentrations and 
change in QTcF over a wide plasma concentration range. This indicated that at plasma concentrations of 420 ng/mL (i.e., double the C
maxobserved in HIV-infected adults on RPV 25 
mg q.d.), the mean (90% CI) time-matched change from baseline in QTcF is estimated to be 4.6 ms (2.8–6.4 ms), indicating that RPV at these plasma concentrations does not cause a clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval.In addition to the above, there was no pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for any other safety parameters in trial TMC278-C204.Taking into account all of the above, the 25 mg q.d. dose is therefore expected to be a safe and efficacious dose for the adolescent population studied in the current trial ( ≥12 to <[ADDRESS_140185] 32 kg).Also for the backbone medications ABC and 3TC used in the current trial the adult dose is recommended for children ≥ 30 kg, for efavirenz (approved NNRTI for pediatric use) the adult 
dose is recommended for children >40 kg, for AZT the adult dose is recommended for children >12 years, for FTC the adult dose is recommended for children ≥33 kg, and for TDF the adult 
dose is recommended for children ≥12 years and ≥35 kg.
In case of inadequate exposure, dose adjustments of RPV cannot be allowed at this stage in order to avoid exposing children to a daily dose exceeding the total adult daily dose (i.e., 25 mg q.d.). The combined use of at least 3 active ARV drugs in ARV treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects is currently recommended due to the inherent high mutation rate of HIV
1,16. One 
recommended treatment regimen for ARV treatment-naïve subjects is 2 N(t)RTIs and an NNRTI. Therefore, all subjects in this trial will receive, in addition to the NNRTI RPV, an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 N(t)RTIs (AZT, ABC, or TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC). Consistent with the treatment guidelines for ART, sensitivity to the chosen N(t)RTIs should be established. In this trial, the subject’s sensitivity at screening will be established using HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
1.
The combination of ABC with 3TC and AZT with 3TC are recommended and approved N(t)RTI regimens for first line use in adults and adolescents
1,16.
When looking at the subset of subjects who used AZT/3TC as background regimen in the RPVdose finding trial in adults (TMC278-C204), it was shown that there were no safety or tolerability concerns with coadministration of these NRTIs and RPV
8. Based on the metabolic 
profiles and elimination, clinically relevant interactions between the other NRTI in the background regimen and RPV are unlikely

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 79
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Data from a recent clinical trial indicated that combination therapy including ABC/3TC is less effective in ARV treatment-naïve adult subjects with a high viral load at screening (≥100,000 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) compared to regimens containing TDF/ FTC. Moreover, it 
was found that among adult subjects with a high viral load at screening, those subjects receiving ABC/3TC developed non-specific side effects, such as body aches, and laboratory test 
abnormalities, such as elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, faster compared to those receiving TDF/FTC
17. Recent use of ABC was also reported to be associated with increased risk 
of myocardial infarction, especially in adult subjects with a high underlying cardiovascular risk
18, but this has not been confirmed by [CONTACT_124731]. Fatal hypersensitivity reactions 
have been associated with ART including ABC (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in approximately 5% of adult and pediatric subjects receiving ABC
18. Since the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_124631]-B*5701 allele19, subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results for 
whom the investigator considers ABC/3TC as background regimen should test negative for HLA-B*5701 at screening to limit the risk of hypersensitivity reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details). If a subject is planned to be switched to an ABC-containing background regimen during 
the trial (due to intolerance, see Section 6.3.5), an HLA-B*[ADDRESS_140186] has to be performed to 
determine eligibility to start ABC treatment (unless prior documented negative results are available).There have been reports of delusions and inappropriate behavior in subjects receiving licensed NNRTIs, predominantly in subjects with a history of mental illness or substance abuse. Severe acute depression (including suicidal ideation/attempts) has also been reported in subjects receiving NVP or EFV (package insert). In trial TMC278-C204, 6.5% of subjects receiving RPV [ADDRESS_140187] of care for this population, to determine who needs to be referred for a complete mental health assessment by a mental health professional (see Section 6.4.11 for 
details).Pharmacokinetic evaluations have shown that RPV is better absorbed following oral administration with food. Therefore intake should occur with a meal. For details, see Section 6.3.4. Whenever possible, RPV should be taken around the same time each day, with 
approximately 24 hours between the doses. Intake of the N(t)RTIs in the background regimen will be according to the locally applicable procedures and package inserts. A trial duration of minimally 48 weeks is mandatory for providing long-term safety and efficacy data

At the time of Amendment 10 , 240-week results from Cohort 1 (adolescents aged ≥12 to <18 
years) are available. The 4-year follow-up data in adolescents did not show an effect on pubertal [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020development. No clinically relevant suppression of cortisol secretion is observed in adults62,63or 
adolescents aged ≥12 to <18 years (Cohort 1)64,65. Also, in the first 9 children aged ≥ 6 to <12 
years in Cohort 2 of this study there were no emergent cortisol abnormalities and no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency
66. The following RPV dose recommendations were 
determined based on accumulating data and were endorsed by [CONTACT_31849], in order to achievesimilar exposure to RPV compared to adults: RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg, and RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg. Appropriateness of these 
doses will be further evaluated in this study. At the time of protocol amendment 6 writing, new clinical information has become available. For the discussion of the trial design in children (Cohort 2), a summary of relevant new and existinginformation has been provided below.In mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys RPV affects adrenal hormone biosynthesis by [CONTACT_124732] 21-hydroxylase and 17-hydroxylase (the latter in cynomolgus monkey only). Studies in dogs indicate that this effect does not occur after a single dose but that repeated dosing is needed to alter adrenal hormone levels in the circulation. There is potential concern for RPV to cause partial adrenal insufficiency, virilization in girls and/or growth retardation due to 21-hydroxylase inhibition. Studies in juvenile female cynomolgus monkeys, a more relevant species than dogs, did not show evidence of induction of premature ovulation, therefore the effects on the estrous cycle in dogs is not considered relevant for pre-pubertal children. In case significant inhibition of cortisol synthesis would occur (partial adrenal insufficiency), androgen production might increase. In girls, this could result in masculinization and blunted growth. In boys, due to increased levels of testosterone, growth might also be impaired. No clinically relevant mean change from baseline in serum cortisol levels or 17-hy droxyproges terone levels over time have 
been observed in the clinical Phase IIb or III stud ies in adult men and women or in the Week [ADDRESS_140188] was observed 
for gonadal laboratory parameters in adults or adolescents. As a precaution, endocrine testing will be conducted in this trial to verify whether any clinically relevant adrenal and/or gonadal effects of RPV are observed in pre-pubertal children.Results of the Phase  III stud ies in adults show that virologic response (<50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, TLOVR) 
rates at Week 96 and in the extension after Week 96 were high and consistent between the Phase III studies. In the Week 96 pooled Phas e III analysis a virologic response of <50 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (ITT, TLOVR) was achieved in 77.6% of s ubjects in both the RPV and control group
(EFV). The proportion of virologic responders was higher in subjects with a baseline plasma viral load ≤100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL compared to subjects with baseline viral load 
>100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. RPV was non i nferior to control. In the Week 96 pooled Phase III analysis, 
beyond 48 weeks there were a limited number of additional virologic failures with fewer virologic failures in subjects with baseline viral load ≤100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL compared to subjects 
with baseline viral load >100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 81
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020In the Week 96 pooled Phase III analysis, RPV provided clear immunologic benefits. The CD4+
cell count increased from Week [ADDRESS_140189] frequently and was commonly seen in combination with the M184I RAM. The FTC and 3TC RAMs M184I/V emerged more frequently in subjects experiencing virologic failure treated with RPV compared with subjects experiencing virologic failure treated with control (EFV).In the Week [ADDRESS_140190] 48 
weeks of the trial and no new safety signals we re observed thereafter. Overall RPV administered 
at 25 mg q.d. in combination with 2N(t)RTIs was generally safe and well tolerated. The most commonly reported AEs in the RPV group were headache (15.5%), nausea (14.6%), diarrhea (13.7%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (12.8%), and nasopharyngitis (12.8%), with similar incidences in the control group. Dizziness and rash (preferred term) were reported statistically significantly less on RPV than on control. A lower incidence on RPV than on control was observed for treatment-related AEs ( ≥grade 2), skin events of interest (including rash [grouped 
term]), neurologic events of interest, psychiatric events of interest, and grade [ADDRESS_140191] on 21-hydroxylase or 
17-hydroxylase. There were no clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of adrenal or gonadal 
dysfunction. In the Week 48 and Week 96 pooled Ph ase III analyses, there was a gradual mean 
increase (from baseline) in QTcF, similar in both treatment groups at all time points. No gender difference was observed. This mean increase from baseline was less pronounced in the TDF/FTC subgroup than in the AZT/3TC subgroup. The incidence of prolonged QTcF (>480 ms) was low in both treatment groups (0.3%). There were no QTcF >500 ms, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_124632]-arrhythmic threshold. No AEs suggestive of ventricular  tachyarrhythmia were reported. There was no 
relationship between exposure to RPV (AUC
24h) and the maximum mean change from baseline 
in QTcF across the exposure range in Phase III. No apparent relationship was observed between the pharmacokinetic parameters of RPV 25 mg q.d. and the occurrence of AEs or changes in laboratory or ECG parameters. Although it seems that RPV at the recommended dose has minimal effects on adults’ ECG and no ECG-related AEs or clinically relevant ECG abnormalities were reported in the adolescent cohort of this trial (see below), its effect on the ECG parameters of children <12 years of age needs to be established and will therefore be monitored in this trial.The Week 48 efficacy analysis resu lts of the adolescent cohort ( !12 to <18 years of age) of this 
trial, demonstrated that RPV 25 mg q.d., in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen, is efficacious in adolescents of ≥12 to <18 years. A virologic response of 
<50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (ITT, TLOVR) was achieved in 26/36 (72.2%) subjects at Week 48. At Week 48, the proportion of virologic responders was higher in subjects with a baseline plasma viral load 
≤100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (78.6%) than in the limited number of subjects with a baseline plasma viral [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

The observed treatment-emergent RPV and NRTI RAMs were previously identified in the Phase III studies conducted in adults.To date and based on all in vitro and in vivo data, [ADDRESS_140194] been identified as potential determinants of decreased antiviral activity of RPV. These

No apparent relationships were observed between th e RPV pharmacokinetics and efficacy or safety 
parameters at Week 48.The safety data up to Week 48 demonstrated that RPV, administered at 25 mg q.d., in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 N(t)RTIs, was generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents. RPV did not appear to affect pubertal development or growthin these adolescents nor did it appear to have an effect on ECG parameters. The RPV safety profile as established in HIV-1 infected ARV treatment-naïve adults was confirmed in adolescents.For further information on the above mentioned non-clinical and clinical data, see the Investigator’s Brochure

4. Similarly, data in adolescents between [ADDRESS_140195] of body weight 
on the RPV exposure53. While at some point, smaller body weight/size is expected to become 
more important and may start to have an effect on the RPV pharmacokinetics; it is at present not clear as of what age/body weight this would be.  
  
  
 Therefore, the 25 mg qd dose is considered adequate 
as a starting dose for children 6 to 12 years of age. However, the pharmacokinetic data will be evaluated in real-time every time a child has completed its intensive pharmacokinetic visit, and in the event the pharmacokinetic guidelines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) cannot be met for the mini-
cohort or full group of subjects with a body weight of <25 kg, an alternative dose will be determined for evaluation. The background regimen selection will be similar as in Cohort 1(adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age): a regimen of 2 N(t)RTIs will be selected by [CONTACT_1275]. For details about timing of dosing, see Section 6.3.4.
In Cohort 2, children with a body weight as of 17 kg are allowed to enter the trial in this cohort (i.e., the 10
thpercentile of the growth curve for body weight for healthy children aged 6 years)31.
Similar as in Cohort 1, the risk of depression in subjects in Cohort 2 will be assessed at every visit indicated in the flowchart (see Section 6.4.11 for details). 
To accommodate regulatory requirements concerning the evaluation of RPV in the pediatric population, overall across studies C213 (Cohort 2; children aged ≥6 to <12 years) and 
TMC278HTX2002 (children aged ≥2 to <12 years with a body weight of ≥11 kg), approximately 
[ADDRESS_140196] 12 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140197] 7 subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140198] 10 subjects in Cohort 2, including PK modeling and simulation to further assess the RPV pediatric dose based on accumulating data, was discussed with and endorsed by [CONTACT_31849]. With this, at the time of Amendment 10 , the following RPV dose recommendations 
will apply to newly enrolled subjects:
∀RPV 25 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of ≥25 kg
∀RPV 15 mg q.d. for subjects with a body weight of <25 kg
All ongoing subjects in Cohort 2 (who are already in the post Week 48 treatment extension period at the time of Amendment 10) will remain on the RPV 25 mg q.d. dose + 2 N(t)RTIs 
(investigator-selected), until their roll-over to  study TMC278IFD3004 has been completed (see 
addendum 7.11). All newly recruited subjects will start treatment with the weight-appropriate [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020RPV dose stated above + 2 N(t)RTIs (investigator-selected), until they reach a total treatment duration of 48 weeks or discontinue earlier. If newl y recruited subjects with a body weight of 
<25 kg, increase in weight such that they require a 25 mg RPV dose, they can change to the 25 mg tablet formulation.To further evaluate and confirm the RPV dose for subjects with lower body weight, newly enrolled subjects with a body weight of <25 kg require intensive PK evaluation. An overall analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_124693] (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for dose evaluation criteria).
∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory, and no alternative RPV dose seems feasible, all 
subjects will be seen for a Withdrawal visit, treatment with RPV will be stopped, subjects will be switched to local standard of care, and Cohort 2 will be stopped. 
∀If the results are not deemed satisfactory but concerns can be addressed by [CONTACT_124694] (doses of >25 mg q.d. are not allowed) for certain subjects (e.g. up to a certain body weight), those subjects will be switched to an adjusted dose, while those that don't need dose adjustment, will continue their treatment. For all subjects who require an RPV dose adjustment, a 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation after [ADDRESS_140199] 4 weeks or discontinued earlier, an analysis of the intensive pharmacokinetic data (after 14 to 18 days of RPV dosing), and all available safety, tolerability and antiviral activity/efficacy  data will be reviewed. If, after review of 
the data, the RPV dose is still not acceptable, the process will be repeated until an acceptable RPV dose is found or it is deemed necessary to stop Cohort 2.
Once an appropriate RPV dose has been selected, Part 1 of Cohort 2 will be considered complete and Part 2 in which long-term safety, efficacy , and pharmacokinetics of RPV will be evaluated,
will start. For more details on the trial design, please refer to Section 2.2and Section 6.1.1.
As in Cohort 1, a trial duration of minimally 48 weeks is mandatory for providing long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data in this age group

Note: To reassess eligibility, retesting of a screening value that leads to exclusion will be 
allowed only once during the screening period using an unscheduled visit.
8. In the judgment of the investigator, it is appropriate to initiate ART based on the subject’s 
medical condition and taking into account guidelines for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in children of this age group.
9. Results from the screening HIV-1 genotype demonstrate sensitivity to the selected N(t)RTIs.10. Subject is able to swallow the RPV tablet as a whole (since the tablet cannot be chewed, 
broken, or crushed), except when the appropriate RPV dose for the subjects is determined to 
be <25 mg (only applicable for subjects enrolled after it has been decided that a lower RPV dose is appropriate for subjects up to a certain e. g., age or body weight). In this case an age-
appropriate formulation other than the tablet formulation will be provided.
11. The subject agrees (or their parents/caregivers agree, in case the subject's age is below the 
cut-off age for consent according to local regulations, in which case the subject is informed and asked to give positive assent) not to start ART before the baseline visit.

methods or not willing to continue practicing these birth control methods from screening onwards until at least [ADDRESS_140208] intake of RPV .
Note: RPV [ADDRESS_140209] agree to use one of the 
following birth control methods:
%A diaphragm or cervical cap and the male partner should use a condom;
%A hormonal contraceptive or an intra-uterine device (IUD) in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom);
or
%Be non- heterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence or have a vasectomized 
partner.
Note: A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction 
between the two can result in failing of either product.
Note: Spermicides should not be used as this can potentially increase the rate of HIV-1 
transmission22.
Note: A cervical cap has been shown to be less effective in parous women. Therefore, the 
combination of a cervical cap with oral contraceptives is preferably not used in parous girls in this trial.
16. Heterosexually active boys without the use of effective birth control methods or not willing 
to continue practicing these birth control methods from screening onwards until [ADDRESS_140210] intake of RPV .

Note: Retesting of abnormal screening values that lead to exclusion will be allowed only once 
for each laboratory test using an unscheduled visit during the screening period (to reassess eligibility). 
Note: Investigators should ensure that all trial enrollment criteria have been met at screening. If 
a subject's status changes (including any available laboratory results or receipt of additional medical records) after screening but before the first dose of study drug is given such that he or she no longer meets all eligibility criteria, then the subject should be excluded from participation in the trial. Section 3.4, Source Data, describes the required 
documentation to support meeting the enrollment criteria.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 90
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE].2.4. Precautions and Restrictions
Potential subjects must be willing and able to adhere to the following precaution measures and restrictions during the course of the trial to be eligible for participation.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Precautions
It is the investigator’s responsibility to provide appropriate counseling about precautions to avoid the risk of transmitting HIV.Since the effects of RPV on gestation are unknow n, heterosexually active boys and girls of 
childbearing potential should receive counseling about birth control methods
23.
Boys and girls of childbearing potential having heterosexual intercourse must agree to use 2 contraceptive methods in conjunction with their sex partner, i.e., use a condom in 
combination with hormonal contraceptives, an IUD, diaphragm, or cervical cap.Note: A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between the 
two can result in failing of either product.
Note: Spermicide should not be used as this can potentially increase the rate of HIV-1 
transmission22.
Note: A cervical cap has been shown to be less effective in parous women. Therefore, the 
combination of a cervical cap with oral contraceptives is preferably not used in parous girls in this trial.
All HIV-infected boys are advised to use a condom to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV .These precautions apply from screening onwards until one month after the last study drug administration, i.e., until [ADDRESS_140213] to th e reproductive toxicity of RPV, please see the 
current Investigator’s Brochure
4.
Girls should not breastfeed when taking RPV, as the effects to their newborn child are unknown. Girls who have a newborn child should talk to their investigator about the best way to feed their child. They should be aware that HIV could be transmitted through breastfeeding.For the N(t)RTI background regimen, the package insert should be consulted with regard to directions concerning birth control and breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Restrictions 
During the conduct of the trial, subjects are not allowed to participate in any other clinical trials that include any blood sampling with a volume higher than 50 mL taken over the course of 6 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 91
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020months, specimen collection, or other interventional procedure. Concurrent participation in non-interventional observational trials is allowed as long as there is no impact on the objectives of this trial. Data collected in this trial can be reported in the observational trial.No treatment interruptions are allowed prior to intensive PK in either cohort of the trial.The consumption of grapefruit juice is not allowed during the trial. In addition, the subjects included prior to intensive PK in either cohort of the trial, may not consume beverages containing quinine (e.g., tonic, bitter lemon, bitter alcoholic beverages containing quinine), until after the pharmacokinetic sampling day at Week 2. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more 
information on disallowed medication.
6.2.5. Removal of Subjects From Therapy or Assessment
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported after discontinuation of 3TC in subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection who are using this agent in their ARV regimen. Discontinuation of this agent for any reason in subjects with hepatitis B infection should be undertaken with caution. Careful clinical and laboratory assessment of the hepatic status should be undertaken for at least several months in such subjects. Initiation of specific anti-hepatitis B therapy may be required.Subjects may be withdrawn from the trial if:
1. An SAE occurs.2. They fail to comply with the protocol requirements or to cooperate with the trial staff.3. They do not respect the washout period of disallowed medication (i.e., a period of at least 
[ADDRESS_140214] intake of RPV), or start treatment with one of the medications reported on the list of disallowed medications (see Section 6.3.13).
4. The subject experiences a grade 3 AE or confirmed grade 3 laboratory abnormality, 
according to DAIDS grading table (see the DAIDS grading table in Addendum 2, Section 7.2). Exceptions are (unless clinical assessment foresees an immediate health risk to 
the subject):%Glucose elevations of grade 3 in subjects with pre-existing diabetes (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
%Asymptomatic glucose, triglyceride, or cholesterol elevations of grade 3 (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and6.5.11.2)
%Asymptomatic pancreatic amylase elevations of grade 3 in subjects with no history or concomitant disease of pancreatitis (see Section 6.5.4 )
%A grade 3 AE that is considered not related or doubtfully related to RPVFor grade 3 cutaneous reaction/rash, allergic reaction, or neurological events, persistent grade 3 glucose elevations despi[INVESTIGATOR_124636]/treatment, grade 3 elevation in lipase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Note: For grade [ADDRESS_140216] experiences an ABC hypersensitivity reaction (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]); ABC 
treatment must be discontinued immediately. N(t)RTI background regimen will be replaced by [CONTACT_124736] 2 N(t)RTIs (Brand name [CONTACT_124845]/or WHO prequalified drugs. If not available; generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124737].). At all times the background regimen should consist of 2 N(t)RTIs and the subject’s HIV-1 genotype at screening should show sensitivity to the alternative N(t)RTIs. The subject must never be rechallenged with any medicinal product that contains ABC (Ziagen®, Trizivir®, or Epzicom®/Kivexa®).
6. The subject demonstrates:
%Loss of virologic response (i.e., 2 consecutive measurements of >400 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at least 2 weeks apart after having been confirmed virologic responder [defined as having had 2 consecutive measurements of <400 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL]). Withdrawal of the subject should be based on clinical judgment and preferably be discussed with the Sponsor.
Subjects must be withdrawn from the trial if:
1. The pharmacokinetics or safety and antiv iral activity/efficacy of RPV in the first part of 
either cohort of the trial are not satisfactory (as judged by [CONTACT_31849]), the subjects included in this first part will be seen for a Withdrawal visit, treatment with RPV will be stopped, subjects will be switched to a locally available ARV regimen or local standard of care, and the cohort will be stopped (see also Section 6.1.1 ). Until the review by [CONTACT_124738], subjects will continue the intake of RPV and the background regimen. In case a cohort is stopped after the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling, a sample of the subjects participating in this cohort will be analyzed in real time for the determination of HIV-1 genotype (as long as the viral load is sufficiently high to allow HIV-1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), in order to assist in the selection of a new ARV regimen. When determination of HIV-[ADDRESS_140217] or parent/caregiver withdraws consent.3. The investigator considers, for safety reasons, it is in the best interest of the subject that

Additional unscheduled visits may be performed for safety/tolerability reasons and for confirmation of plasma viral load results. For these subjects, the date and reasons for discontinuation should be completed on the Trial Termination pages of the eCRF, on the date of discontinuation. Remaining data should be completed on the date of the last scheduled follow-up visit.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

The study drug, RPV, will be provided under the responsibility of the Sponsor.RPV is formulated as an oral film-coated tablet  containing 27.[ADDRESS_140229] be dispersed prior to use.
6.3.2. Other Medication Administered in the Trial
The investigator-selected N(t)RTIs will be AZT, ABC, or TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC, whichever are approved and marketed or considered local standard of care for children aged !6 
to <18 years in a particular country. The background regimen will be given as the co-formulation or as the separate components according to local availability and use in the country (e.g., Combivir® or AZT/3TC, Epzicom®/Kivexa® or ABC/3TC, Truvada® or TDF/FTC).N(t)RTIs will be prescribed by [CONTACT_124741] 48 weeks of treatment. During the 4-year treatment extension period if applicable, it is not the 
Sponsor's intention to reimburse N(t)RTIs (Note: for countries where it is objectionable or 
impossible for N[t]RTIs to not be reimbursed during the extension period, the Sponsor will consider reimbursement of N[t]RTIs on a case by [CONTACT_413]).
6.3.3. Dosage and Treatment Overview Per Subject
All subjects will receive RPV in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen consisting of 2 N(t)RTIs:
Screening period(maximum 8 weeks)No ARV treatment administration.
Initial Treatment period(48 weeks)Treatment extension, if applicable (192 weeks)RPV 25 mg q.d., administered as 1 RPV tablet; or RPV adjusted dose q.d. administered as age-appropriate formulation other than the tablet formulation, if applicable; plusAn investigator-selected background regimen consisting of 2 N(t)RTIs.
Follow-up period(4 weeks)Investigator-selected regimen.
Subjects who started on the age-appropriate formulation, in case an adjusted RPV dose was required, will increase their RPV dose according to the final dosing schedule by [CONTACT_8497]/age[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

If subjects increase in weight and/or age such that they require a 25-mg RPV dose, they can change to the 25-mg tablet formulation.The selected N(t)RTIs will be used in doses that are specified in the individual product labels or for which sufficient supporting data are available for use in this age group. Only branded versions of the N(t)RTIs, or generics with tentative US FDA approval and/or WHO prequalified drugs are to be prescribed by [CONTACT_093]. If not available; generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124695] (i.e., UNICEF) can be allowed upon approval by [CONTACT_456]. Applicable procedures and guidance based on package inserts should be respected.For those subjects who do not tolerate the selected N(t)RTIs, switching to alternative N(t)RTIs (Brand name [CONTACT_124845]/or WHO prequalified drugs. If not available; generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124737].) is allowed for some predefined toxicities (see Section 6.3.5 for details).
6.3.4. Timing of Dosing
Pharmacokinetic evaluations have shown that RPV is better absorbed following oral administration with food. Therefore, RPV should always be administered with a meal.Whenever possible, RPV should be taken around the same time each day (each dose should be separated by [CONTACT_3450] 24 hours). The 25-mg tab lets should be taken as a whole, and cannot 
be chewed, broken, or crushed.Before the visit of the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects participating in the first partof either cohort of the trial should take RPV with breakfast. This breakfast will be standardized in the morning of the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. The standardized breakfast, provided at the site for Cohort 1, will consist of four slices of bread with ham or cheese, or cold cereal (1 serving size) and [ADDRESS_140230], butter, jelly, and one or two cups of orange juice, coffee or 
tea, with milk and/or sugar, as desired. For subjects in Cohort 2 an age-appropriate meal will be provided. If more practical, subjects can switch the intake of RPV to another time of the day (always with a meal), after the visit of the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling.Subjects in either cohort of the trial should take RPV with the main meal of the day throughout the trial.The intake of the N(t)RTIs in the background regi men will be according to the locally applicable 
procedures and package inserts, but preferably at the same time as RPV for N(t)RTIs with a q.d. regimen. For N(t)RTIs with a b.i.d. regimen, one of the doses is preferably taken together with RPV; the other dose is taken according to the label.Subjects will be instructed to start taking their ART, respecting the food requirements, on the day of the baseline visit (Day 1), or on the following da y if for some reason it is not possible to start [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 98
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020RPV intake at baseline. The date of the first intake of RPV will be recorded on the eCRF. All ARVs (including the background N[t]RTIs) should be started on the same day, as instructed by 
[CONTACT_093].In case a subject missed the intake of RPV, and this is noticed within [ADDRESS_140231] may then continue his/her usual dosing schedule. In case a subject missed the intake of RPV, and it is noticed more than [ADDRESS_140232] should not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.For missed doses of N(t)RTIs in the background regimen, refer to the respective package inserts.
6.3.5. Individually Selected Background Regimen
Once the screening resistance data (HIV-1 genotype) have become available, the investigator is to select a background regimen consisting of 2 N( t)RTIs, with a choice limited to AZT, ABC, or 
TDF in combination with 3TC or FTC, whichever is approved, marketed, or considered local standard of care for children aged !6 to <18 years in a particular country. The background 
regimen will be given as the co-formulation or as the separate components according to local availability and use in the country (e.g., Combivir
®or AZT/3TC, Epzicom®/Kivexa® or 
ABC/3TC, Truvada®or TDF/FTC).
In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in approximately 5% of adult and pediatric subjects receiving ABC
18. Since the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_124638]-B*5701 allele19, subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 
negative results in whom the investigator considers ABC/3TC as background regimen should test negative for HLA-B*5701 at screening to avoid hypersensitivity reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
for details). If a subject is planned to be switched to an ABC-containing background regimen during the trial (due to intolerance, see paragraph below), an HLA-B*[ADDRESS_140233] has to be performed to determine eligibility to start ABC treatment (unless prior documented specific negative results are available). A change of background regimen will be allowed in case the following AEs are reported and preferably after written approval from the Sponsor:
%Lactic acidosis
%Hepatotoxicity, including severe hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations
%Renal impairment
%Anemia
%Hypersensitivity reactions[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 99
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020The symptoms of intolerance to the N(t)RTIs should be reported as AEs and should be clearly documented as leading to the change in N(t)RTIs . If the tolerability issue is related to only 1 of 
the 2 N(t)RTIs it is only needed to switch that one. At all times, the background regimen should consist of 2 N(t)RTIs (Brand name [CONTACT_80378] [or generics with tentative US FDA approval and/or WHO prequalified drugs]. If not available; generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124742].), and the subject’s HIV-1 genotype at screening should show sensitivity to the alternative N(t)RTIs.Alternative N(t)RTIs will be used in doses that are specified in the individual product labels or for which sufficient supporting data are available. Only branded versions of the N(t)RTIs, orgenerics with tentative US FDA approval and/or WHO prequalified drugs are to be prescribed by [CONTACT_093]. If not available; generic drugs approved by [CONTACT_124743] (i.e., UNICEF) can be allowed upon approval by [CONTACT_456]. Applicable procedures and treatment guidance based on package inserts of the selected N(t)RTIs should be respected. The use of PIs, NNRTIs (other than RPV), ENF, integrase inhibitors and investigational ARVs 
during the trial is not allowed.In the second part of either cohort of the trial, temporary interruption of all ARVs during the treatment period will be allowed in the event of suspected toxicity, as long as the temporary interruption is associated with and can be linked to  an AE or an SAE and this is not one of the 
cases listed in Section 6.2.5 or Section 6.5. The maximum allowed duration of a single treatment 
interruption for toxicity reasons will be 4 weeks and the maximum allowed cumulative duration 
of the treatment interruptions for toxicity reasons  will be 8 weeks (interruptions are counted 
cumulatively within a time frame of 48 weeks). Subjects should maintain the regular visit schedule during the treatment interruptions. Additional unscheduled visits may be performed for safety or tolerability reasons. Re-initiation of therapy including the background regimen will 
only be allowed once the event has resolved or decreased to a grade [ADDRESS_140234] be withdrawn from the trial in case the total cumulative duration of treatment interruptions for suspected toxicities is more than 8 weeks (interruptions are counted cumulatively within a time frame of 48 weeks) or the duration of a single treatment interruption for a suspected toxicity is more than 4 weeks (see Section 6.2.5). 
Special considerations may be warranted for the discontinuation of certain ARV agents:
%When discontinuing ART for any reason, please take the following into consideration: NNRTIs, including RPV, have a long plasma elimination half-life compared to N(t)RTIs. In presentations and publications, it has been hypothesized that this difference in elimination half-life of ARVs when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124639]
25,26. Some experts 
recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124640], before the other ARVs (i.e., the N[t]RTI background regimen). Currently, however, there is no consensus on the approach to this issue either among the scientific community or in treatment guidelines.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 100
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020%Discontinuation of 3TC in subjects with hepatitis B co-infection: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported after discontinuation of 3TC in subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection who are using this agent in their ARV regimen. Discontinuation of this agent for any reason in subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection should be undertaken with caution. Careful clinical and laboratory assessment of hepatic status should be undertaken for at least several months in such subjects . Initiation of specific anti-hepatitis B therapy 
may be required (see Section 6.5.3).
%Subjects who develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction related to ABC treatment must discontinue ABC treatment immediately. If a hypersensitivity reaction 
cannot be ruled out, no medicinal product containing ABC (Ziagen
®, Trizivir®, or 
Epzicom®/Kivexa®) should be restarted. Restarting any ABC-containing product following 
a hypersensitivity reaction results in a prompt return of symptoms within hours. This recurrence of the hypersensitivity reaction may be more severe than on initial presentation, and may include life-threatening hypotension and death (for more details, see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
6.3.6. Packaging and Labeling
The study drug (RPV) will be packed under responsibility of the Sponsor.Labels will be according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
27Annex 13 and local 
requirements.No medication can be repacked or relabeled without prior approval from the Sponsor.
6.3.7. Randomization
As this is a single arm trial, no randomization procedures are applicable.
6.3.8. Blinding and Unblinding
As this is an open trial, blinding procedures are not applicable.
6.3.9. Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An IDMC will be installed to monitor pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety/tolerability data(including individual growth and pubertal development as part of physical examination), and to safeguard the subjects participating in this trial. The IDMC will include external experts only (two pediatric HIV specialists, a pediatric endocrinologist, a clinical pharmacologist, and a statistician). The main role of this IDMC is to evaluate accumulating pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data, and to make recommendations regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial.Further details will be described in the IDMC charter.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

All these records must be up to date and available for inspection at any time. When subjects bring their medication to the site for counting, this is not considered as a return of supplies.
6.3.11. Storage
All supplies of RPV must be stored at room temperature (15 to 30°C or 59 to 86°F) unless otherwise specified and in the original packaging. Should a deviation in storage conditions occur for RPV, the site should refrain from any further dispensation of the affected medication and provide the monitor immediately with the following information:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

to prevent an accidental rechallenge.
6.3.12. Adherence
Drug adherence is critical to the success of any treatment regimen. Poor or even sub-optimal adherence to an ARV regimen can lead to incomplete suppression of viral replication and treatment failure, resulting in the emergence of drug-resistant virus.There is evidence that adherence problems occur frequently in children. In a randomized treatment trial, caregivers reported that 30% of children missed one or more doses of ARV medications in the preceding 3 days
22. These findings illustrate the difficulty of maintaining high 
levels of adherence and underscore the need to work in partnership with families to make adherence assessment, education, and support integral components of care. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 103
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020To optimize adherence in this trial, counseling should be planned by [CONTACT_093]/trial personnel with the subject, and their parent(s)/caregiver(s) at the screening visit to discuss the individual issues that may affect each adolescent’s or child's chances of successfully adhering to treatment. At the baseline visit, a second adherence counseling session should take place and clear instructions need to be given regarding the intake of the regimen.A medication adherence check (e.g., review the adherence questionnaire or drug accountability) and additional medication adherence counseling should take place at every subsequent trial visit.During the entire trial (i.e., in both parts of all cohorts of the trial), compliance to RPV and the background regimen will be assessed by [CONTACT_124750] (see Addenda 7 and 8) and for RPV as documented on the drug accountability form. Site staff, such as a counselor, should support the subject or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) to complete the questionnaire together, where the subject or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) provides the responses to the counselor. Once the subject or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) have completed the questionnaire, the site staff should review it for completeness. The questionnaire will be collected and the data will be entered into the trial database by [CONTACT_58047].In addition, from the start of RPV treatment until the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling,subjects or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) should complete a diary documenting the intakes of RPVfrom the start of treatment with RPV 25 mg q.d. (or adjusted dose if applicable) until the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. For intakes of RPV and accompanying meals at home, subjects or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) should be asked to note the exact times of medication intakes and accompanying meals (stop times). The investigator or trial personnel should review the recorded data in the subject’s diary. The diaries should be provided to data management and entered into the trial database by [CONTACT_58047]. In Cohort 2, subjects or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) will also be contact[CONTACT_124751] (to study drug and other ARVs) and to reinforce trial instructions every day for [ADDRESS_140239] has missed a dose of RPV within 10 days prior to the intensive pharmacokinetic visit, the visit should be rescheduled so as to allow steady-state of RPV to be reached.The subjects or their parent(s)/caregiver(s) will be requested to bring unused medication and empty packaging to the unit at each visit.

6.4. Assessments6.4.1. Timing of Assessments
The exact timing of the assessments is presented in the flowchart (see Section 2).
During the screening period it is allowed to assess the viral load and CD4
+cell count before 
continuing with the other screening assessments. In such case, after obtaining informed consent, samples will be taken for determination of plasma viral load and CD4
+cell count. If plasma viral 
load results meet the inclusion criteria and the investigator considers initiation of ART appropriate (taking into account current treatment guidelines, including CD4
+cell count and the 
subject’s clinical situation), the subject will return to the site within [ADDRESS_140248] unnecessary blood draws and assessments may be avoided in a lot of subjects since screening viral load being outside the limits for inclusion is the major reason for screen failure (i.e., 33% of all screen failures in Part 1a). Within [ADDRESS_140249]’s eligibility.The baseline visit should be scheduled within 4 weeks after the screening visit (and within 6 weeks after plasma viral load and CD4
+cell count assessment, if these were assessed 
separately before continuing with the other screening assessments), but in case of unforeseeable circumstances the screening period can be prolonged by 2 weeks maximum, resulting in a maximum screening period duration of 8 weeks.RPV will be initiated at baseline (Day 1). Thereafter, subjects will return for visits at Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, then every 4 weeks until Week 16, every 8 weeks until Week 48, and if applicable every 3 months until Week 240.Unscheduled visits should be planned:
%To perform a confirmatory plasma viral load determination during the treatment period in the event of suspected virologic failure (see Section 6.2.5). For Cohort 2, during this 
unscheduled visit, also samples for pharmacokinetics will be taken.
Note: The minimal time between [ADDRESS_140250] 2 weeks.
%To repeat PK samples if needed (see Section 6.4.8).
%To assess, confirm, and follow-up on clinically relevant AEs or laboratory abnormalities.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

should be performed by a local or central labor atory, preferably within 48 hours after receipt 
of the abnormal result by [CONTACT_779].
%To assess and ensure appropriate follow-up on cutaneous reaction/rashes (see Section 6.5.1).
%To assess and ensure appropriate follow-up on clinically suspected hypersensitivity reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
%To perform additional safety monitoring in case certain concomitant medications are started (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
%To assess and ensure appropriate follow-up on abnormal basal or ACTH stimulated cortisol values and to perform an unscheduled ACTH stimulation test in case of clinical signs and symptoms or laboratory abnormalities (other than cortisol) indicative of adrenal insufficiency (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 and 6.5.5).
%To assess, confirm, and follow-up on abnormal QTc values on ECG (see Section 6.2.5).
%To switch subjects to an adjusted dose of RPV (dose switch visit), and to re-evaluate this dose (post switch visit[s]). The dose switch visit has to be performed as soon as possible after communication of the recommended adjusted dose.
Findings during these unscheduled visits need to be reported on designated sections of the eCRF.Blood samples for biochemistry testing are to be taken under fasted conditions. See flowchart in Section 2for the exact timing of these assessments.
6.4.2. Time Windows
All study visits should be scheduled relative to the baseline visit date (eg, Day 1 + 7 days for Week 1). The following time windows are recommended:
%For the Week 1 visit: ∋2 days
%For the Week 2 visit (including Week [ADDRESS_140252] switch): ∋2 days (Cohort 1); between Day 
14 and 18 (Cohort 2)

This exploratory work can include pharmacokinetics, metabolites, proteins, plasma protein binding, biochemistry, virus characterization, characterization of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (if applicable), and characterization of viral drug resistance, and immunologic parameters. Apart from HLA-B*5701 testing in subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results in whom the investigator considers ABC/3TC as the background regimen, no genomic testing will be done. All genetic samples will be destroyed after analysis.
6.4.4. Initial Subject and Disease Characteristics
At the screening visit, after signing the ICF, the overall eligibility of the subject to participate in the trial will be assessed. The subject's demographics, smoking habits, clinically relevant medical and surgical history, or pre-existing conditions (active or non active) that may be expected to 
impact the subject’s clinical outcome during participation in this trial (e.g., diabetes, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, liver disease, neoplasms, opportunistic infections, rash, allergic reactions, etc.) and all concomitant medication will be recorded. A comprehensive physical examination including all body parts (and specifically assessment of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_124648]) will be performed and urine and blood samples will be collected for urinalysis, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, viral pheno-and genotype, and plasma viral load determinations. Vital signs and ECG will be recorded.Since ABC has been associated with severe hypersensitivity reactions, and the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_124626]-B*5701 allele, subjects without prior documented HLA-B*[ADDRESS_140257] negative for HLA-B*5701 at screening (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details).[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

In addition, at screening, contraceptive and adherence counseling is done.
6.4.5. Antiviral Activity
At the time points specified in the flowchart (see Section 2), samples for the determination of 
efficacy will be taken. Plasma viral load levels will be determined using a [COMPANY_002] HIV-[ADDRESS_140258], for the purpose of exploratory analyses.Changes in viral load, including rebound and incomplete virologic suppression, will be part of the efficacy analysis and should not be reported as AE/SAEs.
6.4.6. Immunologic Change
At the time points specified in the flowchart (see Section 2), samples for the determination of the 
CD4
+cells (absolute and %) will be taken. 
Changes in CD4+cells, either increases or decreases, will be part of the efficacy analysis and 
should not be reported as AE/SAEs.
6.4.7. Resistance Determinations

6.4.8. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations6.4.8.1. Sample Collection and Handling
At the time points specified in the flowchart (see Section 2), blood samples will be taken to 
determine the RPV plasma concentrations. Samples for bioanalysis should be protected from light during sample processing and storage.Use of local anesthetics creams is allowed to minimize the pain during the blood draw. Use of indwelling catheters is encouraged for the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling visit in order to minimize discomfort and distress due to repeated venipunctures for blood sampling.Cohort 1: Adolescents Aged ≥12 to <18 Years:
Only in the subjects included in the first part of Cohort 1 (Part 1), intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was to be performed during a 24-hour dosing interval at the Week 2 visit (for Part 1a subjects) and at the Week 4 visit (for Part 1b subjects) to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of RPV (see Section 2.1.2 for details). Plasma samples for RPV of 
the subjects in the first part of Cohort 1 (Part 1) were to be divided over 2 tubes. One sample was to be used for bioanalysis of RPV (main sample) and one sample is the back-up sample. The main sample had to contain at least 500 ∃L of plasma.
In all subjects, sparse pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed for population pharmacokinetic analysis. A pharmacokinetic sample will be taken at all time points indicated in the flowchart (see Section 2).[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

the next [ADDRESS_140266] has symptoms consistent with adrenal insufficiency (see Section 6.5.5) withdrawal of 
the subject should be discussed with the Sponsor.
In case of clinical signs or symptoms or laboratory abnormalities (other than cortisol) indicativeof adrenal insufficiency (see Section 6.5.5), an ACTH stimulation test should be done as soon as 
possible during an unscheduled visit. If the ACTH stimulation test is abnormal (i.e., the cortisol value after ACTH stimulation is <500 nmol/L [18.1 μg/dL]), withdrawal of the subject should be 
discussed with the Sponsor.In case of withdrawal due to pregnancy, no ACTH stimulation test needs to be performed, but basal assessments need to be performed.For more details, please see the central laboratory manual.
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Urinalysis
Urinalysis by [CONTACT_124764], RBC and glucose will be performed at specific time points (see flowchart, Section 2). If abnormal, a microscopic examination for WBC, RBC, and casts 
will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].Note: In the microscopic examination, observations other than the presence of WBC, RBC, and 
casts may also be reported by [CONTACT_25699].
At all time points throughout the trial (except at screening, Week 1, and Week 2), a urine pregnancy test will be performed for all girls of  childbearing potential (see flowchart, Section 2). 
At baseline, a urine pregnancy test will be done prior to the first intake of RPV .
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Hepatitis Serology/Viremia
A sample will be taken for hepatitis A, B, and C testing at baseline. Whenever clinically relevant, the investigator can request additional tests at other visits.The hepatitis A infection status will be confirmed by [CONTACT_91292] A immunoglobulin M antibody. Hepatitis B infection status will be confirmed by [CONTACT_971] B surface antigen. The HCV infection status will be confirmed by [CONTACT_89750]-antibody and if applicable also by [CONTACT_37108] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

[IP_ADDRESS]. Cardiovascular Safety
At the time points specified in the flowchart (see Section 2), vital signs and ECG will be 
recorded. Any clinically relevant changes occurring from the signing of ICF onwards until the last trial-related visit must be recorded on the AE/HIV-Related Events section of the eCRF.Please see Addendum 4: Cardiovascular Safety – Abnormalities for a detailed description of 
abnormalities.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Vital Signs
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) must be measured standing and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(after [ADDRESS_140267]). Standing and supi[INVESTIGATOR_124651].
[IP_ADDRESS].2. ECG
Central ECG readings will be performed by a central ECG lab. Instructions for ECG acquisition and ECG transmission will be described in the manual provided by [CONTACT_124765]. There will be 2 ECG reports: a preliminary report and a final report. The final report will be reviewed by a board certified cardiologist from the central ECG lab.Both ECG reports generated by [CONTACT_124766], signed and dated by [CONTACT_093], and filed in the subject’s medical record.Whenever possible, the ECG should be taken around the expected C
max(i.e., 4 hours after intake 
of RPV).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination
To evaluate the subject’s eligibility, a full physical examination, in which all body parts need to be reviewed, will be performed at screening. In addition, a full physical examination will be performed at time points shown in the flowchart (see Section 2). This assessment includes 
general appearance, eyes, ears, nose and throat, skin and mucous membranes (with particular attention to hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_124648]), lymph nodes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, musculoskeletal system, genitourinary system. It does not include rectal or vaginal examination unless clinically indicated. Any clinically relevant changes occurring from signing the ICF onwards must be recorded on the AE/HIV-related event sections of the eCRF.At several time points (specified in the flowchart, Section 2) only a brief physical examination 
will be performed. These assessments include general appearance, eyes, ears, nose and throat, skin and mucous membranes (with particular attention to hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_124648]), [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

It does not include rectal or vaginal examination unless clinically indicated.At Week 2, only a skin examination will take place.Body weight and height will be recorded at the visits specified in the flowchart (see Section 2). 
Growth will be followed regularly and evaluated consistently using standardized growth charts
30,31,32. The subjects will be weighed in underwear, wearing no shoes. The same weighing 
scale will preferably be used at each visit. For the measurement of the height, the subjects will wear no shoes. The same stadiometer will preferably be used at each visit.The assessment of pubertal development will be performed by a modified Tanner assessment
33
consisting of a discrete visual inspection and comparison to the illustrated Tanner scales (seeAddendum 9: Tanner Scales ). Tanner stages will be recorded at all visits indicated in the 
flowchart (see Section 2). For girls that have not yet had their first menses, the date of the first 
menses will be recorded as part of the evaluation of pubertal development at every visit. At screening, it will be assessed whether girls already have had their first menses.Any clinically relevant changes in phys ical examination occurring from the signing of ICF 
onwards, until the last trial-related visit must be recorded on the AE /HIV-Related Event sectionof the eCRF. 
6.4.10. Adherence Questionnaire
At all visits indicated in the flowchart (see Section 2) a number of Sponsor-selected questions 
from the Pediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) adherence questionnaire will be used to assess compliance. The adherence questionnaire will be self-administered by [CONTACT_124767]. Depending on the age and literacy of the subject, the adherence questionnaire can be completed by [CONTACT_3184]/or by [CONTACT_124768]. If a subject and/or pare nt or caregiver has difficulties in completing the 
questionnaire, either because of the age, literacy or general health status, then the trial staff may assist in completing the questionnaire.Once the subject and/or its parent or caregiver has completed the questionnaire, the site staff should review it for completeness. The questionnaire will be collected and the data will beentered into the trial database by [CONTACT_58047].If based on the review of the questionnaire, there seems to be a compliance issue, this should trigger additional compliance counseling by [CONTACT_6649].Note that the questionnaires will only be administered if a certified translation is available in the local language. Sites should always use the most recently provided version of the questionnaire.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE].4.11. Evaluation for Depression
At all visits indicated in the flowchart (see Section 2) an evaluation will be done using 
questionnaires or other means, as in use at the site as part of local standard of care for this population, to assess whether the subject needs to be referred for a complete mental health assessment. Subjects in whom a tendency for depression or suicidal thoughts is detected will be referred for a complete mental health assessment. Also, if the site staff feels that the child/adolescent has under-reported his/her symptoms, or if depressi on or suicidality are suspected, the subject should 
be referred for a complete mental health assessment. 
6.4.12. Assessment of Palatability of RPV Formulation
Subjects who require RPV 15 mg  (i.e. body w eight <25 kg) or any other adjusted RPV dose
should use a formulation other than the 25 mg tablet formulation (see Section 6.3.1). 
Understanding the taste preferences of children who take RPV as 2.5-mg tablets (which must be dispersed) is important as palatability of the st udy drug plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_124652]. Taste acceptability will be assessed at Day 1 and Week 4 using a modified questionnaire form incorporating a 5 point hedonic facial scale (see Section 7.12, Addendum 12). This scale is a standard tool used in clinical trials to assess drug 
palatability in children
55,56.
6.5. Monitoring and Safety for Specific Toxicities
Guidelines in this section are applicable for the entire trial period, including the screening and follow-up period. For grade [ADDRESS_140268] a confirmatory measurement, preferably within 48 hours after the laboratory results become available to the site. This management scheme is for confirmed laboratory abnormalities and not for isolated events. The following laboratory abnormalities do not warrant mandatory confirmation within 48 hours:
%Asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 glucose elevations in subjects with pre-existing diabetes
%Asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 glucose or triglyceride elevations, or asymptomatic grade 3 cholesterol elevations
%Asymptomatic grade 3 pancreatic amylase elevations in subjects with no history or concomitant disease of pancreatitis
AEs still ongoing at the end of the trial will be followed until satisfactory clinical resolution or stabilization. All grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory abnormalities and laboratory abnormalities resulting in an increase of 2 DAIDS grades from baseline will be followed until return to baseline or within one grade from baseline. Certain long-term AEs of ART cannot be followed to resolution within the setting of this trial; in these cases follow-up will be the responsibility of the investigator, which will be agreed upon with the Sponsor.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020In case a treatment interruption (only allowed after the intensive PK visit) is needed during the treatment period in the event of a suspected tox icity, the subject will not automatically be 
withdrawn from the trial, as long as treatment interruption for the suspected toxicity does not 
exceed 4 weeks or the total cumulative duration of the treatment interruptions for suspected toxicities does not exceed 8 weeks (interruptions are counted cumulatively within a time frame of 48 weeks). In case a permanent discontinuation of study drug is needed, all ARV medication (i.e., RPV and background regimen) should be discontinued, considering the guidelines on-treatment discontinuation (Section 6.2.5) and specific considerations (Section 6.3.3).
Subjects who start ketoconazole treatment during the trial need to have an ACTH stimulation test performed 2 weeks into ketoconazole treatment (Cohort 1 only) and additional ECG monitoring is required (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Additional ECG monitoring is also required for subjects receiving CYP3A4 inhibitory comedications for >2 days, as well as for subjects receiving drugs associated with a risk of Torsade de Pointes for > 2 days (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). If the use of certain comedication 
warrants additional ECG monitoring, a pharmacokinetic sample should be taken within [ADDRESS_140269] intake of RPV should be recorded on the eCRF.For subjects reporting cutaneous event/rash, allergic reaction, AST/ALT and total bilirubin elevations, pancreatic amylase/lipase elevations, clinical hepatitis, neuropsychological symptoms, gastrointestinal nausea, diarrhea, signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or other toxicities the following actions should be taken:
6.5.1. Cutaneous Event/Rash
Subjects who have a history of a grade 2 or 3 cutaneous reaction/rash may be at increased risk for RPV related skin reaction and should therefore be monitored closely during the first [ADDRESS_140270] intake of study drugneeds to be reported in the ‘Rash’ section of the eCRF within [ADDRESS_140271] intake of study drug are to be reported as medical events (see 1.4).
Any skin change should be evaluated with specific attention for systemic symptoms, mucosal involvement, laboratory abnormalities, including eosinophilia and increases in ALT/AST, and vital sign changes such as decreases in blood pressure or fever. In case of rash, safety blood samples need to be taken, which are to be processed by [CONTACT_27396]. These samples need to be taken during the unscheduled visits as described below. The following parameters need to be tested: AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

In case of clinical signs or symptoms or laboratory abnormalities (other than cortisol) indicative for adrenal insufficiency, the ACTH stimulation test should be done as soon as possible during an unscheduled visit.At the time point specific in the flowchart (see Section 2) an ACTH stimulation test will be 
performed for all subjects including measurements of cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone, DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, aldosterone, FSH, and LH (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). Cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and aldosterone will be measured before, 
30, and 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation; all other endocrine parameters will only be measured before ACTH stimulation. If the ACTH stimulation test is abnormal (i.e., all cortisol values [prior to and after ACTH stimulation] are <500 nmol/L [18.1 ∃g/dL]), a retest needs to be 
performed at the next scheduled visit or at least within the next 8 weeks.A sample for the determination of basal cortisol will be drawn in the morning of the time points specified in the flowchart (see Section 2), between 7h30 and 9h30. If at any of these time points

Appropriate clinical follow-up, including further endocrine evaluations, should be installed
24.
The Sponsor will seek external endocrinological advice should this be deemed appropriate or at request of the investigator. To this extent an external pediatric endocrinology expert will be available for the full duration of the trial. In case of clinical signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and an abnormal ACTH stimulation test it may be decided by [CONTACT_124771]. Other measures could be to start substitution therapy as appropriate. This may be the administration of glucocorticoids at the time of stressful events such as surgery or short or longer-term glucocorticoid substitution. In case of acute adrenal insufficiency subjects may be hypovolemic, hyponatremic, or hyperkalemic. In such case initial therapy may consist of intravenously administered saline and dextrose. In a hypotensive patient, a 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic sodium chloride solution given over the first hour may be necessary to restore their 
blood pressure. This bolus may be repeated if the blood pressure remains low. After results for the subject’s electrolytes, blood sugar, and cortisol are obtained, a single dose of dexamethasone may be administered without interfering with th e cortisol response to cosyntropin or analogues, 
and an ACTH stimulation test should be performed. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed based on the results, substitution with glucocorticoids may need to be installed. The need for glucocorticoid replacement needs to be balanced between the need to prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and the need to allow the child to grow at a normal rate since excess replacement with glucocorticoid diminishes growth velocity. In case of reduced aldosterone secretion, mineralocorticoid replacement might also be required.If the unscheduled ACTH test is performed further to the presence of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (as listed above), and th e subject does not achieve a cortisol value 
!500 nmol/L (18.1 ∃g/dL) on at least one of the [ADDRESS_140298] (i.e., morning cortisol, 30 or 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation), this should be discussed with the Sponsor, taking into account other possible confounding factors (e.g., concomitant medication, AEs,…), and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial if considered appropriate. Appropriate clinical follow-up, including further endocrine evaluations, should be installed
24.
As ketoconazole is known to have an intrinsic effect of inhibition of certain adrenal enzymes, resulting in decreased synthesis of certain adrenal hormones such as cortisol, subjects who start ketoconazole treatment during the trial need to have an ACTH stimulation test performed 2 weeks into ketoconazole treatment. If all cortisol values (prior to and after ACTH stimulation) are <500 nmol/L (18.1 ∃g/dL), and this subject has clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency, which are evaluated in conjunction with other possible confounding factors (e.g., [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

[IP_ADDRESS]. Cohort 2: Children Aged ≥6 to <12 Years
In case of clinical signs or symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities (other than cortisol) indicative for adrenal insufficiency, an ACTH stimulation test should be done as soon as possible during an unscheduled visit. For additional details about the ACTH stimulation test and other endocrine assessments, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.2.
If the unscheduled ACTH test is performed further to the presence of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (as listed above), and th e subject does not achieve a cortisol value 
!500 nmol/L (18.1 ∃g/dL) on at least [ADDRESS_140299] (i.e., morning cortisol or 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation), this should be discussed with the Sponsor, taking into account other possible confounding factors (e.g., concomitant medication, AEs,…), and the subject may discontinue RPV treatment and be withdrawn from the trial if considered appropriate.Similar clinical follow-up as in Cohort 1, including seeking advice from an external endocrinologist if deemed appropriate will be applicable for Cohort 2. 
6.5.6. Clinical Hepatitis
Non-Viral HepatitisSubjects should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of hepatitis, which include but are not limited to fatigue, malaise,  anorexia, nausea, dark urine and clay-colored 
stools, bilirubinuria, jaundice, liver tenderness, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels.Subjects with these signs and symptoms should seek medical attention immediately and hepatic parameters should be tested. All ARV medication must be permanently discontinued if the hepatitis is considered at least possibly related  to RPV in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] (see 
Section 6.2.5).
Viral HepatitisIf acute viral hepatitis is diagnosed during the trial, the subject should be permanently withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.2.5).
6.5.7. Neuropsychological Symptoms
Subjects should be informed that RPV may cause dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and/or abnormal dreaming and instructed that if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020There have been reports of delusions and inappropriate behavior in subjects receiving licensed NNRTIs, especially in subjects with a history of  mental illness or substance abuse. Severe acute 
depression (including suicidal ideation/attempts) has also been infrequently reported. At all visits indicated in the flowchart (see Section 2) an evaluation will be done using questionnaires or 
other means, as in use at the site as part of local standard of care for this population, to assess whether the subject needs to be referred for a complete mental health assessment. In case a tendency for depression or suicidal thoughts is detected, a mental health assessment will need to be performed. Subjects who experience symptoms of depression should contact [CONTACT_124772] (RPV and background regimen) may be required. Investigators should refer subjects reporting such symptoms for immediate psychiatric evaluation/medical intervention. In case of grade 3 (alteration causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities) and grade 4 alterations in personality behavior or in mood (behavior potentially harmful to self or others (e.g., suicidal and homicidal ideation or attempt, acute psychosis) or causing inability to perform basic self-care functions): the ARV medication must be permanently discontinued if the neuropsychological symptoms are considered at least possibly related to RPV in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] (see Section 6.2.5).
6.5.8. Gastrointestinal Nausea (With or Without Vomiting)
Although common, nausea following initiation of ARV medication usually subsides or resolves during the first few weeks of treatment.Subjects planning to use ABC in their background regimen, who develop gastrointestinal nausea should be evaluated for the possibility of ABC hy persensitivity reaction and follow instructions 
related to clinically suspected hypersensitivity to ABC (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Grade 1 nausea (transient or intermittent; no or minimal interference with oral intake <24 hours) and Grade 2 nausea (persistent nausea resulting in decreased oral intake for 24-48 
hours):Subjects may continue with ARV medication and may be treated as needed with anti-emetics given orally or by [CONTACT_124773].Grade 3 nausea (persistent nausea resulting in decreased intake for >48 hours or aggressive rehydration indicated): Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] [ADDRESS_140300] will be treated as needed with anti-emetics given orally or by [CONTACT_124773].

6.5.9. Diarrhea
Subjects planning to use ABC in their background regimen, who develop diarrhea should be evaluated for the possibility of ABC hypersensitiv ity reaction and follow instructions related to 
clinically suspected hypersensitivity to ABC (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Grade 1 diarrhea (transient or intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_124657] &3 stools over 
baseline per 24 hours) and Grade 2 diarrhea (persistent epi[INVESTIGATOR_124658] &4-6 stools over baseline per 24 hours):
Subjects may continue ARV medication. Loperamide or diphenoxylate can be administered.Grade 3 diarrhea (bloody diarrhea or !7 stools per 24 hours or intravenous fluid replacement 
required):Subjects with grade [ADDRESS_140301] all ARV treatment (RPV and background regimen) interrupted. All ARV medication (RPV and background regimen) may be resumed when the diarrhea resolves to grade &2.
If grade 3 diarrhea recurs after resuming the ARV medication despi[INVESTIGATOR_124659], subjects should permanently discontinue all ARV medication and will be withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.2.5).Grade 4 diarrhea (life-threatening consequences):
Subjects with grade 4 diarrhea will permanently discontinue all ARV medication and will be withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.2.5).
6.5.10. Other Toxicities
Grade 1Subjects who develop a grade 1 AE or laboratory  toxicity may continue intake of the ARV 
medication.Grade 2Subjects who develop a grade 2 AE or laboratory  toxicity may continue intake of the ARV 
medication based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

%Subjects who experience asymptomatic glucose, triglyceride or cholesterol elevations of grade 3.
%Subjects who experience asymptomatic pancreatic amylase elevations of grade 3 with no history or concomitant disease of pancreatitis.
%Subjects who experience an AE that is considered not related or doubtfully related to RPV.
Grade 4Subjects experiencing a grade 4 AE or laboratory toxicity will permanently discontinue all ARV medication and will be withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.2.5).
Exceptions are, unless clinical assessment foresees an immediate health risk to the subject:
%Glucose elevation of grade 4 in subjects with pre-existing diabetes (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
%Asymptomatic glucose or triglyceride elevations of grade 4 (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]

If elevated glucose levels are from a non-fasting blood draw, the draw should be repeated after a 10-hour fast. Management decisions should be based on fasted results. Subjects who experienced asymptomatic glucose elevations of grade [ADDRESS_140304]. Subjects, without pre-existing diabetes, with persistent grade 3 or 4 glucose elevations despi[INVESTIGATOR_124660]/management should permanently discontinue ARV medication (see Section 6.2.5). Appropriate clinical management of hyperglycemia must be 
started in a timely fashion.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypertriglyceridemia and Hypercholesterolemia
Hypertriglyceridemia grade 3: 8.49-13.56 mmol/L (751-1,200 mg/dL);
grade 4: >13.56 mmol/L (>1,200 mg/dL).
Hypercholesterolemia grade 3: >7.77 mmol/L (>300 mg/L); ( grade 4 : NA).
Management decisions should be based on fasted results. If elevated triglyceride or cholesterol levels are from a non-fasting blood draw, the draw should be repeated after a 10-hour fast. Subjects who experienced asymptomatic triglyceride elevations of grade 3 or 4 or cholesterol elevations of grade 3 may continue to receive ARV medication.Hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia should be treated according to the specific guidelines for treating HIV-infected subjects. Appropriate clinical management of cholesterol in the setting of HIV infection should be started in a timely fashion. Investigators may choose to initiate treatment with fenofibrate, gemfibro zil or clofibrate or niacin or a 3- hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, in addition to the usual counseling on diet and exercise. These medications should be introduced with caution. These medications may have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_124661] a history of hyperglycemia.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypersensitivity Reactions
In clinical studies, approximately 5% of subjects receiving an ABC-containing product developed a hypersensitivity reaction, which in rare cases has been proven fatal
18.
At screening, all subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results in whom the investigator considers ABC/3TC as the background regimen will be tested for HLA-B*5701. In those subjects where HLA-B*5701 is positive ABC/3TC cannot be administered
19. In this case, 
the investigator should select AZT/3TC as the background regimen.Also in case of switch to ABC due to intolerance of an N(t)RTI, the subject should test negative for HLA-B*5701. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

syndrome; however reactions have occurred without rash or fever.Symptoms can occur at any time during treatment w ith ABC, but usually appear within the first 
six weeks of initiation of treatment (median time to onset: 11 days). The symptoms worsen with 
continued therapy and can be life-threatening. Th ese symptoms usually resolve shortly after 
discontinuation of ABC.Frequently observed signs and symptoms include fever, rash, malaise or fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_124662], sore throat, or cough. Other signs and symptoms include myalgia, arthralgia, oedema, pharyngitis, headache, paresthesia or myolysis. Physical findings may include rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial), lymphadenopathy or mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis, mouth ulceration). Abnormal chest x-ray findings may also be present (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localized).Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated liver function tests (such as hepatic transaminases), increased creatine phosphokinase or creatinine levels, and lymphopenia. Anaphylaxis, hypotension, liver failure, renal failure, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_124663].Some subjects with hypersensitivity were initially thought to have respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), a flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medications. This delay in diagnosis of hypersensitivity has resulted in ABC being continued or re-introduced, leading to a more severe hy persensitivity reaction or death. Therefore, the 
diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction should be car efully considered for subjects presenting with 
symptoms of these diseases. If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, no medicinal product containing ABC (Ziagen
®, Trizivir®, or Epzicom®/Kivexa®) should be restarted.
Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions
Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_124664]. If a hypersensitivity reaction is diagnosed, the subject MUST discontinue ABC treatment IMMEDIATELY. The N(t)RTI background regimen will be replaced by [CONTACT_124774] N(t)RTIs

At all times the background regimen should consist of 2 N(t)RTIs and the subject’s HIV-1 genotype at screening should show sensitivity to the alternative N(t)RTIs. The subject should be asked to return all unused supplies of the ABC-containing product for disposal to prevent an accidental rechallenge.An ABC-containing medicinal product (Ziagen
®, Trizivir®, or Epzicom®/Kivexa®) MUST 
NEVER be administered following a hypersensitivity reaction, as more severe symptoms will recur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimize the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, the ABC-containing product should be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748], flu-like illness, gastroenteritis, or reactions to other medications). Symptomatic support for ABC hypersensitivity may be indicated. This should include, for example, administration of intravenous fluids to subjects who develop hypotension. Antihistamines or corticosteroids have been used in cases of ABC hypersensitivity; however there are no clinical data demonstrating the benefit of these in the management of the reaction. Laboratory and other investigations which may be useful in the evaluation and treatment of ABC hypersensitivity include, but may not be limited to, measurement of ALT, AST, creatine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, and WBC differential count and chest x-ray, if respi[INVESTIGATOR_124665].Special Considerations Following an Interruption of ABC Therapy
If therapy with ABC has been discontinued a nd restarting therapy is under consideration, the 
reason for discontinuation should be evaluated to ensure that the subject did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, no medicinal product containing ABC (Ziagen
®, Trizivir®, or Epzicom®/Kivexa®) should be restarted.
There have been infrequent reports of a hypers ensitivity reaction following reintroduction of an 
ABC-containing product where the interruption was preceded by a single key symptom of hypersensitivity (rash, fever, malaise/fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, or a respi[INVESTIGATOR_20321]). If a decision is made to restart any ABC-containing product in these subjects, this should be done only under direct medical supervision. On very rare occasions hypersensitivity reacti ons have been reported in subjects who have 
restarted therapy, and who had no preceding symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If a decision is made to restart an ABC-containing product, this must be done only if the subject or 
others can access medical care readily.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Essential Subject Information
Subjects will be provided a warning card listing the common signs of a hypersensitivity reaction and will be instructed to carry this card with them at all times.Investigators must ensure that subjects are fully informed regarding the following information on the hypersensitivity reaction:% Subjects must be made aware of the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction to ABC that may result in a life-threatening reaction or death;
% At screening, all subjects without prior documented HLA-B*5701 negative results in whom the investigator considers ABC/3TC as the background regimen will be tested for HLA-B*5701. In those subjects where HLA-B*5701 is positive ABC/3TC cannot be administered

% In order to avoid restarting the ABC-containing product, subjects who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction should be asked to return the remaining tablets to the site.
% Subjects who have stopped taking an ABC-containing product for any reason, and particularly due to possible adverse reactions or illness, must be advised to contact [CONTACT_124776].
Reporting of Hypersensitivity Reaction
All cases of potential ABC hypersensitivity should be reported as SAE (see 1.4).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lactic Acidosis
The relevance of asymptomatic lactic acid elevations is unclear, and serum lactate evaluation is not part of the routine safety evaluations for this trial. Routine lactate monitoring is not currently recommended. However, lactate monitoring should be performed at the local laboratory if there is a clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_124667] (see description below).A, sometimes fatal, syndrome of lactic acidosis, oft en associated with evidence of hepatic 
steatosis, is a recognized but rare complication of N(t)RTI therapy. This syndrome is felt to be secondary to mitochondrial toxicity induced by [CONTACT_124777] N(t)RTIs on DNA polymerase gamma, a key enzyme needed for mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Current knowledge regarding this syndrome is incomplete. Obesity and prolonged N(t)RTI exposure may be risk factors. Symptoms of lactic acidosis frequently involve non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and fever, but in the majority of cas es also involve symptoms suggestive of hepatic 
dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59378], abdominal distension, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Alternatively, it is possible that unwarranted concern may be raised by [CONTACT_124778]. N(t)RTI toxicity is only one cause of lactic acidosis. Type "B" lactic acid elevations or those without clinically apparent tissue hypoxia are also seen in the context of diabetes mellitus, uremia, liver disease, infections, malignancies, alkaloses, and drug and toxin ingestion of such substances as ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and salicylates.The following case definition of lactic acidosis will be used in this trial:Symptomatic Hyperlactatemia
New, otherwise unexplained, and persistent ( !2 weeks) occurrence of one or more of the 
following symptoms:% Nausea and vomiting
% Abdominal pain or gastric discomfort
% Abdominal distention
% Increased hepatic transaminases
% Unexplained fatigue
% Dyspnea
% Lactate level >2x ULN confirmed by [CONTACT_124779]: All lactate >2x ULN should be repeated as soon as possible (local laboratory), 
generally within 1 week. If the sec ond result confirms hyperlactatemia (>2x ULN), 
subjects should immediately interrupt their current ARV regimen (RPV and background regimen). Standard management should be initiated with follow-up to resolution. If causality is related to the background regimen only and NOT to the NNRTI regimen (RPV), N(t)RTIs must be changed. If causality is related to RPV, subjects must be withdrawn.
Processing of the lactate sample needs to be done according to strict guidelines both in the preparation of the subject (ideally, fasting and with no recent exercise) and in the blood drawing/processing procedure (ideally, blood drawn without a tourniquet, no hand clenching, blood drawn into a chilled tube and processed immediately) to minimize false elevations of lactates.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Renal Complications
Renal safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_124780], eGFR, serum chemistry and urinalysis results at every trial visit.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases , is a major clinical toxicity associated with 
didanosine (ddI) (with or without concomitant administration of TDF) and/or stavudine (d4T) therapy and has been reported with other ARVs. Pancreatitis must be considered whenever a subject receiving ddI (with or without concomitant administration of TDF) and/or d4T develops abdominal pain and nausea, vomiting, or elevated pancreatic amylase or lipase, and ddI (and/or TDF) and/or d4T use should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded.In case the pancreatitis is considered at least possibly related to RPV, ARV medication must be permanently discontinued (see Section 6.2.5). The subject experiencing pancreatitis can however 
be rechallenged with the N(t)RTI background regimen, if pancreatitis is considered not related to TDF/FTC treatment.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Subjects should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy, which is usually characterized by [CONTACT_124782], tingling and/or pain in the feet or hands. Peripheral neuropathy is a common AE of ddI and d4T.Treatment of the peripheral neuropathy is at the discretion of the investigator, but generally begins with nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and acetaminophen (paracetamol), and the use of tricyclic antidepressants and other agents when more severe pain is present. Some of these medications should be introduced with caution.

Cohort 2: Children Aged ≥6 to <[ADDRESS_140315] 4 weeks (or discontinued earlier). This will be followed by [CONTACT_124785] [ADDRESS_140316] 4 weeks (or discontinued earlier). The objective of these analyses is to determine whether it is appropriate to continue with the 25 mg q.d. dose for the treatment of children, based primarily on the pharmacokinetics of these subjects (samples taken after 14 to 18 days of RPV dosing) and the antiviral activity/efficacy and safety data. All available antiviral activity/e fficacy and safety data will be included in these analyses, 
even if they have been obtained after the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. If the results of these analyses indicate the need for an RPV dose adjustment for all or a part of the subjects in Part 1, an analysis (including the intensive pha rmacokinetic evaluation after  14 to 18 days on the 
original and/or adjusted dose) will be performed after these subjects have been treated at least 4 weeks (or discontinued earlier) with the adjusted RPV dose.

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020weight of <[ADDRESS_140321] 10 subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 were all towards the 
higher end, and data for subjects <25 kg were very limited (see addendum 7.11), it was decided 
to continue intensive PK evaluation for newly enrolled subjects with a body weight of <[ADDRESS_140322] 12 subjects in the body weight cate gory <25 kg with intensive PK data across the 2 studies 
(Cohort 2 of this C213 study and study TMC278HTX2002) is considered sufficient to allow for conclusions on the steady-state exposure of RPV.If in the mini-cohort, subjects discontinue the tr ial before receiving their first dose of study drug, 
additional subjects can be recruited to have 5 subjects starting treatment in the mini-cohort. If subjects discontinue the trial after starting treatment for reasons other than drug tolerability/safety, additional subjects can be recruited to have at least an additional [ADDRESS_140323] additional subjects with intensive pharmacokinetic data because interpretation of the data is hampered by e.g., study drug adherence issues prior to the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling time point.The precision of the efficacy parameter (proportion of subjects with viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, TLOVR) expressed as half the widt h of the (2-sided) 95% CI is presented in Table 7,

All demographic (age, height, w eight, gender, body mass index [BMI], et hnic origin) and other 
initial subject characteristics (smoking habits, physical examination, medical and surgical history, concomitant diseases) will be tabulated and analyzed descriptively.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy6.[IP_ADDRESS]. Plasma viral load
Throughout the analysis, plasma viral load will be log
10transformed. Plasma viral load reported 
as <50 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL will be scored as 49 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, if not otherwise mentioned.Parameters:
%The change in plasma viral load from baseline at Week 2 /Week 4 (IDMC analyses only).
%Proportion of subjects with a viral load <50 and <400 HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at all time points, and time to achieve these;
%Proportion of subjects with a decrease from baseline in plasma viral load of 1.0 log

Week 12
%Change from baseline in log 10viral load;
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1. Analysis
An outcome analysis using "Snapshot" approach will be performed, i.e., viral load <50 and <400 
HIV-1 RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL observed and missing = failure (M=F). The Snapshot analysis is based on the last observed viral load data within the visit window (i.e. Weeks 24 and 48). Subjects who switched N(t)RTIs for tolerability reasons not allowed per protocol (see Section 6.3.5) will be 
considered as failures for this Snapshot approach. Proportion responders will be expressed as percentages with Clopper-Pearson 95% CI at each time point.Raw data and changes in log
10plasma viral load will be descriptively and graphically presented. 
Changes in plasma viral load will be part of th e efficacy analysis and will not be reported as 
AEs/SAEs.

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 151
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020The analysis will be based on observed values and on imputed values using NC = F, i.e., subjects who prematurely discontinued the trial and will have their CD4
+cell count following 
discontinuation imputed with the baseline value (resulting in a change of 0), and will have LOCFfor intermediate missing values.Raw data and changes versus baseline will be descriptively and graphically presented.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Resistance Determinations
The results of the viral pheno- and genotypes will be evaluated by [CONTACT_124786].Relevant changes in the viral phenotype and genotype and archived resistance, as applicable, will be tabulated and described, particularly for subjects with virologic failure. Changes in viral phenotype and genotype will not be regarded as AEs.Furthermore, phenotypic resistance data, including the fold change in EC
50values, of RPV and 
other ARVs will be described.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analyses
Applicable for Intensive PK data:Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses of the results will be done using WinNonlin Professional™ (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, [LOCATION_004], U.S.A.), Microsoft Excel® (Microsoft Redmond, Washington, U.S.A.) and/or SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, U.S.A.). A non-compartmental model with extravascular input will be used for the pharmacokinetic analysis.Based on the individual plasma concentration- time data, using the actual sampling times (see the 
flowchart for scheduled sampling times, Section 2), the following pharmacokinetic parameters 
are to be derived for RPV:
At the Week 2 or Week 4 visit for Cohort 1, and at the Week 2 visit (Day 14-18) for 
Cohort 2: C
0h, Cmin, tmax, Cmax, AUC 24h, Css,av, CL/F, fluctuation index 
For the pharmacokinetic parameters, definitions and methods of calculation are:
%C0h: predose plasma concentration;
%Cmin: minimum plasma concentration between 0 hour and τ (τ = dosing interval);
%Cmax: maximum plasma concentration;
%tmax: time to reach the maximum plasma concentration;
%AUC 24h: AUC from time of administration up to [ADDRESS_140325] dosing, calculated by 
[CONTACT_124787];[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 152
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020%Css,av: average steady-state plasma concentration, calculated by [CONTACT_12265] τ / τ at steady-
state (τ = dosing interval);
%CL/F: total apparent plasma clearance at steady-state, calculated by [CONTACT_2715]/AUC 24h.
%Fluctuation index, i.e., percentage fluctuation (variation between maximum and minimum plasma concentration at steady-state), calculated as 100x ([C
max-C min] / 
Css,av).
The mean AUC 24hin adolescents and children will be compared separately with the mean 
AUC 24hof the 25 mg q.d. dose in adults.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the plasma concentrations of RPV at each time point and for the derived pharmacokinetic parameters. Statistics will include sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum.For each subject, plasma concentration-time data will be graphically presented. Similarly, graphs 
of the mean plasma concentration-time profiles and overlay graphs with combined individual plasma concentration-time profiles will be produced. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be subjected to an exploratory graphical analysis in cluding various transformations in order to get a 
general overview.Applicable for population PK analysis:Based on the individual plasma concentration-time data, using the actual medication intake and sampling times, pharmacokinetic parameters of RPV will be derived for all subjects, using population pharmacokinetic modeling. The intensive pharmacokinetic sampling data will also be included in the population pharmacokinetic model for further evaluation of the RPV dose with modeling and simulation.  
 
The mean AUC
24hin adolescents and children will be compared separately with the mean 
AUC 24hof the 25 mg q.d. dose in adults.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the derived pharmacokinetic parameters. Summary statistics include sample size (n), mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum.Efficacy and safety parameters will be subjected to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.

Type (system organ class, preferred term) and incidence of all AEs and HIV-related events, between the signing of ICF and last trial-related ac tivity, will be tabulated per trial period (i.e., 
screening, the treatment period and follow-up). Separate tabulations will be made by [CONTACT_926], drug relationship, and outcome of the AEs. Separate tabulations and listings will be made for those subjects who have discontinued the trial for an AE/HIV-related event, or who experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE, or an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Clinical Laboratory Tests
For the clinical laboratory data, descriptive statistics will be generated for all tests performed (actual values and changes from baseline). Statistics to be presented include number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.Additionally, for the tests available, laboratory abnormalities will be calculated according to the DAIDS grading table (see Addendum 2: DAIDS Table ). Worst toxicity grade after baseline will 
be cross-tabulated versus baseline. Separate tabulations and listings will be provided for those subjects who develop a grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicity. For tests for which no DAIDS grading exists, a cross-tabulation versus baseline (with classes below/within/above normal range) will be performed.Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, other diagnostic tests (except for changes in resistance pattern, plasma viral load, and CD4
+cell counts), and intercurrent illnesses are AEs.
Descriptive statistics of the actual values and changes from baseline of the endocrine assessments at 30 minutes (Cohort 1 only) and 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation as well as for the maximal increment after ACTH stimulation will be presented for the respective analytes (cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, aldosterone [Cohort 1 only]). In addition, the proportion of subjects with values at all 3 (Cohort 1) and all available (Cohort 2) assessments during ACTH stimulation (before, 30 minutes [Cohort 1 only] and 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation) of cortisol being <500 nmol/L (18.1 μg/dL), will be tabulated.
Results of the ACTH stimulation test during the concomitant use of ketoconazole (Cohort 1 only) will be described separately.Descriptive statistics of the actual values and changes from baseline of the other endocrine assessments will be generated.

The effects on cardiovascular and vital signs parameters will be evaluated by [CONTACT_64161] (actual values and changes from baseline) and frequency tabulations. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 154
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Statistics to be presented include number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.Vital signs include pulse, SBP and DBP. For the BP parameters, the toxicity definition of the DAIDS grading (see Addendum 2: DAIDS Table ) will be applied. The percentage of subjects 
with abnormal values (see Section 7.4for age specific details) will be tabulated at each specific 
time point. The ECG parameters that will be analyzed are heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval, QTcB (QT corrected for heart rate according to Bazett
34) and QTcF (QT corrected 
for heart rate according to Fridericia35). For the ECG parameters, the toxicity definition of the 
DAIDS grading (see Addendum 2: DAIDS Table ) will be applied. The percentage of subjects 
with increases in QTc of <30, 30-60, or >60 milliseconds from screening and abnormal QTc, PR, QRS interval, RR interval values (see Section 7.4for age specific details) will be tabulated at 
each time point.All important abnormalities from the ECG readings will be reported.
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Physical Examination
Physical examination findings will be tabulated at each time point.Body weight and height will be analyzed descriptively (actual values and changes from baseline). Statistics to be presented include number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. These tables will include shifts from baseline values to allow detection of relevant changes in individuals.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diaries
A subject listing will be created with the date and time of intake of RPV from the start of treatment with RPV 25 mg q.d. (or adjusted dose if applicable) until the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Questionnaires
Subject listings will be created so that adherence can be checked on an individual basis. The answers to the different questions will be tabulated at each time point

DIVISION OF AIDS TABLE FOR GRADING THE SEVERITY OF ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS. PUBLISH DATE: DECEMBER, 2004Quick ReferenceThe Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity  of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS 
grading table”) is a descriptive terminology to be utilized for AE reporting in this trial. A grading 
(severity) scale is provided for each AE term.General InstructionsEstimating Severity Grade
If the need arises to grade a clinical AE that is not identified in the DAIDS grading table, use the category “Estimating Severity Grade” located at the top of the table on the following page. Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs
The DAIDS grading table includes parameters for gradi ng both adult and pediatric AEs. When a single 
set of parameters is not appropriate for grading specific types of AEs for both adult and pediatric populations, separate sets of parameters for adult and/or pediatric populations (with specified respective age ranges) are provided. If there is no distinction in the table between adult and pediatric values for a type of AE, then the single set of parameters listed is to be used for grading the severity of both adult and pediatric events of that type.Determining Severity Grade
If the severity of an AE could fall under either one of 2 grades (e.g., the severity of an AE could be either grade 2 or grade 3), select the higher of the 2 grades for the AE.Note : The laboratory normal ranges should be taken into consideration to assign gradings to a laboratory 
value.DefinitionsBasic self-care functions Adult: activities such as bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer/movement, 
continence, and feeding.Young children: activities that are age and culturally appropriate 
(e.g., feeding self with culturally appropriate eating implement).
Usual social & functional activitiesAdult: adaptive tasks and desirable activities, such as going to work, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cooking, use of transportation, pursuing a hobby, etc.Young Children: activities that are age and culturally appropriate (e.g., 
social interactions, play activities, learning tasks, etc.).
Medical intervention Use of pharmacologic or biologic agent(s) for treatment of an AE.Operative intervention Surgical OR other invasive mechanical procedures.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE].10. Addendum 10: Childhood Immunizations
Routine Childhood Immunizations:
Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, meningococcus C, mumps, and rubella.Exceptions for Children With HIV Infection:
1. BCG. HIV positive individuals should not receive BCG vaccine; there have been reports of 
dissemination of BCG in HIV positive individuals.
2. Measles. Measles vaccine has been reported to cause fatal disease in one severely 
immunosuppressed HIV positive adult. Some experts do not recommend giving measles vaccine to HIV positive children with severe immunosupression (i.e., CD4
+<15%).
No harmful effects have been reported following live attenuated vaccines for mumps or rubella in HIV positive children.
3. Polio. The use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is safe in HIV-infected children, is 
recommended. The live, oral polio vaccine is not recommended.
No harmful effects have been reported following oral, live attenuated polio vaccine in HIV positive children, although some experts recommend IPV be used for all HIV positive children.
4. Yellow fever. There is insufficient evidence as to the safety of Yellow fever vaccine in HIV 
positive people.
Additional Vaccines Can Be Safely Given When Needed:
Inactivated typhoid, inactivated cholera, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, rabies, hepatitis A, and meningococcal A+C vaccines.Experts Recommendations:

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-[ZIP_CODE].11. Addendum 11: Pharmacokinetic Modeling for Cohort 2 Dose Selection
As of Amendment 10
The modeling and simulation to define a bodyweight-adjusted RPV dose for children is an ongoing process, based on accumulating data over time. Recently the existing RPV population PK model for adults and adolescents was updated incorporating also the available RPV plasma concentration data from the ongoing subjects in Cohort 2 ( ≥6 to <12 years of age). The existing 
model was adjusted to better describe the RPV pediatric data by [CONTACT_124805] (standard factor 0.75) on clearance and intercompartmental flow. Age was not found to be a significant covariate for the RPV model parameters. With this revised model, RPV exposures across the whole bodyweight range were simulated and 
the following initial RPV dosing scheme was determined for newly enrolled subjects in Study C213 Cohort 2 and other ongoing RPV pediatric studies (TMC278HTX2002), regardless of age:∀ 25 mg qd for children with a body weight of ≥25 kg; 
∀15 mg qd for children with a body weight of ≥11 and <25 kg. 
The simulations indicated that for subjects with a bodyweight ≥25 kg, a RPV dose of 25 mg qd 
can be used safely.  
 
 
 
 
 the geometric mean AUC ratio for these pediatric subjects compared to 
adults, based on preliminary non-compartmental analysis of the 24 hour intensive PK visit, was 1.49 (<150% of adult value).Children with bodyweight ≥11 and <[ADDRESS_140337] that it is generally 
preferred, if safety allows, to dose antiretrovirals (ARVs) at the high rather than at the low end, from an efficacy perspective.

1. ADVERSE EVENTS1.1. Definitions
A
DVERSE EVENT 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (International Conference on Harmonization - ICH E6; 1.2).This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.Note: The Sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing of the ICF.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
%Results in death
%Is life-threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
%Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
%Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
%Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (ICH E6; 1.50)
%Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product;
%Is Medically Important.
Note 
%Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124681] 1 of the outcomes listed in the definition above.

N
OT RELATED
An AE which is not related to the use of the drug.D
OUBTFUL
An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely.P
OSSIBLE
An AE which might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore the causal relationship cannot be excluded.P
ROBABLE
An AE which might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive, e.g., confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]. An alternative explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s).[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020VERY LIKELY
An AE, which is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed by [CONTACT_35719]).
1.3. HIV-Related Events or Outcomes
The events or outcomes listed in the classification list (see Part I, Addendum 5: HIV-Related 
Events or Outcomes in Adolescents and Adults and Addendum 6: HIV-Related Events or 
Outcomes in Children ) will be recorded as HIV-related events on the eCRF. These events or 
outcomes, as well as any sign, symptom, diagnosis, illness, and/or clinical laboratory abnormalities that can be linked to any of these events or outcomes, are not to be reported as an AE.
1.4. Reporting of AEs and HIV-Related Events
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor, and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. The Sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_124807].AEs and HIV-related events will be collected from the signing of the ICF until completion of the subject's last trial-related procedure (which may include contact [CONTACT_20687]-up of safety). Occurrence of AEs and HIV-related events will be  reported in the AE and HIV-Related Events 
sections of the eCRF, respectively.All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, 
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]"). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_124684]. All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions.All AEs still ongoing at the end of the treatment will be followed until satisfactory resolution (i.e., value back to baseline value) or stabilization (to be agreed upon in collaboration with the Sponsor). New AEs reported during the follow-up period of the trial will be followed as agreed between the Sponsor and investigator.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 207
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Certain long-term AEs of ARTcannot be followed until resolution within the setting of this protocol; in these cases follow-up will be the responsibility of the treating investigator. However, this has to be agreed upon with the Sponsor.SAEs occurring within the clinical trial (between  signing of the ICF and last follow-up visit) and 
those spontaneously reported to the investigator within [ADDRESS_140339] be completed and signed by a physician from the trial site, and transmitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of an SAE should be made by [CONTACT_6972] (fax).All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_124808], or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the trial, must be followed until any of the following occurs:
%The event resolves
%The event stabilizes
%The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
%The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
trial conduct
%It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as an SAE.Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a trial must be reported as an SAE, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported 
to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_20767]-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEsand must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the trial must be promptly withdrawn from the trial and discontinue further trial treatment.The names (and corresponding telephone numbers) of the individuals who should be contact[CONTACT_124809](s), which will be provided as a separate document.The Sponsor or its representatives will assume responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to Regulatory Authorities. The Sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The investigator (or Sponsor where required) must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.After termination of the clinical trial (last subject last visit in the trial), any unexpected safety issue that changes the risks benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the subjects who have participated in it, should be reported as soon as possible to the competent authority(ies) concerned together with proposed actions.Special reporting situationsSafety events of interest on a Sponsor study drug that may require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:
%Overdose of a Sponsor study drug
%Suspected abuse/misuse of a Sponsor study drug
%Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Sponsor study drug
%Medication error involving a Sponsor study drug (with or without subject/patient exposure to the Sponsor study drug, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF.[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

In addition, the author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable. Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded on the eCRF are consistent with the original source data.At a minimum, the type and level of detail of source data available for a subject should be consistent with that commonly recorded at the trial site as a basis for standard medical care. Specific details required as source data for the trial will be reviewed with the investigator before the trial and will be described in the monitoring guidelines (or other equivalent document).The following data will be recorded directly into the eCRF and will be considered source data: 
%Race
%History of smoking
%Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate 
%Height and weight
%Details of physical examination
Subject- and investigator-completed scales, assessments, and diaries designated by [CONTACT_124814]. Information from the diary, provided to subjects, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_124815].

TMC278-TiDP38-C213 Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment X 214
Approved, Issued Date: 03-FEB-2020Electronic Data Capture  will be used for this tr ial, meaning that all data will be entered in eCRF 
at the investigational site.All data must be entered in English.The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the trial. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after the subject’s visit. To avoid interobserver variability, every effort should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes all efficacy/safety evaluations. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable, or unknown, the investigator should indicate this in the eCRF. The investigator will be required to electronically sign off the clinical data. The monitor will review the eCRFs, evaluate them for completeness and consistency. The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections and alterations are to be made by [CONTACT_5245]/her designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central se rver, corrections to the data fields will be audit 
trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_27501], together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data manger will raise a query in the EDC application. The appropriate investigational staff will answer queries sent to the investigator. This will be audit-trailed by [CONTACT_124816], time and date stamp are captured.

The investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.Essential documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_140343]. These documents should be retained for a longer period however, if required by [CONTACT_1214].It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any trial documents before having obtained a written approval of the Sponsor.If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124688], custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be no tified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any 
documentation relating to this trial, the investigator must permit access to such reports. The subject is granting access to his/her source data by [CONTACT_12568].Any difficulty in storing original documents must be discussed with the monitor prior to the initiation of the trial.
3.8. Protocol Amendments
Neither the investigator nor the Sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. All protocol amendments must be issued by [CONTACT_1034], and signed and dated 
by [CONTACT_093]. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/IRB approval, or when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects, in which case the amendment must be promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority. Documentation of amendment approval by [CONTACT_23846]/IRB must be provided to the Sponsor. When the change(s) involves only logistic or administrative aspects of the trial, the IRB (and IEC where required) only needs to be notified.During the course of the trial, in situations where a departure from the protocol is unavoidable, the investigator or other physician in attendance will contact [CONTACT_41060] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

In all cases, contact [CONTACT_124818]. The data recorded in the eCRF and source documents will reflect any departure from the protocol, and the source documents will describe this departure and the circumstances requiring it.
3.9. Monitoring
The Sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques to monitor this trial.The Sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will record dates of the visits in a trial site visit log that will be kept at the trial site. The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source documents). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the Sponsor and trial-site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_124819]-site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the trial site, the method of verification must be discussed with the trial-site personnel. Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the trial-site personnel. 
The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant trial-site personnel will be available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of trial-related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the trial to provide feedback on the trial conduct.In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, trial-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the trial at the site. Central monitoring will take place for data identified by [CONTACT_23862].

During the trial, subjects and/or their parent(s) or legally aut horized representative(s) will be given any new 
information that may affect their decision to continue participation. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the trial at any time with no 
reason given and without penalty or loss of benef its to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
They will be informed that choosing not to participate or to withdraw from the trial will not have an impact on the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his/her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if th ey refuse to take part in this trial. Finally, 
they will be told that their records may be accessed by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB, competent authorities and authorized representatives of the Sponsor or the contract research organization (CRO) without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) and/or regulations. By [CONTACT_12568], the subject or their parent(s)/legally authorized representative(s)are authorizing such access, and agree to allow his or her trial physician to recontact [CONTACT_124826]/or their parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s) for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safety evaluations, if needed. Only subjects and/or their parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s) who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential adverse events of the trial, and provide their consent/assent voluntarily will be enrolled.The ICF(s) must be signed before performan ce of any trial-related activity.

This signed and dated amended version will be filed together with the initial signed and dated ICF.Pediatric subjectsThe special vulnerability of children requires specific measures in the informed consent process in order to safeguard their interests and to protect them from harm.As a rule, a pediatric subject is legally unable to provide informed consent. Therefore children are dependent on their parent(s)/legal guardian to assume responsibility for their participation in the clinical trial. While children are legally incapable of giving informed consent, they nevertheless may possess the ability to assent or to dissent from participation. Out of respect for children as developi[INVESTIGATOR_124689], children will be asked whether or not they wish to participate in the research, after having been informed about the trial in a manner that is appropriate to their intellectual and emotional capacities. They will be informed to the fullest extent possible in language and terms they are able to understand. Where appropriate, participants should assent to enroll in a trial (age of assent is to be determined by [CONTACT_8134]/IRB or to be consistent with local legal requirements). The parent(s)/legal guardian will be responsible for the actual informed consent, while the child will be asked to assent. Minors who assent to a trial and later withdraw that assent should not be maintained in the trial against their will, even if their parents still want them to participate.The following information forms (including consent / assent form) will be used by [CONTACT_71378]:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Status: Approved,  Date: [ADDRESS_140347] DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMICIt is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on the conduct of this clinical study due to, for example, self-isolation/quarantine by [CONTACT_124835]-site personnel; travel restrictions/limited access to public places, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; study site personnel being reassigned to critical tasks. In alignment with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing options for study related patient management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the study. This guidance does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement of the investigator to protect the health and well-being of patients and site staff and to maintain oversight of delegated trial activities. If, at any time, a patient’s safe ty is considered to be at risk, study drug 
will be discontinued, and study follow-up will be conducted.Scheduled visits that cannot be conducted in person at the study site will be performed to the extent 
possible remotely/virtually or delayed until such time that on-site visits can be resumed. At each contact, patients will be interviewed to co llect safety data. Sampling for efficacy endpoint 
assessments should be conducted and stored on-site or performed locally in case sample shipments to the central laboratory are disrupted. Patients will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement. Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments for patients, including follow up. Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted after consultation with the patient, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be documented asprotocol deviations with the prefix "COVID-19 related". Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19 related” in the case report form (CRF). The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study, and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance.  If a patient has tested positive for COVID-19, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_456]’s responsible medical officer to discuss plans for study drug and follow-up. Modifications made to

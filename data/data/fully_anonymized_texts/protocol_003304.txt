STUDY TREATMENT(s)  
Investigational medicinal 
product(s) 
 Formulation: Tested drug: Toujeo
 (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) 
Toujeo will be supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless solution in 
the Toujeo SoloStar prefilled (disposable) pen (insulin glargine 300 units/mL 
solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection). Each Toujeo® SoloStar® contains in 
total 450 units of insulin glargine (1.5 mL of 300 units/mL insulin glargine 
solution). This pen allows dose setting in the range of 1–80 units with 
minimum of 1 unit increment. Mixing of Toujeo with other insulin products is 
not allowed nor dilution. 
Control drug: Tresiba® (insulin Degludec 100 U/mL) 
Tresiba® will be supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless solution 
in the marketed Tresiba® FlexTouch prefilled (disposable) pen (insulin 
degludec 100 units/mL solution for SC injection).  
Each Tresiba FlexTouch contains in total 300 units of insulin degludec 
(3.0 mL of 100 units/mL insulin degludec solutions). This pen allows dose 
setting in the range of 1–80 units with minimum of 1 unit increment. 
Mixing of Tresiba with other insulin products is not allowed nor dilution.  
Route(s) of administration: Toujeo and Tresiba will be self-administered by [CONTACT_277110] 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM throughout the study treatment period. 
Dose regimen: Starting dose : 
The recommended daily starting dose of each basal insulin is defined per label with once daily as below followed by [CONTACT_277111]: 
x Toujeo: 0.2 units/kg 
x Tresiba: [ADDRESS_338303] weekly (but no more often than every 3 days), until the patient reaches a target 
fasting SMPG of 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding 
hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
x Thereafter, until the end of the study, the dose will be adjusted as necessary to maintain this fasting SMPG target. 
x Dose adjustments are based on a median of fasting SMPG values from the last [ADDRESS_338304] efforts should be made to reach the target glucose by 8-12 weeks after randomization.

Noninvestigational medicinal 
product(s) (if applicable) 
 Formulation: Background therapy: OADs and GLP-[ADDRESS_338305] (if taken) will be 
considered as NIMP(s).  
Rescue medication will be considered as NIMP(s): anti-diabetic medication 
(should be based on Investigator’s decision and local labeling documents).  
Route(s) of administration: OADs: Oral administration  
GLP-[ADDRESS_338306] (if taken): SC injection  
Dose regimen: 
 The type and dose of anti-diabetic background therapy will remain unchanged 
during the study; unless agents not approved in combination with insulin according to local labeling/local treatment guideline or identified safety 
concerns necessitate a reduction in dose or discontinuation of non-insulin 
antidiabetic drug(s).  
 
Rescue therapy:  
Routine fasting SMPG, central laboratory FPG measurements and central 
laboratory alerts on HbA1c are set up to ensure that glycemic parameters 
remain under predefined threshold values. The threshold values for rescue 
are defined as follows: 
From Visit 14 (Week 12): FPG >200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) and / or 
HbA1c>8.5%. 
In case of FPG or HbA1c above the target values and/or SMPG are not 
improving as expected in spi[INVESTIGATOR_277077] (note: the 
investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for 
insufficient glucose control and undertake appropriate action to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values), intensification of the treatment is to 
be considered.  
The choice of the anti-diabetic treatment to be added to the basal insulin 
should be based on Investigator’s decision and local labeling documents, 
adding prandial insulin may be the preferred option. The addition of a new 
antidiabetic drug or increase in dose of background antidiabetic medication 
(“rescue”) should not be decided based on a single FPG or HbA1c value but 
be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient’s glycemic control.

All assessments for primary and secondary efficacy and safety parameters 
planned in final on treatment assessment visit (Visit 20) should be performed 
before starting the “rescue medication” (adding new antidiabetic agent or 
increase in dose of existing background antidiabetic medication.) 
Then the patient continues the IMP and stays in the study in order to collect

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE The schedule of study-related procedures/assessments is detailed in the Study Flowchart 
Early termination: 
For all patients who prematurely and permanently discontinue the study 
treatment, assessments scheduled at the “End of treatment visit” and the 
“Post-treatment safety follow up visit”, will be performed as soon as possible. 
Afterward, the patients should continue in the study up to the scheduled date of study completion. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: Number of subjects: N=920 
A sample size of 920 patients (460 with Toujeo and 460 with Tresiba) will 
ensure that the upper confidence limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
adjusted mean difference between Toujeo and Tresiba would not exceed 
0.3% HbA1c with 90 % power assuming that standard deviation (SD) is 1.4%, 
and that the true difference between Toujeo and Tresiba is zero in HbA1c. 
General aspects of the analyses: For efficacy analyses, the baseline for both treatment groups is defined as the 
last available value prior to randomization. 
Analysis population: The primary efficacy population will be the ITT (intent-to-treat) population, 
which includes all randomized patients who received at least one dose of 
IMP, irrespective of the treatment actually being received, analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by [CONTACT_17628]. 
The safety population is defined as all randomized patients who received at 
least one dose of IMP, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. 
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Primary analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint 
[Week 24]) using available data during the 24-week on-treatment period will 
be analyzed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) 
(electronic

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 9 approach, using the missing at random framework carried out via SAS PROC 
MIXED using adequate contrasts. The model will include fixed categorical 
effects of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, randomization stratum of use of SU or meglitinide at screening (Yes versus No) and the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline HbA1c value and baseline HbA1c 
value-by-visit interaction. 
A stepwise closed testing approach will be used for the primary efficacy 
variable to assess non-inferiority and superiority sequentially. 
x Step 1 will proceed to assess non-inferiority Toujeo versus Tresiba. 
To assess non-inferiority, the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 between 
Toujeo and Tresiba will be compared with the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c. Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the difference between Toujeo and Tresiba 
on ITT population is <0.3%. 
x Step [ADDRESS_338307] superiority of Toujeo over Tresiba, only if non-inferiority of Toujeo versus Tresiba has been demonstrated. 
The superiority of Toujeo over Tresiba will be demonstrated if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in 
HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 between Toujeo over Tresiba on ITT 
population is <0 (zero). 
 
Analysis of secondary endpoints: All secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed or summarized on the 
24-week on treatment period using the ITT population. 
Safety analyses will be descriptive, based on the safety population. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  The study consists of:  
x Up-to 2 weeks screening period; it can be exceptionally extended up to one additional week,  
x A 24-week open label comparative efficacy and safety treatment period,  
x A 7-day post-treatment safety follow-up period for all the patients 
after permanent investigational medical product(IMP) discontinuation(except for patients who prematurely discontinue the study treatment but continue in the study) 
In total the maximum study duration will be approximately 27 weeks per patient: 
2 weeks + 24 weeks ± 5 days + 7 days

The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes requires introducing insulin therapy to achieve 
appropriate glycemic control in many patients at certain stage of the disease. Clinicians face challenge when advising patients to start insulin despi[INVESTIGATOR_277080], and to a lesser degree, macro-vascular complication. The key barriers appear to be both patient and physician related factors: fear of pain and needles, concern of side effects of insulin (ie, hypoglycemia, weight gain  etc) and the complexity of delivering the insulin 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_277081]. The major facilitat ors of insulin initiation 
focus on clinical benefits of in sulin in reducing symptoms and complications as well as improving 
survival and quality of life ( 1). 
Basal insulin forms the cornerstone of many treatme nt regimens for type 2 diabetes. Basal insulin 
alone is recommended by [CONTACT_251916] (ADA) as the most convenient initial insulin regimen ( 2). Recently two new basal insulin preparations (Toujeo
® and Tresiba®) have 
been introduced to clinical practice with the potential to address some of the concerns around initiating insulin therapy will facilitate patients and physicians to make decision on insulin 
initiation and keep better compliance and then co ntribute to long term glycemic control for 
patients. Comparison of these new basal insulins in insulin naive patients with type 2 diabetes 
inadequately controlled with OADs would provide meaningful information on their use for 
clinical practice. 
Insulin glargine U100 (Lantus
®) is 21A-Gly-30Ba-L-Arg-30Bb-L-Arg human insulin, a 
recombinant analog of human insulin providing a 24-hour basal insulin supply after a single-dose 
SC injection. Its efficacy and safety are well-known through extensive data collection involving over 200 000 patients in clinical studies and observational studies ( 3). 
HOE901-U300 (Toujeo) has the same composition as the current Lantus formulation 100 U/mL with adjustment of 3-times the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient and corresponding Zn content. The time-action profile of Toujeo was investigated in preclinical and clinical pharmacology studies and can be characterized as more even and prolonged profile of the glucose 
lowering activity (up to 36 hours) compared to insulin Lantus. Its efficacy and safety were 
demonstrated in the EDITION program. The glucose lowering effect of Toujeo was comparable with Lantus but lower hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population. EDITION 3 study which studied an insulin naive population demonstrated that in comparison with Lantus, hypoglycemia risk was reduced in nocturnal severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <3.9 mmol/L) and severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia<3.0 mmol/L in any time of the day.  Toujeo has been approved in th e US, the European Union, Japan, and other parts 
of the world. Further information on Toujeo, including important clinical trials performed pre- and post-registration, can be found in the national product label or in the Product Information ( 4) 
and Investigators Brochure HOE901 ( 3). 
Tresiba 100 unit/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen (insulin degludec) is a new recombinant analog of human insulin providing basal insulin supply beyond 42 hours after injection in euglycemic clamp conditions in type 1 diabetes ( 5). Its efficacy and safety were

Clinical Trial Protocol  18-Dec-2015 
HOE901/LPS14584 - insulin glargine Version number: [ADDRESS_338326] of Tresiba on glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
was comparable with insulin Lantus but with reduced risk of hypoglycemia mainly during the 
protocol defined nocturnal period ( 6). In the BEGIN Once Long study which investigate the 
efficacy and safety with Tresiba versus Lantus in similar population as EDITION 3 ( 7), overall 
rates of confirmed hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <3.1 mmol/L or severe) were similar with Lantus. However lower nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia was shown in favor of Tresiba ( 8). It 
has been approved in the US, European Union, Japan and other parts of the world. Further information on Tresiba can be found in the Product label Information on FDA website ( 5). 
Both Toujeo and Tresiba took Lantus as active comparator and demonstrated comparable efficacy and lower hypoglycemia risk in T2DM but no head-to-head comparison was performed. This trial is designed to confirm Toujeo’s efficacy and safe ty in comparison with Tresiba in insulin-naïve 
patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with non-insulin anti-diabetic medication and requiring basal insulin initiation. It will test the hypothesis that glucose control with Toujeo is non-inferior to Tresiba. Based on the currently available medical evidence and the application of 
the treat-to-target concept, comparable efficacy is  expected. HbA1c reflects the average glycemia 
over 2-3 months and has strong predictive value for diabetes complications. It is accepted by 
[CONTACT_17513], scientific association as an appropriate primary endpoint to support a claim based on glycemic control ( 9),(10). 
In the EDITION trials Toujeo was associated w ith lower hypoglycemia risk than Lantus during 
the initial phase (first two months when most  of the insulin titration occurred) and the 
hypoglycemia benefit was mainta ined until the end of the trials (6 months) in T2DM. Tresiba 
demonstrated comparable hypoglycemia risk to Lantus during the titrati on phases (0-15 weeks of 
treatment) and in favor of Tresiba with lower hypoglycemia risk beyond Week 16 in insulin naive population ( 6). Hence, the results from this head to h ead comparison of Toujeo with Tresiba in 
term of hypoglycemia will be of particular interest. 
Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of Toujeo versus Tresiba on percentage of patients 
reached HbA1c target, including not only reaching the target but also without severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia. The analysis of the effects of the flat insulin profile over at least 24 hours will be assessed based on self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) measurements (eg, 4-point, 8-point glucose profiles, fasting plasma glucose [FPG]).  Safety evaluation will include 
the comparison of all hypoglycemia events occurrence frequency and distribution, local tolerability at injection site, hypersensitivity reactions and other treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Repeat assessments of PRO will be performed during the study (Including 
patient satisfaction with treatment and patient perception of blood glucose control assessed by 
[CONTACT_277113] (status and change version) (DTSQ and DTSQc) 
questionnaires ( 11),(12) and Hypoglycemia Attitudes and Behavior Scale (HABS) ( 13) with a 
particular focus on patient’s a ttitudes and behavior rela ted to hypoglycemia in T2DM. Nocturnal 
hypoglycemia timeframe is defined as during standardized period (0:00 to 5:59
 AM) and extended 
period (0:00 to 7:59  AM) and at sleep status to observe the hy poglycemia event when patients are 
usually at sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_266420], usually in fasting condition. The extended period allow both Toujeo and Tresiba effect reaches a maximum (Toujeo: reach a stable plateau from 11 to 12 hours after dosing. Tresiba: a median of [ADDRESS_338327]-dose) which anticipate more hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_277082].

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 24 The target study population will comprise of adult T2DM patients who are naïve to insulin use, 
and considered to be inadequately controlled on their current antidiabetic medications (HbA1c between 7.5 and 10.5% and pre-study antidiabetic therapy have been stable for type and dose for at least 3 months before screening). It is expected that the investigator will exercise sound clinical 
judgment in assessing the patient’s eligibility in meeting the study inclusi on/exclusion criteria and 
the individual evaluation of the expected benefits of improved glycemic control versus treatment 
risks (eg, Hypoglycemia). The inclusion of insulin naive patients will provide valuable 
information around insulin initiation and dose titration for both compounds in this population. 
The starting dose of Toujeo and Tresiba was recommended as 0.2 U/Kg and [ADDRESS_338328] label and follow the same insulin titration algorithm. Injections of IMPs will be given during 6:00 
PM to 8:00 PM to compare both IMP in comparable situation, such as 
avoid potential bias of timing of hy poglycemic events during the day (eg, nocturnal versus other) 
based on the different pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles. Pen injectors will be used which should maximize convenience and minimize dosing errors. Background 
treatment should remain stable (type and dose) during the study, including SU and meglitinide, at 
least until basal insulin doses and HbA1c levels  have stabilized, except for discontinuation of 
agents not approved in combination with insulin  according to local labeling/local treatment 
guidelines before randomization and any identified safety concerns necessitating a reduction in dose or discontinuation of background non-insulin antidiabetic drug(s) during the trial, after randomization. Rescue therapy may be given for refractory hyperglycemia after Week 12. The choice of the anti-diabetic treatment to be added to the basal insulin should be based on Investigator’s decision and local labeling documents, either adding an increase in dose of one of the background agents the patient was taking at randomization, or in the form of another oral agent or an injectable such as prandial insulin may be the preferred option or a glucagon like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. 
A screening period of 2 weeks is designed to a llow patients to familiarize  themselves with the 
glucose meter, diary; and to be counseled in appropriate lifestyle practices as well as the symptom 
of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia management. Only if any of the laboratory parameters are not available upon the end of the screening period (eg, sample material damaged during transport etc), a retest can be performed. If this is the case (and exceptionally in other situations if justified) the screening period can be extended of one additional week. Twelve (12) weeks are anticipated for study drug dose titration which should allow most patients have time to reach a stable dose, with another 12 weeks to allow HbA1c value to stabilize at this dose. A dose titration schedule will be recommended (dose increases for fasting SMPG values above target ranges of 80-100 mg/dL 
(4.4-5.6 mmol/L), and dose reductions for lower values or occurrence of symptomatic confirmed 
hypoglycemia). Weekly site contacts with the patient (at time of on-site visits or by [CONTACT_648]) should occur during the titration period (through Visit 14) to titrate the dose of study drug based on 
review of the interval SMPG readings, any hypoglycemia events, and overall clinical situation. Because patients are beginning a new insulin trea tment, participants in  this trial will be 
encouraged to perform frequent SMPG monitoring, especially fasting values and any time if hypoglycemia occurred, in order to provide optimal data for study drug titration, and to confirm epi[INVESTIGATOR_277083]. Seven days post-treatment safety assessment is designed to be performed by [CONTACT_277114]/AEs after completion of study treatment at the end of

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a multicenter, open-label, 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm, parallel-group, 
24-week treatment duration Phase 4 study. 
The study will recruit outpatients with T2DM inadequately controlled on OADs with/without 
GLP-[ADDRESS_338330]. At the end of the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 
x Insulin Toujeo group 
x Insulin Tresiba group 
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_277109]1c at the screening visit (<8%, 8%) and 
sulphonylurea (SU) or meglitinides use before the day of screening (Yes; No). 
The study will comprise 3 periods: 
x An up to 2-weeks screening period. It can be exceptionally extended up to one additional 
week 
x A 24-week open-label randomized treatment period  
x A 7-day post-treatment safety follow-up period for all the patients after permanent investigational medical product (IMP) discontinuation (except for patients who 
prematurely discontinue the study treatment but continue in the study) 
The type and dose of antidiabetic background therapy will remain unchanged during the study (see Section  8.3.1). 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 27 weeks: an up to 2-week 
screening period, a 24-week randomized treatment period, and a 7-day post-treatment safety 
follow-up period.

Injection time 
Toujeo and Tresiba will be se lf-administered by [CONTACT_277119] 6:00 PM and 
8:00 PM throughout the study period. The injection time will be selected at the discretion of 
patients and investigators at V2.

The IMP should be self-administered by [CONTACT_277120], alternating between the left and right 
anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal  wall or thighs or upper arms. Within a 
given area, location should be changed (rotated) at each time to prevent injection site skin 
reactions. 
The injection sites for IMP and n on-investigational medicinal product  ([NIMP], if taken) should be 
different so that, if any, an injection site reactions can be attributed specifically either to IMP (Toujeo 
or Tresiba) or NIMP (eg, GLP-[ADDRESS_338337]).

Starting dose 
The recommended daily starting dose of each IMP is defined per label with once daily as below 
followed by [CONTACT_277111]: 
x Toujeo: 0.2 units/kg ( 4) 
x Tresiba: 10 units ( 5) 
Dose adjustment 
During the study, doses of either basal insuli n, Toujeo or Tresiba will be titrated to achieve 
glycemic targets without hypoglycemia according to the same algorithm as below ( Table 2 ). 
x After randomization, the dose will be titrated at least weekly (but no more often than every 
3 days), until the patient reaches a target fasting SMPG of 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 
5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
x Thereafter, until the end of the study, the dose will be adjusted as necessary to maintain 
this fasting SMPG target. 
x Dose adjustments are based on a median of fasting SMPG values from the last [ADDRESS_338338] efforts should be made to reach the target glucose by 8-12 weeks after randomization.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 36 8.3.2 Rescue therapy:  
Routine fasting SMPG, central laboratory FPG me asurements and central laboratory alerts on 
HbA1c are set up to ensure that glycemic parameters remain under predefined threshold values. 
The threshold values for rescue are defined as follows: 
From visit 14 (Week 12) : FPG >200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) and / or HbA1c >8.5%. 
In case of FPG or HbA1c above the thresholds, the investigator should ensure that no reasonable 
explanation exists for insufficient glucos e control and in particular that:  
x Plasma glucose was actually measured in fasting condition (ie, After at least 8 hours 
fasting) 
x Study treatment is being properly titrated according to the protocol, 
x There is no intercurrent disease which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infection), 
x Compliance to treatment, diet and lifestyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explains the insufficient glycemic control, the investigator 
should undertake appropriate action, ie: 
x Titrate basal insulin dose according to the protocol, 
x Initiate an evaluation and treatment of any intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/SAE/concomitant medica tion parts of the e-CRF and the medical record), 
x Stress the absolute need to comply with treatment, diet and lifestyle recommendations, 
x Schedule an HbA1c and/or FPG assessment at the next visit (if the next visit is a phone call, it should be replaced by [CONTACT_63689]-site visit). 
If none of the above reasons can be found, and/or appropriate actions fail, it is recommended to 
initiate rescue therapy. The choice of the anti-diabetic treatment to be added to the basal insulin should be based on Investigator’s decision and local labeling documents. Adding prandial insulin may be the preferred option. The addition of a new antidiabetic drug or increase in dose of background antidiabetic medication (“rescue”) should not be decided based on a single FPG or 
HbA1c value but be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient’s glycemic control. 
The reason for initiating rescue therapy, type of rescue therapy and the day of starting rescue 
therapy along with the dose will be documented on the appropriate pages of e-CRF. Note: Short-term (up to 10 days maximum) uses of short/rapid-acting insulin therapy (eg, due to 
acute illness or surgery) will not be  considered as rescue therapy.  All such use of short/rapid-
acting insulin therapy must be reported in the e-CRF and patient record. All assessments for primary and secondary efficacy and safety parameters planned in final on 
treatment assessment visit (Visit 20) should be performed before adding the “rescue medication”. Then the patient continues the IMP and stays in the study in order to collect safety information.

As Toujeo and the control drug Tresiba are distinguishable, this study is an open-label design, and 
no attempt will be made to blind administration. 
COMPENSATION FOR LACK OF BLINDING 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_197593]-label adminis tration of IMP, assessment of outcomes will be based on 
objectively collected data, which are assessments for the efficacy variable (HbA1c, FPG) by 
[CONTACT_277122].  
As Toujeo and the control drug Tresiba are distinguishable in terms of initial dose and following doses during the first weeks of the study, a process will be applied to blind this information at the sponsor study team level. 
The sponsor study team, except individuals who have access to patients’ source documents (eg, 
local monitoring team, auditors) will remain bli nded to the treatment arm of individual patients 
and dose of IMP throughout the study up to the database lock. All analyses and data review before database lock will be pe rformed blindly, except for the titration review which will be performed 
by [CONTACT_15034]. 
Insulin titration review will be performed by [CONTACT_277123], 
hypoglycemia events and IMP dose titration by [CONTACT_277124]. The first Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written before the first patient is randomized in 
the study. 
8.[ADDRESS_338342] and the Study Biostatistician provides the randomization scheme to the interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS). Then, the IVRS/IWRS generates the patient randomization list according to which it allo cates treatment arms to the patients. 
The study medications are provided in open-label boxes and each type of kit is identified with a treatment number. 
At the screening visit the investigator or designee contacts the IVRS/IWRS center to receive the 
patient number. The patient number is composed of 9-digit number containing the 3-digit country code, the 3-digit center code and the 3-digit patient chronological number (which is [ADDRESS_338343] patient screened in a center, 002 for the second patient screened in the same center etc). 
Patients are randomized to receive during the 24 weeks comparative efficacy and safety period,

procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructions for handling the compounds should be managed according to the rules provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The expi[INVESTIGATOR_277089], and storage conditions are written on the IMPs 
labels and in the instruction leaflet. Patients are responsible for the correct storage of “unused” 
and “in-use”pens after it is dispensed at the site.

HOE901/LPS14584 - insulin glargine Version number: [ADDRESS_338344], or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by [CONTACT_179623]. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription and it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. Pen-related 
deficiencies should be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_199084] a procedure on product technical complain (PTC) form (please see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be s ubject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the investigator supply  IMP to a third party, allows the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by [CONTACT_13129], or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.8.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
A Treatment Log for returned and dispensed IMP w ill be kept for each patient. At each on-site 
visit, patient returns to the site with used and unused IMP except for Visit 4 (collecting used study 
medication only). Investigator or delegate has to insp ect IMP remaining in the returned packs and 
compare to dosing records documented in the patients’ diaries. Discrepancies have to be addressed to the patient for clarification of real treatment administration. The investigator completes the appropriate treatment log based on the used/unused IMP (study drug pens) returned. 
The monitor will check the e-CRF data by [CONTACT_277129]’s diary entries, treatment 
logs and unused treatment kits. 
Patients have to record the administration of their background non-insulin antidiabetic 
medication(s) and rescue therapy (if applicable) in the diary. The following information with 
regards to the NIMP will be recorded in the s ource data: drug(s) name, dosage, start date, stop 
date. Compliance will be checked by [CONTACT_277130].

IMP 
All used, partially-used or unused treatments will be retrieved by [CONTACT_1034]. A detailed 
treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Inve stigator (or the pharmacist) and 
countersigned by [CONTACT_179626]. 
The Investigator will not destroy any IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization.  A potential defect in the quality of IMP may initiate a recall procedure by [CONTACT_1034]. In this 
case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
NIMP 
As NIMP is not provided by [CONTACT_4530], return and destruction isn’t required. 
8.9 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by [CONTACT_56449](s). 
Treatments in addition to the st udy treatment should be kept to a minimum during the study. 
However, if these are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). Any treatment which are continued during the study a nd/or initiated or changed during 
the study must be recorded in source data and in the e-CRF. 
Prohibited concomitant therapy 
The following drugs are not permitted during the screening and randomized open-label treatment 
periods: 
x Antidiabetic drugs, which are not approved in combination with insulin according to local 
labeling/local treatment guideline, are prohibited throughout the on treatment period of the 
study, 
x No other additional antid iabetic treatments (eg, meal time insulin), apart from authorized 
concomitant non-insulin antidiabetic therapy and, when applicable rescue therapy (see Section  8.3.2), are to be used until the end of the study, 
x Note: Short-term use ( 10 days) of rapid/short-acting insulin due to acute illness or 
surgery (eg, infection) is allowed, 
x Insulin pump therapy is not allowed during the course of the study, 
x Initiation of weight loss drugs during the stud y is not allowed. Prev ious treatment with 
weight loss drugs can be continued but the doses must have been stable for at least [ADDRESS_338345] remain stable throughout the study,

In case of using rescue therapy, all assessments planned for the Visit 20 (Week 24) are to be 
performed before initiating rescue therapy. After these assessments are completed and rescue 
therapy has been initiated, the pa tient will remain in the study and continue with their study 
treatment as well as background non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs if appropriate. The planned visits and assessments should be 
performed until the last scheduled visit.  
In case  of premature and permanent IMP discontinuation, patients should have a visit as soon as 
possible with the assessments normally planned in Visit 20 (Week 24). Afterward, the patients should continue in the study up to the scheduled date of study completion. They should be followed up according to the study procedures as specified in the protocol (except for the 7-day safety post-treatment follow-up). 
Data quality being very important to fully evaluate the efficacy/safety of the IMP, investigators 
must make their best efforts educating thei r patients on the importance of sticking to visit 
schedules, study required procedures and assessments up to the end of the study. A particular effort is requested to prevent missing data.

Observation period of efficacy endpoints 
The 24-week on-treatment period for efficacy endpoints (primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints) is defined as the time from the first injection of open-label IMP up to [ADDRESS_338347]. 
The randomized 24–week period for efficacy variables is defined from first dose of IMP up to 
Week 24, regardless of study treatment discontinuation and intake of rescue therapy. 
The baseline value for efficacy endpoints is the last available value prior to the first injection of 
open-label IMP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fasting plasma glucose  
Fasting plasma glucose is measured at a central laboratory. 
Blood samples for FPG measurement are taken at baseline (Visit 2; Day 1); at Visit 10 (Week 8); 
Visit 14 (Week 12); and Visit 20 (Week 24; final primary endpoint assessment visit). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) and glucometer, patient diaries and 
training

IMP doses etc. The patients will be instructed in the proper use of the glucometer and diary 
including education about hypoglycemia symptoms and management (See Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) at 
Visit 1 and repeated at Visit 2 to make sure good compliance to the instruction. The training will 
be repeated as often as necessary at the study vi sits. The patients will be instructed to bring their 
glucometers and patient diaries with them to each site visit.  
The glucometers should be calibrated according to instructions given in the package leaflet and the study site should also check the glucometers regularly using the provided control solutions for data validity.  
Instruction on how to complete the patient diary on a daily basis will be done by [CONTACT_6624]. At each 
on site visit: 
x The study site staff reviews the patient’s diary, 
x SMPG values stored in the glucometer memo ry will be downloade d, printed out, dated, 
signed and filed into the patient  file. If the patient has more than one SMPG reading at the 
same time point, the Investigator/site staff should discuss with the patient to identify the appropriate value to be recorded in the patient diary and in the e-CRF. This information will help the Investigator to assess treatment effects, adjust insulin doses and compliance. 
Note: The SMPG values to be entered in the e-CRF must be checked for consistency with the 
information from the glucometer. In case of inconsistency, the reason for inconsistency has to be documented.  If needed, the resulting action (eg, tr aining of the patient on correct documentation 
of the values) is also to be documented. The conf irmed values will be entered in the e-CRF based 
on the glucometer output values. 
The patient diary  includes but is not limited to the following information: 
x Time and dose of daily IMP injections and type and dose of daily non-insulin antidiabetic 
medication(s),  
- In case of missed IMP injection, “0 unit” should be reported during the period when 
the IMP was not taken, 
x Times of start of meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and SMPG measurements, as well as plasma glucose values at the day of the 4-point and 8-point SMPG test (see Section  1.2). 
x Changes in anti-diabetic  medication treatment, 
x Adverse events, signs and symptoms suggesting occurrence of hypoglycemia and relevant onset time, countermeasure or corrective treatment, supportive test (ie, SMPG value) and

measured by [CONTACT_277131]-lowering 
agents once a day during the study. When up-titration has been completed and fasting SMPG is 
stable in the target range, at least 3 days measurements per week should be performed. 
Fasting SMPG values should be recorded in the patient diary. The following daily fasting SMPG 
values will be entered in the e-CRF: 
x All available fasting SMPG values from the w eek prior to each site or phone call visit 
and/or prior to insulin dose titration; these include the fasting SMPG value on the day of titration. 
4-point (prebreakfast, prelunch, predinner, bedtime) SMPG Profile:  
4-point SMPG profiles should be measured at the following 4 points: prebreakfast, prelunch, 
predinner and bedtime. 
The patients are requested to perform 4-point SMPG profile measurement over a single 24-hour 
period on at least one day in the 5 days before V6 (Week 4) and V10 (Week 8). All SMPG values measured on these days will be recorded in th e patient’s diary and entered in the e-CRF (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section  1.2). 
On the days when 4-point profiles are done, fas ting SMPG will be considered as the first point of 
measurement, ie, “prebreakfast” time point.  
8-point SMPG Profile:  
The 8-point SMPG profile should be measured at the following 8 points: the 3:00 
AM (+/-1 hour) 
at night, pre-prandial and [ADDRESS_338350], lunch, dinner and at bedtime. Two 
hours postprandial (breakfast, lunch and dinner) is defined as [ADDRESS_338351] one day in the 5 days before baseline visit (V2) , V14 (Week 12) and V20 
(Week 24, end of treatment assessment visit). Special attention should be paid that the 3:00 AM. 
All SMPG values measured on these days will be reco rded in the patient’s diary and entered in the 
e-CRF (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section  1.2). 
On the days when 8-point profile are done, 4-point (prebreakfast, prelunch, predinner and bedtime) will be used for 4-point SMPG profile analysis.

Observation period of safety endpoints 
The observation period of safety data  will be divided into 3 segments: 
x The pre-treatment period  is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first injection of open-label IMP 
x The on-treatment period  is defined as the time from the first injection of open-label IMP 
up to [ADDRESS_338352] injection of open-label IMP, regardless of the introduction of 
rescue therapy. The 7-day interval is chosen based on the half-life of the IMP 
(approximately 5 times the half-life of Tresiba) 
x The post-treatment period  is defined as the time starting [ADDRESS_338353] injection of

Hypoglycemia will be  assessed. Refer to Section  10.6.1 for details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Body weight 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same scale should be used throughout the study, 
and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by [CONTACT_3455]. 
The use of balance scales is recommended; if digital scales are used, testing with standard weights 
is of particular importance. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced with both weights at zero and the balance bar aligned. The patient should stand in the center of the platform as standing off-center may affect measurement. The weights are moved until the beam balances (the arrows are aligned). The weight is read and recorded in the e-CRF and Source Data. Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. The body weight is measured at each on-site visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis, including hematology, clinical chemistry, serum pregnancy test in female s of childbearing potential and serum follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH) and estradiol (only in females requiring confirmation of postmenopausal status) and urinalysis. Clinical laboratory values will be  analyzed after conversion into standard 
international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. 
Central laboratory data will be collected only at screening visit (Visit 1, Week -2) for identifying 
patients with exclusion criteria or safety consideration include serum pregnancy test will be test at 
screening visit. Urine pregnancy test at site will be  performed at Visit 2 and end of treatment visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical examination 
Physical examination is performed at screening visit (V1, Week-2), baseline visit (V2, Day 1) and

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
Vital signs include: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (beat per minute: 
bpm). They are assessed at screening (Visit 1, Week -2); at baseline (Visit 2, Day 1), and all on-site visit (see Section  1.2). 
Blood pressure (mmHg) should be measured when the patient is quiet and seated and with their arm outstretched in line with mid-sternum and supported. Measurement should be taken under standardized conditions, approximately at the same time of th e day, on the same arm, with the 
same device (after the patient has rested comfortably for at least five minutes) and the values are

9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Patient Reported Outcomes (Health-related Quality of Life) 
The patient reported outcomes (PROs) measures in this study are the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (DTSQs and DTSQc versions) and the Hypoglycemia Attitudes and Behavior Scale 
(HABS). They will be administered at Week 0 (D ay 1, except for DTSQc), at Week 12 and at the 
end of the treatment. The questionnaires are attached in the Appendices (see Appendix A , 
Appendix B , Appendix C ) 
The patients will be requested to complete the questionnaires by [CONTACT_277133] (see study flow chart) in spec ific booklets, independently from investigator, site 
staff and any help from friends or relatives. For validity purposes, patients will be asked to answer 
all the questions of the questionnaires at the start of the visit in a quiet place, and while on site to return the completed questionnaires to the investigator or his/her designee on the same day. 
In case of rescue therapy: Administration of the three questionnaires (DTSQs, DTSQc and HABS) 
prior to the administration of the rescue therapy and afterwards as normally planned. 
In case of early IMP discontinuation: Administration of the questionnaires at the visit planned for 
the last dosing day with IMP and afterwards as normally planned. 
The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status Version (DTSQs)  is a validated 
questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with treatment and patient perception of blood glucose 
control ( 11). It consists of 8 items that are answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6. Items 1, 4, 5, 6, 
7 and 8 are summed to produce a Total Treatment Satisfaction score ranging from 0 (no satisfaction) to 36 (high satisf action with treatment). The 2 items of ‘perceived frequency of 
hyperglycemia’ (Item 2) and ‘perceived frequency of hypoglycemia’ (Item 3) are scored separately ranging from 0 (none of the time) to 6 (most of the time). DTSQs will be administered at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks in the local language.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 50 The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Change Version (DTSQc) was developed 
from the original DTSQ to evaluate the change in  treatment satisfaction at a specific time point 
(12). The change version has the same 8 items as the status version, with a small alteration to the 
wording of Item 7. The DTSQc instructions and response options differ from those of the DTSQs 
to produce measures of relative change in satisfaction rather than measures of absolute 
satisfaction. Items are answered on a Likert scale from í3 to +3, and the sum of the treatment 
satisfaction scores range from í18 to +18. Positive scores are indicative of improvement in 
treatment satisfaction, whereas negative scores are indicative of deterioration in treatment satisfaction. A score of 0 represents no change. The 2 items of ‘perceived frequency of hyperglycemia’ (Item 2) and ‘perceived frequency of hypoqlycemia’ (Item 3) are scored from -3 (‘much less of the time now’) to +3 (‘much more of the time now’), meaning negative scores indicate fewer problems with blood glucose levels and positive scores indicate more problems than before. DTSQc will be administered at  12 and 24 weeks in the local language. 
At 12 and 24 weeks, DTSQs (status) will be administered before the DTSQc (change). 
The HABS (Hypoglycemia Attitudes and Behavior Scale)  was recently developed with type 2 
diabetic patients using or not insulin ( 13). It consists of 14 items within 3 domains measuring 
anxiety (5 items), confidence (5 items) and avoida nce (4 items) related to hypoglycemia. Items are 
answered on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with higher scores indicating high avoidance, confidence and anxiety related to hypoglycemia. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks in the local language.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments listed in the “Study Flow Chart” in Section  1.2 are 
not repeated in this section. The aim of this section is to provide details on how some of the 
procedures/assessments have to be performed. 
This is an outpatient study and consists of [ADDRESS_338357] in the morning at approximately the same time (patient is in fasting conditions  at Visit 1 (Week -2, screening visit), Visit 2 
(Day 1, baseline), Visit 10 (Week 8), Visit 14 (Week 12), Visit 20 (Week 24), see also Study Flowchart, Section  1.2). 
The fasting condition  is defined as an overnight fast no less than 8 hours that consisted of no 
food or liquid intake, other than water. IMP and non-insulin antidiabetic medication should be administered after the fasting blood sample is drawn for all laboratory tests on the study site. 
Note: If the patient is not in fasting conditions at visits which required in fasting conditions, the 
blood sample is not collected and a new appointment should be given to the patient for the 
following day if possible, with instruction to be fasted. 
For phone-call visits, the patient is called by [CONTACT_277136] a scheduled 
time. 
Visit window: From Visit 3 (Week 1) to Visit 9 (Week 7), a timeframe of ± 3 days is acceptable 
using the day of visit 2 (baseline) as reference (if one visit date is changed, the next visit should take place according to the original schedule). From Visit 10 (Week 8) up to the final primary 
endpoint assessment at Visit 20 (Week 24), a time frame of ± 5 days is acceptable. For Visit 21 
(follow up visit) a time frame of -1~+ [ADDRESS_338358]-treatment is acceptable. 
10.1.1 Screening period (Week -2 to Week 0) 
Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria as noted in Section 7.1  may be screened. It will be 
the investigator’s responsibility to confirm the diagnosis of T2DM. 
All laboratory tests measured at a central laborato ry that are needed for checking the exclusion 
criteria of the patients, are performed at the screening visit. At V2 (Day 1), patient who meet the 
selection criteria at the end of screening period as noted in Section 7.2  can be randomized into on-
treatment period. 
All background non-insulin antidiabetic medications should be continued without dose and type 
change during screening period.

material damaged during transport etc), a retest can be performed. As an exception, if justified 
according to the Investigator’s assessment, the screening period can be extended one additional week, ie, baseline visit (V2, Day 1) can be scheduled no later than 3 weeks after screening visit 
(V1, Week -2). 
Patients can be re-screened one time before randomization in case of non-evaluable exclusion 
criteria or in cases where original screen failure was due to reasons expected to change at rescreening and based upon the Investigator’s c linical judgment. Re-screened patients will be 
subject to the screening visit procedures/assessments (see below) including new informed consent signed and allocation of a new patient number.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_338364](s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_277150]. In case of treatment interruption due to an AE, reinitiating of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be recorded by [CONTACT_13137] e-CRF when considered as confirmed.

Clinical Trial Protocol  18-Dec-2015 
HOE901/LPS14584 - insulin glargine Version number: [ADDRESS_338365](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinua tion is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pati ent not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_338366] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with IMP in case of the following: 
x At patient’s own request, ie, withdrawal of the consent for treatment 
x If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor 
A patient must withdraw from treatment with IMP in either  of the following cases: 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of IMP 
x Pregnancy in female participants 
x Necessity to use prohibited therapy (see Section  8.9) 
Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a 
decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study  procedures as specifie d in this protocol 
(except for the 7-day safety  post-treatment follow up) up to the scheduled date of study 
completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. 
If possible, and after the permanent discontinua tion of treatment, the pa tients will be assessed 
using the procedure normally planned for the last dosing day with the IMP (end of treatment visit). For PRO assessments, please refer to Section  9.3.1. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded by [CONTACT_277151]’s medical record when considered as confirmed. IVRS/IWRS should be notified when a patient prematurely discontinues treatment.

If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study 
visit. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_56479] 
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws the consent for follow-up, 
the Investigator should make the best effort to re-contact [CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_277152] (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone 
contact, receipt for sending a registered letter) 
In addition, the date of discontinuation of the study for patients who discontinued the IMP should 
be recorded by [CONTACT_13137] e-CRF when considered as confirmed. 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered. Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events

A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited  reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not  be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277095] (ie, specific measures or corrective  treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important ev ents is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is 
not intended to be exhaustive: 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 63 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_125478]. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
All AESIs will be reported to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs, ie, within 24 hours as 
detailed in Section  10.4.3. 
The AESIs are listed below: 
x Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualifie d as an SAE only if it fulfills 
one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
x Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP 
- An overdose (accidental or in tentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by 
[CONTACT_277153] (not based on systematic drug 
count) and defined as follows 
- For IMP and other insulin: any dose adminis tration which, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_277096]. 
- An overdose with non-insulin anti-diabetic medication is defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended/ planned therapeutic interval. 
Of note, asymptomatic overdose has to be reported as a standard AE. 
x Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT). 
ALT [ADDRESS_338371] (if baseline ALT < ULN) or ALT 2 times the baseline value (if baseline 
ALT ULN) should be notified within 24 hours to the monitoring team (see Section

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia events will be categorized as follows according to ADA category ( 17): 
Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_251250], unconsciousness or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  
The definition of severe hypoglycemia includes all epi[INVESTIGATOR_277097]-treatment and which were thus thought to place patients at risk 
for injury to themselves or others.  
Note that “requires assistance” means that the patient could not help himself or herself. Assisting 
a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident.  
Severe hypoglycemia will be qua lified as an SAE only if it fulfills  SAE criteria. All events of 
seizure, unconsciousness or coma must be reported as SAEs. 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an  event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L). 
Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_277098] (but not 
necessarily limited to): increased sweating, nervousness, asthenia, tremor, dizziness, increased appetite, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, and coma. Patients will be instructed to measure finger stick plasma glucose levels prior to the administration of carbohydrates whenever symptomatic hypoglyc emia is suspected, unless safety considerations 
necessitate immediate glucose rescue prior to confirmation, and then a glucose measurement should be performed as soon as safe, with appropriate diary documentation. Details on hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_277099], and patients will contact [CONTACT_277154].

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 67 Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not accomp anied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_277100] a measured plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event dur ing which symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_277101] a plasma glucose determination, but was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration less than or equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate without a test of plasma glucose. 
Pseudo hypoglycemia 
Pseudo-hypoglycemia is an event during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_277102] a measured  plasma glucose concentration >70 mg/dL 
(>3.9 mmol/L) but approaching that level. 
Nocturnal hypoglycemia 
Nocturnal hypoglycemia is any hypoglycemia of the above categories that occurs: 
x Between 00:00
 AM and 05:59 AM or 00:00 AM and 7:59 AM, regardless whether patient was 
awake or work up because of the event. 
x Sleep status: patient was asleep between bed time and before getting up in the morning, ie, 
before the morning determina tion of fasting pre-breakfast SMPG and patient woke-up due 
to the hypoglycemia 
Note: Confirmed hypoglycemia:  Any hypoglycemia confirmed by [CONTACT_277155] (1) of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or (2) 54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L).

10.6.2 Local tolerability at injection site and hypersensitivity reactions 
If the investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability at the study drug 
injection site or hypersensitivity reactions, the event should be recorded in the adverse event page in the e-CRF. If a patient reports  severe injection site or hypers ensitivity reaction between the on-
site visits or during a phone call visit, the investigator should ask him/her to come to the study site on the same or the next day, so that the event can be properly assessed, reported and treated.

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy variable of HbA1c change from 
baseline to Week 24. 
A sample size of 920 randomized patients (460 randomized per treatment group) will ensure that 
the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean difference between Toujeo and Tresiba would not exceed a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% with at least 90% power. This calculation assumes a common SD of 1.4% with a 1-sided test at the 2.5% significant level and a true difference between Toujeo and Tresiba is zero in HbA1c between the treatment groups. 
Calculations were made using nQuery Advisor
® Software Version 7.0. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
The total number of patients for each of the following categories will be presented. 
x Screened: all patients who originally met inclusion criteria and signed the informed 
consent 
x Screen failure patients and reason for screen failure 
x Randomized: all screened patie nts with a treatment arm allocated and recorded in the 
IVRS/IWRS database, regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not 
x Safety population (see Section  11.3.2) presented as treated 
x The intent-to-treat (ITT) population ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) analyzed as randomized 
x The randomization strata (screening HbA1c categories [<8.0%, 8.0%], use of SU or 
meglitinides at screening [Yes, No]) assigned by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS will be summarized. The 
discrepancy between the strata assigned by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS and the information reported on CRF will be listed for all randomized patients 
x The Per-Protocol (PP) population ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] analyzed as subset of ITT population 
and without major protocol deviations) 
x Patients who permanently discontinued the IMP, and the reasons for permanent treatment 
discontinuation 
For all categories of patients except screened and screen failure patients, percentages will be 
calculated using the number of randomized patients as denominator for different treatment groups.

11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy variable, change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 in % as defined in 
Section  9.1.1 will be analyzed in the ITT population using available data during the 24-week on 
treatment period (defined in Section  9.2.1). A mixed-effect model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach will be used, under the missing at random framework carried out via SAS PROC MIXED using an adequate contrast at Visit 20 (Week 24). 
The model will include fixed categorical effects of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit 
interaction, randomization stratum of use of SU or meglitinides at screening (Yes, No) as well as, the continuous fixed covariates of baseline HbA1c value and baseline HbA1c value-by-visit interaction. 
This model will be run with an unstructured correlation matrix to model the within-patient errors. 
Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method with the 
Newton-Raphson algorithm. Denominator degr ees of freedom will be estimated using 
Satterthwaite’s approximation. This model will provide baseline adjusted least squares (LS)

A stepwise closed testing approach will be used for the primary efficacy variable to assess non-
inferiority and superiority  sequentially detailed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]: 
x Step 1 will proceed to assess non-inferiority Toujeo versus Tresiba. To assess non-inferiority, the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change 
in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 between T oujeo and Tresiba will be compared with 
the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c. Non-inferiority will be 
demonstrated if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the difference between Toujeo and Tresiba on ITT population is <0.3%. 
x Step [ADDRESS_338378] superiority of Toujeo over Tresiba, only if non-inferiority of Toujeo versus 
Tresiba
 has been demonstrated. The superiority of Toujeo over Tresiba will be 
demonstrated if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean 
change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 between Toujeo over Tresiba on ITT population is <0 (zero).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 74 for imputation using MINIMUM option of MI SAS procedure. Since in general, the missing 
pattern will not be monotone, a two-step approach will be used: 
x Step 1: the MCMC method will be used in conjunction with the IMPUTE=MONOTONE 
option to create an imputed data set with a monotone missing pattern 
x Step 2: using the monotone data set from Step 1, missing data will be imputed using the regression method 
The imputation model for Step 1 will include the treatment group, baseline HbA1c value, as well 
as HbA1c values at Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24. 
The imputation model for Step 2 will includes the same variables as in Step 1 with the 
randomization strata. 
For each simulation leading to negative imputed  value, another value will be redrawn for 
imputation using MINIMUM option of MI SAS procedure. The imputed HbA1c value at Week 24 in the Toujeo group will then be penalized by [CONTACT_1583] 0.3% 
(corresponding to the non-inferiority margin) to the imputed HbA1c value whereas the imputed HbA1c in the Tresiba group will not be pena lized. The change in HbA1c from baseline to 
endpoint will then be derived from observed and imputed (penalized or not) HbA1c value at Week 24.  
The 100 complete data sets will then be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model including the fixed categorical effects of randomization stratum of screening HbA1c 
(<8.0%,  8.0%), and randomization stratum of use of SU or meglitinides at screening (Yes, No), 
treatment group (Toujeo, Tresiba), as well as, the continuous fixed covariate of baseline HbA1c value. The MIANALYZE procedure will then be used  to generate valid statistical inferences by 
[CONTACT_31571] 100 analyses using Rubin’s formulae.  
This procedure will provide base line adjusted least-squares means estimates at Week 24 for both 
treatment groups, as well as, the differences of these estimates, with their corresponding SEs and 
95% CIs.

of open-label IMP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety endpoints 
Safety endpoints are described in Section  9.2.2. 
The summary of safety results will be presented by [CONTACT_6660].  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rules: 
x The baseline value for safety endpoints will be the last available value prior to the first 
injection of IMP  
x The following definitions will be applied to vital signs: 
- The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as 
abnormal values considered medically important by [CONTACT_181295]/thresholds based on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_277160] 
- PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at leas t one PCSA during the TEAE 
period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment TEAE period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the PCSA percentage during the TEAE on-treatment period 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_338383] 1 hypoglycemic event will be 
presented per treatment group and type of hypoglycemic event (ADA Workgroup on Hypoglycemia [ 17], Section  10.6.1) according to time of occurrence {nocturnal (ie, 00:00 to 
05:59 
AM; 00:00 to 07:59 AM), any time of the day} during the on treatment period. The Odds 
Ratio and its corresponding 95% CI of Toujeo arm over Tresiba arm for each hypoglycemic event will be estimated by a logistic re gression model using th e same approach as the one described for 
categorical efficacy endpoint. 
The number and rate of hypoglycemic events (in pa tient-year of exposure) will be determined per 
treatment arm and type of hypoglycemic event (ADA Workgroup on Hypoglycemia [17]), 
according to time of occurrence {nocturnal (ie, 00:00 to 05:59 
AM; 00:00 to 07:59 AM), any time 
of the day} during the on treatment period. For each hypoglycemic event, the rate ratio, and its corresponding 95% CI, of Toujeo arm over Tresiba arm will be estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model adjusted on randomization strata of screening HbA1c (<8.0%, 8.0%) 
and randomization strata  of SU or meglitinides at screening (Yes vs No).

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Adverse events 
All adverse events will be coded to a “PT” a nd “HLGT”, “HLT” and associated primary “SOC” 
using the version of MedDRA currently in use by [CONTACT_277162]. 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) (sorted by 
[CONTACT_56496]), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order, and for each treatment arm, the number (n) and percentage 
(%) of patients experiencing at least one AE. Multip le occurrences of the same event in the same 
patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment period. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safety population within treatment arm. 
Adverse event incidence table will be provided by  [CONTACT_277163]: 
all TEAEs, all treatment emergent SAEs, a ll TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation and all TEAEs  related to local tolera bility at injection site and hypersensitivity. 
Death  
The following deaths summaries will be generated on the safety population: 
x Number (%) of patients who died by [CONTACT_6960] (TEAE, on-study, post-study*) and reasons for 
death summarized by [CONTACT_277164] 
x Death in nonrandomized patients or randomized and not treated patients 
x TEAE leading to death by [CONTACT_148274], HLGT, HLT and PT showing number (%) of patients sorted by [CONTACT_179654], HLT, and PT 
*Post-study deaths, if presented, will follow safety guideline instruction

DTSQc total treatment satisf action score (items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), ‘perceived frequency 
of hyperglycemia’ (Item 2) and ‘perceived frequency of hypoqlycemia’ (Item 3) scores (at Week 12 and Week 24 only) 
• HABS subscale scores (confidence, anxiety and avoidance) 
The change in DTSQs and HABS scores from baseline to endpoint are analyzed using an MMRM 
model similar as model used for quantitative secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Average scores at Week 12 and at Week 24 in total treatment satisfaction score, hyperglycemia 
perception and hypoglycemia perception score from DTSQc will be analyzed using an ANCOVA 
model. This model will include fixed categorical effects of treatment arm, on randomization strata of screening HbA1c (<8.0%, 8.0%) and randomization strata of SU used at screening (yes/no) as 
well as continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline score from DTSQs.

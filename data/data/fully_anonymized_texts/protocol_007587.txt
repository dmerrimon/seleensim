1.1 Purpose:  This [ADDRESS_760175] will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate an 
intervention designed to help families successfully adapt to the admission of a cognitively 
impaired relative to a RLTC facility. The Residential Care Transition Module (RC TM) provides 
6 individualized formal sessions of consultation (one -to-one and family sessions) over a [ADDRESS_760176] admitted a relative to a RLTC setting. The RCTM will 
identify individual placement stressors and enhance family caregiver s’ strategies for copi[INVESTIGATOR_578494]. In this RCT, family members who have admitted a cognitively impaired relative 
to a RLTC setting will be randomly assigned to the RCTM [( n  = 120)] or a usual care control 
condition [( n = 120)]. A  mixed methods analysis62 will be used to pursue the following aims : 
 Specific Aim 1 . Assess whether the RCTM yields statistically significant reductions in family 
members’ primary subjective stress (e.g., burden) and negative mental health outcomes 
(depressive symptoms) in the 12 months following enrollment when compared to controls;  
o Secondary Aim 1a.  Determine whether the RCTM results in greater increases in caregiver 
competence and self -efficacy when compared to controls;  
o Secondary Aim 1b.  Ascertain whether those who receive the RCTM report greater family 
involvement and visits to relatives in RLTC when compared to usual care controls;  
 Specific Aim 2 . Determine whether family members who receive the RCTM indicate 
statistically signif icant decreases in secondary role strains (perceived adjustment of the 
relative and the caregiver to RLTC placement) over a 12 -month period when compared to 
control family members;  
 Specific Aim 3 . Determine whether RCTM family members report statistically  significant 
decreases in residential care stress (e.g., improved perceptions of staff communication or staff 
support; reduced upset at having a relative in residential care; reduced negative interactions 
with relatives or staff in the facility) when compa red to family members in the usual care 
control group; and  
 Specific Aim 4 . Delineate the mechanism of action of RCTM under conditions of high and low 
success by [CONTACT_578538] (up to 30 semi -structured interviews) at the 
conclusion of th e [ADDRESS_760177] been caring for a  relative in RLTC since the onset of the COVID -19 
pandemic, and are currently reporting to us new stressors associated with COVID -19. We will

recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s health and well -being. We will use a parallel -convergent mixed methods design and 
analytic strategy, with data collected via a supplemental quantitative survey delivered at [ADDRESS_760179] focused on addressing caregivers’ challenges in adapting to COVID -19. 
Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the influence of COVID -19 on caregiver stress and mental health 
trajectories for AD/ADRD caregivers. We propose to extend the currently -administered surveys of 
caregiver stress and mental health to collect additional assessments at [ADDRESS_760180] negative 
consequences of COVID -19. We will compare trajectories of caregiver stress and well -being across 
the treatment and control groups to determine whether the RCTM provides  benefits in the 
context of COVID -19. 
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose :  
Emerging research on family caregiving and institutionalization has found that families do 
not disengage from care responsibilities following relatives’ admission s to residential long -
term care settings. Families instead remain involved in a spectrum of care activities ranging 
from instrumental activities of daily living to emotional support. Perhaps for these reasons, 
a number of studies have noted that caregiving  stress, depression, or other key outcomes 
remain stable or sometimes increase following residential long -term care (RLTC) entry for 
certain types of caregivers. A few interventions have attempted to increase family 
involvement after institutionalization, but no rigorous studies have demonstrated that these 
interventions are effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_578496].  
Persons with dementia rely heavily on informal (i.e., unpaid) sources of care, and this has a 
staggering effect on families. Currently 85% of the 5.3 million persons with Alzheimer’s 
disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in the [LOCATION_002] are cared for by [CONTACT_578540], and [ADDRESS_760181] global sense caregiving 
refers to attending to an individual’s health and daily care needs.2,3 Dementia caregiving can 
extend to managing the consequences of specific symptoms, such as behavioral disruptions. 
A well -established literature demonstrates the adverse effects of dementia care on family 
members, including impaired physical health,4-6 financial strain,7 degradation in social well -
being, and increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, or other psy chological symptoms.8,9

R21 AG026525/RCTM Feasibility and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_578497]. The research team has collaborated to 
establish a strong base of preliminary research to suppo rt the evaluation of the RCTM. 
Specifically, preliminary work on this project was supported by R21 AG026525 to [CONTACT_283804] (PI), [CONTACT_578579] (Co -I), and [CONTACT_48467] (Co -I);4-[ADDRESS_760182]. Gaugler’s research 
team first conducted focus groups at two local RLTC facilities with families and staff ( N = 48) 
to determine the need for a psychosocial prog ram for families who have admitted their 
relative to RLTC and to review an outline of potential content for the RCTM intervention. 
The focus groups lasted approximately 2 hours each and posed 4 -5 questions with follow -up 
probes. Each facility hosted two fo cus groups (one consisting of family members and 
another consisting of professional nursing staff). Participants were identified through flyers. 
These focus groups were conducted via the phone to ease participant burden.  Each group 
of 6-10 participants wa s audiotaped and results were transcribed. A content analysis was 
conducted, and a range of themes emerged that highlighted how family needs could be 
addressed through consultation following RLTC placement, including family members’ stress 
and feelings of guilt, managing the administrative paperwork related to admission, fostering 
positive staff relationships to advocate for a relative’s needs, managing the impact of staff 
turnover on family involvement with and quality of care for the relative, and managin g 
family conflict related to the placement transition. Families also indicated the need for a 
“go-to” person to provide psychosocial consultation, support, and education about/referral 
to key resources that could meet their relatives’ care needs (this was a theme that also 
emerged in the staff focus groups, along with the difficulties of establishing positive 
relationships with family due to distrust, negative stereotypes regarding RLTC, and similar 
issues). This focus group information, along with a system atic review of existing protocols 
involving family member support during and after the placement transition,42,43,46 -48,75 led to 
the development of the RCTM intervention model and a preliminary treatment manual.  
 
A feasibility study of the RCTM usin g the draft treatment manual as the principal guide to 
implementation was also conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_511713]. Reese. Fifteen Caucasian family 
members ( N = 13 daughters; age M = 54.53 years, SD = 5.29; duration of care M = 5.11 
years, SD = 2.56) of cognitively  impaired relatives who had placed their relatives in nursing 
homes or memory care units of assisted living facilities approximately a year prior to 
enrollment completed the RCTM intervention. Baseline/pre -RCTM and post -RCTM (4 -
months later) interview asse ssments were also completed. The small sample size precluded 
extensive empi[INVESTIGATOR_578498]. Several measures (such as perceived stress, guilt, and distress 
related to care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578499]) trended downward. A content analysis 
of the open -ended data collected from participants as well as the TC notes revealed several 
mechanisms of benefit including the formation of a therapeutic relationship,  provision of 
psycho -education  related to dementia and its progression, and explorations of guilt a nd 
stigma.  The results made it clear that the initial session held particular importance in that it 
allowed caregivers to fashion their own narrative related to the RLTC transition; repeatedly 
caregivers stated how surprised they were at the positive effec ts of telling their story in a 
linear and sequential manner. The TC suggested that the act of narrating the event helps to 
remove the sense of immediacy and allows caregivers to build up tolerance and copi[INVESTIGATOR_578500].

 Page 11 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/2021       Following feasibility t esting and refinement of the treatment manual, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_578501].91 A randomized controlled design was 
used ( N = 36; n = 19 in usual care control condition; n = 17 i n the RCTM treatment 
condition); participants were administered a pre -RCTM baseline survey along with 4 - and 8 -
month follow -up interviews. Participants had admitted their relatives to a RLTC an average 
of 141 days prior to the baseline interview. Twenty -nine caregivers were women and 17 
were spousal caregivers; all were Caucasian. On average, caregivers were 62.67 years of age 
and had provided care an average of 51.79 months. All RCTM counseling sessions provided 
emotional support to participating caregiver s. Twenty -six (29.6%) individual and three 
(33.3%) family counseling sessions addressed relatives’ behaviors. Approximately 40% of all 
individual sessions addressed caregivers’ issues with the relative’s facility compared with 
only one family session. Biva riate analyses of sociodemographic characteristics, caregiving 
duration, and other context of care indices found no statistically significant differences 
between the RCTM treatment and control conditions. Seven care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578502] 8 -month f ollow -up; 5 prior to the 4 -month interview and 2 prior to the 8 -month 
interview. Analyses of variance found that caregivers in the RCTM treatment group 
indicated significantly less distress on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory -Questionnaire92 at 4-
month follow up compared to caregivers in the control group ( p< 0.05). Caregivers in the 
RCTM treatment group reported less role overload at 8 months compared to usual care 
controls ( p< 0.05). Due to the small pi[INVESTIGATOR_38264], a number of findings did not achieve 
statistical significance below the p< 0.05 threshold but trended in the expected clinical 
direction ( p ≤ 0.10; role overload at 4 months; Perceived Stress Scale at 4 months;93 and 
Zarit Burden Inventory94 at 8 months). Focus groups conducted following the RCTM 
indicated that caregivers highly valued the readily available psychosocial support following 
RLTC placement. Combined, the preliminary quanti tative and qualitative data emphasize 
that the provision of skilled psychosocial support can potentially help families navigate the 
emotional distress and crises in the months following a cognitively impaired relative's 
admission to RLTC.[ADDRESS_760183] challenges meeting the needs of care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and caregivers with 
their own hea lth needs appeared particularly susceptible to high levels of burden in the 6 
months following residential long -term care (RLTC) placement. Husbands and caregivers 
with their own prior health impairments and emotional stressors were most likely to suffer 
from depression in the 12 months after a relative’s RLTC entry.23 Our research leads us to 
hypothesize that psychosocial interventions – particularly in the months immediately 
following admission – can ease the RLTC  transition for caregivers and alleviate its adverse 
outcomes such as burden and depression.  
 
2.3 Existing Literature:  Longitudinal analyses of dementia caregiving make it clear that 
caregiving does not “end” with the institutionalization of a cognitively impaired relative.10 
The high prevalence of dementia among NH residents (64% of Medicare beneficiaries in NHs 
have ADRD and 47% of all NH residents have a formally recorded d ementia diagnosis)11 
likely influences the need for ongoing family care. Family members thus remain engaged in 
the lives of institutionalized relatives.12,13 While “hands -on” technical care for ambulation 
and transferring is often assumed by [CONTACT_578541] a NH or other types of

PROTOCOL TITLE: The Residential Care Transition Module  
VERSION DATE:  2/10/2022  
 Page 12 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/2021       residential memory care settings (e.g., assisted living memory care units), family 
involvement contin ues and ranges from regular visits, to ongoing provision of more 
instrumental forms of direct care (such as transportation and financial management), to 
interaction with staff to ensure proper care delivery.12-[ADDRESS_760184] found that 
high levels of caregiving stress or depressive symptoms continue or, in some cases, increase 
with institutionalization.17-21 
Facilitating family caregivers’ RLTC transition is important, because family caregiver well -
being may influence their relative’s quality of li fe once in a residential setting. Various 
studies have emphasized that while NHs are oriented to delivering the necessary physical 
care, these facilities often fall short of providing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578503] e goal of a ‘life worth living.’25-29 Several studies imply that 
social engagement, family visits, and other types of involvement can potentially improve life 
satisfaction and health outcomes for NH or assisted living residents.30-35 These findings 
emphasize that reducing emotional distress and negative mental health outcomes and 
enhancing families’ overall perceptions of and relationships with staff can have positive 
effects on residents’ outcomes.  
 
Innovation  
The RCTM is different fr om existing evidence -based caregiver intervention models in that it 
is transition -specific; unlike most other interventions the RCTM targets a key transition in 
the dementia caregiving trajectory and as a result is a more focused and compact protocol 
than other multi -component, efficacious dementia caregiver interventions. The RCTM’s 
clinical content is specific to the needs of families attempting to adapt to the residential 
long -term care (RLTC) admission transition. The RCTM is further positioned as an in novative 
intervention when considering the state -of-the-art in transitional care management for 
older adults. Family caregivers often experience significant stress and upheaval when in the 
midst of care transitions for older relatives in need, often becaus e of the lack of 
coordination between care settings.[ADDRESS_760185] clinical 
interventions that adopt a family caregiver focus to facilitate successful residential 
transitions for older persons with cognitive impairment. The RCTM has undergone multiple 
phases of testing to develop a protocol that is clinically and conceptually tailored to 
facilitate families’ management of the RLTC transition for cognitively impaired relatives.  
 
Another innovative aspect of this proposal is the use of mixed methods to evaluate the 
RCTM. Specifically, we propose to use an embedded experimental mixed methods design.62 
Mixed methods  is generally defined as the collection and analysis of both quantitative and 
qualitative data that link these two forms of data concurrently or sequentially.63 Data 
integration can occur within the design of a single study or across multiple studies.64 Mixed 
methods research is generally used: a) to better understand a research problem by 
[CONTACT_578542]; 
and b) to obtain statistical, quantitative data from a sample and identify individuals wh o 
may expand on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_578504].65 The proposed design 
combines the collection and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized 
controlled trial design; the collect ion of “embedded” qualitative data in the proposed study

information on the mechanisms and pathways that lead to benefit for family caregivers who 
are struggling to navigate the RLTC transition.64,67 -70  
 
An additional innovation in the current proposal is the utilizatio n of a conceptual framework 
that is applicable to the RLTC placement transition for families. The conceptual model 
underlying the proposed study is the Stress Process Model for Residential Care (SPM -RC), 
developed by [CONTACT_578543]20 and based on the widely used Stress Process 
Model (SPM) for dementia caregiving (Pearlin et al.).71 The SPM offers a multidimensional, 
theoretical framework for analyzing the occurrence of stress and outcomes in the caregiving 
career.71,72 The model incorporates an appreciation for the sociodemographic context of 
care (e.g., background characteristics of the caregiver and c are recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), care demands 
(functional, cognitive, and behavioral severity of dementia), subjective stress (caregivers’ 
emotional appraisals of and reactions to care demands), resources (formal and informal 
support), and caregiver well -being (physical an d psychological indicators of caregivers’ 
global well -being). The major mechanism that helps to explain exacerbated stress is 
proliferation:72 as stress accumulates in primary stressor domains, this stress then “spreads” 
to life domains outside of the primary caregiving situation (i.e., secondary stressors) which 
then negatively influences global dimensions of dementia caregivers’ mental or physical 
health. In the SPM, psychosocial or formal resources are hypothe sized to stem the 
proliferation of stress, thereby [CONTACT_578544].  
 
The SPM -RC adds and refines several interconnected domains of Pearlin’s SPM to result in a 
model that is directly pertinent to RLTC. The SPM -RC captures th e possible changes in 
relationship processes and structures in areas such as the emotional closeness of the 
relative and family member and family members’ perceptions of difficulty when managing 
relatives’ emotional and mental status (an appraisal that may  change and expand once a 
relative is admitted to a RLTC setting; primary subjective stressors ). Family members’ 
perceptions of their relative’s adjustment to the RLTC setting can produce “secondary” role 
strains , particularly if the family member feels gu ilt or believes the placement decision is 
contrary to the wishes of the relative. With RLTC admission, an array of placement -related 
stressors may emerge ( residential care stress ). These range from establishing effective roles 
and relationships with direct  care workers or other facility staff, attempting to remain 
involved in the life of the relative in order to maintain or improve quality of life, and 
advocating for more appropriate care should families perceive that institutional care is of 
deficient qual ity.73,[ADDRESS_760187]. If family 
members perceive that their relative is not doing well, they may increase their engagement 
in advocacy, hands -on c are, or other types of involvement in order to improve their 
relative’s overall sense of well -being ( family involvement and visits ).35,46,73,74 Similarly, family 
members’ own perceptions of how they have adjusted to a relative’s placement and the 
potentially new roles they have assumed may contribute to their stress. Finally, the model 
includes contextual indices rela ted to family caregivers’ interactions with and perceptions of

 Page 14 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/2021       the RLTC setting itself. Family members’ appraisals of their involvement with and the quality 
of interactions with staff may reflect how well family members’ perceive their own – as well 
as the ir relative’s – overall adjustment to the residential care setting. In this manner, the 
SPM -RC model incorporates placement -specific stressors to better capture the experience 
of RLTC for family members, including its impact on key emotional and mental hea lth 
outcomes.  
 
Prior efforts have successfully analyzed and tested the SPM -RC model (and several 
hypothesized relationships within it) that informs the RCTM.[ADDRESS_760188] as a psychosocial resource for family members, operating on and producing beneficial 
outcomes in the key outcome domains identified by [CONTACT_396176] -RC. The RCTM topic areas are 
linked to stressors identified in the model, and its psychoeducational approach is designed 
to strengt hen family caregiver self -efficacy in these same domains. As such, we hypothesize 
reductions in primary subjective stress and negative mental health outcomes on the part of 
family caregivers (Specific Aim 1); reductions in secondary role strains (Specific Aim 2); and 
reductions in residential care stress (Specific Aim 3). Related to the predicted outcomes, we 
have – innovatively, we believe – tailored our measurement strategy to capture outcomes 
most closely associated with RLTC placement alongside more gen eral measures of stress and 
mental health. Prior research focusing on RLTC entry for dementia caregivers employ 
measures designed for at -home care situations (e.g., the Zarit Burden Interview).22,23,[ADDRESS_760189] -
placement measurements that often do not capture challenges specific to residential care 
admission for caregiving families (e.g.,  perceptions of staff support; perceived adjustment to 
the RTLC transition). The inclusion of such measures in the proposed study will help to 
advance understanding of how individualized psychoeducational and psychosocial support 
can enhance family caregiv ers adaptation to a relative’s RLTC admission. Our embedded 
evaluation strategy described earlier likewise addresses this gap.  
 
Clinical framework of the Residential Care Transition Module.  There is a demonstrable need 
for supporting family members following RLTC placement. Scholars  emphasize the 
importance of incorporating families in the provision of services and care to cognitively 
impaired older adults in residential care settings.[ADDRESS_760190] services for families are 
designed for at -home caregivers,37 and in prior intervention studies RLTC placement has 
been conceptualized as an outcome to be prevent ed or delayed. Earlier RLTC transition 
intervention protocols that sought to increase the frequency and quality of family 
involvement (e.g., reduce staff -family conflict) can be categorized into three models: group 
protocols that include peer -led support,38-[ADDRESS_760191] to weak effects in 
increasing family involvement, enhancing staff satisfaction, and improving resident well -
being.48 Although several pi[INVESTIGATOR_448998] a recently published randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) report on providing support to  families of institutionalized relatives, these protocols 
either lack sufficient rigor to support their implementation or, in the case of the RCT, did not 
result in positive outcomes for family caregivers due in part to the clinical content, delivery, 
and measurement approach selected.49,50

4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Interaction(s)  
4.1 Description:  
Residential Care Transition Module (RCTM) clinical sessions are designed to be delivered 
during the timeframe (i.e., the months following RLTC entry) when family caregivers are 
most at -risk for psychosocial distress. The RCTM incorporates psychosocial and 
psychoeducational approaches, focusing on the identification of potential stressors 
associated with RLTC placement and the development of more effective individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_578505] -efficacy within this new environment. As critical 
reviews of caregiver interventions suggest, multi -component  programs that provide some 
combination of therapeutic/social support along with training and skills -based modules 
appear most likely to improve caregiving outcomes.51,[ADDRESS_760192] families adapt to RLTC.48   
     
The RCTM includes six consultation sessions over a 4 -month period  conducted by a trained 
Transition Counselor (TC) with a primary family  caregiver (self -identified as the person most 
responsible for providing on -going assistance to the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578506]).[ADDRESS_760193] 3 
sessions are held weekly and the final 3 sessions are held monthly  [subject to 
scheduling/availability] . RCTM sessions take place either via telephone or video -based 
conference. The sessions focus on the experiences of the caregiver, the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and 
(potentially) other family members following RLTC admission. Among the objectives for 
each session are the caregiver’s acquisition of information and strategies designed to deal 
with unique issues, including distance caregiving . The sessions are designed to establish a 
therapeutic rapport with the caregiver and the family; provide a safe environment to 
explore stressors; examine fam ily relational dynamics as they relate to the RLTC placement 
decision itself as well as the roles different family members play in the life of the caregiver 
and relative in RLTC; identify new modes of communication to facilitate more effective

advocate for improved quality of care for and quality of life of their relatives in RLTC. 
Throughout the RCTM counseling process/relationship, caregivers receive constructive 
feedbac k to help achieve their goals stated at the outset of the RCTM intervention. The 
duration of each session is about  45 to 150 minutes each.  
 
The following summarizes the clinical content of the semi -structured RCTM, delivered 
across six sessions, each of which is prioritized and tailored according to the needs 
expressed by [CONTACT_18629]. Each component is designed to positively influence key outcome 
domains of RLTC admission for family caregivers: primary subjective stress; secondary role 
strain; care -related distress; and depressive symptoms (see below):  
 
Information about core questions is provided and information is tailored to respond to the 
needs of the caregiver and family and woven across the sessions. Among the questions 
often addressed include: How  does RLTC placement affect the caregiver or other family 
members participating in the counseling session?; What are the constraints and reasons for 
the way dementia care is provided in RLTCs?; How can this care be optimized?; and How can 
the family caregi ver’s voice be heard when expressing the long -term care goals of the 
relative? Critical stressors identified during the intake interview, crisis situations, and 
adaptation issues are taken into account when individualizing a “curriculum” that uses 
conversa tion, presentations and online information and support.  
 Psycho -education : Education on how dementia affects the brain and behavior, 
personality, and cognition is provided to explain the changes the relative is currently 
experiencing and may experience in the future. There is a focus on the biological 
basis for why these changes occur, emphasizing that they are not under the 
relative’s control.  
 Promotion of communication : The objective is to strengthen family members’ skills 
in understanding other family me mbers’ perspectives and to establish positive and 
collaborative relationships with RLTC staff.[ADDRESS_760194] Resolution 
and dementia -friendly activities designed to engage the PWML are included.  
 Prob lem solving : Individual and family counseling sessions help caregivers divide 
potentially overwhelming problems into manageable components and direct the 
caregiver or other family members to formal/informal services available within the 
facility and in the  outlying community (e.g., ombudsman).  
 Patient behavior management strategies : Instruction and practice focuses on 
acquisition of skills and strategies to manage reactions to unpredictable behavior [as 
utilized in evidence -based interventions for dementia  family caregivers such as the 
Savvy Caregiver Program as well as strategies provided by [CONTACT_104412]’s 
Association].53-55  
 Concrete planning:  Goals for care to optimi ze personal and socioemotional care 
assistance for relatives in RLTC are explored and strategies are developed to secure 
support for them from other family members and facility staff. These goals can also 
be made concrete in the facility’s care plan for th e relative in RLTC.67 Follow -up 
allows for refinement of the care plan.  
 Making families aware: Caregivers acquire knowledge about the rehabilitative 
treatments used in RLTCs to effectively manage dementia symptoms (e.g., 
depression, agitation, etc.) and to determine whether such treatment approaches

 Page 17 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/2021       are available and delivered in the relatives’ RLTC  setting.  Caregivers also learn about 
differences in the levels and types of care within different care settings (for example 
assisted living versus memory care).  
 Ad hoc counseling  is provided throughout the RCTM, which consists of ongoing, 
informal couns eling on the telephone, or via email with the TC at the request of the 
family caregiver. This makes it possible for the TC to respond to the effects of the 
changing nature of the disease; changes in the RLTC environment, services, and 
policies; and crises as they occur. As needed, information/resources are provided to 
participants.  
 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
 
5.1 Study Design:   
We propose to use an embedded experimental mixed methods design.62 Mixed methods  is 
generally defined as the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data 
that link these two forms of data concurrently or sequentially.63 Data integration can occur 
within the design of a s ingle study or across multiple studies.64 Mixed methods research is 
generally used: a) to better understand a research problem by [CONTACT_578545]; and b) to obtain 
statistical, quantitative data from a sample and identify individuals who may expand on the 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_578504].65 The proposed design combines the 
collection a nd analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial 
design; the collection of “embedded” qualitative data in the proposed study will occur after 
the randomized controlled trial.64, p. [ADDRESS_760195] 
of which do not adopt qualitative methods to explore processes of intervention efficacy.66 
Specifically, qualitative components will provide more compr ehensive information on the 
mechanisms and pathways that lead to benefit for family caregivers who are struggling to 
navigate the RLTC transition.64,67 -70  
 
5.2 Study Procedures:  
Recruitment .  At various outreach events, a Documentation of Permission form will be 
utilized to provide the PI [INVESTIGATOR_578507]. Following completion of this form, a research coordinator will 
initiate email, telephone, or mail contact [CONTACT_578546]. Alternatively, interested 
research participants can reach out to the study team directly to initiate contact. During 
initial contacts with potential participants, the coordinator will describ e the RCTM 
intervention, explain study procedures such as voluntary participation, randomization, and 
what the usual care control condition includes. A telephone and email script will be utilized.  
More information about recruitment can be found under secti on 12.0 “Recruitment 
Methods”.

each potential participant whether they have any questions about the consent form or 
study details. Since we are improving our procedures, this more detailed consent process 
will begin after approval of the protocol (v 11.09.2020). During the parent stud y and the 
supplement, we provided potential participants an overview of the project prior to 
initiating the consent process, which we will continue to do.  
 
After an overview of the project has been described, highlights of the consent form will be 
describ ed and any questions from the potential participant will be answered, then a signed 
informed consent will be obtained from the eligible family caregiver. This consent will be 
offered electronically, over the phone or via mail. Online consent forms will be 
administered via the secure University of Minnesota Qualtrics survey application. 
Participants will be provided with a copy of their completed consent form.  See more details 
on the consent process in section 22.1 “Consent process”.

research assistants will administer follow -up surveys to enrolled caregivers at 4 months, 8 
months, and 12 -month time -points. Unless the research team is aware that the participant 
is bereaved, staff send (or call in attempt to com plete) the disposition survey 7 days (+/ - 7

sent 4 months (+/ - 7 days) following the receipt of the previous survey or within 7 days of 
receiving the disposition status. If the date a survey is scheduled to be sent falls on a 
weekend/ho liday, the survey send date is moved to the next business day (and the survey is 
sent +/ - 7 days from that date). Participants are given several reminders to facilitate survey 
completion. [Please note: Survey time -points are calculated following the date o f receipt of 
the previous survey (or if the previous survey was not returned, surveys time -points are 
calculated using the appropriate time interval following the receipt date of the prior survey). 
Based on this, if participants are not prompt in survey co mpletion, subsequent surveys are 
pushed back accordingly.]  In addition to the 4, 8, and 12 -month surveys, additional surveys 
may be sent if the participant is participating in surveys related to the COVID supplement. 
These supplemental survey time points are calculated according to the protocol -based 
survey sched ule (i.e. 1, 3 months) following the sent or receipt date of the previous survey 
as described above. Data will be collected regarding any caregiver status changes or 
bereavements. Surveys will continue to be administered whether the person with ADRD 
moves to another setting or passes away. A modified survey will be administered if the 
person with ADRD passes away during the course of the study. For participants still enrolled 
in the RCTM study in May 2020, additional COVID -19 related questions will be inclu ded in 
follow -up surveys.  
 
Note: Depending on the survey type and  time -point , the due date for surveys administered to 
primary caregivers that enrolled with other family members is either calculated separately or 
is dependent upon the receipt of the other family members’ surveys. Specifically, due dates 
for treatment fidelity surveys and routine 4 -month surveys are calculated based upon the 
receipt of the previous survey  time -point  by [CONTACT_259457]; other surveys are calculated 
based upon the receipt o f that individual’s survey only.  
 
We will take several steps to address attrition bias. If ADRD caregivers wish to withdraw 
from the RCTM treatment group, but agree to continue with follow -up interviews/surveys, 
we will continue routine data collection without counseling.  
 
Several steps will enhance study retention. Baseline and follow -up surveys are administered 
in a format that is convenient to ADRD caregivers (online, telephone, or mail 
survey/questionnaire formats). Baseline interviews are anticipate d to take no more than 60 
minutes; follow -up interviews are expected to take approximately 45 minutes. Quarterly 
follow -up calls by [CONTACT_578549] “how things are going” and will offer the 
opportunity for controls to feel connected to the overall study. Following completion of the 
final [ADDRESS_760201] newsletter 
will be sent to all participants. We will also pay participants $25 following the completion of 
each baseline, 4 -, 8-, and 12 -month and final qualitative interview (if selected). Payments 
will be made using a pre -paid debit card, using the Greenphire ClinCard system.

will ask caregivers to rate their experiences with various facets of the TC’s psychosocial 
counseling. This checklist will be administered at each follow -up to caregivers who are 
randomly assigned to receive the RCTM intervention.  
 
Strategies to assess treatment enactment will determine how participants apply the 
counseling content to their everyday care situations. Multiple open -ended questions will be 
included on the [ADDRESS_760204] described above to all care givers in the RCTM treatment 
condition at the 4 -, 8-, and 12 -month interview intervals. Surveys are sent within 7 days of 
their scheduled send date (send dates falling on a weekend/holiday are moved to the next

reminders to facilitate survey completion as needed. [Note: Survey time -points are 
calculated 4 months following receipt of previous treatment fidelity survey (or 4 months 
following the sent date of the previous survey, if the previous survey was not returned). 
Based on this, if participants are not prompt in survey completion, subsequent surveys are 
pushed back accordingly. In order to maintain blinding of staff involved in administering the 
routine follow -up sur veys, the treatment fidelity surveys are administered separately from 
the routine follow up surveys and thus the timing of these surveys are calculated without 
regard to receipt of the routine follow up survey.]  
 
The open -ended responses will provide quali tative data as to the reasons why family 
caregivers felt the counseling recommendations of the RCTM were or were not appropriate, 
whether the recommendations were helpful, which elements of the RCTM caregivers used 
and how effective they found them, and wh at barriers or facilitators exist when

Interviews will be conducted via telephone and digitally recorded. Audio recordings will be 
transcribed by a professional transcription service into a Microsoft Word file which will then 
be uploaded to nVivo10  for subsequent analysis. If the participant does not give permission 
for interview to be recorded, interviewer will ask permission to take notes. If permission is

The four key  components of the additional data collection (depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1) are:

This schedule integrates the proposed additional surveys into the ongoing data collection schedule

occasions to the extent possible. The proposed schedule allows for at least three assessments of 
caregivers’ stress, well -being, and COVID -19-specific experiences after  the onset of the pandemic, 
which will facilitate the planned longitudinal modeling. For post -COVID -19-onset survey 
assessments, we propose measurement intervals of 0, 1, and 4 months in order to capture 
caregivers’ responses to the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -changing condit ions that are occurring early in the pandemic 
period, as well as longer -term adjustment across several months.

Administrative Supplement Data & Measures  
The supplemental surveys administered aft er the onset of the COVID -[ADDRESS_760214] of a questionnaire focused specifically 
on AD/ADRD caregivers’ and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ COVID -[ADDRESS_760215] caregivers’ and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ experiences.  
● Care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s residential status. The questionnaire will assess whether the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578510], the approximate capacity of the RLTC, and whether the 
care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578511].   
● RLTC measures to mitigate COVID -19. Participants will complete a checklist of possible 
measures that their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s RLTC facility may h ave taken to prevent the spread of 
COVID -19 or mitigate its effects on residents (e.g., limiting visitors, canceling group 
activities, facilitating video or phone contact [CONTACT_578551]).    
● Care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s health status.  Participants will report whet her their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_135991] a 
known COVID -19 diagnosis, has experienced symptoms of COVID -19, and has any pre -
existing health conditions that may contribute to heightened risk of serious infection.  
● RLTC COVID -19 status.  Items will assess whether the RLTC facility has known positive 
COVID -19 cases and the facility’s plans for management of COVID -19 cases.  
● Caregiver’s health, employment, and family status.  Caregivers will be asked whether they 
have been diagnosed with COVID -19, or are experiencing symptoms. They will also be 
asked about their employment status, and responsibilities for caring for other family 
members aside from the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
● Perceptions of RLTC crisis management. This portion of the questionnaire will ask 
caregivers to evaluate the RLTC facility’s handling of the situation, in terms of

● Caregiver -Care rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_578512] . Participants will report the methods they have 
used to remain in contact [CONTACT_578552][INVESTIGATOR_841], the frequency of contact, and the 
effects of any changes in contact [CONTACT_578553].  
● Staying or leaving RLTC. Caregiver s will be asked if they have decided to move their care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578513].  
 
We developed a semi -structured interview protocol for in -depth evaluation of participants’ 
experiences related to COVID -[ADDRESS_760216] used. Interview questions will prompt 
participants to discuss any COVID -19-specific practices that their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s RLT C has 
implemented and how these practices have affected the caregiver and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Participants 
who received support from the RCTM Transition Counselor through the pandemic period will also 
be asked how the RCTM was or was not helpful in copi[INVESTIGATOR_578514] -19. Interview questions will 
be modified by [CONTACT_578554][INVESTIGATOR_578515].

most involved in visiting and providing assistance to the person with memory loss (or who 
share the primary caregiving role equally). For the caregiver to participate, the care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578516] a RLTC setting (e.g. assisted living, nursing home, memory care, 
or other residential long -term care setting) and have received a physician’s diagnosis of 
ADRD. Family caregivers must be English speaking, 21 years of age or older , and not 
participating in any other one -to-one psychosocial consultation specifically for caregiving 
(support group participation is not a deterrent to enrollment, nor is general counseling not 
specific to caregiving). Family caregivers on psychotropic me dications, such as anti -
depressants or anti -psychotics, will be eligible if they have remained on a stable dosage for

All participants in the above table that are listed as “included but not the focus” could be 
included in the study by [CONTACT_3364]. However, these vulnerable groups are not sought out 
during recruitment and we do not ask potential participants if they belong to one of the 
above groups or not. Thus, extra safeguards are not put in place to protect these groups 
since we would not know if they were included in the research or not. Given our study 
population of interest, it is unlikely for participants to be a part o f the groups listed as 
“included but not the focus,” besides adults lacking the capacity to consent or have a 
diminished capacity to consent which is addressed below.

11.1 Number of Participants to be Consented:  
● Parent study: 240 primary caregivers  
● Administrative supplement: 100 caregivers  
12.0 Recruitment Methods  
12.1 Recruitment Process: At various outreach events, a Documentation of Permission form will 
be utilized to provide the PI [INVESTIGATOR_578507]. Following completion of this form, a research coordinator will 
initiate email, telephone, or mail contact [CONTACT_578546].  
Alternatively, interested research participants can reach out to the study team directly to 
initiate contact. During initial contacts with potential participants, the coordinator will 
describe  the RCTM intervention, explain study procedures such as voluntary participation, 
randomization, and what the usual care control condition includes. A telephone and email 
script will be utilized.  
Participants for the supplement will be drawn from participa nts in the original RCTM parent 
study. Caregivers who are eligible to take part in the supplemental assessments will receive 
an invitation to complete additional surveys, which will provide information about the 
supplemental study aims and procedures.  
12.2 Source of Participants: [CONTACT_283805] has created a University of Minnesota Caregiver Registry 
that includes family and professional caregivers who have participated in his free annual 
community education conference, “Caring for a Person with Memory Loss” (C PWML).

 Page 30 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/[ADDRESS_760225]. Gaugler is a member of the Minnesota Care Options Network. To supple ment Registry -
based recruitment efforts, we will ask ‘facility liaisons’ (e.g., administrator, director of 
nursing, or director of social services) to assist with recruitment efforts.  Initially, facility 
liaisons will be asked to advertise monthly presenta tions that will be conducted by [CONTACT_578556] ([CONTACT_283805], the TC, or research coordinators). 
These presentations will introduce the RCTM to interested family members. Following each 
presentation, the evaluation team will cir culate a sign -up sheet for those interested in 
participating in the project. In addition, facility liaisons can post flyers in select areas of 
facilities that are frequented by [CONTACT_578557]/or distribute 
announcements in the facility ne wsletter and web page. Finally, facility liaisons will be asked 
to contact [CONTACT_578558]’ permission for [CONTACT_283805], the TC, or research coordinators to contact [CONTACT_578559].   
 
We will also ask direct care providers in the Registry to identify ADRD caregivers of diverse 
ethnic or racial origin and geographic location who are not in the Registry. These 
recruitment efforts will be facilitated by [CONTACT_578560] (MBA) and the 
Minnesota -North Dakota Alzheimer’s Association regional office (see Letters of Support). 
The MBA will help us promote this study through Area Agencies on Aging, many of which 
serve ethnic and racially diverse older adults as w ell rural ADRD caregivers. To further 
facilitate these efforts, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a number of free, community presentations about 
the RCTM throughout the Minneapolis/St. Paul and outlying rural areas seeking to recruit 
underrepresented ADRD caregivers.  
 
IRB-approved information sheets, flyers, and study materials will be shared at various 
community events, including events such as Minnesota’s Farm Fest and the Minnesota State 
Fair.  
 
In addition to the above methods of recruitment, we will also recruit in such a way where 
interested parties can reach out to our research team directly, such as e -letters sent out by 
[CONTACT_104412]’s Disease Education and Referral program of the National Institute on Aging. 
Additional recruitment is conducted through the follow ing IRB -approved advertisements: a 
radio announcement, periodic newspaper advertisements in local circulars in various states; 
project listings on CTSI StudyFinder and Clinicaltrials.gov; the University of Minnesota School 
of Public Health website; Banner Health’s Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry (including a study 
listing, geotargeted e -mails, Facebook posts), and via Facebook advertisements.  A Families

For the COVID -19 administrative supplement, participants will be recruited from among 
current and previous participants in the parent RCTM study.  
12.3 Identification of Pot ential Participants: Please see above.   
12.4 Recruitment Materials: Please see above.  
12.5 Payment:  
Participants will be paid $25 following the completion of each baseline, 4 -, 8-, and 12 -month 
and final qualitative interview (if selected). These same payments are provided for the 
administrative supplement. Payments will be made using a pre -paid debit card, using the 
Greenphire Clincard system.  
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Staff may become aware of participants who have potential memory concerns through 
study interactions, such as phone calls by [CONTACT_578561]. 
When this type of participant is identified, the research coordinator will call the 
participant and determine if they are able to consent to participation. To do so, a brief 
summary of the consent form will be read to the participant, then the research 
coordinator will administer the UBACC (UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent). 
Please see details in section 22.6 - “Cognitively Impaired Adults, or adults with 
fluctuating or  diminished capacity to consent ” for more information on administering the 
UBACC. If the participant scores under 14.5, then we will withdraw them from the study 
and therefore not ask them to complete any additional surveys. Participants in the 
treatment group who do not pass the capacity to consent screener will be offered the 
opportun ity to  continue  contact [CONTACT_578562], if they desire, even if they 
are withdrawn from the study.  This will ensure continued support for any participants 
who had planned to continue their contact [CONTACT_578563], but are no longer eligi ble 
to participate in surveys.  We will report participants who are withdrawn for this reason 
along with their UBACC scores to the IRB as an RNI within 5 business days of the capacity 
to consent call with the participant. This data will also be reported in the annual data 
reports on participant safety as part of the data safety monitoring plan (see plan below).  
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  
In instances where ADRD caregivers wish to withdraw from the study, we will attempt to 
determine the reason for study withdr awal and conduct necessary documentation (RNI, 
tracking forms, etc.). Withdrawn participants will not be contact[CONTACT_578564].  
 
13.3 Termination Procedures:  
There is no intention to terminate any participant’s participation in the research stud y, 
however if this were to occur, the procedures that would be carried out would be similar 
to those if the participant requested to withdraw, or was lost to follow up. Data from 
participants who were terminated would be used up until the point of their te rmination.

14.0 Risks to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Since the study involves no invasive procedures, there will be no physical risks to study  
participants. The consideration of need is potentially stressful, and thus there are  possible 
psychological risks for the caregiver. However, the research team has  considerable 
experience providing psychosocial support to dementia caregivers on  various protocols and 
serious psychological risks are unlikely to occur based on this  experience. The potential 
social or legal risks for the participants relate only to possible  violations of confidentiality. 
Given the procedures outlined below, such risks are highly  unlikely.  
 
The experience of the research team and the exclusion of caregivers with serious  psychiatric 
illness will minimize the possibility of psychological risks. The unlikelihood of  such problems 
is evident from the absence of any clinically significant problems during the past [ADDRESS_760226]. Gaugler. With the caregiver’s  permission, 
we will then contact [CONTACT_283778]  (e.g. , the 
Alzheimer’s Association). Based on the research team’s experience working  with their 
caregiving families, we expect very few or no such instances to occur. If a  member of the 
research team does identify neglect or other potentially inappropriate  care  practices, Adult 
Protective Services will be notified to protect the rights of  persons with dementia and their 
families.  
 
All information obtained from the participants will remain strictly confidential and will  not 
be released except at the express written request of the study participant. All  electronic 
data will be maintained in Qualtrics, the Secure Computing Environment,  secure Academic 
Health Center project folder, and in Box. All data on [CONTACT_283805]’s  computer in D351 Mayo 
Building and the rese arch staff’s computers (also located in  D351 Mayo Building) are 
encrypted and protected by [CONTACT_578565]. Gaugler and the 
research team.  
 
Research data will be maintained on the Academic Health Center secure project folder  for 
appr oximately 2 -3 years which is the time anticipated it will take to disseminate any and all 
research papers or presentations from these data. Similarly, paper forms of the  data will be

17.0 Statistical Considerations  
17.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
Analysis of Specific Aims [ADDRESS_760227] caregiver outcomes.103,104 Multilevel 
analysis approaches are available that support growth curve modeling. In this context, 
growth curve modeling is an example of a 2 -stage modeling process consisting of 1) a 
within -subjects model across time, and 2) a between -subjects model that incorporates 
caregiver and person with ADRD covariates.105,106 The primary independent variable in the 
proposed investigation c onsists of an indicator variable for random assignment into the 
RCTM treatment condition or the attention care control. [SAS (version 9.4) Proc Mixed107] 
will be used to conduct these analyses, as it supports multilevel and growth curve modeling 
procedures.  
 
Our proposed analyses will provide in -depth tests of Specific Aims 1 to 3 (i.e., rates of 
change in primary subjective stress, secondary role strains, residential care stress, and 
caregiver depres sive symptoms) over a 12 -month period. In one set of outcome evaluations, 
the baseline value will be included as a covariate, and time will be “centered” at [ADDRESS_760228] different 4 -, 8-, 
and 12 -month change trajectories, or an RCTM treatment*time interaction effect. After 
establishing that the individual growth parameter estimates have significant v ariance 
around the mean trajectories of change in key dependent variables, an RCTM treatment vs. 
control group indicator will be added as the key independent variable to predict intercepts 
and rates of change in outcomes. Additional analyses will determine  if covariates (e.g., 
context of care indicators, primary objective stressors, and resources) significantly vary 
across the RCTM treatment and control groups at baseline and over time via growth curve 
modeling procedures. If statistically significant varia tions between the RCTM treatment and 
control groups are found, initial status and rate of change parameters for these covariates 
will be included in all tests to provide further statistical control.

In addition to analyses of secondary  Aims 1a and 1b (which will mirror the Specific Aims 1 -3 
analyses described above), empi[INVESTIGATOR_578517] 
(e.g., frequency and duration of counseling sessions) will be included in growth curve 
models as a series of post -hoc Specific Aims 1, 2, and 3 analyses. These analyses will explore 
the effects of variations in RCTM utilization on the outcomes hypothesized above. [A series 
of mediational models will also be tested examining some of the hypothesized pathways of 
the SPM -RC as described in the conceptualization of the proposed project (e.g., whether 
RCTM assignment mediates the empi[INVESTIGATOR_578518] -related stressors and 
more global psychological and emotional outcomes on the part of family caregivers) . As 
detailed by [CONTACT_578566], mediational models appropriate 
for longitudinal data will be utilized.108 These analyses will explore the empi[INVESTIGATOR_578519]’s effi cacy or lack thereof.]  
 
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_760229]. Garcia (Co -Investigator) and the research assistants 
will independently develop coding categories together with descriptors (via hand -coding 
and NVivo) and will develop a shared coding scheme that will reflect the primary categories 
of the transcript ion. Through repetition of this procedure, a consensus perspective on 
appropriate coding categories and themes will be modified and developed. These themes 
will provide insights as to the RCTM’s implementation and use (i.e., treatment 
fidelity/process eval uation) and mechanisms of benefit (i.e., semi -structured interview 
embedded component).  
 
Grounded theory techniques described by [CONTACT_578567]111 and Strauss and Corbin109 will guide  the 
analyses of qualitative data in the treatment fidelity/process evaluation procedures and 
Specific Aim 4. These approaches allow participants to construct meanings, perceptions, and 
behaviors from their own vantage points. All open -ended data collected  will be first read by 
[CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_142041], and the research assistants to identify textual elements that emerge 
repeatedly (i.e., codes); these codes will then be clustered into larger categories that are 
later used to construct major thematic elements fro m the text (with the use of nVivo [ZIP_CODE] 
analytic software).  
 
During weekly meetings in the analysis phase of the proposed project, the PI, [CONTACT_142041], and 
the research assistants will discuss their own identified codes to reach a consensus about 
specific codes, categories, and themes that emerge from the qualitative data (these 
decisions will be noted in an audit trail). In addition, patterns that link particular themes will 
be identified and discussed i n successive meetings between the PI, [CONTACT_142041], and the 
research assistants to identify more complex processes of RCTM use or RCTM’s pathways to 
benefit. During monthly team meetings, the development of codes, categories, and themes 
will be reviewed with  the other Co -Investigators to yield any additional input into these 
project components. The multiple team meetings and discussions will allow for an 
exploration of alternative interpretations of the qualitative data and will also provide a

 Page 36 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/[ADDRESS_760236] aim (examining COVID -19-related experiences among caregivers with a care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_578506]), we will use a parallel -convergent mixed methods design to integrate 
qualitative and quantit ative data about participants' COVID -19-specific experiences. We will 
calculate descriptive statistics for the measures of COVID -19-specific experiences, and use 
appropriate correlational methods to examine the relationship between key COVID -19 
experiences  (e.g., having a confirmed positive case in the relative's RLTC facility; removing a 
relative from the RLTC facility; perceptions of the RLTC's crisis response effectiveness) and 
caregivers' stress and mental health. In addition, we will use thematic analy sis techniques 
developed by [CONTACT_578569] -structured interviews and 
open -ended survey responses relating to caregivers' challenges and copi[INVESTIGATOR_578524] -19. These open -ended responses will provide insights regardi ng novel challenges that 
are currently emerging for caregivers, and reveal which issues are perceived as most 
important and urgent from caregivers' perspectives. All open -ended data will be read by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_578525] s within the text (i.e., codes). These 
codes will be refined through an iterative process of weekly discussion and adjustment of 
the coding scheme. Decisions will be noted in an audit trail to enhance transparency of the 
coding process. Codes will be clust ered into broader overarching themes that reflect key 
insights. Additional mixed methods analyses will involve cross -tabulating the thematic codes 
with the quantitative data on caregivers' COVID -[ADDRESS_760237] how and why caregivers are able to cope with COVID -19 related 
challenges.  
 
For our second aim (evaluating the effects of COVID -19 on caregiver stress), we will use 
latent growth curve modeling to estimate trajectories of change in caregiver stress over 
time. Latent growth curve modeling is a structural modeling approach to longitudinal 
analysis that can accommodate individually -varying measurement occasions. With up to 
seven waves of data per participant, we will be able to estimate nonlinear growth 
trajectories. We will examine change in caregivers' primary subjective stress, residential  care 
stress, and depressive symptoms, and will center our longitudinal analyses around March 
13, 2020, the date when COVID -[ADDRESS_760238] aim (determining whether RCTM treatment group participant s are more 
resilient to negative psychosocial effects of COVID -19), we will incorporate a time -invariant 
covariate reflecting treatment or control group membership into the latent growth curve 
models for caregiver outcomes. This will allow us to compare th e trajectories for the 
treatment and control groups to determine whether the RCTM intervention affected change 
in caregiver stress and mental health before and after the onset of the pandemic. We will 
also conduct sensitivity analyses that incorporate meas ures of treatment group participants’ 
contact [CONTACT_578570] -19 pandemic, to distinguish 
the effects of current support via RCTM from the potential protective effects of having 
completed the intervention prior to the p andemic.  
 
Statistical analyses used will include calculation of frequencies, bivariate correlations, t -
tests, and chi -square tests in order to describe participants' COVID -19-related experiences.

17.2 Power Analysis:  
Determination of Sample Size   
Intensive longitudinal analysis procedures (multilevel regression analyses of outcome and 
growth curve modeling) will be utilized to capi[INVESTIGATOR_578526]. The number of ADRD caregivers to be 
enrolled to address study hypotheses was determined using power analysis procedures that 
take i nto account the hierarchical analytic design of the study.99 In this framework, the 
researcher identifies the Type I error rate (e.g., p < .05) to differentiate between a null and 
alternative test hypothesis, a suitable level of statistical power (.80 is considered an 
excellent power value), and the expected difference between the two study groups in order 
to determine the number of ADRD c aregivers to enroll into the project. [ We sought a sample 
size that would be sufficient to detect a group difference of 0.[ADDRESS_760239] sizes that we identified in our preliminary efficacy trial. This is considered 
to be a “ medium” effect size100 and is a reasonable benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of a 
behavioral intervention in comparison to a usual care control condition. We also used a 
Bonferroni adjusted Type I error rate of .0125 ( .05/4) to accommodate up to 4 primary 
outcome variables (primary subjective stress; secondary role strain; residential care stress; 
caregiver depressive symptoms), and we allowed for a conservative 10% loss to follow -up. 
With these specifications, an enrol led sample size of [ADDRESS_760240] caregivers (120 in each 
group ) was sufficient to provide adequate statistical power. After attrition, this sample si ze 
will give us .[ADDRESS_760241] size could apply to covariate -adjusted 
mean differences at a particular follow -up point, or two line ar slope differences of change 
across time between the intervention and control conditions.]    
 
As noted in various recommendations for mixed methods sampling, 30 -40 participants is 
considered an adequate sample size for semi -structured interview protocol s as proposed 
here.101,102 As “sample size“ in qualitative research is based more on the richness and depth 
of open -ended data collected, it is possible to achieve the goals of t he post -randomized 
controlled evaluation embedded component with a smaller number of semi -structured 
interviews. Given the expected number of ADRD caregivers in the RCTM treatment 
condition, we decided on 30 semi -structured interviews to ensure the richnes s of the 
qualitative data collected.  
 
17.3 Statistical Analysis: Please see data analysis plan.  
17.4 Data Integrity: Several steps will be taken to ensure data quality. The psychometric 
properties of the study measures are generally well -established; however, additi onal steps 
will be taken to ensure the reliability and validity of the study measures. For example, 
internal reliability will be established with Cronbach's alpha (α) estimates for each measure 
and subscale. These procedures will help to establish the psyc hometric qualities of each tool 
beyond their utilization in prior study. Each outcome variable will be examined to determine 
if skewness exists or outliers are present. Normal probability plots and histograms of each

variables must have near -normal distributions in order to be included in subsequent models. 
If the outcome variables are not normally distributed, the original variables can be subjected

20.2 Data Safety Monitoring.  
A data monitoring safety plan (DMSP) that includes a data safety and monitoring officer is

necessary.  
 
The main activities of the DMSP will be as follows (taken from National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases guidelines):  
1. Review of interim and cumulative data for any evidence of study -related adverse events 
(AEs);  
2. Review of interim/cumulative data for evidence of efficacy of the intervention;  
3. Review of data quality, completeness, and timeliness;  
4. Review the adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, including 
those related to the participation of women and minorities;  
5. Review adherence to the protocol;  
6. Review factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of 
the data (such as protocol violations, unmasking, etc.); and  
7. Identification of factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic 
developments that may impa ct participant safety or the ethics of the study.  
 
Safety reports. In addition to producing administrative reports on an annual basis to the DMO, [CONTACT_283804] will generate annual safety reports that will list adverse events, serious events, 
unexpected even ts, events related to or associated with the intervention, and the potential 
causality of the intervention to the event for each participant. If the research team becomes 
aware of an adverse event or unanticipated problem occurring while a participant is e nrolled in 
the study (from consent through the participant’s final data collection), the event will be 
documented and/or reported per the protocol below. Events will be documented/reported as 
adverse events per the protocol if they meet one of the followin g criteria: a participant alerts 
study staff of a new or worsening health problem that causes the participant to 1) be unable to 
perform their daily routine, 2) seek medical care (provider visit, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], residential care 
placement, etc.), or 3) ta ke a new medication. Conditions existing prior to study enrollment that 
have not worsened/changed will not be considered adverse events and will not be 
documented/reported. Per the University of Minnesota IRB guidelines, all events or information 
that indi cates a new or increased risk, or a safety issue, will be promptly reported.

 Page 44 of 55 Template  Revised On: 11/1/2021       Taken from earlier National Institutes of Mental Health policy on Data and Safety Monitoring in 
Clinical Trials, the definition of each event is as follows:  
Adverse event.  Any unt oward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal labor atory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the participants’ involvement in research, whether or not considered 
related to participation in the research.  
Serious adverse event.  Any adverse experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or  require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372203] a serious adverse experience when based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
and they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
Unexpected.  Any adverse ex perience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the [protocol or consent documents].  
Related to (or associated with) the intervention. There is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience may have be en caused by [CONTACT_25234].  
Causality.  A reasonable possibility that the product is etiologically related to the adverse 
event. Causality assessment includes, for example, assessment of temporal relationships, 
dechallenge/rechallenge information, associ ation with (or lack of association with) 
underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, plausibility, etc.  
 
Survey responses regarding health information will not be considered adverse events, unless 
otherwise communicated to the study s taff. [Note: Medical events or emergencies of a non -
participant will not be considered/documented as adverse events].  Regardless of the 
classification of an event (adverse event versus serious adverse event), only those events 
determined to be potentially  related to the participant’s involvement in research will be reported 
to IRB promptly. All other adverse events reported to study staff by [CONTACT_578572]. Any participant deaths will also be promptl y reported, 
regardless of the cause.  
 
In the instance of an adverse event, [CONTACT_283805] and/or the study team will classify whether the 
event is unexpected, adverse, or seriously adverse, whether the event is unexpected or related to 
the intervention, and what potentially caused the event. Per the protocol, [CONTACT_283805] will review 
the data routinely and will alert both the DMO as well as NIA as needed if these events occur.  
 
All AEs (following consent) will be collected on an adverse event form, in electro nic format. AEs 
experienced by a participant during a study procedure (i.e. intervention/survey) and are 
considered potentially related to the participant’s involvement in research will be reported within 
5 days of discovery to the University of Minnesota IRB (per the University’s IRB procedures) and 
annually to the NIA, DMO, and IRB in data monitoring reports.

has a possible relationship to the study, it will be reported in expedited fashion (within 24 hours of 
the team’s knowledge of a participant’s death) to the University of Minnesota IRB, the NIA 
Program Officer, and to the DMO. A written SAE report will be submitted soon thereafter.  
 
No adverse ev ents are expected to be related to study involvement. However, due to the nature 
of our study population, possible adverse events (i.e. general medical events and/or emergencies) 
may occur during the time a participant is enrolled in the study. These event s will be documented 
and/or reported according to the protocol.  
 
[CONTACT_283805]  will present the safety report to the DMO to ensure that there are no negative effects 
of the treatment. The DMO will review the safety reports annually to ensure that the proper 
procedure was followed and to identify any potential trends in the data. [CONTACT_578581] will present 
the safety reports to NIA if adverse events occur.

describ ed and any questions from the potential participant will be answered, then a signed 
informed consent will be obtained from the eligible family caregiver. This consent will be 
offered electronically, over the phone or via mail. Online consent forms will be 
administered via the secure University of Minnesota Qualtrics survey application. 
Participants will be provided with a copy of their completed consent form.  
 
Due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_760249] copy records of signed consent forms will not be 
maintained at D351 Mayo. However, records of signed consent forms will be saved on the 
University of Minnesota secure server. For this reason, staff are unable to sign online 
consent forms.  
The modality of consent will determine who signs the consent form, as detailed below:  
 Online consent form: only the participant signs  
 Phone (verbal) consent form: only the staff member signs  
 Mail consent form: both the participant and the staff member sign  
The online and verbal consent forms in Qualtrics will only display the approp riate signature 
[CONTACT_578578]. As before, once consent is obtained, participants will be 
emailed or mailed a copy of their completed consent form.  
 
For the COVID -19 administrative supplement , participants will be recruited from among 
current and previous participants in the parent RCTM study.  
 
Previously -enrolled participants:  For caregivers who have previously completed the 12 -
month parent RCTM survey, research staff will reach out by [CONTACT_648], email, or mail to invite 
caregivers to re -enroll in the study to complete three additional surveys.  We will describe 
the contents and ti ming of these additional surveys, and invite caregivers to participate.  
Previously completed participants who are interested in participating in the additional 
survey(s) for the COVID -focused supplement will complete a brief screening survey prior to 
re-enrollment, including items assessing bereavement.  Caregivers who are eligible and 
agree to re -enroll will provide informed consent, and will receive the additional surveys 
according to the same procedures used for the parent study surveys.  
 
Semi -structure d interviews:  We will select a purposive sample of approximately 20 
participants (split evenly among the treatment and control group) to invite for a semi -
structured interview to investigate their COVID -[ADDRESS_760250] reported a high  degree 
and a low degree of perceived preparedness from their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s RLTC, participants

disease exposure.  We will reach out to the selected participants to provide information 
about the interview and invite them to participate.  Those who are interested will provide

information will not be disclosed, or the research involves deception): N/A 
22.3 Waiver of Written/Signed Documentation of Consent (w hen written/signed consent will not 
be obtained):  
As mentioned, for the COVID -19 administrative supplement, participants will be recruited 
from among current and previous participants in the parent RCTM study.  
Currently -enrolled participants:  We will invite caregivers who remain currently -enrolled in 
the parent study to extend their participation with additional surveys.  Research staff will 
reach out by [CONTACT_648], email, or mail to describe the contents of the additional surveys and 
the timing of  these additional assessments, and to invite participants to participate.  
Caregivers will receive an information sheet describing the additional surveys, as well as 
the original RCTM consent form if they have questions.  Those who agree to take part in 
the additional surveys will then receive the additional surveys according to the same 
procedures used for the parent study surveys. We request a waiver of documentation of 
consent for these participants, as they are still currently enrolled in the parent RCT M study, 
and the additional surveys they will be invited to complete present no more than minimal 
risk.

22.6 Cognitively Impaired Adults, or adults with fluctuating or diminished capacity to consent:  
Although we do not purposively recruit cognitively impaired adults, d ue to the longevity  of 
the study, staff may become aware of participants who have pot ential memory concerns 
through study interactions such as phone calls by [CONTACT_578573]. When this type of participant is identified, the research coordinator will call the 
participant and determine if they are able to consent t o participation. To do so, a brief 
summary of the consent form will be read to the participant, then the research coordinator 
will administer the UBACC (UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent). In accordance 
with the UBACC administration instructions , if a participant does not correctly answer an 
item, the interventionist or research coordinator may repeat and discuss information from 
the consent form relevant to that item, and then repeat the item for up to three trials.  A 
score of 14.[ADDRESS_760251] with the counselor, but are no longer eligible to participate in

VERSION 1.1   5(33) 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
A horizontal loss of some 15% of the original width of the alveolar ridge already occurs 
in the first 6 –[ADDRESS_1083390] 6 months equals about 1.2 mm whi ch is 
about 11 –22% of the original height (1). With physiological loss of hard and soft tissu e 
following tooth extraction, the conditions deteriorate for proper axial alignment of the 
implant and aesthetically pleasing prosthetic treatment (2, 3).  
To minimize alveolar atrophy in the course of wound healing, method has been 
described that is summarized under the terms “ridge preservation”. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_787518]/or covering it 
with a membrane . When a tooth is extracted atraumatically  without raising a flap the 
bone graft substitute can be plugged by a collagen plug. The primary objective of ridge 
preservation is preserving the alveolar ridge volume. A systematic literature analysis 
shows that ridge preservation procedures are effective. With ridge preservation 
procedures, alveolar atrophy in the first 6 months after tooth extraction is significantly 
lower than atrophy in non -treated control groups (4). 
Evidence -based reviews have shown positive outcomes using a broad range of grafting 
materials, including autogenous bone, allografts, and xenografts in ridge preservation 
procedures (5, 6). Synthetic bone grafting materials are made from mineral raw 
materials. The most -used materials are β -tricalcium phosphate (β -TCP), 
hydroxyapatitie (HA) and biphasic calcium phosphate. Human bone consists of  
approximately 60 -70% of a modified hydroxyapatitie (HA) and 30 -40% of organic 
constituents and water, this material can give bone its strength (7, 8).  
Easy -graft®  CLASSIC , is commercially available alloplast ic bone graft granules  consists 
of pure β -TCP, which has been commonly used for the indication of ridge preservation 
(9). It has unique ha ndling capacity based on an extremely thin coating of the graft 
granules with poly(lactic -co-glycolic acid ) (PLGA) . In medicine, PLGA  is used to 
manufacture dental membranes, suture materials and resorbable screws. Before 
application, the granules are mixe d with BioLinker ™ which consists of water and N -
Methyl -2-pyrrolidone (NMP). It is non -volatile solvent which has been in used in various 
medical products for more than [ADDRESS_1083391] with blood or tissue flu ids. When the material is soaked in blood in bone defects 
it hardens in a few minutes to form stable porous scaffold for bone regeneration. This 
characteristic of graft material gives better handling for the clinician.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_787519] -graft CLASSIC in 
extraction  socket ridge preservation has been  conducted by [CONTACT_787538] (IRB#  HP00063203 ).  The interim observation  of the study  indicates 
that th e effectivenes s of easy -graft CLASSIC is not inferior to those of other leading 
bone graft substitutes even when easy -graft is used  without a membrane or a plug 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   6(33) covering the defect site.  It is beneficial to both dentists and patients to avoid additional 
treatment time and a cost of membrane  or a plug .   
The purpose of study is to evaluate two different treatment approaches using easy -graft 
CLASSIC for comparative effectiveness to freeze -dried bone  allograft (FDBA) with 
collagen plug (Colla gen Plug, Zimmer Dental  Inc.) in ridge  preservation  when the study 
tooth is extracted atraumatically . Furthermore , implant stability will be observed in the 
follow -up period.   
 
[ADDRESS_1083392] imaging.  
 
Hypothesis : The treatment  group with easy -graft CLASSIC  is superior or at least not 
inferior  to the control  treatment group  (FDBA  with collagen  plug). 
2.2 Secondary objectives  
Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate and compare : 
- New bone replacement/remaining graft residuals  at re-entry (histomorphometric 
assessment) . 
- Change of m esial and distal marginal bone loss on periapi[INVESTIGATOR_787520] -entry.  
- Change of m esial and distal marginal bone loss on periapi[INVESTIGATOR_787521] 6 months and to 12 months after the crown delivery (follow -up 
observation).   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   7(33)  
[ADDRESS_1083393] 40 evaluable subjects in 
anticipation of a 1 0% dropout rate.  [ADDRESS_1083394] will be randomized into one of  two groups : group A ( GUIDOR® easy -graft 
CLASSIC ) and group B ( FDBA  and collagen  plug).  Each center  will enroll  22 evaluable 
subjects, 11 per group  ideally .  
 
The ridge preservation study will be a 5-month  follow -up with 9 main clinic visits  to re-
entry/implant placement .  Three additional clinic visits for the observation period will be 
scheduled after crown delivery to the study site.  
3.1.1  Visit 1:  Screening  
Subjects in need of ridge preservation  of a single tooth extraction socket  in premolars or 
molars  prior to dental implant surgery that a re deemed eligible by [CONTACT_787539] .  Third  molars will be 
excluded as a study site.  
 
Screening process will include  evaluation of general den tal and systemic health .  It will 
also include a clinical and radiographic assessment of the potential study  site and the 
adjacent teeth.  Pre -existing intraoral (periapi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) radiograph can be used but must not 
be older than 6 months. All women except for postmenopausal women  will require a 
negative urine  human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test result prior to inclusion in the 
study to rule out pregnancy.  Postmenopausal is considered when the patient has not 
had her period for an entire year. Eligible s ubjects will immediately  be scheduled for 
Visit 2  provided that they fulfill all inclusion and none of the exclusion criterion . 
3.1.2  Visit 2 :  Enrollment  
Visit 1  (Screening)  and Visit 2 (Enrollment ) may occur on the same day.  Individuals 
meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and that have  signed all 
appropriate  consent forms will be further evaluated.  Before any assessment or 
examination  is carried out for study purposes the subject must have been informed 
orally and in writing about the study, and have signed the appropriate  consent form s.  
Informed consent for the research study will be given and signed on paper, as well as

Pre-Surgical Procedures  
 
Buccal and occlusal photographs of the planned surgical site will be obtained . Width of 
keratinized mucosa on the buccal and thickness of the buccal and lingual mucosa  will 
be measured by a caliper . Standardized periapi[INVESTIGATOR_787522] a target tooth will be 
taken.  
 
Surgical Procedure  
 
After administration of local anesthesia, the tooth will be extracted without raising a 
mucoperiosteal flap. A minimally invasive extraction procedure helps protection and 
preservation of the surrounding socket bone.  Horizontal bucco -lingual ridge  width  at crest 
will be measured intraoperatively and recorded in CRF.   The bucco -lingual width will be 
measured intraoperatively using a pointy caliper . The width  will be  measured  1mm api[INVESTIGATOR_787523].    
 
If fenestration and/or dehiscence are present  when the marginal bone  is sounded by a 
perio odontal probe  through the sulcus around the tooth  or fracture of the buccal bone is 
noted upon extraction, the subject will be excluded from the study and treated as a 
normal patient  of the  clinic ( Incorrect enrollment ). 
 
After thorough debridement of granulated tissue and rinsing with sterile  saline the 
prepared easy -graft® CLASSIC  (Group A)  or FDBA  (Group B) will be grafted to the 
socket defect.  Easy -graft CLASSIC  should be prepared acc ording to manufacturer’s  
instruction.   FDBA will be  rehydrated  by [CONTACT_787540].    
The graft materials will be condensed  to achieve  a fill of the socket to level of crestal 
bone.

CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   12(33) If the bucco -lingual ridge width is judged not enough  for implant placement  the subject 
will be terminated from the study and will receive an appropriate treatment and follow ed 
according to the clinic ’s routines.  
 
Surgical Procedure  
 
Implant placement is made per standard procedure.  For patients in each treatment 
group, a trephine drill will be used to harvest a core of bone for descriptive histology.  A 
trephine dr ill will be used to harvest a core of bone corresponding with the planned 
implant length.  A trephine drill of 2.[ADDRESS_1083397] choice.  If 
another diameter has to be used  a diameter of the trephine will be recorded in CRF.  A 
length of a trephine will be up to 8 mm .  Following harvesting, the trephined  bone core 
will immediately be transferred to a so lution of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF).  
These samples are to be used for histomorphometric assessment.   Bone Density 
Classification  (Misch  Classification )(10) will be evaluated and recorded in CRF.  
 
Selection of i mplant system  will be left to the judgment of study sites;  however the same 
system should be used in all the cases treated at the site .  Implant site preparation and 
placement will proceed according to the implant system manufacturer 
recommendations . 
 
When one -stage approach  is chosen, a healing abutment will be placed to finger 
tightness.  Depending on the buccal soft tissue thickness, the crestal tissue will either 
be removed or deepi[INVESTIGATOR_787525].   When  two-stage procedure is chosen, a cover screw will be placed and stay 
buried and left to heal.  Once healed, a second surgery is performed to attach an 
abutment for securing the crown in place.  Selection of approach will be left up to the 
dentist’s  discre tion. 
 
Post-Surgical Procedures

 3.2 Rationale and risk/benefit assessment  
It is necessary to further define the effects of different grafting materials on clinical 
outcomes following ridge preservation .  This study will employ gold standard 
methods of evaluation efficacy and  safety conforming to that stipulated of the 
medical, clinical research, and regulatory communities to demonstrate clinical benefit 
of GUIDOR® easy -graft CLASSIC .  The study has been designed to treat a clinical 
scenario commonly encountered in clinical pr actice .   
 
The patients will benefit from a  preserved alveolar ridge dimension to permit dental 
implant placement.  The public will benefit from the study results which will help to 
refine  the knowledge of bone preservation and healing  following ridge preservation 
with different grafting material.  This will help aid clinicians in the selection of 
materials to  optimize their clinical outcomes of treatment.  The study also includes 
dental implant placement and acquisition of data that wi ll help to define the effect 
that different grafting materials have on implant stability at time of placement  and 
follow -up period for one year after the implant placement .  Data acquisition includes 
minimally invasive collection methods, both before and after the surgical procedure s.

Procedures for handling incorrect enrolled subjects  
Subjects not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria for a study should, under no 
circumstances, be enrolled into the study - there can be no  exce ptions to this rule. 
When subjects  not meeting the study criteria are enrolled in error, or if subjects  
subsequently fail to meet the criteria for the study after enrol lment, they will be 
excluded from the study and from the analyses .  
 
If subjects are excluded intraoperatively  (e.g. dehiscence), the subjects will receive a 
standard grafting treatment at no cost. However , an implant placement at the site will 
be at the patient ’s cost.

4.2.1  Primary outcome variable  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dimensional osseous changes  
The amount of horizontal and vertical bone changes will be calculated using data 
from DICOM images acquired by [CONTACT_787547] 3D software.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1083414] scans  will be obtained at baseline and 4 months following ridge 
preservation  (Visit 8). Linear measurements will be done at the 
University of Iowa by a single, calibrated  examiner . Volumetric 
assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_787548] . All examiners 
will be masked for the therapy applied in each case .  
For the horizontal and vertical measurements a plane of reference will 
be set to allow for reproducible and reliable assessments (in mm) 
between both baseline and 4 -month datasets.  
Volumetric assessments will be performed using a specific software 
(Simpla nt 16 Pro) via selection of a region of interest (ROI) that 
includes only hard tissues. The same segmentation settings of the ROI 
selected in the baseline s can will be transferred to the 4 -month 
reconstruction in order to generate comparable volumes. Volum e 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   22(33) measurements will be expressed in cc, which allows for a calculation of 
the % of volumetric reduction that took place from baseline until one 
month prior to surgical re -entry.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Derivation or calculation of variable  
The mid -alveolar point positioned on a tangent drawn from the mesial 
and distal adjacent tooth CEJs will be used as a reference point for 
assessment of dimensional bone changes in the Z -axis (bone width) 
and Y -axis (bone height).  The changes in the bone dimensions 
between baseline (Visit 2) an d 4 months (Visit 8) will be measured.  
The change for each study site will be compared longitudinally and the 
average for each treatment group will be calculated and compared 
among treatment groups.  
4.2.2  Secondary outcome variable s 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Qualitative histological eva luation  
A core of bone from the defect  sites will be harvested for qualitative histological 
assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Methods of assessment  
Trephined bone cores will be obtained from a subset of patients from 
each treatment group (Visit 9).   Tissues stored in 10% neutral buffered 
formalin (NBF) will be fixed for at least 7 days.  All bone core samples 
will be sent to University of Maryland. The samples will be 
subsequently rinsed in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and 
demineralized by [CONTACT_787549] (EDTA) 
for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1083415], and stai ned with conventional 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) technique, and coverslipped for 
qualitative histologic analysis.  
 
Images of sections will be taken with microscope and connected  with 
digital camera .  Quantitative  assess ment of newly formed bone and , 
residual bone graft particles and non -mineralized tissue on histological 
section with H&E staining will be performed at least 5 images randomly 
chosen in the same section and analyzed with recommended  software.

system stay the same from r adiograph to  radiograph, the image of 
the penny should only be submitted once. However, if any parts of 
the system change (i.e. the sensor or capturing device, scanner or 
capturing software), a new penny  radiograph should be submitted.   
 
The measurements a re taken from a stationary landmark ( e.g. the 
mesial and /or distal adjacent tooth CEJs ) to the crest of and distal 
marginal bone,  to the crest and bottom of osseous defect and to the 
apex of the longest  root of mesial and/or distal adjacent tooth  in 
millimeters. A d0 is the  root length of distal adjacent tooth  at baseline;  
Bd0 is the measurement f rom the CEJ to the crest of distal marginal 
bone  at baseline . All measurements are taken  parallel to the long axis 
of the adjacent tooth.   
  
Subsequent im ages are logged in and saved to the file. Linear 
measurements of bone height along  root surfaces are made using the 
same method as the original defect.  
 
Measurements to the root apex taken from baseline images  (Ad 0, 
Am 0) are used to correct for any geometric  distortion 
(elongation/foreshortening) of subsequent images .

VERSION 1.1   24(33) 4.3.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
The definitions of AEs, ADEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are given below.  
It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the 
content of this section.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_129130].  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward and unintended medical occurrence in a subject.  This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the AE and the medical 
device under investigation.  An AE which is possibly related, is one that may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_140289], or treatment, however there is insufficient 
information to determine the likelihood of this possibility.    
• Possibly related: temporal relationship of t he onset of the event, relative to the 
use/administration of the medical device, is reasonable but the event could 
have been due to another, equally likely cause.  
• Non-related (unlikely): temporal relationship of the onset of the event, relative 
to the use /administration of the medical device, is not reasonable or another 
cause can itself explain the occurrence of the event.  
Ambiguous cases should be considered as possibly related.  
Adverse Device Effect  
An ADE is any untoward and unintended response to a me dical device.  This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use of the medical device or any event that is a result of a user error.  
This definition also includes treatment - or procedure -related  events. ADEs can only 
occur from the time of medical device use/administration.  Here the event is related 
to the use of the medical device where there is a probable/definite relationship that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_140289], or treat ment.  
• Probably related:  temporal relationship of the onset of the event, relative to 
the use/administration of the medical device, is reasonable and the event is 
more likely explained by [CONTACT_140289]/treatment than by [CONTACT_787551].  
• Definitely re lated: temporal relationship of the onset of the event, relative to 
the use/administration of the medical device, is reasonable and there is no 
other cause to explain the event.  
Expected post -surgical events (i.e.. pain , swelling, bleeding and edema ) on th e study 
site within 7 days following  surgeries will be excluded from AE/ADE . 
Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is an AE/ADE occurring during any study phase of the medical device that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may je opardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   25(33) If a non -related AE becomes serious, i.e. fulfilling one or more of the above criteria, 
action should be taken as for any other SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording of Adverse E vents and Adverse Device Effects  
At each visit, scheduled or unscheduled, the subject will be asked an open question; 
"Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?"  
 
All health problems, reported by [CONTACT_787552], where the 
investigator believes the event "possibly" has been caused by [CONTACT_787553], must be recorded in the CRF as AEs, specifying time of 
onset, action taken, outcome and whether it constitutes a SAE or not.  No n-related 
AEs must be recorded in the CRF together with a short description and whether it 
constitutes a SAE or not.  
 
All health problems, reported by [CONTACT_787552], where the 
investigator believes the event "probably/definitely"  has been caused by [CONTACT_787554], must be recorded in the CRF as AEs 
and ADEs, specifying time of onset, action taken, outcome and whether it constitutes 
a SAE or not.  
 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported in acc ordance with the procedures 
described in Section  8.2, Pregnancy.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE 
unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a me dical device under study may have interfered 
with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Timelines for reporting of SAEs  
Investigators and other study site personnel must inform appropriate Sponsor  
representati ves of any SAE that occurs during the course of the study within one day 
(i.e., immediately but no later than the end of the next business day) of when he or 
she becomes aware of it.  
 
The Sponsor  representative will work with the Investigator to compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a ll the 
necessary information and ensure that the appropriate Sponsor  personnel receives a 
report by [CONTACT_787555] -threatening cases and by [CONTACT_787556].  
 
If an AE or ADE becomes a SAE, this and other relevant follow -up infor mation must 
also be provided to Sponsor  within one day for all fatal and life -threatening cases  
and by [CONTACT_787557].  
 
The Investigator is responsible for informing the ethics committee of SAEs as per 
local requirements.  
 
SUNSTAR is responsible for informing the regulatory authority of device related 
SAEs as per requirements.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   26(33) 5 DATA MANAGEMENT  
5.1 Data handling  
Sponsor or the d esignee will supply investigative sites with access to electronic case 
report forms (eCRF) via a web -based electronic data capture system. The eCRF will 
be completed for each included patient.  The completed eCRFs will not be made 
available in any form to third parties without written permission  from S ponsor .  
 
All data from source document s will be entered into the eCRF database.  The data 
entry will be verified by [CONTACT_787558].  Before database lock, both manual and computerized validation tests will be 
performed and, if necessary, data queries will be sent to the investigator for 
clarification.  Should questionable data be detected during the validation process, 
written queries will be raised as resul t of this validation.  The  study site personnel are 
required to resolve any such queries.   The eCRF s will be retained for [ADDRESS_1083418] retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audit s from regulatory agencies or S ponsor  and its 
representatives, the investigator agrees to keep records in the Investiga tor’s Study 
File (ISF), including the identification list of the participating patients, all original 
signed Informed Consent forms, and detailed records of medical device disposition.  
To comply with international regulations, the investigator should reta in the records 
for 10 years.

VERSION 1.1   27(33) 6 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE  
6.1 Statistical evaluation – general aspects  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) may be prepared before database 
lock. If prepared, the SAP will be kept as an appen dix to the Data Management Plan.  
When using the terminology descriptive statistics it means that number of patients, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values will be presented 
for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for cate gorical data.  
 
If nothing else is stated, descriptive statistics will be given for each variable in the 
study and p -values may be complemented by [CONTACT_583142].  
All p-values presented will be two -sided. A p -value less than 5% will be called 
“statistically significant” but all conclusions will be based on the primary objective and 
hence multiplicity is accounted for even though careful interpretations are necessary 
as multiple tests are performed . 
6.1.1  Demographics and other baseline characteristics  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_787559]  (by [CONTACT_787560]) .  Continuous variables will be presented 
by [CONTACT_787561] (N), minimum (min), median, maximum (ma x), 
mean, and standard deviation (std).  Discrete variables will be presented by 
[CONTACT_7237].

that there w ill be any qualitative  differences between the centers regarding  any of the 
efficacy variables or regarding the safety variables . Therefore , the primary statistical 
analys es will not include center  in the model . 
 
In order to harmonize the use and handling of the graft materials and dental implant 
systems,  training will be conducted prior to study start at each center.  
6.1.5  Subgroup analyses  
Subgroup analys is is not planned.   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
VERSION 1.1   28(33) 6.2 Method of statistical analysis  
6.2.1  Primary objective  
The primary objective is to compare dimensional bone  changes from baseline  (Visit 
2) to 4 months (Visit 8) occurring in a single tooth extraction socket  following ridge 
preservation  using three different techniques .  
 
Assume the change (in the mid -buccal horizontal bone dimensions from baseline  to 
five months ) is denoted C A and CB, for group A  and B. The null -hypotheses (two) is 
then to test if:  
H0 CA = C B 
can be rejected and hence  
H1 CA  CB  
accepted.  
  
H0 will be tested by [CONTACT_787562].  A p-value less than 5% 
will be regarded statistically significant.  
6.2.2  Secondary objectives  
The data collected  in the study were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD ). 
The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used  for statistical analysis . 
6.3 Determination of sample size  
A sample size of 22 participants per treatment group was selected following power 
calculations and allowing for 10% patient dropout.  A sample size of 20 patients was 
calculated for the primary outcome variable (horizontal bone changes) with the 
assumption that the detectable  difference would amount to 0. [ADDRESS_1083420]

• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) (and other personnel involved with the study) 
their responsibilities wi th regard to protocol adherence, and the 
responsibilities of Sponsor  or its representatives.  This will be documented in 
a Clinical Study Agreement between Sponsor  and the investigator . 
During the study, a monitor from Sponsor  or a company representing sponsor will 
have regular contacts with the s tudy site, including visits to:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the prot ocol, that data are 
being a ccurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification (a comp arison of the data in the eCRFs with 
the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study).  This will require direct access to all original records for 
each subject (e.g., clinic charts).  
The monitor or another Sponsor  representative will be available between visits if the 
investigator(s) or other staff at the center needs  information and advice.

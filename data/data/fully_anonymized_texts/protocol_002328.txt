1 INTRODUCTION  
According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately 
40% of all adults and 31% of children have been found to take multivitamin or mineral 
supplements (MVM)  (1;2) . Moreover, 71% of dietary s upplement consumers have reported 
routinely taking a MVM in a recent panel of nationally representative surveys of adults in the 
[LOCATION_002] from 2007 to 2011  (3). Aside from MVM, vitamin C (32%) is also commonly 
consumed by  [CONTACT_837452] a balanced diet and follow a lifestyle routine that is 
associated with good health  (3).  
Vitamin C is frequently reported to be below the estimated average requirements for vitamins 
obtained through dietary sources (2). Moreover, adequate levels of vitamin C are  vital for the 
maintenance of numerous biological functions  within the body.  
Vitamin C (A scorbic acid) is an essential water -soluble vitamin in humans, which can be obtained 
through the diet mainly through fruits and vegetables (4). This nutrient plays an important role 
as a cofactor for various biological processes,  an anti-oxidant, and it provides support for the 
immune system  (5). Pharmacokinetic studies have found that vitamin C has a relatively short 
plasma half -life that can range from 30 minutes to 8 hours  (6). Moyad et al  (2008)  found that 
vitamin C accumulate s in leukocytes following an acute oral dose of either calcium ascorbate with 
calcium threonate, or with ascorbic acid alone  (7). 
While people perceive taking MVM supplements as a healthy lifestyle choice, bioequivalence 
studies centered on gummy vitamin  C formulations are lacking. This may be due to the difficulty 
in having two competing vitamin  products with similar micro -nutrient profile s. This current 
randomized, examiner -blind, cross -over  study will evaluate the bioequivalence of a gummy  
containing vitamin C relative to a  caplet  comparator product in healthy adults.

2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this exploratory  pharmacokinetic  research study is to demonstrate that both 
caplet s and gummies provide an effective dose of ascorbic acid on healthy adults . 
Outcome s: 
1. The vitamin C AUC 0-24h of the gummy  formulation and that of a caplet  comparator product  
2. The vitamin C C max of the gummy  formulation and that of a caplet  comparator product  
3. The vitamin C T max of the gummy  formulation and that of a caplet  comparator product  
4. The vitamin C AUC to infinity ( AUC I) of the gummy formulation and that of a caplet  
comparator product  
5. The vitamin C AUC 0-24h /AUC I of the gummy formulation and that of a caplet  comparator 
product  
6. The vitamin C terminal disposition rate constant (λ)  of the gummy formulation and that of a caplet 
comparator product  
7. The vitamin C terminal half -life (t ½) of the gummy formulation and that of a caplet comparator 
product  
 
Safety outcomes:  
1. The difference in vital signs, hematology and clinical chemistry parameters between the 
gummy  formulation vs. that of a comparator product  
2. The difference in the incidence of adverse events between  the gummy  formulation vs. that 
of a caplet  comparator product

Removal by [CONTACT_837455] : 
 
June 6, [ADDRESS_1163039]  be documented in detail  in the participant  file 
and final report .  If possible, the evaluations planned for the end of study will be carried out at 
the time when the participant  is withdrawn from the study.  A participant  leaving the study 
prematurely will be replaced by [CONTACT_837456] 30 participants complete the study .  
It is understood by [CONTACT_837457] -
interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of participant s should be avoided.   
Criteria for removal of participant s from the study will include:  
Clinic al reasons  
A participant  may be withdrawn from the study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_837439], it 
is not in the participant 's best interest to continue.  Any participant  who experiences a serious 
adverse event (SAE) may be withdrawn from the tr ial at the discretion of the Qualified 
Investigator.  A participant  will also be withdrawn due to adverse events causing clinically 
significant illness or the need for prohibited medication(s) during the trial. Any female participant  
who becomes pregnant d uring the course of the trial will be withdrawn.   
Protocol violation  
Any participant  found to have entered this study in violation of the protocol will be discontinued 
from the study at the discretion of the Qualified Investigator.  This will include any participant  
found to have been inappropriately enrolled (did not meet eligibility criteria).  Participant  non-
compliance includes not showing up for study visits or refusing to undergo study visit procedures.  
Participant s who are found to be taking prohib ited medications or supplements without the 
knowledge of the Qualified Investigator will also be withdrawn. Any major protocol deviations 
(i.e., those that increase the risk to participant s and/or compromise the integrity of the study or 
its results) will result in participant  discontinuation.  
[ADDRESS_1163040] will be ret urned to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_837458] (at the sponsor’s 
expense) or destroyed on receipt of written confirmation from the sponsor  at study closeout

5.6 Randomization  
A randomization schedule will be created and provided to the Investigator indicating the order 
of randomization  (Appendix  5). Each participant  will be assigned a randomization code according 
to the order of the random ization list generated using www.randomization.com . Enrolled 
participant s will be randomized to the different study  arms at the Baseline Visit .  
5.7 Un -blinding  and Allocation Concealment  
This study is single blinded (examiner only) due to the obvious difference in product form (gummy 
vs. caplet ).  Un-blinding should not occur except in the case of emergency situations. If a serious 
adverse event occurs, for which the identity of the invest igational product administered is 
necessary to manage the participant ’s condition, the supplement  received by [CONTACT_837461] -blinded and the investigational product identified.  Concealment of the allocation of 
supplement will be employed using  opaque sealed envelopes , each labeled with a randomization 
number . Each envelope will contain information regarding the supplement associated with each 
randomization number. These envelopes will be readily available for the investigator to open if 
it beco mes necessary to know which product a participant is taking for the sake of the participant 
health care. The sponsor must be notified of any un -blinding within 24 hours. Details of 
participant s who are un -blinded during the study will be included in the Fi nal Report.

At screening, a volunteer Inform ed Consent Form  will be given to the potential participant .  The 
volunteer will read the information carefully and will be given the opportunity to seek more 
information if needed.  The volunteer will also be pro vided with the option of taking the consent 
form home to review prior to making his or her decision.  If agreeable, the volunteer  will sign the 
consent form  and receive a duplicate.  Once consent has been obtained, the screening visit will 
proceed.  After t he volunteer  has signed the informe d consent, the screening number  will be 
assigned sequentially and entered in the Screening and Enrolment Log.  Screening numbers will 
be allocated in the chronological order of the volunteer  signing the informed consent.  
Participants will be provided with a list of meal items  to choose from  during the 8-h clinic visits .

(5) working days of the implementation.  
7 Safety Instructions and Guidance  
7.1 Adverse Eve nts and Laboratory Abnormalities  
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant  
who has been administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the investigational product .  An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a product, whether or not it is considered related to that product.  
Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study  are to be reported as AEs.  
 
During the study, participant s should record any adverse effects in their diary.  At each visit the 
participant  will be asked "Have you experienced any difficulties or problems since I saw you 
last"?  Any adverse events (AEs) will be documented and in the study record and will be 
classified according to the description, duration, intensity, frequency, and outcome.  The 
Qualified I nvestigator will assess any AEs and decide causali ty. 
 
Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in 
detail in the study record.  
Mild:    Awareness of event but easily tolerated  
Moderate:   Discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual activity  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activity  
 
The causality relationship of investigational product to the adverse event will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_837467]:  
Most probable:  There is a reasonable relationship between the investigational 
product and AEs. The event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product (dechallenge) and recurs with rechallenge 
when clinically feasible.  
Probable:  There is a reasonable relationship between the investigational 
product and AEs.  The event responds t o dechallenge.  
Possible:  There is a reasonable relationship between the investigational 
product and AEs.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
 
June 6, 2017               Page 27 of 47 
Unlikely:  There is a temporal relationship to the investigational product 
administration but there is no reasonable causal relationship 
between the investigational product and the AEs.  
Not related:  No temporal relationship to the investigational product 
administration or there is a reasonable causal relationship between 
non-investigational product, concurr ent disease or circumstance 
and the AEs.  
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life -threatening adverse event  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant  who received the 
study produ ct 
 Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837446].  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1163072] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for 
an approved product).  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1163073]:  
 Accompanied by [CONTACT_837468] 6, 2017               Page 28 of 47 
 Leading to interruption or discontinuation of the investigational product  
 Requiring a change in concomitant  therapy  
 
This applies to any protocol and non -protocol specified laboratory re sult from tests performed 
after the first dose of the investigational product, which falls outside the laboratory reference 
range and meets the clinical significance criteria for liver and kidney tests as well as for 
hematology and clinical chemistry, etc. This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result 
which falls outside the laboratory reference range but which does not meet the clinical 
significance criteria or those which are a result of an AE which has already been reported.  
 
Any laboratory result  abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) should 
be reported as such, in addition to being reported as an AE in the study record.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1163074] be made in writing 
to the study sponsor. The IRB will be notified of all SAEs and unexpected adverse reactions.  All 
SAEs will be reported to the Therapeutics Products Directorate (TPD)  in an expedited manner.  
The sponsor must notify t he TPD of all serious adverse reactions as follows:  
a) If it is neither fatal or life threatening, within 15 calendar days after the day on which the 
sponsor becomes aware of the information; and  
 
June 6, 2017               Page 29 of 47 
b) If it is fatal or life threatening, must be reported as soon as  possible, but not later than 
seven (7) days after the day on which the sponsor becomes aware of the information.  
[ADDRESS_1163075] and no calculation was conducted for sample size.  
8.2 Study Population  
 The Safety Population will consist of all participants who received any amount of either 
product, and on whom any post -randomization safety information is available.  
 The Per Protocol (PP) Population  consists of all participants  who  do not have any major 
protocol violations and complete all study visits and procedures connected with 
measurement of the primary variable.  
8.3 Analysis Plan  
The primary outcome variable will be the peak plasma ascorbic acid level (C MAX).  The responses 
from a ll time points will be compared to determine the time at which the plasma ascorbic acid 
level reaches its peak (T MAX).  For each product, a one sample t -test will be utilized to test whether 
the mean peak plasma ascorbic acid level is greater than 37 µM.  
                H0: CMAX ≤ 37 µM 
                HA: CMAX > 37  µM 
Because the plasma ascorbic acid level reaches a saturation point at approximately 80 µM  (9;10) , 
some of the participants  may reach saturation at the peak time.  Depending on the proportion of 
participants  who peak at saturation level, a one sample t -test may be inappropriate and 
nonparametric techniques may be required to judge the typi[INVESTIGATOR_837447].  
The action standard for each product will be that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_837448] p lasma ascorbic acid level is 
statistically significantly greater than [ADDRESS_1163076] provided an effective dose.  
Additional outcome variables which will be measured include the ascorbic aci d level in white 
blood cells and the ascorbic acid level in urine. These data will be collected for informational 
purposes only.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for participant demographic and baseline characteristics.  
Line graphs showing the indiv idual and mean concentrations in µM of plasma , WBC and urine 
ascorbic acid over the 24 h will be provided for the investigational products .  
 
June 6, 2017               Page 30 of 47 
Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the incremental area under the curve (iAUC 0-24h and 
iAUC 0-∞), the maximum obs erved concentration (C max) time, and maximum concentration (T max) 
will be calculated for each participant.  The area under the curve parameter will be calculated

8.3.1 Premature Discontinuation Description  
For each premature discontinuation, the following parameters will be listed: participant  number, 
dates of start and end of supplementation , and the reason of premature discontinuation.  If a 
participant is withdrawn or drops out of the pharmacokinetic study, KGK will replace the 
participant to ensure a total number of [ADDRESS_1163077] .  Furthermore, description, frequency, 
severity and causality will be reported for each adverse event.  
Continuous safety parameters (e.g. hematology, clinical chemistry, heart rate and blood 
pressure) will be summarized using a table including mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum value, and maximum value for each measurement point. The changes from bas eline

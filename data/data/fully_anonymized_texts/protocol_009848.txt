4.4 S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase 3b single-arm, open -label multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab 300 mg intravenous ( IV) infusion over a 26-week treatment period using 
ileocolonoscopy for the assessment in subjects with moderately to severely active CD (Study 
Part A) followed by a 26-week treatment extension period (Part B). Biopsies will be collected for 
histological assessments per the schedule of events for all subjects. The study will be conducted 
at sites in North America and Europe. The 26-week treatment extension (Study Part B) is 
included as part of Protocol Amendment No. 04 (dated 27 April 2016), ongoing subjects at the 
time of the amendment will have the option to either stop treatment at Week 26 (Study Part A) or 
continue treatment into Part B. Subjects who enroll into the study after Protocol Amendment No. 
04 will be treated directly for 52 weeks (Study Parts A and B). 
Approximately [ADDRESS_1275859] failed treatment 
with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or biologics will be enrolled. Subjects who are 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist naïve as well as those who are TNF-α antagonist 
failures will be included, such that approximately 50% of enrolled subjects are TNF-α antagonist 
naïve.  
The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period (Study Part A),  
followed by a 26-week extension treatment period (Part B from [ADDRESS_1275860] dose at Week 46), and an 18-week follow-up period following the last dose. The duration of 
the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_1275861] at the Postdose 18 Week Safety Follow-up visit. 
Subjects that meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be dosed on 
site with vedolizumab 300 mg IV. Subjects will visit the site for dosing at Day 1, Weeks 2, 6, 14, 
and 22 for Study Part A and at Weeks 30, 38, and 46 for Study Part B. Ileocolonoscopy will be 
pe
rformed at the Screening, Week 14, Week 26 (Study Part A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or 
early termination (ET) visits. Biopsies will be taken during the Screening, Week 26 (Study Part 
A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or ET visit. All ileocolonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_908739] a blinded 
central reader.  
An MREn substudy will be conducted at selected qualified centers using a standardized magnetic 
resonance ( MR) acquisition and procedure to assess bowel wall activity. Only subjects from the 
pre-selected sites will be included in this study; these subjects will undergo an MREn assessment 
at the Screening, Week 26 (Study Part A), and Week 52 (Study Part B) or ET visit, unless they 
have contraindications to the procedure. All MREn results will be evaluated by a blinded 
independent central reader. 
Additional procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Appendix A ).

 6.0 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of 100 subjects will be sufficient to provide a 95% confidence interval based on 
normal approximation for the primary endpoint (endoscopic remission rate at Week 26) that 
extends no more than 10% in each direction from the estimated rate. 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1275866]. Every effort will be made to limit the amount 
of missing data; however, if any missing data is present in the clinical database, a Missing 
category will be added in the tabulation, unless otherwise stated. 
For continuous variables, the number of subjects with non-missing values, mean, median, 
standard deviation ( SD), minimum, and maximum values will be tabulated. Means and medians 
will be presented to [ADDRESS_1275867] than the recorded data. The SDs will be presented to 2 
more decimal places than the recorded data. Confidence intervals about a parameter estimate will 
be presented using the same number of decimal places as the parameter estimate. 
All confidence intervals will be reported as 2-sided and will be assessed at the α=0.[ADDRESS_1275868] data listings. 
A windowing convention will be used to determine the analysis value for a given study visit for 
observed data analyses. Details are provided in section  7.1.5. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS System® Version 9.2, or higher. 
7.1.1 Study Terms and Definitions 
Study terms and definitions are provided below. 
Term  Definition  
Endoscopic Remission  SES-CD score ≤ 4  
Complete Mucosal Healing  Absence of ulcerations  
Endoscopic Response  SES-CD reduction by ≥ 50%  
Clinical Response  CDAI decrease from baseline of ≥ 100 points  
Clinical Remission  CDAI ≤ [ADDRESS_1275869] dose of the 
medication, as recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) dosing page. Other study days 
are defined relative to the Study Day 1 with Day 1 being Study Day 1 and Day -1 being the day 
prior to Study Day 1. 
All protocol-specified study visit dates are defined relative to Study Day 1 (for example, the date 
for the scheduled Week 2 Visit should be Study Day 15).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of [COMPANY_005] without a confidentiality agreement.  
 7.1.4 Definition of Screen Failure 
Screen failure subjects are subjects who signed the informed consent and were not enrolled in the 
study. The primary reason for screen failure is collected in the eCRF using the following 
categories: 
 Pretreatment Event (PTE)/AE 
 Did Not Meet Entrance Criteria 
 Significant Protocol Deviation 
 Lost to Follow-Up 
 Voluntary Withdrawal 
 Study Termination 
 Other 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1275871] to the target day will be used. In case of ties between observations located on 
different sides of the target day, the later assessment will be used in analyses. In case of ties 
located on the same side of the target day (i.e., more than one value for the same day), the mean 
of the values will be used for continuous parameters and the worst result will be chosen over a 
more positive one for categorical parameters (i.e., an abnormal electrocardiogram [ECG] value 
will be chosen over a normal ECG value).  
For safety measurements (laboratory tests and vital signs), descriptive statistics are presented for 
each scheduled visit including the Final Visit. Final Visit during the Treatment Period will be 
defined as the last visit (inclusive of both scheduled and unscheduled) which falls between 
Baseline and Week [ADDRESS_1275872] visit (inclusive of both scheduled and unscheduled) which falls just after 
Week [ADDRESS_1275873], using the visit 
analysis windows defined above. 
Data identified on the eCRF as coming from an “unscheduled” visit will be eligible for 
windowing and Final Visit summaries. There will not be a separate “unscheduled” categorization 
for the reporting of these observations. 
The visit windows and applicable study day ranges are presented below for study.

 Data identified on the eCRF as coming from the “follow-up” visit (i.e., Postdose 18 Week Safety 
Follow-up) will be summarized as collected and entered. These study visits will not be 
windowed. 
 
The study window convention will not be applied to data listings; the data listings will display 
the visits as collected and entered in the eCRF. 
7.1.6 Convention for Calculation of SES- CD Scores 
The SES-CD has been shown to be comparable to the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of 
Severity and a straightforward scoring system for Crohn’s disease [ 2]. The overall SES-CD score 
ranges from 0 to 56 and is the sum of 4 variables (i.e., size of ulcers [cm], ulcerated surface [%], 
affected surface [%], and presence of narrowing) across 5 bowel segments (i.e., rectum, 
descending and sigmoid colon, transverse colon, ascending colon, and ileum). Each variable is 
coded from [ADDRESS_1275879] severe case, 
with the sum of the scores for each variable ranging from 0 to 15, except for presence of 
narrowing. Presence of narrowing ranges from 0 to 11 since a severity of 3 represents a 
narrowing which a colonscope cannot be passed and, thus, can only be observed once among the 
bowel segments. The segmental SES-CD score is the sum of the 4 variables for each bowel 
segment and can range from 0 to 12, where each individual variable score ranges from 0 to 3 (see 
Appendix B ). 
7.1.7 Convention for Calculation of CDAI Scores 
The CDAI score is the summation of 8 components, including number of liquid or very soft 
stools, abdominal pain, general well-being, extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease, 
Lomotil/Imodium/opi[INVESTIGATOR_908740], abdominal mass, hematocrit level, and body weight 
(see Appendix C ). 
Number of liquid or very soft stools, abdominal pain, and general well-being are self-reported 
via subject electronic diary entries. To calculate subscores at each visit, the diary data from the 
10 days prior to the date of CDAI calculation were used and the following rules were applied: 
1. Take the [ADDRESS_1275880] the effective version.  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of [COMPANY_005] without a confidentiality agreement.  
 c. For general well-being, the factor is 7. 
Table 7.e provides examples of calculated CDAI scores using various eDiary scenarios 
(excluding eligibility). Table 7.f provides examples of calculated CDAI scores using various 
eDiary scenarios for eligibility. Patient diaries can be completed 14 days prior to the eligibility 
visit. Any on -study colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or MREn are taken into account such that the diary data 
from the day prior, day of, and day after are excluded from the visit’s CDAI calculation.

In addition to the subscores originating from the subject electronic diary entries, subscores for 
extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease, usage of Lomotil/Imodium/opi[INVESTIGATOR_396031], abdominal mass, hematocrit level, and body weight are calculated. 
Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease include arthritis/arthralgia, iritis/uveitis, 
erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis, anal fissure fistula, or abscess, 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1275881] the effective version.  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of [COMPANY_005] without a confidentiality agreement.  
 other fistula, and fever over 37.8 °C during the past week. The total number of extra- intestinal 
manifestations is summed and multiplied by a factor of 20. 
If a subject used Lomotil/Imodium/opi[INVESTIGATOR_22032], they have a subscore of 30. Otherwise, 
their usage of Lomotil/Imodium/opi[INVESTIGATOR_908741] 0. 
For a definite, questionable, or no abdominal mass, a subject receives a subscore of 50, 20, or 0, 
respectively. 
Hematocrit results are subtract ed from 47 for males and from 42 for females to obtain the 
hematocrit subtotal. The hematocrit subtotal is then multiplied by a factor of 6 to determine the 
hematocrit subscore. If the hematocrit subtotal is 0, the hematocrit subscore is also 0. 
Lastly, the body weight subscore is obtained with the following formula: 
[1 − (Body Weight
Standard Weight)]×[ADDRESS_1275882] weight is calculated as (height in m)2×22.1 for males and (height in m)2×20.8 
for females. If the body weight subscore is < -10, the body weight subscore is set to -10. 
To calculate the total CDAI score for a study visit, sum all 8 component subscores at that 
particular study visit. If any of the 8 subscores are missing, the total CDAI score cannot be 
calculated for that study visit. 
7.1.8 Conventions for Missing Adverse Events Dates 
Every effort will be made to determine the actual onset date for the event or to obtain a reliable 
estimate for the onset date from the investigator. 
For AEs or SAEs, a missing or incomplete onset date will be imputed according to the following 
conventions: 
1. If an onset date is missing, the derived onset date will be calculated as the first non-
missing valid date from the following list (in order of precedence): 
 First study medication date 
 Informed consent date (for SAEs only) 
2. If an onset date is incomplete, the derived onset date will be calculated following: 
 Missing day, but month and year present: the day will be imputed as the 15th of the 
month. If the month and year are equal to the month and year of the first study 
medication dose and the first study medication dose occurs after the imputed date, the 
derived onset date will be set equal to the first study medication date. If the AE end 
date occurs prior to the imputed date, the derived onset date will be set equal to the 
AE end date. 
 Missing day and month, but year present: the day and month will be imputed as the 
30th June of the year. If the year is equal to the year of the first study medication dose 
and the first study medication dose occurs after the imputed date, the derived onset 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1275883] study medication date. If the AE end date occurs 
prior to the imputed date, the derived onset date will be set equal to the AE end date. 
 If the imputed AE onset date occurs after the database lock date, the imputed AE 
onset date will be imputed as the database lock date. 
For AEs or SAEs, a missing or incomplete end date will be imputed according to the following 
conventions: 
1. If an end date is missing, the derived end date will be imputed as the last assessment date, 
assuming that the last assessment occurs after the AE start. If the last assessment occurs 
prior to the AE start date, the derived end date will be imputed as the AE start date. 
2. If an end date is incomplete, the derived end date will be calculated following:  
 Missing day, but month and year present: the day will be imputed as the last date (for 
example February 2009 will be imputed as 28 February 2009) of the month. 
 Missing day and month, but year present: the day and month will be imputed as the 
31st December of the year. 
 If the imputed AE end date occurs after the database lock date, the imputed AE end 
date will be imputed as the database lock date. 
7.1.9 Conventions for Missing Concomitant Medications Dates 
Start and stop dates for all concomitant medications are collected on the eCRF. However, in case 
of missing or partial information in these dates, the following rules will be used: 
If the start date is missing or partial: 
 If the day is missing, the start day will be the first day of the month.  
 If the month is missing, the start month will be the month corresponding to [ADDRESS_1275884] study medication date. 
 If the year is missing, the start year will be the minimum of the year of the first clinic 
visit or the year of the informed consent date. 
 If the entire date is missing, the start date will be the date of first study drug 
administration.  
If the stop date is missing, partial or “continuing”: 
 If the day is missing, the stop day will be the last day of the month reported. 
 If the month is missing, the stop month will be the month during which the last dose of 
treatment was administered. 
 If the year or the entire date is missing or if the medication is “continuing”, the stop year 
will be the year in which the last dose of treatment was administered. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1275885] dose date: 
1 + date first dose − date diagnosis
365. [ADDRESS_1275886]: 
 Missing day, but month and year are present: the day will be imputed as the 15th day of 
the month. 
 Missing day and month, but year is present: the day and month will be imputed as 30th 
June of the year. 
7.1.12 Calculation of Body Mass Index 
BMI will be calculated as the ratio of patient’s weight (in kilograms) to the square of the 
patient’s height (in meters): 
BMI (kg
m2) =weight (kg)
[height (m)]2 
7.1.13 Methods for Handling of Missing Efficacy Data 
Through the end of the treatment period, the missing efficacy data will be handled as follows: 
 Missing data for dichotomous (i.e., proportion-based) endpoints will be handled using the 
non-responder imputation method, i.e. any subject with missing information for 
determination of endpoint status will be considered as a non-responder in the analysis.  
 Missing data for continuous endpoints will be imputed using last available post-baseline 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. 
7.2 A NALYSIS SETS 
 The Study Part A analyses will be performed on the following analysis sets: 
 The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug. 
 The FAS-MREn is the FAS within the MREn substudy. 
 The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and consists of all subjects 
who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the study 
outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the PPS are 
listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints using the 
PPS population may be provided as part of a sensitivity analysis. 
 The PPS-MREn is a subset of the FAS-MREn and consists of all subjects who do not 
violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the study outcome 
significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the PPS-MREn are

population may be provided as part of a sensitivity analysis. 
The Study Part B analyses will performed on the following analysis sets: 
 The FAS-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS who consented to Part B. 
 The FAS-MREn-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-MREn who consented to 
Part B. 
 The PPS-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-Extension and consists of all 
subjects who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the 
study outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject from the 
PPS-Extension are listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analysis for the primary and secondary 
endpoints using the PPS-Extension population may be provided as part of a sensitivity 
analysis. 
 The PPS-MREn-Extension is the subset of subjects in the FAS-MREn -Extension and 
consists of all subjects who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would 
impact the study outcome significantly. Major protocol violations that exclude a subject 
from the PPS-MREn-Extension are listed in Section 7.4. Efficacy analysis for the MREn 
endpoints using the PPS-MREn-Extension population may be provided as part of a 
sensitivity analysis. 
The FAS and FAS-Extension will be used in both efficacy and safety analyses. The FAS-MREn 
and FAS-MREn-Extension will be used in the MREn analyses. Analyses using PPS,  PPS-
Extension, PPS-MREn, and PPS-MREn-Extension populations may be provided as sensitivity 
analyses.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints using PPS/PPS-Extension 
will be conducted only if more than 15% of the subjects in the FAS/FAS-Extension have at least 
1 significant protocol deviation. 
7.3 D ISPOSITION OF SUBJECTS

Derivation guidelines for IBDQ, EQ-5D, and WPAI-CD are documented in Appendix G  of the 
SAP. 
The responses collected on each of the QOL questionnaires will be listed. 
7.12.1 IBDQ 
The IBDQ is a valid and reliable instrument used to assess quality of life in adult patients with 
IBD. It includes 32 questions on 4 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL): Bowel 
Systems (10 items), Emotional Function (12 items), Social Function (5 items), and Systemic 
Function (5 items). Patients are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 
weeks and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (higher scores equate to higher quality of life). 
A total IBDQ score is calculated by [CONTACT_82293]; the total IBDQ score 
ranges from [ADDRESS_1275909] the effective version.  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Do not distribute outside of [COMPANY_005] without a confidentiality agreement.  
 7.12.2 EQ-5D Questionnaire 
The EQ-5D questionnaire, developed by [CONTACT_33012], is a simple, valid, and reliable instrument used 
to measure general health-related quality of life in patients and includes five domain items - 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients choose the 
level of health problems they currently have on each item as “None”, “Moderate”, or “Extreme” 
and are scored a 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the 
individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. The EQ-5D VAS score is a self-assigned rating of 
overall health using a [ADDRESS_1275910] been shown in many studies 
to be valid and reliable instruments for measuring HRQOL in patients with GI diseases. 
7.12.3 WPAI-CD 
The WPAI questionnaire is a valid and reliable 6-item instrument that consists of four metrics: 
absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one’s health in the past seven days), 
presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days 
because of one’s health), overall work productivity loss (an overall impairment estimate that is a 
combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity impairment (the percentage of 
impairment in daily activities because of one’s health in the past seven days). WPAI outcomes 
are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and 
less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes. WPAI-CD is the specific disease version of the 
questionnaire for Crohn’s Disease.

Malignancies will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], HLT, and PT. 
7.13.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated and presented using the International System of Units 
(SI) unless otherwise stated. Refer to Appendix A  for scheduled measurements for clinical 
laboratory tests and to Table 7.i for a list of all Protocol-specified clinical laboratory tests. The 
central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for serum chemistries, hematology, and 
urinalysis. All laboratory test parameters will be displayed in individual subject data listings in 
SI units. For test results not in SI units, the conversion to SI units will be done in the derived 
analysis data sets using the known conversion factors. If necessary, SI units from the central 
laboratory may be converted to [COMPANY_005]’s preferred SI units in the derived dataset. All summaries 
and analyses will be based on the values using these preferred SI units. If a lab test with 
quantitative results has a value that is reported using a non-numeric qualifier (e.g., less than (<) a

 certain value, or greater than (>) a certain value), the given numeric value will be used in the 
summary statistics, ignoring the non-numeric qualifier. 
The following summaries of hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis lab tests will be 
presented for each scheduled time point (Baseline, each post-Baseline visit, and Final Visit). 
The observed and change from Baseline values will be based on a single data value selected 
according to the window conventions described in Table 7.a , Table 7.b, Table 7 .c, and Table 7.d. 
Note that “character” urinalysis parameters will only be listed. 
Shifts in laboratory test values will be presented as cross-tabulations (Baseline versus each post-
Baseline visit and Final Visit) of numbers of subjects with low, normal,  and high values relative 
to the normal range used at the central laboratory. This classification will be based on the low, 
normal, and high alert flags reported by [CONTACT_2237]. If a subject has multiple values 
within a particular visit window, the most extreme result will be used for summary. Shift tables 
will be produced for all clinical laboratory tests with reference ranges.  
Listings of all clinical safety laboratory data will be provided, including hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis. Laboratory data outside of the normal reference range will be 
indicated in the listings. In addition, markedly abnormal values (MAVs) will be flagged. The 
listing will also include the site, subject number, age (at informed consent), gender, treatment 
group, study visit, and sample collection date.

EQ-5D Index Score  1. If any of the 5  components above are missing, the index score is 
missing. Skip the remaining steps below.  
2. Count the number of component scores with a response > 1. If the count 
is non-zero, subtract 1. If the count is zero, leave it as 0.  
3. Count the number of component scores w ith a response equal to 2. If the 
count is non -zero, subtract 1. If the count is zero, leave it as 0.  
4. Count the number of component scores with a response equal to 3. If the 
count is non -zero, subtract 1. If the count is zero, leave it as 0.  
5. Calculat e the index score using the following formula:

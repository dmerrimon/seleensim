 10. Efficacy Endpoints: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
At week 24, compared to baseline, the mean probing Pocket Depth (PD) reductions (absolute change) 
for the selected target implant/s will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint.   
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 PD measurement at week 24 compared  to baseline in patients with baseline PD measurement of 
6-8 mm inclusive . 

 Bleeding on Probing (BOP ) measurements at week 16 and 24 compared to baseline.  
 PD measurement at week 16 compared to baseline.  
Exploratory Endpoints: 
 PD, BOP and Relative Attachment Levels ( RAL ) measurements at week [ADDRESS_1209511] 2mm from 
baseline PD of 6-8mm inclusive.    
 PD and BOP measurements at weeks 8 and 12 compared to baseline. 
 Recession (R) and RAL measurements at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 24 compare to baseline. 
 PD measurement at week 12 and 16 compared to week 24. 
 PD, BOP, RAL and R measured at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 24 for all 4 sites (mesio-buccal, mid-
buccal, disto-buccal and mid-lingual), surrounding the selected target implant/s, compared to 
baseline. 
11. Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size: 
A total of up to [ADDRESS_1209512] 123 patients for the Subgingival Debridement 
+ PerioChip® arm and 123 patients for the Subgingival Debridement alone arm to complete all required 
study visits Based on the current drop -out rate  (after randomization)  of 9%, the expected drop -out rate 
(after randomization) should be between 12% -15% 
Based on previous phase IIa studies, the expected drop-out rate in this study will be between 20%-
25%. Thus, i t is estimated that a pproximately 375 patients will be screened in order to randomize up 
to 290 patients  that complete all required study visits . 
The sample size is determined based on previous phase IIa study (CLI/013P) that demonstrated 
substantial improvement (trend toward significant, p = 0.07)  in PD reduction between the PerioChip® 
and Pl acebo chip  in therapy of Peri -im plantitis . 
The rational for sample size calculated is based on detecting a difference of 0.50 mm  in PD reduction 
fr
om baseline between PerioChip® and Placebo chip, with 5% statistical significance and 85% power.  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_1209513] 85% power to detect a difference in means of -0.50 mm 
(
the difference between a Group 1 mean, of -2.29 and a Group 2 mean, of -1.79) assuming that the 
common standard deviation is 1.[ADDRESS_1209514] with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. 
Statistical significance level was set to 5 % for all statistical analysis and comparisons. 
 
Study Population: 
Three populations will be defined for data analysis. 
1. Intent- to-treat (ITT) population – all patients randomized for one of the treatment arms and 
CONFIDENTIAL   Dexcel Pharma Technologies Ltd. 
Chlorhexidine Gluconate Chip (PerioChip®)  Clinical Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1209515] 2017 Page 10 Protocol # CLI/016P –version [ADDRESS_1209516] one chip of study treatment or underwent Subgingival debridemen t will be 
used for assessments related to efficacy  and all safety evaluations.  
2.
 Modified-Intent- to-Treat (mITT) population – all patients in the ITT population with no major 
protocol violations, will be used to confirm the assessments related to efficacy .    
3. Per
 Protocol (PP) population - all patients in the ITT population who completed the study 
according to the protocol and with no major protocol violations. 
All measured variables and derived parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, tabulated 
by [CONTACT_9086]. For categorical variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, 
absolute and relative frequency and 95% C.I (Confidence Interval) for proportions by [CONTACT_30157]. For 
conti
nuous variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of variation (if appropriate), median, minimum and maximum, percentiles and 
95% C.I by [CONTACT_866971].  
The change in efficacy parameters, PD , R and RAL during the 24 week treatment, will be modelled 
using a linear-mixed model (SAS® 9.2 Mixed Procedure) with treatment as fixed factors. Patient and 
pocket will be entered as random effects. The model will be adjusted for smoking status Gingival 
Index (GI) and medical center. Additional potential parameters suspected as influencing the outcome 
variable will be tested at 0.10 confidence level. Parameters that will achieve statistical significance 
≤10% will be added to the model as covariates. The adequacy of the Mixed Model will be checked 
and if needed a normalizing transformation will be performed. This model will be used for the 
reduction in PD, R and for improvement in RAL for the treated peri-implant pockets. 
Contrasts with 95% C.I for the difference or ratio between the changes will be computed. 
The Paired T-test or Signed rank test for two means (paired observations) (as is appropriate) will be 
applied for testing the statistical significance of the decrease in PD at each time point within each 
study group. 
The two-sample T-test or Non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Rank sum test for independent 
samples (as is appropriate) will be applied for testing the statistical significance of the difference in 
the percent PD decrease from baseline between the study groups. 
Patients may have multiple pockets being treated. All treated pockets will be taken into account to 
create a by-pocket analysis in addition to the by-patient analysis. 
Corresponding 95% C.I for the difference between treatments not including zero for linear model, or 
95% C.I for the ratios between treatments not including unity for the log-linear regression will prove 
superior to treatment with PerioChip® versus Subgingival debridement.  
Anal
ysis for the number of pockets with at least 1 mm reduction in PD, and analysis for BOP for the 
target implant/s measured at each visit will be analyzed by a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as is 
appropriate. 
Logistic regression will be applied for testing the above differences with adjustment to smoking status, 
GI, medical center and other suspected confounders, if found. Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence 
Interval will be calculated using the Logistic model.   
Similar mixed models for PD, R and RAL with time as a fixed repeated covariate will be used to reveal 
the changes of these parameters over time. 
A hierarchical model will be used for an alyzing the secondary endpoints ( refer to  section 8.4) . 
Analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_866972]® 9.2, or a higher Edition  
12. Safety Evaluation  
Safety assessments will be based on Adverse Events (AEs) and oral inspections recorded at each visit.  
All AEs will be coded using coding dictionaries MedDRA version 16.0 or higher and will be

 summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. AEs will be described by [CONTACT_12917], onset 
and resolution dates, duration, severity, pattern, action taken, relationship to the study drug and 
outcome.    
The primary safety evaluation of the PerioChip® will be performed by [CONTACT_866973]. Specifically, the number of AEs reported for each treatment group will be compared to 
see if there is a treatment-related difference in the appearance of the following: 
1. Number of dental-related AEs, such as dental or gingival pain. 
2. Observed changes in the clinical appearance of the tissues at each of the oral inspections relative 
to baseline. 
The number of dental-related AEs reported and the time of first occurrence of dental-related events 
will be evaluated to assess if the event is associated with the chip insertion. In addition, all other 
reported AEs will be evaluated for any treatment related effects. 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact test will be applied for testing the above differences between the 
groups. 
Oral inspections will evaluate any changes from baseline in the target implant/s that can be attributed 
to treatment.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Peri-implantitis  
P
eri-implantitis is an inflammatory process caused by [CONTACT_84798]-organisms 
aff
ecting the tissues around an osseointegrated implant in function, resulting in 
a loss of supporting bone (Albrektsson & Isidor, 1994). 
The above definition was consecutively reviewed and followed by [CONTACT_866975] (2008) and the Consensus of Lindhe and Meyle (2008) was: 
"Peri-implant Mucositis and Peri-implantitis are infectious diseases. In Peri-
implantitis the inflammatory lesion affect the supporting bone and there should 
be loss of the supporting marginal bone".    
Pe
ri-implantitis may display some or all of the following symptoms; bleeding 
on probing
 (BOP), increased Probing Pocket Depth (PD), mobility, suppuration 
and pain. In peri-implantitis the bio-film in the peri-implant area is dominated 
by [CONTACT_866976][INVESTIGATOR_866956] (Zitz mann & Be rglundh, 2008). 
The 
treatment in peri-implants infections basically used the same intervention 
protocols 
as in Periodontitis treatment.  The aim in both diseases is maximum 
reduction of the subgingival bacterial load presenting the deepened and 
inflamed pockets.  In peri-implant infections a greater difficulty in mechanical 
treatment is experienced because of the often rough implant surfaces and the 
screw-like morphology of many implant systems (Renvert, Roos-Jansaker, & 
Claf
fey, 2008).

[ADDRESS_1209522] 2017 Page 15 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 in clinical dentistry for many decades (Heasman, Heasman , Stacey & 
McCracken, 2001; Fardall, & Turnbull, 1986). For several decades it is used in 
oral 
rinses in various concentrations ranging from 0.02% to 0.2% (Briner, 
Grossm
an, & Buckner, 1986). It is applied in dentifrices, gels, toothpaste gels 
and in carriers allowing sustained delivery of the drug.  
In several in vitro and in vivo studies it has been demonstrated that 
Chlorhexidine exerts a bactericidal as well as an anti-collagenolytic effect if 
administered locally in the periodontal pockets. Recent data from animal 
experiments even suggest a beneficial action inside the body (Houri-Haddad, 
Halabi, & Soskolne, 2008).  
Se
veral in vitro investigations have demonstrated that Chlorhexidine is 
adsorbed to the oxide layer of titanium surfaces. Recent data indicate that the 
type of oxide may influence the amount of Chlorhexidine absorbed (Barbour , 
Gandhi, el-Turki, O'Sullivan, & Jagger, 2009; Morra, Cassinelli, Cascardo, 
Ca
rpi, Fini, Giavaresi, et al. 2004). It has also been shown that the amount 
increases with greater surface roughness and correlates positively with the 
concentration of the Chlorhexidine solution. A desorption occurs within 24 
hours and inhibits bacterial growth (Kozlovsky, Artzi, Moses, Kamin-Belsky, 
& Gr
eenstein, 2006).  
In 
peri-implantitis lesions, mechanical debridement in conjunction with the 
application of a 0.2% Chlorhexidine gel resulted in clinical improvement 
including significant reduction of BOP, pocket depth (PD) reduction and 
clinical attachment gain (Salvi, Persson, Heitz-Mayfield, Frei, & Lang, 2007).  
Data collected in case series and randomized controlled clinical trials point ed 
toward
 the benefits of an adjunctive local antimicrobial regimen (Minocycline 
sphere
s) as well as a disinfective treatment with 1% Chlorhexidine gel (Persson, 
Salvi, Heitz-Mayfield, & Lang, 2006;  Renvert, Lessem, Dahle'n, Lindahl, & 
Svensson, 2006; Salvi et al. 2007). The effect of local disinfection was less 
pronounced than the local administration of antibiotics (Renvert, Lessem, 
Lindahl, & Svensson, 2004; Renvert, et al. 2006; Renvert S., Roos-Jansaker,

[ADDRESS_1209523] 2017 Page 16 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 Lindahl, Renvert, H., & Persson, 2007). Although it might have an effect, the 
adjunctive use of antibiotics (Minocycline microspheres) to mechanical 
debridement fell to be advantages over other adjunctive therapy method (Schär, 
Ramseier, Eick, Arweiler, Sculean, & Salvi, 2013).  
1.3  PerioChip®  
Pe
rioChip® is a small rectangular chip (rounded at one end), orange-brown, 
rigid, thin film chip that is 4.8 mm in length, about 3.8 mm wide and about 350 
m thick. It contains 2.5 mg Chlorhexidine gluconate in a cross-linked gelatin 
matrix
.  The PerioChip® biodegrades within the periodontal pocket, slowly 
releasing the Chlorhexidine gluconate directly into the gingival crevicular fluid. 
Following insertion of a PerioChip®, Chlorhexidine concentrations greater than 
100 µg/mL within the periodontal pocket are achieved for a week or longer. 
Sub
-gingival bacteria have been demonstrated to be suppressed for up to 11 
weeks following PerioChip® insertion.  The bio- degradable  matrix of the chip 
degrades over 7 -10 days, elim inating the need for a second dental appointment 
for removal.  
Studies with PerioChip® showed reductions in the numbers of the putative 
periodontopathic organisms Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, 
Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus, and Campylobacter 
rectus (Wolinella recta) after insertion of the chip. No overgrowth of 
opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial 
ecosystem were noted.  
A recent placebo-controlled clinical study which compared PerioChip® and 
Placebo chip found greater reduction in the number of "red complex" 
(Specifically: Pg, Tf and Td ) organisms and improved clinical attachment level 
following PerioChip®   insertion ( Gonzales, Harnack,  Schmitt-Corsitto , 
Boedeker, Chakraborty,  Domann, et al. 2011). Moreover, Meyle , Amm oura, 
Hamid, Rolf -Hasso, Trinad, & E ugen  (2005), found that even in the absence of 
mechanical treatment  Chlorhexidine  chip demonstrated significant reduction in 
periodontopathic organisms and improved clinical results. These results are in

[ADDRESS_1209524] 2017 Page 17 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 line with former multi-center studies which demonstrated a clinical and 
microbiological advantage for using the PerioChip® in conjunction with 
scaling and root planning (SRP) ( Paolantonio , D'Angelo,  Grassi , Perinetti , 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_866957] , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_69020] , et al. 2008).  
Je
ffcoat, Bray, Ciancio, Dentino, Fine, Gordon, et al. (1998) reported a mean 
probing depth reduction of 0.95 mm after 9 months in patients treated with SRP 
+ Pe
rioChip® compared to 0.[ADDRESS_1209525] clinical significance, the percentage of patient s 
experiencing a decrease of more than 2.0 mm was 30.3% for the SRP + 
Pe
rioChip® group vs. 13.5% for the SRP-only group. A reduction of 2.0 mm or 
gr
eater is generally considered clinically significant (see also Jeffcoat, Palcanis, 
Weatherford, Reese, Geurs, & Flashner, 2000). 
The 
use of PerioChip® as a treatment of peri-implant disease infection, e.g. Peri-
implantit
is, was recently studied in a phase IIa multi-center, randomized, 
double-blind, parallel, two-arm placebo-controlled clinical trial. The results 
showed that controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery treatment in peri-
implantitis is effective and has high safety profile without any related SAE's 
and without worsening of peri-implantitis clinical symptoms (Machtei, 
Frankenthal, Levi, Elimelech, Shoshani, Rosenfeld, et. al. 2012).    
1.4  Study Rationale 
On 
the basis of the information on the effectiveness of Chlorhexidine and the 
local application of sustained delivery system with Chlorhexidine  gluconate 
(PerioChip®) in periodontal disease  and the very recent data fro m a phase IIa 
study (CLI/013P) in [ADDRESS_1209526] 
that use of PerioChip® will benefit the treatment of peri -implant infections for 
several reasons:  
1. PerioChip® has been proven clinically beneficial in the treatment of 
moderate periodontitis lesions and in a small population of peri-
implantitis patients.  Given these promising results with peri-implantitis 
CONFIDENTIAL   Dexcel Pharma Technologies Ltd. 
Chlorhexidine Gluconate Chip (PerioChip®)  Clinical Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1209527] 2017 Page 18 Protocol # CLI/016P –version [ADDRESS_1209528] shown to be 
mi
nimal in terms of medical complications.  Apart from occasionally 
reported complaints of discomfort, the side effects of the PerioChip® are 
minimal.  
6. The slow release of PerioChip® provides long-term maintenance of 
therapeutic levels of the drug without concerns for patient compliance.  
Ba
sed on the available scientific information reported in peer reviewed studies, 
one may expect beneficial clinical and microbiological effects of local 
application of a high concentration of Chlorhexidine provided in a sustained 
delivery system such as the PerioChip® in the control of peri-implant infections.  
There is a worldwide need of adjunct antiseptic devices in the control of peri-
implant mucositis and peri-implantitis.  There is a preference of local antiseptic 
treatment of these infections over the use of systemic antibiotics.  The 
PerioChip® therefore should be investigated in the anti-infective treatment of

4. STUD
Y DESIGN AND DURATION  
This study is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind masking, parallel , two-arm clinical 
study
.        
The 
duration of patient follow-up will be 25-28 weeks (including Screening  a nd hygienic 
phase visit s), with interim visits at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1 0, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.   
Dur
ing the Baseline visit, eligible patients will be randomized to one of the following 
treatment regimens: 
Treatment 1 – Subgingival debridement + Chlorhexidine Gluconate chip (PerioChip®) 
inserted every fortnight, starting at baseline, for the first 12 weeks. 
Tre
atment 2 – Subgingival debridement.   
The 
reason for preferring the above design over the Double-blind, Placebo-controlled 
design is that in previous clinical studies with PerioChip® it was evident that when used 
Placebo chips have worse clinical outcome compare to No-chip. Namely , periodontal 
pocke
ts treated with Placebo chips showed less improvement in PD and attachment levels 
compare to No-chip treated pockets. It was also noted that at six months following the use 
of 
Placebo chips fewer incidences of patients were considered to have healthy pockets. The 
results of these studies suggest, that placing of the Placebo chip acting as a mechanical 
barrier preventing environmental/outside improvement in the pockets (Perio Products-I ; 
Perio products- II). Due to the above mentioned findings the use of Placebo treatment arm 
is less adequate. In this case excluding the Placebo arm from the study design ultimately 
prevents the establishment of Double-blind procedure.   
The
 above treatments will be applied for at least 1 (one) and not more than 2 (two) implants 
in the 
oral cavity with clinical and radiographical signs of peri -implantitis.  Peri- implantitis 
is 
defined a s marginal bone loss of at least [ADDRESS_1209532] 2 mm 
distal and mesial supporting bone left from the apex to the coronal direction , in 
combination with bleeding and/or suppuration on probing and a peri -implant Probing 
Depth (PD) o f 5-8 mm.

[ADDRESS_1209533] 2017 Page 21 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 All pocket measurements (PD, BOP and R) and chip insertions will be made in the same 
order of procedures every time.  
Calibrated examiners will perform all the measurements during the studyThe person 
(phy
sician/hygienist) placing the Chlorhexidine chips in the periodontal pockets or 
performing the Subgingival debridement, according to the randomization, will not be 
involved in target pockets measurements (i.e. the examiner and the physician/hygienist 
placing the chip or performing the Subgingival debridement will be two different persons). 
The 
primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean probing Pocket Depth (PD) reductions 
(absolute change) at week 24 compared to baseline, for the selected target implant/s.   
For secondary endpoints the following will be used: 
 P D measurement at week 24 compared to baseline in patients with baseline PD 
measurement of 6 -8 mm inclusive.  
 Bleeding on Probing (BOP) measurements at week 16 and 24 compared to baseline. 

 PD measurement at week 16 compared to baseline. 
F
or exploratory endpoints the following will be used:  
 PD, BOP and RAL measurements at week [ADDRESS_1209534] 2 
mm from baseline PD of 6-8 mm inclusive. 
 PD and BOP measurement at weeks 8 and 12 compared to baseline. 

 Recession (R) and Relative Attachment Levels (RAL) measurements at weeks 8, 12, 
16 a
nd 24 compare to baseline. 
 PD measurement at week 12 and 16 compared to week 24. 
 PD, BOP, RAL and R measured at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 24 for all 4 sites (mesio-
buccal, mid-buccal , disto-buccal  and mid-lingual), surrounding the selected target 
implant/s, compared to baseline.

(one) and no more than 2 (two) implant/s (if available) will be selected as a target pocket, 
and will be used for chip/s insertion or Subgingival Debridement and as the primary 
efficacy end-point. 
The target pocket in the selected implant/s, will be treated at each visit with the same 
trea
tment arm, initiated at Baseline visit, as described below. 
Impl
ant/s which were not selected as target implant/s will be treated as per the investigators 
discretion as long as  it does not affect the study inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. treatment 
with antibiotics or surgery next to a target implant included in the study).  
Treatment 1: (PerioChip®) 
Subgingival debridement will be carried out for each one of the target implant which its 
probing
 pockets depth (PD of 5-8 mm) were selected as target pockets (the Subgingival 
debride
ment procedure will be employ ed twice: at baseline (visit 2) and after 3 months, at 
visit 8).  
Upon c
ompletion of the debridement a PerioChip® will be inserted in each one of the target 
implant. 
Pe
rioChip® contains 2.5 mg Chlorhexidine Gluconate formulated in a biodegradable cross 
linke
d gelatine matrix. The maximum dosage for each implant is 5 mg Chlorhexidine 
Glucona
te (i.e. up to 2 PerioChips can be inserted to one implant) and 10 mg of 
Chlorhexidine Gluconate for each patient per visit. The total number of PerioChips that 
can be inserted to one patient in one given visit will not exceed 4 PerioChips.  
The 
number of chips inserted to one implant will be a function of the pocket width. In case 
2 chips are used in one implant, the insertion will be to the target pocket and the implant 
surfa
ce which is not adjacent to the target pocket (i.e. Buccal - Lingual or Mesial - Distal).  
The
 insertion place should be recorded in the Source Document . All subsequent insertion 
must be repeated to the exact place chosen in the first insertion procedure.

 6.2  Study Procedures by [CONTACT_4838]   
6.2.1
 Screening Visit and Hygienic Phase Therapy (Weeks (-3 to -1))  
At the 
Screening visit (Weeks (-3 to -1)) , patients will come to the 
c
linical facility for screening by [CONTACT_866979] [INVESTIGATOR_866962] (inclusion/exclusion criteria). Prior to any study activities, 
patients will be asked to read an Informed Consent Form that has been 
approved previously by [CONTACT_6179]. Patients will be given adequate time to 
c
onsider any information concerning the study and the opportunity to 
ask the Investigator any questions regarding potential risks and benefits 
of participation in the study.  
Written and personally signed and dated Informed Consent Form must 
be obtained from the patient prior to the patient entering the study.  The 
consenting physician must also sign and date the consent form. A copy 
of the Informed Consent Form will be given to the patient. 
Other assessments at this visit will include: 
Demographic data (including date of birth, sex, weight, height, race, and 
tobacco use history), review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
relevant past medical history and concomitant diseases, pregnancy 
assessment (will be done by [CONTACT_866980]), concomitant medication, periapi[INVESTIGATOR_866963] 1 (one ) year prior the Screening visit, oral inflammation 
and infection inspection and treatment need assessment.  
In 
addition, number of natural teeth, implants and over all dental 
condit
ion will be recorded and a full mouth (implant and natural teeth) 
periodontal pocket examinations, PD, R, and BOP, will be carried out 
and re
corded.

 patient, eligible to participate in the study, may undergo 
subje
cted to the Principal Investigator ( PI) or delegated 
physician oral inspection. The hygienic phase period will be 
design to complete within the allowance window of 14 ± [ADDRESS_1209555] 3 days prior to baseline visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Probing Pocket Depth (PD) 
PD is the measurement of the distance from the coronal edge of 
the gingival margin to the base of the pocket. PD will be 
measured at fou r sites per implant : mesio-buccal , mid-buccal, 
disto-buccal and mid-lingual . Measurement s will be taken with 
a standard 15-mm University of North Carolina (UNC) 
pe
riodontal probe. For recording pocket depth, the probe tip will 
be placed at the bottom of t he pocket and the pocket depth will 
be read directly from the mill imetres  markings on the probe.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recession (R) 
Recession is defined as the distance in millimetres that the free 
gingival margin has migrated api[INVESTIGATOR_866964]
d using a standard 15- mm UNC periodontal probe. If 
the re
ference point is other than the coronal line of the crown it 
should be
 exactly defined in the source document. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relative
 Attachment Level ( RAL ) 
Loss 
of attachment is defined as the distance in millimetres that   
the base of the pocket has migrated api[INVESTIGATOR_866965]. RAL will be calculated at the 
same 
site mentioned above, by [CONTACT_233563] R measurement to the 
PD measurement. The RAL calculation will be performed by [CONTACT_866981].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Bleeding on Probing (BOP) 
BOP will be measured at the same site immediately after 
measuring the PD. The scoring system used for recording the 
BOP is a dichotomous one:  
  0 = No bleeding 
  1 = BOP at the base of the pocket 
 
Pa
tients who qualify for the initial examination will be required to have: 
 At least 1 (one) implant in the oral cavity with clinical and 
radiographical signs of peri -implantitis. Peri- implantitis is defined a s 
mar
ginal bone loss of at least 3 mm from implant shoulder, in 
combination with bleeding and/or suppuration on probing and a peri -
implant Probing Depth (PD) of 5-8 mm.  
 The 
implants have been exposed to the oral environment for more than 
2 years. 
 At least 2 mm distal and mesial supporting bone left from the apex to 
the corona
l direction. 
The qualified patient will undergo Supragingival scaling for all the teeth and 
implants (if not done up to 6 weeks prior the Screening visit) and in addition 
the patients will be provided with toothpaste and tooth brushes by [CONTACT_866982]. The 
Investigator or designee will give full instructions to the patient regarding the 
importance of good hygiene of the mouth. Patients will be restricted from any 
use of Chlorhexidine oral rinses/mouthwashes during the study. 
The
 period between Screening visit and Baseline visit should not exceed 14 ± 
7 days .

Sc
reening visit will be re-assessed as follows: 
1. In cases where no more than 2 (two) potential target implants are 
pre
sent, the deepest periodontal pocket of each implant/s (out of 
the 4 sites per implant that were measured) will be selected as a 
target pocket. 
2. In case of presence of 3 (three) or more potential target pockets, 
in 
three or more different implants in one side of the jaw (upper 
or lower jaw ) that are identical in depth, the two deepest  pockets 
in the two implants that are furthest away from each other will be 
selected.  
3. In case of presence of 3 (three) or more potential target pockets in 
thre

 in differentiating between patient screening numbers. 
7.2  Randomization Codes 
Elig
ible patients at Baseline visit will be assigned a randomization number. The 
order will start from: 101 
Eac
h randomization number will be randomly assigned to one of the two letters 
A or B; each letter will be assigned randomly to one of the two treatments 
Subg
ingival debridement + PerioChip® or Subgingival debridement alone. 
The randomization will be generated using a computerized algorithm of random 
numbers by [CONTACT_866987]® program , prior to 
the study start.  
The randomization will be performed with stratification to smoking habits and 
Baseline PD measurement in balanced blocks, each block containing 6 subjects 
(3 per treatment Subgingival debridement + PerioChip® and 3 per treatment 
Subgingival debridement alone). Randomization blocks will be sent to the sites 
by [CONTACT_866988]. Each site will receive 4 types of lists 
by [CONTACT_866989] (smokers with PD 5 mm, smokers with PD 6-8 mm, 
non-smokers with PD 5 mm and non-smokers with PD 6-8 mm). Additional 
blocks wil
l be provided to the sites according to the recruitment rate.  
One 
hundre d and twenty three (123 ) chip packages, each containing 60 chips 
for 
one patient will be prepared for the Subgingival debridement + Pe rioChip® 
treatment.  
7.3  Blinding 
At 
the Baseline visit the patient will start receiving one of the two treatments 
(S
ubgingiv al debridement followed by [CONTACT_866990]® or Subgingival 
debridement alone ), since only the examiner  who conduct s the measurements  
is blinded to the study treatment s the masking is considered "single blinding".  
In 
order to maintain the study blinding condition, in each visit prior to 
evaluation, the examiner will instruct the patients to refrain of bringing up

 whether they did or did not received a PerioChip® in the previous visits. 
One set of sealed envelopes will be provided to the Investigator containing 
individual randomization codes and will be kept at the investigational site.

patients in the Subgingival debridement + PerioChip® arm and at least 123 
patients in the Subgingival debridement alone arm, considering expected 
pati
ent drop-out rate estimation of be tween 12% -15% 
Based on previous phase IIa studies, the expected drop-out rate in this study 
will be between 20%-25%. Thus, i t is estimated that approximately 375 patients 
will be screened in order to randomize   up to 290 patie nts, of which 246 patients 
will complete all required study visits .The sample size is determined base d on 
relevant literature  (Machtei et al. 2012)  and previous phase IIa study 
(CLI/013P) in peri- implantitis patients that  demonstrated substantial 
improveme nt (trend toward significant, p = 0.07) in  PD reduction between 
PerioChip® and Placebo chip.   
The 
rational for sample size calculated is based on detecting a difference of 0.50 
mm in PD reduction from baseline between PerioChip® and Placebo chip, with 
5% statistical significance and 85% power. 
A sampl
e size of [ADDRESS_1209568] 85% power to detect a difference 
in 
means of -0.50 mm (the difference between a Group 1 mean, of -2.29 and a 
Group 2 mean, of -1.79) assuming that the common standard deviation is 1.[ADDRESS_1209569] with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. 
CONFIDENTIAL   Dexcel Pharma Technologies Ltd. 
Chlorhexidine Gluconate Chip (PerioChip®)  Clinical Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1209570] 2017 Page 41 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 Statistical significance level for all statistical analysis was set to 5%. 
It is worth noting that although parameters used in the above calculation are 
derived from a placebo-controlled design, it is reasonable to assume this 
calculation is more conservative than if the parameter used were taken from 
previous studies where the study design included a treatment arm with no chip 
assigned, in Periodontitis patients. 
In other words, the sample size calculation is based on sound data derived from 
a study design which used the same indication (peri-implantitis) and treatment 
regimen (frequent chip insertion ) as appear in the current protocol.   
8.2 Analysis Population 
Thr
ee study populations will be defined for data analysis: 
1. Intent- to- treat (ITT) population –  all patients randomized for one of the 
treatment arms and treated with at least one chip of study treatment or 
underwent Subgingival debridement will be used for assessments related to 
efficacy and all safety evaluations.  
2. Modified-Intention- to- Treat (mITT) population – all patients in the ITT 
population with no major protocol violations, used to confirm the 
assessments related to efficacy. 
3. Per Protocol (PP) population – all patients in the ITT population who 
compl
eted the study according to the protocol and with no major protocol 
violations.    
8.3 Efficacy Endpoints 
8.3.1
  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
At 
week 24, compared to baseline, the mean probing Pocket Depth (PD) 
reductions (absolute change) for the selected target implant/s will be 
used as the primary efficacy endpoint.   
8.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

 PD, 
BOP, RAL and R measured at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 24 for all 4 
sites (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal and mid-lingual), 
surrounding
 the selected target implant/s, compared to baseline.

[ADDRESS_1209574] 2017 Page 43 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 The change in efficacy parameters, PD, R and RAL during the 24 week 
treatment, will be modelled using a linear-mixed model (SAS® 9.2 Mixed 
Procedure) with treatment as fixed factors. Patient and pocket will be entered 
as random effects. The treatment- by-center interaction will be tested and if 
achieve statistical significance of ≤5% will be added to the model as covariate.  
The analysis will be adjusted to the following covariates known to have 
influence on the efficacy parameters: age, gender, smoking status and baseline 
measurements. The adequacy of the Mixed Model will be checked and if needed 
a normalizing transformation will be performed. This model will be used for 
the reduction in PD, R and for improvement in RAL.  
Contra
sts with 95% C.I. for the difference or ratio between the changes will be 
comput
ed. 
The Paired T-test or Signed rank test for two means (paired observations) (as is 
appropriate) will be applied for testing the statistical significance of the 
decrease in PD at each time point within each study group. 
The two-sample T-test or Non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann -Whitney Rank sum 
test for independent samples (as is appropriate) will be applied for testing the 
statistical significance of the difference in the percent PD decrease from 
baseline between the study groups. 
Patients may have multiple pockets being treated. All treated pockets will be 
taken into account to create a by-pocket analysis in addition to the by-patient 
analysis. 
Corresponding 95% C.I. for the difference between treatments not including 
zero for linear model, or 95% C.I. for the ratios between treatments not 
including unity for the log-linear regression will prove superior to treatment 
with PerioChip® versus Subgingival debridement.  
Analysis for the number of pockets with at least [ADDRESS_1209575] 2 mm 
reduc
tion in PD, and analysis for BOP for the target implant/s measured at each 
visit will be analyzed by a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as is appropriate.

Chlorhexidine Gluconate Chip (PerioChip®)  Clinical Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1209576] 2017 Page 44 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
 Logistic regression will be applied for testing the above differences with 
adjustment to smoking status, GI, medical center and other suspected 
confounders, if found. Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval will be 
calcula
ted using the Logistic model. 
Similar mixed models for PD, R and RAL with time as a fixed repeated 
covariate will be used to reveal the changes of these parameters over time. 
A hierarchical model will be used for analysing the secondary endpoints. 
The secondary endpoints will be analysed according to pre-defined order: 
1. PD changes at 24 weeks from baseline in patients with baseline PD of 6- 8 
mm
 inclusive. 
2. BOP changes at 24 weeks from baseline 
3.
 BOP changes at 16 weeks from baseline 
4.
 PD changes at 16 weeks from baseline 
The
 following stages will be applied: 
1. The 1st secondary endpoint in the ordered list will be tested at 5% 
significance level. If it achieves statistical significance then the 2nd 
secondary endpoint will be analysed (stage 2). Otherwise the other 
secondary endpoints in the list will not formally be tested.  
2. The 2nd secondary endpoint in the ordered list will be tested at 5% 
significance level. If it achieves statistical significance then the 3rd 
secondary endpoint will be analysed (stage 3). Otherwise the other 
secondary endpoints in the list will not formally be tested.  
3. The process will continue for all the secondary endpoints according to the 
list until a secondary endpoint is not significant or until all secondary 
endpoints have been found significant.  
All treatment comparison will be two-sided at the 0.05 level of significance. 
The primary time-point for all analyses will be at 24 weeks.

8.5 Safety Evaluation 
S
afety assessment will be based on AEs and oral inspection s recorded at each 
visit.  
All AEs will be coded using coding dictionaries  MedDRA version 16.0 or 
higher and will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. AEs 
will be described by [CONTACT_12917], onset and resolution  date s, duration, severity, 
pa
ttern, action taken , relationship to the study drug and outcome.     
The
 primary safety evaluation of the PerioChip® will be performed by 
[CONTACT_866991]. Specifically, the number 
of AEs reported for each treatment group will be compared to see if there is a 
treatment-related difference in the appearance of the following: 
1. Number of dental-related AEs, such as dental or gingival pain. 
2.
 Observed changes in the clinical appearance of the tissues at each of the oral 
inspec
tions relative to baseline. 
The number of dental-related AEs reported and the time of first occurrence of 
dental-related events will be evaluated to assess if the event is associated with 
the c
hip insertion. In addition, all other reported AEs will be evaluated for any 
treatment related effects. To clarify, AEs that we re reported more than once by 
a subject during the same period will be counted only once for that subject and 
period at the maximum severity.  
Chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact test will be applied for testing the above 
differences between the groups. 
Oral inspections will evaluate any changes from baseline in the target implant/ s 
that can be attributed to treatment. 
8.6  Handling of Missing data 
Missing data will be handled for imputation the primary endpoint data.

 The MMRM model (Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measures), which is 
based on MAR (missing at random) assumption will be applied to all ITT 
subjects.  
Sensitivity analyses will be applied for testing the effect of the imputation on 
the treatment effect. This will show the influence of the imputation on the study 
results.  
9. HANDALING ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Definitions 
An 
Adverse Event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which 
does not
 necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  New inter current illnesses or injuries after a patient 
signs the study Informed Consent Form should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal, 

 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms, 

 leads to treatment or further diagnostic tests, or 

 is considere d by [CONTACT_125943]. 
AEs are classified as either serious or non-serious.  A Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) is any event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 death, 
 are life threatening, 


Chlorhexidine Gluconate Chip (PerioChip®)  Clinical Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1209579] 2017 Page 47 Protocol # CLI/016P –version 7  
  persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 

 a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or malignancy 

 other important medical event. 
All 
AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-SAEs. 
The 
study period for the purpose of AE reporting is defined as the period from 
the initiation of study to the end of the follow-up period.  Although not 
considered a serious adverse event, it is the responsibility of the Investigator, or 
his 
designee, to report any pregnancy (spontaneously reported to them), which 
begins during the course of the study.  At that time, all study-related medication 
should be stopped and the patient discontinued from the study.  All patients who 
become pregnant must be followed up until completion/termination of the 
pregnancy.  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the 
infant) must also be reported by [CONTACT_866992]. 
9.[ADDRESS_1209580] be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization or until 
it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause.   
9.3   Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs during the study period, whether or not considered to be related to 
study treatment are to be reported immediately to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event.  The report should be made 
to one of the Sponsor's representatives as detail ed in the CRF SAE Form.

1.0 GOALS AN D OBJ ECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
1.1 Primary Aims  
 
1.1.1 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 
dose of entinostat adminis tered as a single -agent, once weekly to children with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  
 
1.1.3 To characte rize the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in children with recurrent or 
refractory cancer.  
 
1.2 Secondary Aims  
 
1.2.1 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of entinostat within the confines of 
a Phase 1 study.  
 
1.2.2 To assess change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a marker of the biologic activity of entinostat.  
 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
 
HDAC inhibitors as anti -cancer agents  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_166093] a mechanism for controlling gene expression by [CONTACT_166109]. Along with methylation, acetylation of histones plays a key role 
in regulating gene expression by [CONTACT_166110].1 
Histone acetylation relaxes the chromatin conformation and allo ws access of transcription 
factors to DNA promoter  regions, thus leading to gene expression. Histone acetyl 
transferases (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes modulate acetylation, which 
determines whether the nucleosome complex is in a more compact  or open state.[ADDRESS_192766] proteins.3 The Clas s I family consists of HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8. The Class II family 
contains HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9 (class IIa) as well as HDACs 6 and 10 (class IIb). Class III 
HDACs are also known as SIRTs and include seven family members. The class IV family

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_192767] and differentiation in many 
cancer cell lines. Several HDAC inhibitors are in various stages of development.  
  
Entinostat (SNDX -275) 
Entinostat (SNDX -275) is an oral small molecule inhibitor of class I and IV HDACs 
(HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 11).[ADDRESS_192768] a variety of cancers.7 
 
Entinostat strongly inhibits the class I HDACs, HDACs 1, 2, and 3 with IC 50 values of 
0.119 M, 0.123 M, and 0.181 M, respectively.8 The agent also inhibits HDAC 11 with 
an IC 50 of 0.427 M, but is considerably less eff ective at inhibiting other HDACs.  Growth 
of several human cancer cell lines was inhibited by [CONTACT_166111] 50 values ranging 
from 0.041 to 4.71 M. Entinostat was most potent against ovarian cancer (IC 50 = 0.0415 
M), lung cancer (IC 50 = 0.0195 M), l eukemia (IC 50 = 0.0212 -0.589 M), and gastric 
cancer (IC 50 = 0.820 M) cell lines.[ADDRESS_192769] were observed. In addition, 
hyperacetylation of histones was seen in tumor cell lines at concentrations of 0.3  and 
1 M. Entinostat also demonstrated significant in vivo antitumor activity against xenograft 
models of melanoma, prostate, breast, and non -small cell lung cancer.[ADDRESS_192770] ca ncer models, combination of entinostat 
overcomes resistance to aromatase inhibitors.10 Entinostat also shows synergy with EGFR 
inhibition in lung cancer cell lines.11

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_192771] several pediatric solid tumor 
cell lines, including the Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (entinostat IC 50 = 0.062 
M versus vorinostat IC 50: 1.72 M) and TC -71 Ewing sarcoma cell line 
(entinostat IC 50 = 0.10 M versus vorinostat IC 50 = 1.28 M).6,12 Similar to the 
HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and sodium butyrate, treatment of Ewing sarcoma 
cells with entinostat leads to histone acetylation, growth inhibition, and 
apoptosis.13 
 
In cell lines derived from osteosarcoma lung metastases, entinostat induces Fas 
ligand mediated cell death through downregulation of the apoptosis inhibitor, c -
FLIP. In vivo  treatment with entinostat resulted in decreased c -FLIP expression 
and induced tumo r regression in nu/nu -mice with osteosarcoma lung metastases.14 
Growth of established tumors in neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma models were 
also significantly suppres sed with entinostat doses of 24.5 mg/kg given every 5 -7 
days.6 
 
In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Pax3:Foxo1  fusion oncogene mediates resistance 
to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. There is some evidence that Pax3:Foxo1  
expression may be epi[INVESTIGATOR_166094]. Treatment with entinostat silences 
protein and mRNA expression of Pax3:Foxo1  in both mouse and human alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) cells.[ADDRESS_192772] on Pax3:Foxo1  expression in human ARMS cells. Moreover, 
through apparent downregulation of Pax3:Foxo1  expression, entinostat separately 
shows synergy with each vincristine, actinomycin -D, and radiation therapy in an 
orthotopic mouse model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Entinostat appears to 
enhance the effects of vincristine in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma as well, 
although the mechanism for this effect is unclear.16 
 
Data suggests that aberrant regulation of histone acetylation also plays in the 
progression and m aintenance of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. 
As a single -agent, vorinostat has shown activity against glioma, medulloblastoma, 
and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells.17-[ADDRESS_192773] 
shown synergy with vorinostat and radiation in pediatric brain tumor cells.20 The 
Children’s Oncology Group ACNS0927 study evaluated vorinostat in combination 
with radiation therapy for children  with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and 
efficacy data from this study is pending. Similar to vorinostat, entinostat enhances 
the effect of radiation in human glioma cells.21 In addition, entinostat enhances 
chemotherapy -induced apoptosis in primary human medulloblastoma cells by

promoting p53 -dependent activation of Bax.22 In combination with doxorubicin 
and other chemotherapeutic agents, entinostat induces apoptosis in glioblastoma 
cells and suppresses growth of medulloblastoma tumors in vivo.22,23 
 
HDAC inhibitors and entinostat, in particula r, may also be relevant in hematologic 
malignancies. In Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, entinostat inhibits proliferation 
and induces cell death. The anti -cancer activity of entinostat correlates with 
increased H3 acetylation and upregulation of p21 expressio n.24  
  
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology  
 
Single -dose toxicology studies were conducted in mice and rats. Maximum non -
lethal doses were 380 mg/kg in mice and 150 mg/ kg in rats. Repeated doses 
administered to rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated toxic 
effects on tissues with high cellular turnover. Adverse effects included fur 
thinning, scabbing of skin, atrophy of lymphatic organs, and bone marrow to xicity 
(leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia). Gastrointestinal toxicity was noted 
in monkeys (diarrhea, vomiting) and rats (diarrhea, reduced food consumption). 
Toxic effects on reproductive organs and fertility were noted, and embryo -fetal 
toxicity w as noted in rats and rabbits at doses below 2 mg/kg daily.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_192774] been evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, 
and monkeys using a liquid chromatography -mass spectroscopy method to 
measu re concentrations. Peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 5 and 
30 minutes after oral administration to mice, rats, and dogs and 2 hours after dosing 
in monkeys. Oral bioavailability after a single dose ranged from 30% in dogs to 
80% in monkeys. In dogs, lower gastric pH increased absorption of entinostat from 
30% to 55%, and feeding decreased absorption compared to fasting.  
 
Entinostat was moderately metabolically stable in liver microsomes of humans and 
all animal species evaluated as well as in  human cytochrome P -450 preparations. 
Reversible inhibition by [CONTACT_166112]2C8 and CYP3A4. Moderate 
reversible inhibition was also demonstrated for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1, but only by > 50% at the highest 
concen trations. Entinostat did not inhibit any UGT enzymes. It was found to 
induce CYP1A2, CYP2C6, and CYP2B8 as well as UGT1A4. No formal drug 
interaction studies have been performed.  
 
Entinostat was excreted to a similar extent in urine and feces of albino and  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922], with 68% to 85% excreted in the first 24 hours.  
 
2.3 Adult Studies

  ADVL1513  
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_192775] been completed in adults. Six trials (NCI 
or industry -sponsored) using entinostat as monotherapy have been completed. In a 
phase [ADDRESS_192776] dose level of 2 mg/m2.25 
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis s howed the half -life to be 39 to 80 hours. Twenty -eight 
patients were treated on a once every 14 -day schedule. The MTD was 10 mg/m2 
and dose -limiting toxicities were grade 3 fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.  
 
In another phase 1 trial in adults with r efractory solid tumors and lymphoid 
malignancies, entinostat was administered orally once weekly for 4 weeks of a 6 -
week cycle.26 Among  19 evaluable patients, no grade 4 toxicities were observed. 
DLTs were grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia. The 
MTD was 6 mg/m2 on this schedule. An additional phase 1 trial or entinostat 
evaluated multiple schedules.27 Toxicities were similar to other phase 1 trials an d 
DLTs were hypophosphatemia and asthenia. A twice -weekly schedule was found 
to not be tolerable, and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 4 mg/m2 when 
entinostat is given weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days.  
 
Several adult phase 1 combination trials with entinostat and other agents (including 
azacytidine, 13 -cis-retinoic acid, imatinib, sorafenib, clofarabine, and lapatanib) 
have been completed or are ongoing.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_192777] been completed. Single -
agent entinostat (15 mg weekly or 10 -15mg every other week) was well tolerated 
and demonstrated tumor reduction in 63% of evaluable patients in a phase 2 trial 
for patients with refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma.28 A phase 2 study using 2 
different dosing scheduled of single -agent entinostat for patients with metastatic 
melanoma s howed no objective responses, but stable disease in 25% of patients.[ADDRESS_192778] c ancer.30 Treatment 
with the entinostat combination improved PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months 
(one-sided p = 0.055)  and improved overall survival  from 19.8 months to 28.1 
months (one -sided p = 0.018) . Based on these data, entinostat has received 
Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). The combination of entinostat and exemestane is being evaluated in a 
Phase [ADDRESS_192779] cancer 
whose disease has progres sed on hormonal therapy.  
 
Based on the compi[INVESTIGATOR_166095], the recommended dose 
regimens for further development of entinostat in adults are 5 mg once weekly, 10 
mg once every 2 weeks, and 7 to 15 mg weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 -week  cycle.

2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
 
Pharmacokinetics of entinostat were characterized in three separate phase 1 
trials.25,27,31 Variability in pharmacokinetic parameters across the studies was seen, 
possibly due to different sampling schemes and different assays used in each study. 
In general, pharmacokinetics fo r entinostat were linear with proportional AUC and 
peak concentrations across dose levels up to 12 mg/m2, and toxicity appears to be 
dose-dependent. Entinostat is not metabolized by [CONTACT_166113], and the primary 
elimination pathway is unknown. The elimination half -life of entinostat ranged 
from [ADDRESS_192780] 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal.  
 
In a phase 1 trial, hyperacetylation of histone H3 was seen in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from sever al patients with solid tumors after administration of 
entinostat at doses of 2 mg/m2 and 10 mg/m2.25,[ADDRESS_192781] been no prior pediatric studies with entinostat.  
 
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
 
This will be a phase 1 dose -escalation trial of entinostat in pediatric patients with recurrent 
or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors and lymphoma. The primary study 
objectives are to identify t he maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D), characterize the toxicity profile, evaluate the change in histone acetylation, 
and describe the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in pediatric patients with solid tumors.  
 
Patients age 1 to 2 1 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors 
and lymphoma will be eligible. Entinostat will be administered orally at a starting dose of 
3 mg/m2 once weekly, which is equivalent to the RP2D of 5 mg in adults when entinostat 
is ad ministered on a weekly schedule. Entinostat will be administered continuously once 
weekly in 28 -day cycles. Cohorts will be enrolled and doses escalated using the rolling six 
design.32 Doses will be escalated by [CONTACT_3450] 30% in each subsequent cohort.  
 
The MTD will be determined from toxicities observed during the first cycle of treatment . 
The MTD will be the dose level below which ≥ [ADDRESS_192782] cycle of treatment.

9.0 AGENT INFORMATION  
 
9.1 Entinostat  
(SNDX -275, MS -275, NSC#706995, ), NCI -supplied  agent  
9.1.1 Structure and molecular weight  
Chemical name:  3-Pyridylmethyl N -{4-[(2-
aminophenyl)carbamoyl]benzyl}carbamate  
 
Molecular formula:  C21H20N4O3 
 
Structural formula:  
 
 
 
Molecular weight:   376.41  
 
Mechanism of action: Entinostat inhibits to a family of enzymes called histone 
deacetylases (HDACs) that regulate chromatin remodeling and gene transcription via 
the dynamic process of acetylation and deacetylation of core histones. Entinostat 
inhibits histone deacetylases, ch anges chromatin configuration, and induces 
differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells through an epi[INVESTIGATOR_166099].

Entinostat is supplied by [CONTACT_166119], Inc. and distributed by [CONTACT_52375], 
NCI.  
 
9.1.3 Formulation  
The agent is supplied as a 1 mg (pi[INVESTIGATOR_22759], in bottles of 40), or 5 mg (yellow, 
in bottles of 40) film -coated tablets (round -biconvex). Each tablet also contains 
mannitol, carboxymethyl starch sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium 
bicarbonate, and magnesium stearat e. The film coating consists of hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose, talc, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639] (red and yellow).  
 
9.1.4 Storage  
Store the bottles at room temperature (15 -30oC), and protect from light. Tablets 
may be dispensed in pharmacy amber dispensing bottles with storage at a 
temperature equal or below 15 -30C (59 -86F; do not freeze) with an expi[INVESTIGATOR_166100] [ADDRESS_192828] been performed in humans.  
Data from in vitro experiments showed that, while entinostat inhibited cytochrome 
P-450 enzymes 2B6 and 3A4, the degree of the inhibition make it unlikely that any 
in vivo systemic interactions would occur. Intestinal CYP 3A4 may be inhibited 
by [CONTACT_166120]. However, entinostat did not inhibit any UGT enzymes tested. In 
additi on, entinostat was found to induce CYP 1A2, CYP 2C6, and CYP 2B8 as 
well as UGT 1A4. Finally, entinostat is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_192829] (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent 
using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the 
comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Prot ocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and 
italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol

CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12.0 ). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See Section5_2 Section

A minimum of 4 patients will be enrolled in this study. The expected maximum number of 
evaluable patients req uired to estimate the MTD/RP2D is 12. Once the MTD or 
recommended Phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional patients with recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors may be enrolled to acquire PK data in a representative number of 
young patients (i.e. pat ients < 12 years old). Therefore, a maximum of 22 patients are 
expected to be enrolled which allows for 6 patients at each of 2 dose levels, 6 additional 
patients enrolled at the MTD/RP2D for PK analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. Review 
of the enrollmen t rate into previous COG new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients per 
month are available, which will permit completion of the study within 11 -22 months. An 
absolute maximum of 36 patients is anticipated in the unlikely scenario that each of 2 dose 
levels is expanded to 12 patients due to different classes of AEs, 6 additional patients are 
enrolled at the MTD for PK analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. The absolute maximum 
would require about [ADDRESS_192833] one dose of the study drug(s) and who 
experiences a dose -limiting toxicity is considered evaluable for Adverse Events. 
In addition, for the dose -escalation portion during Cycle 1, patients must  receive 
at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and must have the 
appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be considered evaluable for 
dose limiting toxicity. Patients who do not have DLT and are not considered 
evaluable fo r toxicity will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one -third of patients 
experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are 
different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and 
myelosuppression), AND all of the following conditions are met, expansion 
of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose -related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and 
IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
• The DLTs observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the

dose escalation portion of  the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of patients at the 
MTD (during the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT then 
the MTD will be exceeded.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_192834] of this study.32 Two to six 
patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of 
patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number  of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability 
data pending at the current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has 
enrolled or when the study endpoints have be en met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the 
cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable fo r toxicity). For example, 
when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all 
three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and 
the fourth participant is enrolled to the su bsequent dose level. If data is not yet available 
for one or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT 
has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or 
more DLTs have been ob served, the dose level is de -escalated. This process is repeated for 
participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, 
accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable 
for t oxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de -
escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled 
onto the study.  
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrollin g a patient at (i) the current dose 
level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de -escalated dose level, or whether the study 
is suspended to accrual:

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_192835]  diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_192836] had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cyc le of therapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Measurable dise ase: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_192837] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_192838] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_192839] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
must show definitive evidence of progression to be considered 
measurable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_192840] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
12.2.2 .3 Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disea se, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable.

Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically d efined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representa tive of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the ne xt largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nod es are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but t he presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are sup erficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommend ed.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conventional CT and MR I:  This guideline has defined measurability  of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_192841] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situ ations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast ), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be conside red in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
wher e known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
                         
 
  ADVL1513  
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_192842] scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression o ccurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
 
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_192843] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of  urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%,  the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
meas urable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrink age to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as

[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of  tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

12.2.[ADDRESS_192845] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.[ADDRESS_192846] one dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable by [CONTACT_166122], immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable 
measures.

analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.[ADDRESS_192848] show viable neuroblastoma.  
 
12.4.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Parti al Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
12.4.3  The response  of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
                         
 
  ADVL1513

1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segmen t,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_166123] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
If morphological evidenc e of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6713], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_6783][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Respo nse. 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced).  
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_192849] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Table [ADDRESS_192850] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the  slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non -target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.5.[ADDRESS_192851] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:

• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the product s of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesio ns to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the sum of the products 
of the perpendicular diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum  of the products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.5.5  Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
12.5.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.5.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table b elow. The 
overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms 
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered  under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /protocolDevelopment/electronic _applications/ctc.htm ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or

• See also the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) in Section 9.1.8  of the 
protocol. Additional protocol -specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events 
are the toxicities in bold font listed under the drug information section of the protocol ( Section 9.1 ). 
 
As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at http://ctep.cancer.gov (telephone CTEP at: [PHONE_101]  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour Notification web -based 
applicat ion is unavailable) and by [CONTACT_99243]. Once internet 
connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_192854] be entered electronically 
into CTEP -AERS by [CONTACT_433].  
 
• When the adverse event requires exp edited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A).  
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page at https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers . 
 
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS Reporting  
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
 
A CTEP -AERS report must be submitted electronically via  the CTEP -AERS Web -
based application located at https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers . If prompted to 
enter a sponsor email address, please type in:

include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report 
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS reporting.  
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_192855] (most severe) grade 
of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the 
resolution date ma y therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the 
AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_192856] be reported 
each course it recurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681]  
 
13.5.1  Events  that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF 
packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_192857] responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients following their chemotherapy for cancer must be reported to the 
Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Eval uation Program 
(CTEP) via CTEP -AERS and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm reporting 
requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the completed CTEP -
AERS report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after p rotocol treatment

for cancer.  
 
 Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not cons idered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to  oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])  
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
3) Treatmen t-related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT 
a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporti ng via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed to the 
ADVL1513 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator along with any  additional medical 
information . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should 
be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_192858] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an  expedited manner via CTEP -AERS as 
Grade 3  “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy) ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” System Organ Class  (SOC ). 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known.  If the baby [CONTACT_6796] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required.  
 
13.7.2  Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
• Pregnancy loss  is defined in CTCAE as “ Death in utero .” 
 
•  Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4  
                         
 
  ADVL1513

Version Date: 01/31/19           Page 57 
  
  
     
  
“Pregnancy  loss”  under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC.  Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.   
 
13.7.3  Death Neona tal 
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “ Newborn deaths occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by [CONTACT_166124]/intervention, should be reported 
expeditiously.  
 
• A neonatal de ath should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “ Death 
neonatal ” under the “General disorders and administration ” SOC  when 
the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners 
of men on study . 
 
• Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting fr om a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. T his form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/docs/PregnancyRepo

14.0 RECORDS, REPORTING, AND DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
14.1 Categories of Research Records  
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories  
 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Roadmaps, Pathology Reports, Surgical Reports. 
These forms are uploaded into RAVE.  
 
2. Reference Labs, Biopathology Reviews, and Imaging Center data: These data 
accompany submissions to these centers, which forward their data electronically

CTSU Registration Procedures  
 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_166131] (CTSU).  
 
IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol 
and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can 
be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support 
System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory 
criteria including but not limited to the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements . 
 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572  
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB i nitiative that are approved by [CONTACT_110693]. For sites using the 
CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated 
process. Signatory Institutions  must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the 
CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the 
SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office .  In order for the SSW approval to be 
processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned 
with the Signatory Institution are participating in the study.  
 
Requirements F or ADVL1513  Site Registration:  
 
• IRB appr oval (For sites not participating via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB -signed 
CTSU IRB Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB 
Certification/Declaration of Exemption Form, or combination is accepted )  
• For ap plicable studies with a radiation and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be 
aligned to a RTI provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on 
the CTSU website at https://www.ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation , to add or remove 
associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at least one IROC credentialed provider to participate on 
trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate 
agreements are in place with their RTI provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are in place.

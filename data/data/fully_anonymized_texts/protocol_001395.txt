Study Title: Effectiveness of the Aeroneb Compared to a Jet Nebulizer for the Delivery of Bronchodilator 
Therapy of Acute Severe Asthma  
 
I. Aim and Hypotheses  
Acute exacerbations of asthma remain a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] s.  About one -fifth to one -third of ED patients have poor short term responses to 
bronchodilator therapy  and require admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The initial response to bronchodilator is 
an important indicator of favorable outcomes. The response to bronchod ilator therapy is determined 
by [CONTACT_4676]- specific factors but it is also possible that the delivery method of bronchodilator therapy 
could be playing a role in the response to bronchodilator . Aeroneb system utilizes vibrating mesh 
technology to generate con sistently sized particles wit h greater lung deposition. It may provide 
greater benefits in acute asthma exacerbations.  
 
Aim:  To study whether Aeroneb nebulizer is more effective than small volume jet nebulizer in 
delivering bronchodilators in severe asthma  exacerbation  
Hypothesis: Compared to small volume jet nebulizer, the Aeroneb nebulizer is more effective than a 
small volume jet nebulizer for delivering bronchodilator therapy in patients with acute severe asthma.   
We hypothesize that the mean  of PEFR percentage of predicted at 30 minutes after the initial 
bronchodilator treatment in the Aeroneb group will be 10 points  higher than the mean of PEFR 
percentage of predicted at 30 minutes after the initial bronchodilator treatment in the small volume jet nebulizer group.  
 
 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
A. Background :  
Acute exacerbations of asthma remain a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) visits and h
ospi[INVESTIGATOR_614].  About one -fifth to one -third of ED patients have poor short term responses to 
bronchodilator therapy  and require admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]1. The presence of peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_753454] (PEFR) < 40% is an indicator of severe asthma 2. In patients with  peak flow <50%  severe 
asthma , the improvement in PEFR at [ADDRESS_1031448] been shown to be 
unreliable in delivering the bronchodilator drugs
8. Vibrating mesh technology, which is employed in 
the Aeroneb system, produces consistently sized respi[INVESTIGATOR_753455] 3.4 µm mass mean 
aerodynamic diameter 6.  This improvement in aerosol delivery technology translates into greater 
lung particle deposition in both animal studies and in normal humans 7. Therefore, the Aer oneb 
nebulizer may be more effective that small volume jet nebulizer in  the management of asthma  
exacerbations.  
 
The Aeroneb Nebulizer System is a portable medical device for single patient use that is intended to 
aerosolize physician -prescribed solutions for inhalation to patients on and off ventilation.  
The Aeroneb Adapter is an accessory specific to the Aeroneb Nebulizer. It facilitates intermittent and 
Page 2 of 13  
 continuous nebulization and optional supply of supplemental oxygen to adult patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753456] a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_753457] . The Aeroneb Nebulizer System an d Adapter are 
FDA approved devices for nebulizing solutions including bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]).  
 
 
B. Rationale :  
Aeroneb system has advantages over the small volume nebulizer as mentioned above. These advantages may make it more efficient system to deliver the bronchodilator therapy and to treat the 
asthma exacerbations more effectively.  This is the first study that we are aware of that will look at the use of Aeroneb system to deliver 
bronchodilator therapy in asthma exacerbations.  
The study will provide novel data to demonstrate whether the use of Aeroneb system to deliver bronchodilator therapy is advantageous to patients with sev ere asthma exacerbations.  
If the hypothesis is proven to be correct this will mean improved patient’s  outcomes in severe 
asthma exacerbations  and potentially shorter ER stay, reduction in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753458].    
 
 
III. Research Plan    
 
A. Experimental design :  
This is a prospective,  single blinded, parallel, single center, randomized controlled clinical trial 
(n=68) . Upon entry into the study, patients will be randomized to two groups:  
Treatment group: All the bronchodilator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_753459] (albuterol and 
ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]) will be delivered via Aeroneb nebulizer system . The asthma management will be 
as per the adult asthma protocol in the ER.  
Control group: All the bronchodilator therap ies (Albuterol and ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]) will be delivered  via 
small volume jet nebulizer system, which  is currently the standard nebulizer device used in the 
emergency department  at Tufts Medical Center . The asthma management will be as per the 
adult asthma protocol in the ER.  
 
B. Sample size and statistical analysis(es) :  
Upon entry into the study patients will be randomized at a 1:[ADDRESS_1031449] of bronchodilator (B2-agonist) treatment on the 
improvement of the peak  flow measurement after 30 minutes of the initial bronchodilator 
treatment
4. In this study, the mean PEFR improved from 27% to 39% at [ADDRESS_1031450] 10 points higher than the control 
group (i.e.  mean PEFR ≥ 49% at 30 minutes of the initial bronchodilator therapy).  Group 
sample s izes of 34 and 34 is required to achieve a  power  > 80%  to reject the null hy pothesis of 
equal means when the groups mean difference is 10.[ADDRESS_1031451]  deviation for both 
groups of 14.4 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1031452] 68 patients who will complete the 
study objectives.  
 For the statistical analysis treatment evaluations will be performed on the principle of intention 
to treat (ITT) using the data collected from all randomized participants  who completed the 
study procedures including the two parts of the informed consent form (ICF). Demographics 
and baseline characteristics of patients will be summarized for e ach group. Continuous variables 
will be reported as mean ± standard deviation , with minimum, median, and maximum values . 
Page 3 of 13  
 Categorical variables will be reported as n and %. All statistical testing will be two -sided with 
alpha=0.05.  
For the primary outcome, mean PEFR at [ADDRESS_1031453]- bronchodilator treatment, analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for baseline PEFR will be utilized.  
ANCOVAs with adjustment for baseline values, and incorporating repeated measures where 
appropriate, will be utilized  for the following secondary outcomes: absolute value of PEFR 
(L/Min) at 30 minutes, PEFR percentage of predicted at 60 minutes and 180 minutes, FEV1 percentage of predicted as well as absolute FEV1 (L/Sec) at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 180 
minutes, Borg d yspnea score at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 180 minutes, accessory muscle 
use score at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 180 minutes, and heart rate at 30 minutes, 60 
minutes and 180 minutes.  
 The outcomes which are measured at different time points will be avera ged for each group and 
plotted to visualize the trajectory of those outcomes.  
 
Differences in length of stay (hours) in the ER and the total doses of albuterol and ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_753460] T -tests or non -parametric methods (e.g., Mann -Whitney te st) as 
depending on the distribution of the data. The proportion of patients in each group who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753461] a Chi -square test.

 A study participant may not participate in another research study while participating in 
this study.  
 
 
D. Risk/benefit assessment :  
 
1. Physical risk :  
Patients in both the intervention and control  arms are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_753465] a result of severe asthma exacerbation  and it is unknown if the risk of such 
complications is higher in any arm . It is possible that the Aeroneb group patient my

4. Economic risk  
There is no increased economic risk to the study participants from the study for either 
arm. 
 
5. Benefit of participating in the study :  
a) Patients randomized to the intervention group may benefit from the increased bronchodilator delivery by [CONTACT_753486]  
 
b) Future asthma patients may benefit from this study if Aeroneb  system is proven to be

E. Specific methods and techniques used throughout the study :  
 
1. Laboratory tests:  
      No additional laboratory test is  required in the study.  
 
2. Study Procedures :  
-The patient presenting with acute  severe  asthma exacerbations to the emergency room will 
be screened b y the PI, co -investigator or research coordinator to determine their eligibility 
based on  the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
-Th e required treatment must not be delayed for a research related reason and patients will 
still be eligible for enrollment af ter receiving the treatment as long as their PEFR< 50%40%  
of predicted and the enrollment occur within [ADDRESS_1031455] within 90  minutes 
of the  ER arrival , however, every effort will be  made to enroll the patient as soon as 
possible ; patients will be enrolled as long as their PEFR is less than 50% 40%  of predicted 
regardless of the number of bronchodilator treatment they received prior to the 
randomization.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1031456] who is administering the 
nebulization. In order to avoid any delay in administering the treatments, the sets of 
Aeroneb nebulizer and s mall volume jet nebulizer will be stored in identical boxes and will 
be readily available in the ER.  
In order to blind the treating physician and the recording investigator, a sign “treatment in 
progress” will be displayed at the outdoor of the ER room when the patient is getting the bronchodilator treatment. The nebulizer devices will be placed in the box between the 
bronchodilator treatment sessions. The physician and the recording investigator will be asked  if possible to see the patients only when th e sign is taken off the outdoor.  
 
-Once assigned , all the bronchodilator treatments in the ER will be administered using the 
nebulizer device assigned to that patient.  
 
-The Peak flow and FEV1 will be measured using Spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (micro  I). Both values will b e 
obtained through the same exhalation maneuver.  
 -Patient will be treated and managed according to the asthma ER adult protocol or as 
directed by [CONTACT_753487]’s care  
 -After the study procedures have been performed and the subject is determined to be in 
stable condition and have the capacity to make medical decisions, the investigator will 
approach the subject again and review all the elements of the ICF again with the subject. 
The collected data will be used only if the sub ject signs both parts of the informed consent.  
 -Within two weeks of the subject participation, the research team will attempt to conduct a 
phone  interview with the subject to obtain their feedback on the study procedures and 
mainly on the informed consent process. The phone interview questionnaire is included in the supplement  
 -The research team will report to the IRB the progress of the study including the consent 
process after enrolling the first [ADDRESS_1031457] Timeline :  
During the study several data will be recorded, most of them are standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753467], which are conducted frequently. These data will be collected at baseline and at 
multiple points after the initial bronchodilator therapy (at  30±10 minutes, 60±10 minutes, 
at 180 ± 10 minutes and upon disposition from the ER). All recorded data are obtained 
through noninvasive measurements. No samples of any  body component will be taken that 
it not part of the normal standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53769].

3.2 During the study  
The following variables (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, BP, O2 sat, FIO2, Dyspnea Borg 
score, cough, respi[INVESTIGATOR_753476], peak flow and FEV1) will be recorded at 
the following time points after initial bronchodilator therapy (30±10 minutes, 60±10 
minutes, 180±10 minutes and at the disposition  from the ER). If the patient is 
discharged fro m the ER within 3 hours from the initial bronchodilator therapy then 
the data collection at 3 hours mark will be waived.  
 
3.3 Upon disposition from the ER  
The following data will be collected: the disposition location (home, floor or ICU), length of stay in th e ER (from ER arrival time to the disposition order placement 
time), intubation in the ER, need for NIV ventilation, number and total doses of albuterol treatments in the ER and number and total doses of ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_753477].  
  
 
F. Assessment of Subject Safety and Development of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
1. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Adverse Event (AE) for this study :  
For the purposes of this study a SAE is a serious adverse event that is life -threatening or 
results in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266] , significant  
disability/incapacit ation, congenital anomaly or birth defects, or may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other listed outcomes . A SAE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
the study treatment. SAE may not be uncommon in the study due to the acute nature of 
patients presenting with severe asthma exacerbations that may be enrolled into the study. 
The study will be conducted in the emergency room, which provides a high level of 
monitoring and is capable of managing SAE in this acute patient group. It is possible that 
the Aeroneb group patients may experience more frequent side effects related to potentially 
more a lbuterol and ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_753478]. Those side effects will be monitored closely and patients will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring during the ER visit to capture any arrhythmia.  
 
2. Reporting timeframe for SAEs and AEs:  
SAEs will be reported to the IRB within five business days of the event occurring. The 
investigators will record and track any SAE or AE that might occur during the study. If a 
disproportionate number of events occur in either of the groups, then the study will be 
stopped. A “disproportionate number” is defined as one showing a statistically significant difference in SAEs and AEs occurrence after the recruitment of half the sample size (34 
patients).  
 
3. Accountability procedures as they relate to drugs, devices, and data:  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nicholas Hill and the research team member Haval Chweich, MD will be accountable for the study and interface with Aerogen, the study sponsor.  
 
4. Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan:   
We do not anticipate serious complications attributable to the device, but will monitor 
patients for potential adverse effects such as discomfort or cough. Any serious adverse events that occur during use are more likely due to the underlying disease than the device itself, but will be reported promptly to the IRB by [CONTACT_753488] . 
 The Research team will report to the IRB the process of the informed consent after enrolling 
10 patients (if this occurs before the study continuing review) . 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1031460] Participation  
 
1. Recruitment:  
Patients presenting with severe asthma exacerbation to Tufts Emergency R oom will be 
recruited on to the study. Patients who meet any exclusion criteria will not be screened for possible enrollment. Patients will be approached at their bedside by [CONTACT_978] , co-investigator 
or research coordinator.  No advertisements will be used.    
 2. Registration :  
Patients, that can potentially take part in the study, will be assessed b y the PI [INVESTIGATOR_13899]-
investigator  for their ability to fulfill the eligibility criteria and meet the exclusion criteria, as 
listed above.  
 
3. Screening Interview/questionnaire : Not applicable  
 4. Transportation : Not applicable  
 
5. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent :  
 
The participant must have the full mental capacity to provide the consent. The consenting 
process will be two steps process, each step will involve face -to-face meeting with one of 
the study investigators at bedside in the ER roo m 
 1-The first part of the consent will cover all the essential elements of the informed consent. 
Given the acuity of the medical condition, it is anticipated that the total amount of time 
given to this step of  the informed consent will be  no longer than [ADDRESS_1031461]’s understanding of the study, the subject will be asked to describe his understanding of the study back to the investigator obtaining the consent. The subject will be encouraged 
to call the investigator with any questions.  No study procedures will be performed other than cha rt review to determine eligibility prior to obtaining informed consent. The 
investigators recognize the potential vulnerability of the patient in this setting (i.e., being acutely ill) and thus will terminate the consent discussion in any situation where t he patient 
appears to be uncomfortable or apprehensive about providing consent for participation in 
the study.   
 
2-The second part of the informed consent will take place after the study procedures have 
been performed and the patient condition has been stabilized. The investigator will meet 
face-to-face with the subject and review the ICF again with the subject in more detailed 
manner . The subject will be asked to sign a separate section of the ICF re- consenting that 
they agreed to participate in the study.  
 
Subjects who do not sign the second part of the ICF will be withdrawn from the study and 
data collected on those subjects may not be used for the study.  
  
  
It will be explained that if they refuse to be in the study it will not affect their care or 
medical treatment outside of the study.    
 
Page [ADDRESS_1031462] the consent 
interview, use of interpreters, translated documents, etc.: Only English speaking 
persons will be enrolled as it will be difficult to communicate with non- English speaking 
patients about the P EFR maneuvers and the dyspnea scoring.  Timely assistance from the 
interpreter service  personnel  may not be feasible given the acuity of the cases.  Interpreter 
phone will not be sufficient as it would be hard to demonstrate the maneuver though phone 
interpr etation.

Page 12 of 13  
 Aerogen ( the study sponsor) agrees to reimburse the site for the costs of the care and 
treatment of any illness or injury to a subject directly resulting from his or her participation in 
the Study; provided, however, that such illness or injury is not a result of the negligence or 
misconduct of Site, Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_753480]’s employees.  
 
 
I. Outcome s:  
 
The expected outcome of the study is that the Aeroneb system arm will have higher PEFR after 
treatment with bronchodilator as compared with the small volume jet nebulizer arm. It is also expected that t he improvement in the PEFR in the Aeroneb arm will translate in improvement in 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_753481], accessory muscle use, length of ER stay and need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Primary outcome : the mean of PEFR percentage of predicted at 30 minutes after the initial 
bronchodilator treatment in the Aeroneb group will be 10 points higher than the mean of PEFR 
percentage of predicted at 30 minutes after the initial bronchodilator treatment in the small 
volume jet nebulizer group.  
Secondary outcomes : 
- Change  in the absolute value of PEFR (L/minute) at 30 minutes after the initial bronchodilator

The study will recruit patients with severe acute asthma exacerbations. These patients are vulnerable due 
to the severity of their illness. The risk of providing this alternative method of bronchodilator delivery is not greater than minimal to the patient as this device has been FDA approved for the delivery of bronchodilator.

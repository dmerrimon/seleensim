Background   
Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease and related demen�as (ADRD) is associated with 
higher rates of psychological morbidity and burden, social isola�on, ﬁnancial hardship, and 
deteriora�on of physical health [1]. Much care is administered by [CONTACT_182919], who are 
family or friends who provide regular care outside of a formal professional role to those people who unable to func�on independently [2]. In 2019, 16.[ADDRESS_216045] [3]. This care has 
been valued at a na�onwide contribu�on of $244 billion [3]. Informal caregivers of pa�ents with ADRD manage a complex spectrum of pa�ents’ behavioral and psychological symptoms related 
to demen �a (BPSD); BPSD are major contribu�ng factors to caregivers’ burden and adverse 
health outcomes [2, 4]. Excessive caregiver burden leads to higher unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182910]�on rates and poorer quality of life [5, 6]. The Na�onal Alzheimer’s Project Act rec ognizes the need 
for interven�ons that “enable family caregivers to con�nue to provide care while maintaining their own health and well -being.” [7] A variety of interven�ons have been shown to be eﬀec�ve 
in reducing both BPSD symptoms and caregiver burden [8 –10]. However, with the threefold 
increase of the number of Americans living with ADRD projected for 2050, an eﬀec�ve interven�on would also need to be easily scalable if it were to meaningfully address these 
problems [11].  
Mobile health and tel ehealth technologies oﬀer a means of addressing these issues [12]. 
Internet -based technologies have been shown to be an eﬀec�ve means of interven�on for older 
adults in general [13]. Although a recent systema�c review suggests poten�al beneﬁts of mo bile 
applica�ons for persons with cogni�ve impairment, telehealth applica�ons, which connect pa�ents and informal caregivers to healthcare professionals, were rarely studied in these 
popula�ons, especially among persons with ADRD and their informal ca regivers [14]. However, 
factors such as age, educa�on, and cogni�ve impairment can make u�lizing this approach less eﬀec�ve, thus highligh�ng the need for eﬀec�ve design and careful tes�ng for usability, 
acceptability, and actual use [15 –17].  
Met hods  
Study design  
This is a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] [ADDRESS_216046] pa�ent -caregiver dyads to test the 
feasibility and es�mate the poten�al eﬀect on caregiver burden and BPSD of the mobile telehealth technology Brain CareNotes (BCN). Par�cipant s will be recruited from two health 
systems and randomly assigned to either the BCN interven�on arm or usual care comparator. Study par�cipa�on will last for [ADDRESS_216047] the feasibility outcomes of: (a) recruitme nt rate, (b) 
data comple�on, (c) BCN usability, (d) BCN acceptance, and (e) BCN use, assessed either on an 
ongoing basis or at [ADDRESS_216048] -interven�on. Secondarily, the trial will es�mate the 
interven�on’s eﬀect on outcomes of caregiver burde n and pa�ent BPSD at [ADDRESS_216049] 
interven�on eﬀects on caregiver and pa�ent outcomes. This sample size of 60 dyads was judged 
to produce adequately precise conﬁdence intervals around es�mates of the feasibility outcomes 
[18]. With this sample size, there is also 80% power to  detect a large eﬀect size on caregiver and 
pa�ent outcomes of 0.[ADDRESS_216050] devia�ons between the two groups.  
 
Se�ng and par�cipants   
This study has a planned enrollment of 60 pa�ent caregiver dyads. There will be a recruitment of 30 dyads in the interven�on arm and 30 dyads in the usual care comparator. Dyads will be 
recruited from two health systems in Indiana, [LOCATION_003]: (1) geriatric clinics specializing in pa�ents with cogni�ve impairment at Eskenazi Health, a safety net public healthcare system serving 
Indianapolis, Indiana; and (2) primary care clinics at Indiana University (IU) Health, a nonproﬁt 
academic healthcare system. All dyads contain both a pa�ent with a diagnosis of ADRD and an 
informal caregiver who manages their care. Pa�ents with  ADRD and their caregivers are key 
interven�on targets because they are at high risk of BPSD - and BPSD- related adverse eﬀects on 
caregivers, respec�vely. BPSD in this popula�on are a top contributor to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182910]�on, nursing 
home placement, and new disease or disability.  
 
Descrip�on of interven�on  
The primary interven�on of this study is the delivery of the BCN mobile telehealth applica�on (app), a mobile app for informal caregivers of pa�ents with ADRD. BCN delivers 24/7 
psychoeduca�on and ca regiver support. In addi�on, there are caregiver -reported assessment of 
pa�ent BPSD and tools for self -management and caregiver -clinician communica�on. BCN 
provides 24/7 access to informa�on on caregiving delivered through “bite -sized” CareNotes, 
which convert evidence -based best prac�ces into simple, single sentences oﬀering prac�cal 
advice. For example, advice for everyday care during meal�me is to “Oﬀer regular drinks to avoid dehydra�on.” Personal, relatable stories are used to anchor informa� on modules and 
show how caregiving challenges are universal across cultures. These stories were prepared by 
[CONTACT_182920]�a care professionals based on past experiences with actual pa�ents. BCN provides 
pa�ent and caregiver self -assessment tools in the form of  the Healthy Aging Brain Care (HABC) 
Monitor, a clinically validated test of caregiver percep�ons of cogni�ve, func�onal, and behavioral symptoms and caregiver distress [19]. This assessment is delivered through the 
mobile app and securely communicates the results to prac�cing clinicians. The results of 
completed assessments are available in real �me to clinicians, who presently receive daily alerts 
indica�ng new completed assessments and are expected to review and document all new 
assessments. The re sults of these assessments are used to personalize the CareNote advice 
cards given to the caregiver. In this regard, the recommended CareNote advice cards presented to a user are algorithmically selected based on individual item scores on the assessment. 
Caregivers are also given the ability to browse, save, edit, and arrange recommended advice 
cards. Lastly, the app oﬀers a secure messaging system that connects caregivers and clinicians. 
The messaging is available 24/7 to both par�es, although clinicians  are expected to use the 
messaging during work hours. In the present delivery of the interven�on, community health workers with training in coaching caregivers of persons with demen�a on behavioral symptom 
management receive a daily morning email informing them whether new messages have been 
received, with the expecta�on they will check for and respond to messages throughout the day. 
Regardless of who ini�ates the messaging, the responsible clinician communicates with 
caregiver users through the BCN sec ure messaging system. When a user completes a BPSD self -
assessment via the BCN app, this is treated as an assessment comparable to phone or in -person 
assessment by a clinician and can therefore be used in place of those. However, the use of BCN 
does not re place other services or visits for purposes other than BPSD assessment.  
Caregivers in dyads randomized to BCN will receive a HIPAA compliant BCN applica�on link 
to download the mobile app to their personal mobile device if the device meets minimum 
techni cal requirements. If the caregiver does not have a mobile device mee�ng minimum 
requirements, a smartphone device with unlimited network data plan from AT&T and the BCN app installed will be provided by [CONTACT_182921]ﬀ for the dura�on of the study.  
A res earch assistant (RA) will orient par�cipants to the device, provide training on the BCN 
so�ware, and troubleshoot technical issues in person or remotely. Par�cipants will receive technical support by [CONTACT_182922], during work hours. 
They will also be provided paper and in- app help manuals. Hardware, so�ware, and 
connec�vity checkups will be provided by [CONTACT_182923].  
Descrip�on of usual care comparator  
All pa�ents and informal caregivers in both the interven�on and usual care arms will receive 
usual primary care provided by [CONTACT_182924]. Addi�onally, usual care for 
pa�ents with ADRD at Eskenazi Health includes care in the Aging Brain Care (ABC) clinical 
program, delivered  by [CONTACT_182925]�se in geriatric medicine, social 
work, and nursing, led by a care coordinator according to an individualized care plan.  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
Par�cipant eligibility criteria are the pa�ent has received a diagnosis of possible or probable 
Alzheimer’s disease or related demen�a from a physician at Eskenazi Health or IU Health, the 
caregiver is at least [ADDRESS_216051] a visual impairment signiﬁcant enough to 
interfere with their ability to use BCN, both pa�ent and caregiver are community -dwelling in 
central Indiana, and both pa�ent and caregiver are willing to par�cipate according to the study protocol. Exclusion criteria are the pa�ent or their informal caregiver does not have t he ability 
to communicate in English.  
Recruitment and reten�on  
Par�cipants will be recruited from two large healthcare delivery systems in Indiana. Dyads will 
be screened using the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above by a RC or RA, using each 
system’s respec�ve electronic health records system. Eligible dyads will be called by [CONTACT_182926]�cipa�on. To minimize the burden of study 
par�cipa�on, subjects will receive the op�on of remote data collec�on by [CONTACT_182927]�on at a loca�on convenient to the par�cipants, the default for the later being the 
pa�ent’s home. Research staﬀ will be in regular contact [CONTACT_182928]�cipants to maintain 
engagement.  
Due to varia�on between usual care in the two healthcare systems, study site will be 
recorded as an indicato r to include as a covariate in analyses.  
A challenge to the success of the proposed study is achieving adequate enrollment and 
reten�on. Enrolling older adults including persons with ADRD is uniquely challenging and reten�on is complicated by [CONTACT_181867] 8% annual atri�on due to death alon e. This study 
will also require enrolling two individuals per dyad, who must consent to a 6 -month study 
period and three assessments.  
Ethics and informed consent  
This trial was approved by [CONTACT_182929]�tu�onal Review Board (IRB# 160626715 4) 
and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Both health systems approved the studies 
through their internal approval system. The two health systems do not have independent IRBs 
and instead have an arrangement with the university IRB for their  studies. Informed consent will 
be obtained from the pa�ent or legally authorized representa�ve and separately from the caregiver by a trained RA or RC. Individuals will receive verbal and writen informa�on about 
consent and HIPAA authoriza�on, includ ing answers to all their ques�ons and a copy of the 
documents. Each individual or their surrogate must provide verbal or writen documented consent and HIPAA authoriza�on to par�cipate. Consent by [CONTACT_182930] a pa�ent if 
any of the following  three condi�ons is met:  
1.  The pa�ent has an MMSE score = 17  
2.  The pa�ent is unable to answer any of the following 4 ques�ons correctly:  
a.  What do you understand is wrong with your brain health right now?  
b.  Can you please explain in your ow n words the choices I have presented to you?  
c.  If you decide to par�cipate in this study, what good things might happen and what harm might occur?  
d.  Can you please explain how you decided to par�cipate (or not par�cipate) in this 
study?  
3.  The pa �ent’s provider states that the pa�ent does not have the capacity to consent to 
par�cipa�on in the study based upon the provider’s knowledge of the pa�ent.  
 
When consent by [CONTACT_182931], research personnel will also seek the assent of the pa�ent.  
 
Risks of trial par�cipa�on are expected to be minimal and rare. Par�cipants or their 
surrogates can choose to withdraw from the study at any �me, for any reason. All research 
personnel are IRB -approved and appropriately trained on conﬁden�ality and e nrollment 
procedures. Eligible and enrolled par�cipants’ data will be collected, shared, and maintained in 
accordance with the IU IRB and HIPAA guidelines. Only IRB -approved study team members will 
have access to the collected data. In addi�on, all conse nted par�cipants will be assigned a 
unique study iden�ﬁer upon enrollment. The data will be stored in a secure Research Electronic 
Data Capture (REDCap) database on a password- protected IU server. REDCap was speciﬁcally 
developed around HIPAA security guidelines.  
 
Randomiza�on  
This randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] u�lizes a randomiza�on block to sort subjects into the BCN interven�on or usual care comparator group in a 1:1 manner. The randomiza�on blocks were 
created by [CONTACT_978], approved by [CONTACT_182932]�s�cs faculty member, and loaded in 
REDCap by [CONTACT_182933]�s�cian. Masking/blinding to randomiza�on was not implemented.  
 Assessments and outcomes  
Assessments will be performed at baseline pre -randomiza�on  and at [ADDRESS_216052] -randomiza�on .  The caregiver is contact[CONTACT_182934]. The 
feasibility outcomes assessed are (a) recruitment rate, (b) data comple�on, (c) BCN usability, (d) 
BCN acceptance, and (e) BCN use. The outcomes measured t o es�mate poten�al eﬀect sizes of 
the interven�on are caregiver burden and pa�ent BPSD. Assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_182935]. Par�cipants will receive $25 per assessment and up to 
$75 in total for the en�re project.  
Recruitment rate and data comple�on will be collected via �mestamped research records in 
REDCap on an ongoing basis throughout the dura�on of the trial. Recruitment rate will be 
collected con�nually via �mestamped research records in REDCap and comput ed at the end of 
the accrual period by [CONTACT_182936]�ng # approached, # agreeing, # consen�ng, and # consen�ng/# approached. We will also calculate the monthly rate. Data comple�on will be collected 
con�nually in the REDCap study database and computed a�er  the ﬁnal assessment by 
[CONTACT_182936]�ng # of complete assessments per consen�ng par�cipant/total possible assessments. We will separately compute missing data and atri�on for all causes vs. death in the interven�on 
vs. control groups. A data manager will assist in feasibility data capture and repor�ng.  
BCN usability will be assessed in the BCN interven�on group at 3 and 6 months by [CONTACT_182937]ﬁed System Usability Scale (SUS) [20], a 10 -item ques�onnaire administered to caregivers. 
The Simpliﬁed SUS c ontains statements about usability (e.g., “Learning to use Brain CareNotes 
was quick for me”) answered on a 5 -point response scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) 
and is modiﬁed from the original validated SUS [21]. BCN acceptance will be assessed in the 
BCN interven�on group at 3 and 6 months as the mean score on the Behavioral Inten�on 
Ques�onnaire administered to caregivers. It is a 4 -item ques�onnaire and uses a 7 -point 
response scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (a great deal) [22, 23]. Behavior al inten�on is the 
accepted measure of technology acceptance. BCN use will be collected con�nually from 
captured server ac�vity for log -in, survey ini�a�on, survey comple�on, use of CareNotes advice 
cards, and messages sent and received. We will comp ute daily, weekly, and monthly use rates 
for each use type and for any use at 3 and 6 months.  
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) will be administered to caregivers, measuring 
caregiver -reported pa�ent behavior and obstacles to caregiving [24]. Informal  caregiver burden 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_182936]�ng the NPI  [INVESTIGATOR_182911] (possible range from 0 to 60) 
from the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182912], 3 months, and 6 months. Pa�ent BPSD will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_182936]�ng the  NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182913] (possible range fro m 0 to 144) from the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182914], 3 
months, and 6 months.  
 
Addi�onal data collec�on  
Demographic data for both the caregiver and pa�ent will be collected a�er enrollment, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, educa�on level, employment status, annual household 
income, living situa�on, and insurance status. The total hours over the previous 2 weeks the caregiver spent with the pa�ent and the dura�on of �me the caregiver has been caring for the 
pa�ent will be recorded. Medical data for the pa �ent will also be collected. Health literacy will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_182938] -Item Literacy Screener (SILS) [25].  
 Analyses  
The completeness and distribu�ons of all variables will be checked. We will check the shape of con�nuous distribu�ons to detect strong devia�on from normality and will apply normalizing 
transforma�ons as needed for highly non- normally distributed variables (e.g., NPI). Internal 
consistencies of scale scores will be assessed with Cronbach’s coeﬃcient alpha. Two -sample t 
tests an d chi -squared tests will be used to compare demographic and clinical characteris�cs of 
the par�cipants between the two groups at baseline. The primary aim is to evaluate the 
feasibility of BCN as an interven�on. The following variables will be determine d to test this:  
(a) A recruitment rate per month  
(b) Comple�on on primary outcome measures  
(c) Mean score on the 10 -item SUS [21]  
(d) BCN acceptance on the Behavioral Inten�on 3 -item scale [17]  
(e) % weekly BCN use  
Analyses for (a) and (b) will be descri p�ve in nature, and no sta�s�cal tests will calculated. 
For (c), we will calculate the mean and standard devia�on for the composite SUS to calculate 
the 90% conﬁdence interval. For (d) and (e), we will calculate the propor�on of pa�ents with 
BCN acc eptance and weekly BCN use and then calculate 90% conﬁdence intervals.  
A secondary aim is to es�mate the eﬀect of the BCN interven�on on caregiver burden. A 
linear mixed model will be used to compare the two groups on the mean total NPI -Caregiver 
Distress Scores at 3 and 6 months, using an analysis- of-covariance (ANCOVA) style of model in 
which the baseline measure of the outcome variable is included as a ﬁxed eﬀect. Time (3 and 6 
months), interven�on (BCN vs. usual care), and the interac�on betwee n �me and interven�on 
will be included in the model to test for group diﬀerences at each �me point. If NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182915]�vely skewed, as we have observed in prior research, we will perform a transforma�on on 
NPI, such as log (NPI+1), to sa�sfy mode l assump�ons. All analyses will be inten�on to treat 
(ITT), and addi�onal sensi�vity analyses will assess the eﬀect of impu�ng missing outcomes using several mul�ple imputa�on techniques (both missing at random and not missing at 
random).  
Another secondary aim is to es�mate the eﬀect of the BCN interven�on on BPSD. Analyses 
will be performed as described above for caregiver burden, except the outcome will be the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182913].  
Data and safety monitoring plan and board  
The Principal Inves�ga tors and an independent Safety Oﬃcer will be responsible for data and 
safety monitoring, with support from the team’s data manager and biosta�s�cian. Research staﬀ will prepare for them a formal report communica�ng the study’s enrollment progress, da ta 
collec�on, and par�cipant safety. Inves�gators will meet at least every 2 weeks with the study team to review ongoing study progress and par�cipant safety and will review and discuss every 
reportable event within 48 h. The frequency for reviewing da ta in this study diﬀers according to 
the type of data :   
Reviewed at Each Occurrence  
• Self-reported adverse events  
• Serious adverse event mee�ng prompt repor�ng 
Reviewed Quarterly  
• Summary of serious adverse events  
• Protocol viola�ons/noncompliance  
• Subject accrual/randomiza�on  
• Withdrawal rates  
• Subject complaints  
• Compliance to interven�ons  
Reviewed Annually  
• Summary of adverse events  
• Out of range data  
• Reassessment of risk -to-beneﬁt  
 
All data for each par�cipant will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a single REDCap database. REDCap oﬀers 
secure access, regular backup, data valida�on, and structured data collec�on via mobile devices 
for all interviewer -administered assessments. Medical and care process data will be collected 
from electronic medical records and entered into the REDCap database. Data on device use will 
be obtained via server queries and uploaded to REDCap. Recruitment process data will be 
directly input into REDCap by [CONTACT_182921]ﬀ. A staﬀ biosta�s�cian or data manager will perform 
the merging of all data streams using unique iden�ﬁers assigned to the study par�cipants. They will regularly review data for data entry errors and other irregulari�es.  
Special considera�ons  
A challenge for this study is ensuring that those randomized to receive BCN have adequate ongoing access to BCN technology. We have addressed this challenge by [CONTACT_182939]�ve user -
centered design and tes�ng of BCN, paying considera�on to the needs and abili �es of middle -
aged and older adult caregivers. The user -centered design and tes�ng process included a study 
of processes and unmet needs of the current clinical program [26], followed by [CONTACT_182940]�ng of caregiv ers and clinicians to discuss needs 
and design ideas. Therea�er, we collected ini�al feedback from caregivers on screen mockups and features, followed by a brief ﬁeld test of the applica�on with [ADDRESS_216053] usability interview, we assessed caregivers’ perceived 
usefulness, usability, desirability, and credibility of the app and adjusted the app to address problems. When possible, the BCN app is installed directly on the caregiver’s smartphone. 
Those dyads that need a smartphone are provided a smartphone with an unlimited data plan 
for the dura�on of the study. We will document the propor�on that requires such addi�onal assistance, as this may ul�mately aﬀect the realworld implementa�on of an int erven�on like 
BCN. Assistance with so�ware installa�on and subsequent technical support needs are provided for all study par�cipants. We have also budgeted for network and development support to 
monitor and remediate (e.g., with patches) any emergent t echnical malfunc�ons, opera�ng 
system changes, or security vulnerabili�es during the study. These steps are important to 
reducing the risks of systema�cally excluding more vulnerable par�cipants and crea�ng or 
increasing inequali�es in technology st udies [27].  
Discussion  
Reducing caregiver burden and minimizing BPSD are important for improving wellbeing and 
reducing other health risks of ADRD caregiving. Mobile and telehealth technology applica�ons 
are promising interven�ons to improve these outcom es in a scalable manner [14]. However, 
before a technology is deployed to a large sample or in clinical prac�ce, it must be evaluated for usability, acceptance, and poten�al eﬃcacy. This is especially needed to avoid the poten�al for 
harm or waste of eﬀort when the technology is intended for older and cogni�vely impaired 
individuals, those who provide them informal care, or other vulnerable groups. The present randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_182916].  
If found to be feasible and poten�ally eﬃcacious, BCN and other mobile technologies have 
the poten�al to be scalable. An app such as BCN could be shared with a broad pool of study 
par�cipants or members of the p ublic through exis�ng public app marketplaces and can be 
downloaded on personal devices or accessed via a website. Although the cost of an interven�on 
such as BCN would have to be further assessed, once it is built, major an�cipated technology 
costs inc lude so�ware and security maintenance. Addi�onal costs may be related to �me spent 
by a community health worker reviewing data entered by [CONTACT_182941]�cipa�ng in secure messaging. A telehealth system also allows collabora�ve, inter disciplinary 
care from individuals as diverse as geriatricians, care coordinators, nurses, social workers, community health workers, informal caregivers, and community members. The breadth of 
involvement and the low barriers to access permit contribu�ons to care from larger 
“workforces,” for example, community health workers, volunteers, or a network of informal caregivers. This is an important advance given an�cipated increases in the demand for ADRD 
care and the limited number and cost of geriatricians and memory care specialty services. 
Another, more prospec�ve poten�al for a telehealth system is to deliver care or health coaching 
through or assisted by [CONTACT_140648]�ﬁcial intelligence.  
Overall, if successful, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_182917] a test case for a n ew way of delivering 
beter care to pa�ents with ADRD and their caregivers.

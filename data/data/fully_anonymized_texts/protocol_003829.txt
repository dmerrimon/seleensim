Title of Study:  
A Phase III Randomised, Double -masked , Parallel Group, Multicentre  Study to Compare the Efficacy, 
Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity between SB11 (proposed ranibizumab biosimilar) and 
Lucentis® in Subject s with Neovascular Age-related M acular Degeneration  
Protocol No:  SB11 -G31-AMD  Phase:  III 
Indication:  Neovascular Age-related M acular Degeneration  (AMD)  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• To demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11 to Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the systemic exposure of SB11 and Lucentis® in subjects participating in 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) evaluation   
Study Design:  
This is a randomised, double -masked , parallel group, multicentre  study to evaluate the efficacy , safety , 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB 11 compared to Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular  
AMD . Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB11 or Lucentis® (administered via 
intravitreal ( ITV) 0.5 mg every 4 weeks ). Investigational P roducts  (IP) (SB11 or Lucentis®) will be 
admin istered up to Week 48, and the last assessment will be done at Week 52.  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately a total of 704 subjects are planned to be randomised into this study.  
Target Population:  Subjects with neovascular AMD  
Eligibility Criteria:  
Only one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both eyes, 
the eye with the worse Visual A cuity ( VA) will be selected as the study eye. If both eye s have equal 
VA, the eye with better visual prognosis  (e.g., clear er lens and ocular media and l ess amount  of 
subfoveal scar or geographic atrophy ) will be selected  at the Investigator’s discretion . If there is no 
objective basis for selecting the study eye, factor such as ocular dominance, other ocular pathology and subject preference should be considered by [CONTACT_913466].

Statistical Methods  
Efficacy analysis  
For US FDA , Korea  MFDS or o ther regulatory agency submissions for those who are in favour of the 
VA, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the Full A nalysis  Set (FAS) with the change 
from baseline of BCVA at Week 8  using an analysis of covariance model  with the baselin e BCVA as a 
covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors . The FAS will consist of all 
randomised subjects. The subjects will be analysed based on the treatment they were randomised to by 
[CONTACT_7586] -to-treat principle. However, sub jects who do not qualify for randomisation and are 
inadvertently randomised into the study will be excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects do not 
receive any IP during the study period. The e quivalence  in BCVA  will be declared if the two -sided 90 % 
Confidence Interval (CI) of the difference of BCVA  Least Squares mean (LS mean) change s from 
baseline at Week 8  between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−3 
letters, 3 letters ].

parameter, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the per -protocol set (PPS -CST)  with the 
change from baseline of CST at Week [ADDRESS_1283600] as a 
covariate  and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors . The PPS -CST consists of all 
FAS subjects who have the first  IP injection at Week 0  (Day 1)  and complete procedures at Week [ADDRESS_1283601] will be declared if the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of CST LS mean change s from baseline 
at Week 4 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin  of [−36 μm, 36 
μm]. 
There is no form al adjustment of type I error rates.  
For the primary analysis with the FAS for BCVA, missing data will be imputed for subjects who drop 
out for the study prior to the primary analysis time -point. A missing -at-random approach will assume 
that subjects who withdraw from a study had missing values similar to similar subjects who completed 
the study in that treatment group. This approach ensures that evidence of lack of equivalence is not diluted when there are missing data. For the components of BCVA, the missing letter will be imputed by [CONTACT_913472]. For the sensitivity analyses, available case analysis and last observation carried forward 
analysis will be performed. All othe r efficacy measurements will be summarised descriptively by 
[CONTACT_6982].  
Safety analyses  
All reported terms for AEs (ocular or systemic) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). AEs  including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as 
well as systemic AEs  will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters  will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_29014]. All other safety varia bles will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_760584], and all safety variables will be listed.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses  
Blood sampling for PK  will be collected in approximately 40 subjects participating in PK evalua tion 
(20 subjects per treatment group). Formal PK analysis will not be performed. The systemic exposure 
will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_145662].   
Immunogenicity analyses  
The number and proportion  of subjects with ADA and NAb results ( e.g., “positive” or “negative”) will 
be summarised by [CONTACT_6982].

Subscale scores (general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision -
specific social functioning, vision -specific men tal health, vision -specific role difficulties, vision -

represent overall visual function, will be  calculated, and the change from baseline will be  summarised 
by [CONTACT_6982].  
Sample size calculation  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin  for BCVA , the mean change s in VA were referred from 
two studies of Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, the mean change of 
VA at Week 24  (Standard D eviation  [SD]) were − 6.6 (13.31) letters and 6.5 (12.00) letters for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In FOCUS study, the mean change (SD) of VA at 
Week 24 were −5.0 (16.14) letters and 4.0 (14.41) letters for pl acebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment 
groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta -analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in VA of 12.41 
letters with a 95% CI [10.34  letters , 14.48  letters ]. The derived equivalence limit from meta -analysis is 
4.9 letters at Week 24, but by [CONTACT_913473] 8 will be 3 
letters for the comparison with the 90% CI of mean difference between treatment groups.  
With the given equivalence margin of [−3 letters, 3 letters], 334 subjects  per treatment group  was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0.5 letters and pooled SD of 12.5 letters at the 
overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 5% loss from randomi sed subjects  after 8 weeks , a sample 
size of 352 subjects  per treatment group  (overall sample size of 704) will give 334 completers per 
treatment group  after 8 weeks , which is estimated to give 80% power to detect the equivalence of 
change from baseline in BCVA  within the margin of  [ADDRESS_1283602] were referred from two studies of Lucentis
® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, the mean change of 
CST at Week 4 (SD) was 8.1 (58.1)  μm and −106 (122.5) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® 
treatment groups, respectively. In PI[INVESTIGATOR_913431], the mean change (SD) of CST at Week 4 were 15 (94.9) μm and −90 (140.9) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis
® treatment groups, respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta -analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in CST of 
109.6 μm with a 95% CI [ −146.45 μm; −72.65 μm]. The derived equivalence limit from meta- analysis 
is 36 μm at Week 4.  
With the given equivalence margin of [ −36 μm, 36 μm], 290 subjects per treatment group was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0 between treatment groups, common SD of 
133.3 μm at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 10% loss from FAS, a sample size of 323 per 
arm (overall sample size of 646) will give 80% power to detect the equivalence within the pre- defined 
margin.

1.1. Backg round  
Age-related  Macular  Degeneration  (AMD) , left untreated, is a leading cause of adult blindness 
in the developed world. Most of severe visual loss of AMD occurs from Choroidal 
Neovascularisation ( CNV) or the neovascular form of AMD. Choroidal neovascul arisation  
can be associated with fibrous replacement of the  retinal photoreceptors and Retinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_295677] (RPE), as well as atrophy of these portions of the retina in the macula, leading to 
severe visual decline with loss of reading vision, driving vision, and the ability to recognise 
faces. Vascular Endothelial Growth F actor  (VEGF) , a protein growth factor that both 
stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability, is a major pathogenic factor in 
CNV due to AMD. Counteracting these effec ts of VEGF  can provide significant therapeutic 
benefit to subjects suffering from this disorder. 
In developed countries, AMD is a leading cause of severe visual loss in people 65 years of age 
and older in the US, an estimated 6% of individuals aged 65 to 74, and 20% of those older than 75 are affected with some stage of AMD. Also, among white people aged 40 years and older, AMD is the number one cause of visual impairment and blindness in the US. The pathogenesis of AMD is poorly understood. It is character ised by [CONTACT_913478] –spacing collagen and phospholipid vesicles within and beneath the basement membrane of the RPE, called “drusen” which can be accompanied by [CONTACT_913479] (atrophy), which often results in slow deterioration of central Visual 
Acuity  (VA) . This thickening and degeneration of Bruch’s membrane can predispose to 
abnormal growth of blood vessels from the choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_167583], termed choroidal neovascularization. The occurrence of CNV hera lds the onset of neovascular AMD. Leakage 
from the CNV can cause macular oedema with collection of fluid and blood beneath and within the macula, resulting in loss of vision. Growth of the lesions with accompanying fibrovascular or fibroglial tissue furthe r destroys retinal tissue. Overtime, the CNV promotes 
scarring that damages photoreceptors and the RPE, resulting in permanent vision loss. Neovascular or “wet” AMD accounts for only 10% of cases of AMD yet results in 90% of the severe vision loss. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_913434] “wet” AMD will develop in almost 1 
million persons in the US within the next 5 years [ Wu EW  et al., 2014, Macular 
Photocoagulation Study Group. 1991 ].

®: Ranibizumab Reference Product 
Lucentis® is approved for indications including neovascular (wet) AMD, visual impairment 
due to D iabetic Macular Oedema (DME) and visual impairment due to macular oedema 
secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO) by [CONTACT_913480]. In addition, the FDA approved Lucentis® for the treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy

Information. 2016, Lucentis® Summary of Product Characteristics. 2016 ] 
Mechanism of Action  
Ranibizumab binds to the receptor bindi ng site of active forms of VEGF -A, including the 
biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110. VEGF -A has been shown to 
cause neovascularisation  and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion 
and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, macular oedema 
following RVO, DR and DME. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF- A prevents the 
interaction of VEGF -A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of 
endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation  [Lucentis® Summary of Product Characteristics. 2016 ]. 
Pharmacodynamics  
Increased retinal thickness (i.e., Centre  Point Thickness [CPT]  or C entral Foveal Thickness 
[CFT]), as assessed by [CONTACT_913481], macular 
oedema following RVO, and DME. Leakage from CNV  as assessed by [CONTACT_913482] . 
Microvascular retinal changes  and 
neovascularisation , as assessed by [CONTACT_913483], are associated with diabetic retinopathy 
[Lucentis® Prescribing Information. 2016].  
Pharmacokinetics  
Following monthly ITV administration of Lucentis® to pat ients with neovascular AMD, serum 
concentrations of ranibizumab were generally low, with maximum levels (C max) generally 
below the ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 
50% (11- 27 ng/ml, as assessed in an in vitr o cellular proliferation assay). C max was dose 
proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 1.0 mg/eye. Serum concentrations in a limited 
number of DME patients indicate that a slightly higher systemic exposure cannot be excluded compared to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Serum ranibizumab concentrations 
in RVO patients were similar or slightly higher compared to those observed in neovascular 
AMD patients. 
Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics and disappearance of ranibizumab from 
serum for patients with neovascular AMD treated with the 0.5 mg dose, the average vitreous elimination half -life of ranibizumab is approximately 9 days. Upon monthly ITV

1.3. SB11 : Proposed Ranibizumab Biosimilar  
Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd . (Incheon, Republic of Korea) has developed SB11, a proposed 
biosimilar of the  ranibizumab reference product. SB11 is produced by [CONTACT_913484]. Extensive characterisation studies including intact mass, 
N- and C-terminal sequencing, peptide mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], icIEF, CE-SDS (reduced, non-reduced), SE-
HPLC , amino acid composition, disulfide bond, VEGF binding, VEGF neutralisation , and 
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells ( HUVEC ) anti-proliferation were  performed using 
state-of-the- art techniques. Assays such as CEX -HPLC, UV absorption spectra, free thiol 
group quantification, SEC- MALS, SV -AUC, CD, DSC and FT -IR were  performed for both 
non-clinical and clinical materials.  
After extensive quality similarity studies, a series of in vitro non-clinical studies including 
VEGF binding assay and cell- based assays (HUVEC anti -proliferation assay and VEGF 
neutralizing assay)  were  performed to demonstrate similarity in in vivo  behavio ur between 
SB11 and Lucentis®.  
1.4. Rationale for the Study  
A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that is highly similar to an alre ady authorised 
original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product) in terms of quality, 
tolerability, and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, EMEA/CHMP/437/04 , U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration . 2015] . The EMA  and the US FDA have developed specific guidelines for a 
biologic drug to be approved as a biosimilar [ EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, U. S. Food 
and Drug Administration. 2015, EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012] . These guidelines 
recommend a stepwise approach in develop ing a biosimilar starting with extensive 
physicochemical and biological characterisation before initiating clinical studies for the 
comparison of the efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties, and immunogenicity of the biosimilar.  The purpose of t his study is to demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11

Page 31 of 137 to Lucentis® and to evaluate the safety  and immunogenicity in subjects with neovascular 
AMD. In addition, systemic exposure of SB11 to Lucentis® will also be evaluated  in subjects 
participatin g in PK evaluation. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary Objective  
• To demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy of SB11 to Lucentis® in subjects with 
neovascular AMD  
2.2. Secondary Objective  
• To evaluate the safety of SB11 and Lucentis® 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of  SB11 and Lucentis® 
•       To evaluate the systemic exposure of SB11 and Lucentis® in subjects participating  in 
PK evaluation  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overview of Study Design 
This is a randomised, double -masked , parallel group, multi centre study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB11 compared to Lucentis® in 
subjects with neovascular AMD. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
SB11 or Lucentis® 0.5 mg via ITV into the study eye every 4 weeks.  
The screening  period is 21 days . IP (SB11 or Lucentis®) will be given  until [ADDRESS_1283627] assessment will be done at Week 52.  
3.2. Rationale for  the Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of clinical efficacy of Lucentis® 
and SB11 i n subjects  with neovascular AMD.  
Although a Phase I comparative PK study comparing the proposed biosimilar product to reference product is a fundamental component in supporting a demonstration of biosimilarity 
[U. S. Fo od and Drug Administration. 2015 ], a Phase I comparative PK study has not been 
necessary to support a demonstration of biosimilarity due to negligible systemic exposure 
following ITV injection of ranibizumab. However, for supporting the assessment of over all 
systemic safety of SB11 relative to Lucentis
®, systemic exposures will be collected and 
compared in the subgroup population (approximately 40 subjects, 20 subjects per treatment 
group) in Phase III comparative efficacy study.

Page 32 of 137 Lucentis® is approved for indications including neovascular AMD, visual impairment due to 
DME and visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to RVO by [CONTACT_913485]. In addition, the US FDA approved Lucentis® for the treatment of DR in subjects 
with DME and the EM A approved Lucentis® for the treatment of visual impairment due to 
CNV secondary to PM, respectively.  
Improvements of VA have been reported in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_913436]. For 
example, at Month 12, the average benefit associated with Lucentis® over that of sham 
injection or PDT was approximately 13.[ADDRESS_1283628] 
Corrected Visual Acuity (BC VA) between Lucentis® treated and control group was the largest 
in subjects with AMD, which indicates that neovascular AMD is the most sensitive indication 
compared to DME  or RVO to show a difference between the treatments [ Lee H , 2014].  In 
addition, neovascular AMD has homogeneous disease progress with fewer compounding 
factors than DME or RVO. For instance, it results in severe visual impairment with an average 
loss of around 4 lines of VA within 2 years of disease onset [ Chakravarthy U  et al. 2010]. 
Although this neovascular form accounts for only approximately 10% to 20% of the AMD cases, it is responsible for 80% to 90% of AMD -associated vision loss [Ferris FL 3rd  et al. 
1984] . Therefore, Subjects with neovascular AMD are the most appropriate target population 
to evaluate the product- related difference between Lucentis
® and SB11 in this study. 
This study has two different endpoints, depending on regulato ry agency’s requirements for 
assessing equivalence in efficacy between SB11 and Lucentis®. 
For US FDA, Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ( MFDS ) or other regulatory agency 
submissions for those who are in favour of the VA, the primary endpoint is the m ean change 
from baseline in BCVA at Week 8. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_913437]®, the proportion of 
subjects losing < 15 letters was used as primary endpoint to compare the efficacy between Lucentis
® treatment group and control group. The endpoi nt indicate s the preventive effect of 
the loss of VA, but it includes variability in individual disease progression as well as drug -
induced effect. For example, approximately 90% of the subjects who received Lucentis® lost 
VA less than 15 letters but 60% of the subje cts who received sham injection (or 
PDT/verteporfin) also lost VA less than 15 letters. Thus, the proportion of subjects losing < [ADDRESS_1283629] any change (improvement or deterioration) in the disease status , thus  is more sensitive in detecting a difference between the two treatments. To increase 
sensi tivity, evaluation of equivalence will be  conducted at Week 8  before the efficacy plateau 
is reached , as requested by [CONTACT_124756].  
For EMA  or other regulatory agency submission for those who are in favour of the anatomical 
parameter, the primary objective is t o demonstrate the equivalence of SB11 to Lucentis
®, in 
terms of the mean change from baseline in CST at Week 4. The evaluation of CST is 
important as it addresses the pharmacodynamics aspects of ranibizumab. Ranibizumab binds

on the surface of endothelial cells, thereby [CONTACT_913486]- A to its receptors and 
reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation 
which result in  reduction of CST [Lucentis® Prescribing Information 2016, Lucentis® 
Summary of Product Characteristics . 2016]. It indicates that the reduction of CST represents a 
direct effect of ranibizumab based on the M echanism of Action (MoA). Furthermore, it has 
been reported that CST measurements and clinical outcome has a correlation. In OCT -guided, 
variable-dosing study conducted in neovascular AMD subjects, a statisticall y significant 
correlation between the decrease in CST at one month and the subsequent improvement in VA  
seen at two months and three months [ Fung A  et al. 2007] . Similarly in PrONTO study, the 
results indicated that t he initial OCT response is predictor of future VA improvements 
although the strength of the correlation is affected by [CONTACT_913487]. In addition, visual recovery after 
resolution of macular fluid in neovascular AMD likely depends on many variables including 
chronicity of disease, viability of photoreceptors and the RPE, progression of the underlying 
dry AMD (geographic atrophy), as well as the presence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_122428], RPE tears, and fibrosis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_913438], the initial response to ranibizumab characterised by 
[CONTACT_913488] a useful predictor of treatment efficacy  [Lalwani G  et al. 2009 ].   
The study design was consulted and agreed with both EMA and FDA prior to start of this study. 
4. STUDY POPULATION  
Eligibility for participation in this study will be based on the  inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only 
one eye will be designated as the study eye. For subjects who meet eligibility criteria in both 
eyes, the eye with the worse VA will be selected as the study eye. If both eyes have equal VA, the eye with better visual pr ognosis (e.g., clearer lens and ocular media and less amount of 
subfoveal scar or geographic atrophy) will be selected at the Investigator’s discretion . If there 
is no objective basis for selecting the study eye, factor such as ocular dominance, other ocul ar 
pathology and subject preference should be considered by [CONTACT_913489].

decide IP discontinuation based on the FP and/or FA.  The images taken at unscheduled visits 
will not be sent to the central reading centre.  
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from IP due to any of the above described reasons 
excluding death, the subject will complete the ET procedures (except for PK sampling) after [ADDRESS_1283635] agrees to continue follow -up for associated clinical outcome information  until 
Week 52 irrespective of IP injection status  (as long as an  additional ICF e.g., withdrawal form 
is signed by [CONTACT_760616]), the subject’s clinical 
outcome information such as BCVA, CST, AE and concomitant medication will be collected  
through non- invasive chart review , if available. 
If a subject does not agree to continue follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, 
the subject will be terminated from the study accordingly. The data and blood samples 
collected on the subject up to ET visit remains in the study database and no further data will be collected.  
In all cases, the reason for IP discontinuation must be recorded in the electronic Case Report 
Form ( eCRF ) and in the subject’s medical record.

5.1.2.  Withholding Investigational Products  
If a subject  experiences an AE in the study eye  and the subject’s safety or well -being could be 
compromised by [CONTACT_913495]’s discretion , IPs should be withheld 
until the event has resolved . Such events in the study eye include, but are not limited to:  
• A decrease in BCVA  of ≥[ADDRESS_1283637] assessment of VA;  
• An IOP of ≥30 mmHg;  
• A retinal break;  
Any significant change in the posterior pole (e.g., subretinal haemorrhage, macular hole, 
vitreous haemorrhage or opacity, retinal detachment, etc.) that is detected with fundus 
examination should be confirmed and documented with FP and/or FA. Investigator should 
decide IP withholding based on the FP and/or FA. The images taken at unscheduled visits will 
not be sent to the central reading centre.  
NOTE: If a subject misses any of first t wo dose s or two consecutive doses during the study 
period after randomisation, the subject must be discontinued from IPs according to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1283638]

enrolled  at PK Investigational sites will be “PK subjects” participating in  PK evaluation  until 
the expe cted number of PK subjects is reached. Once the expected number of PK subjects is 
reached, the following  subjects enrolled at  PK Investigational sites will be “non -PK subjects” 
for whom blood sampling for PK will not be performed.  
Blood sampling for PK wi ll be collected  prior to ITV injection of IP (C trough) and 24-72 hours 
after ITV injection of IP (close to C max) at Week 0  (Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 
24, and Week 36. Blood sampling for PK will also be collected  at any time during the visit at 
Week 1 and Week 52 (EOS  visit)  (Table 2).  
The exact date and time of sample collection must  be recorded in the source documentation 
and the eCRF. A detailed process for PK  sampling, handling, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_913445].   
6.6. Immunogenicity  Assessment  
Blood sampling for immunogenicity will be collected  in all randomis ed subjects.  
Blood sampling for immunogenicity  will be collected  prior to ITV inject ion of IP at Week 0  
(Day 1) , Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and Week 36. Blood sampling for 
immunogenicity will also be collected  at any time during the visit at Week 1 and Week 52 
(EOS visit) or ET visit ( Table 2). 
The exact date and time of sample collection must be recorded in the source documentation 
and the eCRF.  A detailed process for immunogenicity sampling, handling, storage and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_913446] . 
If a subject has an unresolved adverse event that is possibly related to ADA formation, he or 
she could be asked to return for immunogenicity blood sampling after Week 52 ( EOS  visit)  or 
ET visit until the antibody titres return to baseline or stabilise at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator and Sponsor . 
6.7. NEI VFQ -25 
Vision -related QOL will be assessed using NEI VFQ -25. NEI VFQ -25 should be performed at 
Week 0 (Day 1) after randomisation. Then, NEI VFQ-25 should be performed before dilation of pupil at Week 0 (Day1), Week 24  and Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit.  
All questionnaires will be administered in the local language. Investigator or delegated site 
staff will conduct a questionnaire survey with the subject in a quiet room. The results of the 
questionnaire will be recorded in a paper questionnaire and then entered into the eCRF.

outlined in Table 1. 
7.1. Visit 1 (Screening, D -21 to D -1) 
Screening should be performed within 21 days before randomisation excluding the day of 
randomisation.  
• Written i nformed consent 
Investigator must  discuss the study with the subject and obtain written informed consent  from 
the subject prior to any study related procedures. If the subject is not randomi sed within [ADDRESS_1283655] is screen failed , he 
or she should not be re -screened.  
The following procedures should be performed: 
• Demographic data  
• Medical & ophthalmic history 
• Physical examinatio n (including body weight and height) 
• Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate)  
• Pregnancy test  for women of childbearing potential ( serum ) 
• Blood and urine sampling for clinical laboratory tests  
- Urine samples must be collected before performing FA to avoid false elevation in 
urine protein values 
• Ocular assessments:  
• BCVA examination using original series ETDRS chart s or 2702 series Number 
chart s (before dilation of the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_913447]/FA and OCT assessment ) 
- Subject must use the same chart consist ently from Screening to Week 52 (EOS 
visit) or ET visit  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy 
• Indirect ophthalmoscopy

• FP & FA (images should be sent to central reading centre) 
• IOP using Goldmann applanation tonometry  
• Adverse event monitoring 
• Concomitant and previous medication or therapy 
• Evaluate subject compliance with all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Investigators are advised to send OCT and FP/ FA images to central reading centre as soon as 
possible for review as this could take more time than the other procedures, in order to avoid 
exceeding the allowed [ADDRESS_1283656] and/or FP/FA images to central reading centre, the Investigator does 
not have to send the subject’s OCT and/or FP/FA images to central reading centre.  
Central reading centre will send central review results confirming  the subject’s eligibility to 
the Investigational site. If a subject is confirmed as ineligible from  centra l reading centre due 
to poor quality of images, but the investigator still considers the subject eligible for the study, 
the Investigator may be allowed to send a second set of images to the central reading centre. In this case, only FP/FA  or OCT  (and not all other screening procedures) have to be repeated 
within screening period of [ADDRESS_1283657] will be advised on study restriction s such as contraception, prohibited medications and other study requirements if any. 
NOTE  
 The most critical assessment will be at Week 4 and Week 8 as these are the visits 
for primary endpoint assessment. Thus, every effort should be made to adhere 
to the visit schedule for the subjects.    
 A decrease in VA of ≥ 15 letters (compared with the last assessment of 
VA) should be reported as AEs/SAEs as appropriate.  
 Intraocular inflammation should be recorded based on the location  of 
inflammation (e.g., “iritis”, “vitritis” or “iridocyclitis” rather than “uveitis”) 
 Grading scales for slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy are 
provided in Appendix A, B and C.

8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal (investigational) pr oduct or other protocol-imposed intervention and 
which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment or 
intervention. An AE can therefore be an unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), sympt om, or disease temporally associated with the use of any 
dose of a medicinal (investigational) product or other protocol-imposed intervention, 
regardless of attribution.  
All AEs including ocular AEs in the study eye and/or fellow eye as well as systemic A Es will 
be collected from the written informed consent is obtained from the subject  until Week 52 
(EOS visit) or ET visit.  If the AMD is diagnosed in the fellow eye during the study period, the 
event should be also reported as an AE.  
Pre-existing conditions and any abnormal findings from assessments at the time of Screening 
which are not related to protocol-imposed intervention should not be reported as AEs, however pre- existing conditions which worsen (i.e., change in severity) that meets the 
definition of an AE during the study period are to be reported as AEs. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be report ed if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.  
The AE that emerge during the treatment with an IP (i.e., T reatment -Emergent Adverse Event 
[TEAE] ) will be analysed for the purposes of safety analyses.  
8.1.2.  Period of Observation for Adverse Events  
All AEs (ocular or systemic) will be recorded from the written informed consent is obtained 
from the subject  until Week 52  (EOS visit) or ET visit.

Page 71 of 137 SAEs  that occurred at or before Week 52 ( EOS visit) or ET  visit must be reported to Sponsor 
or its designated representative via eCRF SAE report form  at least within 24 h ours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
SAEs that are considered to be related to the IP can be collected regardless of the study 
period. SAEs that occurred after Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit and that are considered to 
be related to the IP must be reported to Sponsor or i ts designated representative using the 
paper SAE report form at least within 24 h ours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event (see Section 8.2.2.).   
Date and time (wherever possible) of Investigator becoming aware of the SAE will be 
recorded in the SAE form and source document properly. 
Unresolved AEs should be followed up until the Week 52 ( EOS  visit) or ET visit and 
follow-up information will be recorded in the eCRF. The I nvestigator should provide prop er 
monitoring of subject’s status and related AEs for appropriate medical care of the subject  
until AE resolution or stabilisation.  
Unresolved  SAE at Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit will be followed until event resolution or 
stabilisation (see Section  8.2.2.).   
8.1.3.  Reporting Adverse Events 
AEs are to be reported and reviewed by [CONTACT_10670]. When reporting an AE, a diagnosis 
(when possible and appropriate) rather than each individual signs and symptom s should be 
reported. 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria of an SAE (see Section  8.2. for 
SAE definition). If an AE is classed as an SAE, it must be reported to Sponsor, or its 
designated representa tive, promptly according to the timeline specified in Section  8.2.2.  
For a n SAE, a diagnosis with a description of signs and symptoms as well as other supporting 
information that led to the diagnosis should be described in the SAE report form and reported 
to the Sponsor, or its designated representative, according to the procedures described in Section  8.2.2.  
8.1.4.  Severity Assessment  
Investigator is responsible for assessi ng and reporting the severity of AEs. The following 
classification should be used to classify AEs:  
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and  
may interfere with daily activities.

Amendment 1, Sep 01, 2017  
 
Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 72 of 137 • Severe events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity.  
8.1.5.  Causality Assessment  
Investigator is responsible for assigning a causal relationship to each AE. The causal 
relationship between the IP and  the AE should be defined as not related (no) or related (yes).  
Events should be classified as “related” if there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationshi p. 
Events should be classified as “not related” if there is no reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE.  
8.1.6.  Emergency Unmasking for Safety Reasons  
Unmasking  should be considered only when knowledge of the treatment group assigned to 
subject  is deemed essential for the subject’s safety by [CONTACT_10670]. Emergency unmasking 
may be performed by [CONTACT_913503].  
If the treatment group assigned to subject is unmasked , Investigat or should promptly 
document and explain to the Sponsor about any premature unmasking (e.g., accidental 
unmasking, unmasking due to a serious adverse event) of the investigational product(s) which is treated to the subject .  
Pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unmasking of a subject’s treatment 
group must be documented in the subject’s source documents. This includes who performed 
the unmasking, the subject(s) affected, the reason for the unmasking , the date of the 
unmasking  and the relevant IP information.  
After unma sking (except unmasking  for the purpose of pre-planned regulatory reporting in 
Section 5.2.4.), subjects will be discontinued from the IP (Refer to Section  4.3.).  
8.1.7.  Expectedness Assessment  
Expectedness of AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_913504]’s Brochure ( IB) of the relevant safety section. More detailed information on 
expectedness assessment will be explained in the IB. The latest SmPC of Lucentis
®, Annex I 
of EPAR Product Information posted on EMA website, will be used to assess the 
expectedness for the AEs.

Page [ADDRESS_1283691] withdrawal from the IP due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to 
personal reasons. Subjects withdrawn due to an AE will be followed up until the time point 
specified in the protocol  (refer to Section  4.3.). If s ubjects cannot be followed, the reasons will 
be documented by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator (e.g. , lost to follow -up, refusal to be followed up). When a 
subject withdraws from the IP due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported and followed in 
accordance with the requirements outlined in Section 8.2.2.  
Subjects who are discontinue d from  IPs because of serious or significant safety issues should 
be followed closely until the events are fully and permanently resolved or stabilised.  
8.2. Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Definition o f Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death   
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defects  
• Is medically important  
Life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to  an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913448]. 
Any admission to a healthc are facility more than 24 hours meets these criteria. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (e.g., from the medical 
floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). Staying at the observation unit in the emergency room for more than 24 hours qualifies for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].

Samsung Bioepis – Confidential  
Page 74 of 137 Any events leading to a subsequent emergency ro om visit or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913449] 24 hours may be regarded as medically important for its seriousness criteria, at the 
discretion of the Investigator based on medical judgement. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913450]. Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a pre- existing (prior to ICF signed) condition not 
associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre- existing 
condition 
• Diagnostic admission (e.g., for work-up of persistent pre- treatment laboratory 
abnormality) 
• Social admission (e.g., study subject has no place to sleep)  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for a regular check -up) 
• Protocol-specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_4690]) 
• Elective admission not associated with an AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures  
: Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the relevant source 
document for the individual subject.  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expe dited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]. However, if it is determined 
that the event may jeopardise the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913451]. 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
In addition, sight -threatening ocular adverse event will be reported as SAE if it meets one or 
more of the following criteria:

8.2.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs  that occurred at or before Week 52 ( EOS visit) or ET visit must be reported to Sponsor 
or its designated representative via eCRF SAE report form  at least within 24 h ours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
SAEs that occurred after Week 52 (EOS visit) or ET visit and that are considered to be related 
to the IP must be reported to Sponsor or its designated representative using the paper SAE 
report form at least within 24 h ours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Date and time (wherever possible) of Investigator becoming aware of the SAE will be 
recorded in the SAE form and source document  properly. 
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, Sponsor must be notified immediately, 
irrespective of the extent of available SAE information. This timeframe also appli es to 
additional (follow -up) information that becomes available on previously forwarded SAE 
reports. Sponsor will then follow expedited reporting procedures according to local and 
international regulations as appropriate. 
The Investigator is obligated to p ursue and provide information to Sponsor on all SAEs in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition , Investigator may be 
requested by [CONTACT_913505]- up information in an expedited 
fashion. In general, this will include a description of the SAE, which should be provided in 
sufficient detail so as to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Sponsor or its designated representative.  
All SAEs will be followed until event resolution or stabilisation (for chronic events), if possible, even when a subject is discontinued from IP. For chronic events that does not fully 
resolve until years later, the outcome should be reported as “resolved with sequelae” as soon

The following AEs in  the study eye will be class ified as  Adverse Events of Special Interests 
(AESIs ) in this study:  
• Any case of new onset IOP of > 21 mm Hg that does not respond to treatment, except 
the transient pressure rise observed within an hour  after ITV injection  of IP  
• Any case of IOP ≥ 35 mmHg , at any time, that required treatment 
• Any case of intraocular infection such as endophthalmitis 
• Any case of intraocular inflammation  such as iritis, vitritis and iridocyclitis  
• Iatrogenic traumatic cataract  
• Arterial thromboembolic events defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown as cause) 
8.4. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy, including those of female partners of male subjects treated with the IP, should 
be reported to the Sponsor. If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, a written 
informed consent must be obtained from the female partner before collecting any pregnancy-
related data. All pregnancies associated with the subject, from the time the subject receives the 
first ITV injection of IP  until either Week 52 (EOS visit)  or ET visit, should be reported to the 
Sponsor. Pregnancy reports should be submitted to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1283694] to 
follow-up. The pregnancy outcome should be notified to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-
up Pregnancy Report Form. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the SAE criteria then the Investigator should report this case according to the SAE reporting process ( Section  8.2.2. ). 
8.5. Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent D ata and Safety Monitoring B oard (DSMB) will be assigned for this study. 
The DSMB will consist of external experts (e.g., physician, clinical pharmacologists or 
biostatisticians) and will revie w the safety and tolerability data from the study at pre- specified 
intervals. The details of the safety data and time points for review will be described in the 
DSMB Charter and in the DSMB Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
Further information on the statistical methods to be used in this study will be provided in the 
SAP, which will be finalised prior to the database lock for reporting the main  CSR . 
Statistical analysis and reporting will be performed as follows:  
• Interim safety analysis for independent DSMB  meeting:  
A DSMB SAP, describing the methodol ogy and presentation of results and access to 
results will be prepared as a separate document  and included in the DSMB Charter . The 
safety reports for the DSMB data review meetings will be prepared according to the 
DSMB SAP.  
The statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_913506].  
• Main CSR:  
The main  analysis will take place once all  subjects complete the procedures at Week 24, 
or its corresponding visit . Available efficacy and safety data, pharmacokinetics, and 
immunogenicity data  will be analysed and reported . 
At the time of this reporting,  a limited number of identified individuals of the Sponsor or 
CRO  will be un masked for rep orting purpose. However, s ubjects, I nvestigators, and 
other study personnel will remain masked  throughout the entire study period. 
• Final CSR:  
The final analysis will take place after the last subject completes the procedures at Week 
52 or the corresponding  visit. All study data will be analysed and reported for final CSR. 
9.1. Analysis Sets 
The following sets will be used for the analyses performed in the study: 
• Randomised S et (RAN) consists of all subjects who receive a randomisation number 
at the randomis ation  visit .  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who are randomi sed at the 
randomis ation visit. Following the intent- to-treat principle, subjects will be analysed

subjects who do not qualify for randomisation and are inadvertently randomis ed into 
the study will be excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects do not receive IP 
during the study period. The FAS will be the primary analysis set for BCVA  
• Per-Protocol S et for BCVA (PPS- BCVA) consists of all FAS subjects who have first 
two IP injections and complete the procedures at Week [ADDRESS_1283695] on the BCVA assessment. Major protocol deviations that will lead to exclusion from this set will be pre -defined prior to unmasking the 
treatment group assignment for analyses. 
• Per-Protocol S et for CST (PPS- CST) consists of all FAS subjects who have the first  
IP injection at Week 0 (Day 1 ) and complete the procedures at Week [ADDRESS_1283696]. Major protocol deviations that will lead to 
exclusion from this set will be pre-defined prior to unmasking the treatment codes for 
analyses . 
• Safety Set (SAF) consist s of all subjects who receive at least one IP during the study 
period after randomisation. Subjects will be analysed according to the IP received . 
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis S et (PKS)  consist s of all subjects in the SAF who 
participate  in PK  evaluation  at PK Investigational sites (PK subjects) and have at least 
one PK  sample analysed .  
9.2. Statistical Methods and Analytical Plan  
9.2.1.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be sum marised by [CONTACT_913507]. Continuous variables (e.g., age, weight, height) will be summarised with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum)  and c ategorical variables 
(e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) will be summarised with frequency and percentage.  
Comparison between  treatment groups in baseline characteristics will be performed using the 
chi-square test or F -test as appropriate. The results of these tests will be provided including 
the p- value only for descriptiv e purposes and will not be used as a formal basis to determine 
the factors to be included in primary or secondary efficacy analysis models. If baseline 
imbalances are detected for any of the factors, additional analyses may be performed to adjust for these  baseline differences.  
Relevant medical history will be summarised by [CONTACT_760623].

9.2.2.  Efficacy  
For US FDA, Korea MFDS or other regulatory agency submissions for those who are in 
favour of the VA, t he primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the FAS with the 
change from baseline of BCVA at Week 8 using an analysis of covariance model with the 
baseline BCVA as a covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as factors. 
The equivalence in BCVA will be declared if  the two -sided 90 % Confidence I nterval (CI) of 
the difference in terms of  BCVA Least Squares mean ( LS mean ) changes from baseline at 
Week 8 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within the pre -defined equivalence margin of [− 3 
letters, 3 letters].  
For EMA or other regulatory agency submissions for those who are in favour of the 
anatomical parameter, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed for the per -protocol set 
(PPS- CST)  with the change from baseline of  CST at Week  [ADDRESS_1283697] as a covariate and region (or pooled centres) and treatment group as 
factors . The equivalence in CST will be declared if the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of 
the CST LS mean changes from basel ine in Week 4 between SB11 and Lucentis® lies within 
the pre -defined equivalence margin of [−36 μm, 36 μm]. 
No formal adjustment of Type I error rates will be performed. 
For the primary analysis with the FAS for BCVA, missing data will be imputed for subjects 
who drop out for the study prior to the primary analysis time-point. A missing- at-random 
approach will assume that subjects who withdraw from a study had missing values similar to similar subjects who completed the study in that treatment group. This approach ensures that evidence of lack of equivalence is not diluted when there are missing d ata. For the 
components of BCVA, the missing letter will be imputed by [CONTACT_913509]. For the sensitivity 
analyses, available case analysis and last observation carried forward analysis will be performed.  
All other secondary efficacy measurements will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_29014], and analysed using analysis of covariance model for continuous outcomes or 
Cochran- Mentel -Haenszel method for categori cal outcomes unless otherwise specified . 
9.2.3.  Safety 
All reported terms for AEs (ocular and systemic) will be coded using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA

9.3. Determination of Sample Size  
For the calculation of the equivalence margin  for BCVA, the mean changes in VA were 
referred from two studies of Lucentis® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, 
the mean change of VA at Week 24 (SD) were −6.6 (13.31) letters and 6.5 (12.00) letters for 
placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In FOCUS study, the mean 
change (SD) of VA at Week 24 were −5.0 (16.14) letters and 4.0 (14.41) letters for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta- analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in 
VA of 12.41 letters with a 95% CI [10.34 letters; 14.48 letters]. The derived equivalence limit 
from meta -analysis is 4.9 letters at Week 24, but by [CONTACT_913512] 8 will be 3 letters for the comparison with the 90% CI of mean 
difference between treatment groups.  
With the given equivalence margin of [− 3 letters, 3 letters], [ADDRESS_1283699] deviation (SD)  of 12.5 letters at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 5% loss from 
randomised subjects after  8 weeks , a sample size of 352 subjects per treatment groups (overall 
sample size of 704) will give 334 completers per treatment group after 8 weeks, which is 
estimated to give 80% power to detect the equivalence within the margin of [ADDRESS_1283700] were 
referred from two studies of Lucentis
® in subjects with neovascular AMD. In MARINA study, 
the mean change of CST  at Week 4 (SD) was 8.1 (58.1) μm and −106 (122.5) μm for placebo 
and 0.5 mg Lucentis® treatment groups, respectively. In PI[INVESTIGATOR_913431], the mean change (SD) of 
CST at Week 4 were 15 (94.9) μm and −90 (140.9) μm for placebo and 0.5 mg Lucentis® 
treatment groups , respectively.  
A fixed -effect meta- analysis of the above two studies estimates a weighted mean change in 
CST of −109.6 μm with a 95% CI [−146.45 μm; −72.65 μm]. The derived equivalence limit 
from meta -analysis is 36 μm at Week 4. 
With the given equivalence margin of [−36 μm, 36 μm], 290 subjects per treatment group was 
calculated with the assumptions of the mean difference of 0 between treatment groups, common SD  of 133.3 μm at the overall 5% significance level. Assuming a 10% loss from

Grading Scale for Anterior Chamber Flare  
Flare   
0 No protein is visible in the anterior chamber when viewed by [CONTACT_913521]; a small, bright, focal slit-beam of 
white light; and high magnification.  
Trace  Trace amount of protein detectable in the anterior chamber. This protein is 
visible only with careful scrutiny by [CONTACT_913522]; a small, bright, focal slit-beam of white light; and high 
magnification. 
1+ Mild amount of protein det ectable in the anterior chamber. The presence of 
protein in the anterior chamber is immediately apparent to an experienced observer using slit lamp biomicroscopy and high magnification, but such protein is detected only with careful observation with the na ked eye and a 
small, bright, focal slit-beam of white light. 
2-3+ Moderate amount of protein detectable in the anterior chamber. These grades 
are similar to 1+ but the opacity would be readily visible to the naked eye of an observer using any source of a focused beam of white light, This is a 
continuum of moderate opacification, with 2+ being less apparent than 3+. 
4+ A large (severe) amount of protein is detectable in the anterior chamber. 
Similar to 3+, but the density of the protein approaches that of the lens. 
Additionally, frank fibrin deposition is frequently seen in acute circumstances.  
It needs to be noted that because fibrin may persist for a period of time after 
partial or complete restoration of the blood- aqueous barrier, it is possible to 
have  resorbing fibrin present with lower numeric assignations for flare (e.g., 
1+ flare with fibrin).

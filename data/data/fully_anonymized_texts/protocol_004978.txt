 ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men) is a 10 -session skills -building intervention 
designed to reduce young gay and bisexual men’s (YGBM) co -occu rring health risks by [CONTACT_737682], affective, and behavioral pathways through which minority stress 
impairs YGBM’s health.33,34 ESTEEM is based on the Unified Protocol, a cognitive -behavioral 
therapy (CBT) approach with efficacy across mental health and risk behaviors.35,[ADDRESS_1007699] of 
minority stress, reduce internalized homophobia and reje ction schemas, reduce YGBM’s 
unhealthy avoidance tendencies (e.g., substance use during sex, condom use non -assertion), and 
validate YGBM’s unique strengths. In a preliminary trial ( n=63), ESTEEM significantly reduced 
YGBM’s spectrum of interrelated health  threats, making it the first evidence -based intervention 
to simultaneously improve mental health, substance use, and sexual health outcomes among 
YGBM.[ADDRESS_1007700] that would examine (1) whether ESTEEM (arm 1) 
demonstrates significant improvements compared to existing LGBT -affirma tive community 
mental health treatment (CMHT; arm 2) or standard HIV/STD voluntary counseling and testing 
(VCT; arm 3) for high -risk depressed and anxious YGBM and (2) whether it improves outcomes 
through reducing hypothesized cognitive, affective, and beh avioral minority stress processes.  A 
transdiagnostic treatment like ESTEEM capable of simultaneously improving mental, behavioral, 
and sexual outcomes in a relatively short amount of time maximizes treatment resources in 
constrained economic contexts beca use it reduces the need for training in multiple interventions 
for multiple problems. Yet, as the field has been re -examining the potential utility of individual 
interventions to affect the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], ESTEEM’s potential cost -effectiveness in terms of 
averted mental disorders and HIV infections represents an essential public health question. These 
unanswered questions will be addressed:  
 
Aim 1: Test the efficacy of ESTEEM against (1) community mental health treatment (CMHT) and 
(2) HIV/STD voluntary couns eling and testing (VCT).  Our primary outcome is condomless anal 
sex in the absence of PrEP, with any HIV+ partner  (except primary partners with a known 
undetectable viral load) , casual partner, or status -unknown partner. Knowing whether ESTEEM 
yields greater improvement than time -matched CMHT will establish the benefit of our 
transdiagnostic  approach. Comparing ESTEEM to VCT offers a strong test of ESTEEM’s 
incremental cost -effectiveness.  
 
Aim 2: Determine whether ESTEEM works through its hypothesized cognitive, affective, and 
behavioral minority stress processes . 4-, 8-, and 12 -month follow -ups will determine if 
improvements in minority stress processes precede and statistically  mediate outcome 
Page 8 of 34 
 improvements. Mediation will validate the minority stress theory of ESTEEM and provide 
transdiagnostic targets for future YGBM health interventions.  
 
Aim 3: Estimate ESTEEM’s incremental cost -effectiveness compared to VCT in terms of HIV 
infections averted and improved mental health . ESTEEM shows preliminary efficacy for 
improving the full spectrum of YGBM health. We will collect resource use and cost data to 
estimate return on investment of this transdiagnostic health approach compared to standard 
single outcome/stand -alone treatment approaches.  
 
2. Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide 
references  to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.   
 
Clear and consistent evid ence now suggests that young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) 
disproportionately experience depression, anxiety, and substance use problems compared to 
heterosexual men.1-6 Diverse methods locate the source of these disparities in YGBM’s exposure 
to minority stress —the stress associated with stigma -related social disadvantage.7-10 Minority 
stress also drives YGBM’s HIV risk11-[ADDRESS_1007701], minority s tress, mental health and substance use disparities, and HIV risk fuel each other, 
forming a synergistic threat to YGBM’s health.17-[ADDRESS_1007702] on HIV risk in HIV -uninfected YGBM.  
 
Minority stress theory suggests that stigma compromises YGBM’s health through several 
cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways.10,21 These pathways emerge early in development 
and i nclude negative thinking styles, unhealthy emotion regulation habits, low behavioral self -
efficacy, and behavioral avoidance. Some of these processes are YGBM -specific, such as 
internalized homophobia and expectations of gay -related rejection;22,23 others are universal but 
elevated among YGBM, such as low self -worth and unassertiveness.24,25 All are related to poor 
mental health, substance use prob lems, and HIV risk.12,23,25-31 Our conceptual model suggests that 
an intervention that reduces these minority stress processes could simultaneously improve the 
full spectrum of YGBM’s me ntal, behavioral, and sexual health risks.32   
 
3. Research Plan:  Summarize t he study design and research procedures using non-technical language 
that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894].  If working with a Non -Government 
Organization (NGO) or other organization, be sure to highlight which are research -only activities and 
which activities would occur reg ardless of the research.  
 
We propose to test the efficacy of a principle -based, transdiagnostic (cross -cutting) CBT 
intervention (ESTEEM) that addresses the pathways through which minority stress compromises 
YGBM’s co -occurring mental (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., substance use), and sexual (e.g., 
condomless anal sex) health problems. In this RCT, we expand upon the initial success of our R34 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_737651] (Aim 1), test intervention mechanisms (Aim 2), and 
estimate co st-effectiveness (Aim 3).  
 
Page 9 of 34 
 Aim 1:  We will utilize two comparison conditions —LGB-affirmative community mental health 
treatment ( CMHT ) and brief voluntary HIV testing and counseling (VCT). VCT offers a strong 
control, as it has been shown to reduce condomless anal sex, but not mental disorders or 
substance abuse, in a brief risk -reduction session.[ADDRESS_1007703], non -protocoled LGB -affirmative 
community mental health treatment (CMHT) represents another important test. The efficacy of 
CMHT for YGBM has  never been tested. This represents a startling gap given the significant male 
sexual orientation mental health disparities1-4 and YGBM’s disproportionate treatm ent use.[ADDRESS_1007704] two 
interventions —one brief (VCT), both widespread —represents an essential next step in 
determining ESTEEM’s efficacy and cost -effectiveness.   
 
Aim 2: Follow -up assessments at 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_1007705] whether changes in 
minority stress and mental health precede and statistically mediate the efficacy of ESTEEM. Our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]’s small sample size and lack of follow -up precluded us from testing mediation, but provides 
path estimates necessary to determine sample size and power in full prospective mediation, as 
proposed here.  
 
Aim 3:  CBT-based interventions, such as ESTEEM, are as effective as medication for depression 
and anxiety, effects last l onger with fewer side effects, and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_737652].[ADDRESS_1007706] been shown to avert HIV 
infection but not co -occurring mental health problems. Because of additional time requirements 
for CBT (e.g., training), CBT is also costlier than CMHT. While the current approach of delivering 
stand -alone interventions for isolated health risks is inefficient, the cost -effectiveness of 
multisession skills -based interventions for simultaneously addressing co -occurring health risks 
among the most vulnerable YGBM remains unknown. Two control groups will allow us to 
determine whether ESTEEM yields greater return on investment across the spectrum of YGBM’s 
mental, behavioral, and sexual health than current single -outcome interventions. Collecting cost 
and resource ut ilization data for all intervention conditions will allow us to determine if the 
relatively costlier ESTEEM yields greater cost effectiveness and quality -adjusted life years across 
the spectrum of YGBM’s mental, behavioral, and sexual health than common si ngle -outcome 
interventions , namely CMHT and VCT.  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following three conditions (ESTEEM, 
CMHT, VCT only).  We will use a 2:2:[ADDRESS_1007707] only.   
 
Components of all assessments (baseline 1, baseline 2, 4 -month, 8 -month, 12 -month) will take 
place in our research offices. In the event that a par ticipant moves out of the [LOCATION_001] City area 
or is no longer able to come in to our offices for their follow -up assessessments, we will conduct 
remote assessments via phone  or video conference . The entire baseline [ADDRESS_1007708] over one session in our offices.  Pa rticipants 
assigned to receive CMHT will receive 10 sessions of CMHT at the Institute for Human Identity 
(NYC) or Care Resources (Miami).  CMHT is not prescribed in our treatment manuals, but is 
instead delivered by [CONTACT_737683]. These two sites are 
known for providing LGBT -affirmative treatment in safe, supportive environments. ESTEEM and 
CMHT sessions will be videotaped in the settings where they are delivered [i.e., the Institute for 
Human Identity (NYC) or Care R esources (Miami)] and both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737653] ; all assessments will 
be completed in our research offices and at home for the baseline 1, baseline 2, 4 -month, 8 -
month, a nd 12 -month assessment visits. Tapes of CMHT sessions will be immediately retrieved 
from the video recording devices at the CMHT offices by [CONTACT_737684] [INVESTIGATOR_737654].  
 
Condition 1: ESTEEM.  ESTEEM is a 10 -session interventi on based on the Unified 
Protocol,35,36,120,121 an individually -delivered CBT intervention with efficacy for reducing stress -
sens itive mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) by [CONTACT_737685]; reducing avoidance patterns; and improving motivation and self -efficacy for behavior 
change.35,122 The Unified Protocol employs modules for motivation enhancement, interoceptive 
and situational exposure, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, and self -monitori ng techniques. 
Through an extensive R34 adaptation process described above,34 we adapted the Unified 
Protocol to enhance YGBM’s stigma copi[INVESTIGATOR_737655]. For example, 
modules were adapted to help YGBM identify minority stress experiences; track unhealthy 
reactions to minority stress, focusing on avoidance reactions, like substance use and condomless 
anal sex; attribute distress to minority stress rather than to personal failure; and assert 
themselves against unjust minority stress in safe situations.  Adaptations were infused 
throughout the Unified Protocol Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737656] ;[ADDRESS_1007709] be completed within four 
months.  
 
Page 11 of 34 
 Condition 2: CMHT .  The current standard of care for LGB individuals who seek mental, 
behavioral, or sexual health care is LGB -affirmative therapy.[ADDRESS_1007710] of care.  
In NYC, this community clinic will be the Institute for Human Identity ([ADDRESS_1007711]., [LOCATION_001], 
NY [ZIP_CODE]).  In Miami, this community clinic will be Care Resources ([ADDRESS_1007712]., Miami, 
FL [ZIP_CODE]). CMHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737657]. Similar to participants randomized to ESTEEM, CMHT 
participants will complete [ADDRESS_1007713] be completed within four months.  
 
Condition 3: VCT only.  Participants in all arms will receive VCT at their first baseline visit, before 
being randomized to their respe ctive arms —ESTEEM, CMHT, or VCT only and again at the [ADDRESS_1007714] on CDC guidelines and the control arms of large community -based 
RCTs (e.g., Projects RESPECT, EXPLORE, AWARE).101-[ADDRESS_1007715] for GBM.103 At the be ginning of 
the session, the counselor will explain the purpose of HIV  and STD testing , and with the 
participant’s consent, administer an OraQuick® Rapid HIV -1/[ADDRESS_1007716] 
results, the participant will provide a urine sample and oral and rectal swabs for chlamydia and 
gonorrhea testing, and, when done, the counse lor will review a handout containing facts about 
HIV/STD transmission risk and PrEP. Misconceptions will be clarified. This handout will contain 
provider referrals for participants interested in PrEP or other HIV/STD prevention services. The 
counselor will  then engage in a person -centered discussion to elicit the participant’s current risk 
behavior, the contextual drivers of the behavior, perceptions of the pros/cons of continuing the 
behavior, and self -efficacy for changing the behavior based on the partic ipant’s past success. A 
personalized risk -reduction plan will be created that includes specific, achievable goals the 
participant can implement to reduce risk.[ADDRESS_1007717] result will be referred to nearby 
[CONTACT_737686] (e.g., Care Resource, Gay M en’s Health Crisis, Callen -Lorde Community 
Health Center, Mount Sinai Beth Israel) for confirmatory testing and appropriate care.  Urine, 
oral, and rectal samples will be sent to a lab (Quest Diagnostics) for testing. We will notify 
participants who screen  positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea immediately upon receiving the lab 
results and refer them to a nearby [CONTACT_737687].

5. Describe how access to the population will be gained in the study.  
 
We will use active and passive recruitment strategies. Acti ve approaches will involve conducting 
eligibility screening via electronic tablet at bars/clubs and support groups (e.g., coming out 
groups and 20 -somethings group at the NYC LGBT Center). Passive approaches will involve 
advertising on YGBM -oriented mobile  apps and websites (e.g., Grindr, Scruff, BGCLive , Growlr ), 
clinic waiting rooms (e.g., Callen -Lorde Community Health Center, college counseling centers), 
YGBM -focused media (e.g., Craigslist, Facebook, Reddit, party listservs), and referrals from 
previous  or current study participants.  As part of passive recruitment we will also contact 
[CONTACT_737688]. 
Advertisements will engage help -seeking YGBM by [CONTACT_34743] a saf e venue for 
discussing sex and HIV.

3) current enrollment in an intervention study; 4) current enr ollment in intensive mental health 
treatment ( receiving treatment more than once per month or [ADDRESS_1007721] year ); or 5) HIV -positive status. There are no exclusion criteria for CMHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737664].  
 
 
SECTION  V: RECRUITMENT /CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCEDURES  
 
1. Recruitment Procedures:  
1. Describe how potential participants will be identified and contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and by 
[CONTACT_20898].  
 
We will employ a number of strategies to recruit intervention participants. These strategies are 
designed to recruit an ethnically diverse sample from multiple types of venues in which gay and 
bisexual men are likely to be accessed (e.g., online social networking apps and websites, social 
Page 14 of 34 
 venues, communi ty based organizations, health care organizations, gay bars/clubs).  
 
1) Online recruitment.  Online recruitment for our existing studies has been successfully utilized. 
The proposed study's ads will target HIV -negative gay and bisexual men who are over [ADDRESS_1007722], and other social networking sites for gay and bisexual men. Potential participants will 
link to our website, read about the study and undergo a scre ener.  
 
2) Passive recruitment.  Passive recruitment will be employed at different venues, including, for 
example, locations and events serving YGBM, such as bars and dance clubs, Pride events, street 
fairs, bookstores, community centers, and health care cl inics. These venues will have given us 
permission to post recruitment materials. Our recruitment staff will provide venues with 
recruitment materials such as tear off flyers and recruitment cards containing information such as 
study name, goals, and contac t information for those interested in screening for eligibility.  
 
3) Recruitment of participants from past studies. At the end of one of our current studies ( Urban 
Migration, Self -Regulation, and Drug Abuse and HIV Risk Among Young Men, Protocol #: 
1405013 946) , we ask participants whether they would be willing to be contact[CONTACT_7663]. Participants who consented to be contact[CONTACT_737689]. We will also recruit from a prior study ca lled Gay Community 
Stressors Among Gay, Bisexual, and Queer Men (Protocol #: [PHONE_559] ). Additionally, 
participants from a colleague’s study (Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable 
Prescription among Providers, Protocol #: [PHONE_15330]) who con sented to being contact[CONTACT_737690]. As well as participants who consented to being contact[CONTACT_737691] r Prevention studies lab.  
 
4) Active recruitment. In active recruitment, our recruitment staff will approach potential 
participants in a wide range of venues frequented by [CONTACT_737692] a coup le of minutes about HIV prevention and psychosocial 
health research. If the individual is willing, the recruiter will briefly describe the study and ask if 
they would be willing to answer a few questions to see if they might be eligible. If the potential 
participant does not want to answer the questions right then, the recruiter will give the 
participant a recruitment card and ask them to call the study number should they decide they 
would like to participate at some point in the future . 
  
If the potential participant agrees to answer the eligibility questions, the recruiter will give the 
participant a tablet  device so that they may answer the screening questions in private. The field 
screening questions are designed to give a general sense of eligibility fo r the project (such as age, 
recent sex, and HIV status), but not to determine strict eligibility for the study. At the end of the 
screening questions, the participant will be prompted to provide their name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_737693]. The p articipant will have the opportunity to have his contact 
[CONTACT_737694]. The recruiter 
will inform interested participants that they will receive a call to participate in a full study 
Page 15 of 34 
 screener if they are eligible for the study. If not, participants will not be follow up with.  
 
Recruiters will visit bars/clubs to post study materials and hand out study contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
Recruiters will also visit bars/clubs and other venues with table ts set up with screening questions 
for the potential participant to complete; this field screening survey is preliminary and if the 
potential participant screens eligible, he will provide contact [CONTACT_552616], after 
which the recruiter wil l inform him that he can expect a call/email from a research assistant to 
complete the full study screener.  The tablet will be password protecte d. No data will be stored on 
the tablet. The survey will be hosted on Qualtrics and only accessed if wifi is available to 
complete it.  Use of a tablet to complete a preliminary screening helps to maintain privacy, even 
in a crowded bar setting, given that th e potential participant can read the survey to himself, 
rather than answering questions aloud to the recruiter; a privacy screen protector will also be 
used on the tablet so as to prevent outsiders from overseeing questions/responses on the tablet. 
As an a dditional measure of privacy, recruiters will locate the most private part of the bar/club to 
do these screenings.  
 
Throughout the course of the study,  we will  periodically hold sweepstakes for people who 
complete our in -person screening survey. We will po ol the contact [CONTACT_737695] (noted by [CONTACT_206279]) and will use a random number 
generator to select people to win the prize. The sweepstakes prize will be a $[ADDRESS_1007723] that will 
be emailed to them im mediately after the selection of the winners.  
 
5) Letters and postcards sent to community organizations.  We will send a letter and postcards to 
community organizations, including community -based organizations supporting the LGBT 
community and local colleg e counseling centers.  The letter will ask these organizations to 
distribute the postcards in their waiting areas and to potentially eligibile individuals.   
 
6) Peer -recruitment and referrals by [CONTACT_34747]. Participants in the  
study will be asked to distribute study recruitment materials to peers who may be interested in 
participating in the study. Participants will be reminded that staff will never disclose any 
information about an individual’s participantion in the study, but  that participants are free to 
disclose information about their own participation to whomever they desire. Participants are not 
required to distribute recruitment materials as a condition of study participation and the strictly 
voluntary nature of this req uest will be emphasized by [CONTACT_464].  
 
Recruitment text and images are attached to this application.  
 
Are you collecting any information about the individuals prior to their signing a consent form?  
Yes  No   
If yes, i ndicate what information you will be collecting and how it will be gathered (phone screen, 
paper questionnaire, etc.)

4.   How was this estimate derived?  
 
Our primary goal is to demonstrate a greater reduction at 4, 8, and 12 months in “unprotected 
sex” as defined as past -90-day condomless anal sex without PrEP or with HIV+ or status -unknown 
casual partners or with HIV+ primary partners without known undetectable viral load, in the 
ESTEEM arm versus the CMHT and VCT arms. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we saw a  60% reduction in 
condomless anal sex at [ADDRESS_1007726] that these arms will 
yield lower reductions com pared to ESTEEM, but a slightly larger reduction in CMHT (20%) 
compared to VCT (15%). To achieve at least 90% power at a 5% type I error rate, accounting for 
an R -square of 0.[ADDRESS_1007727] arm.  Although we plan to take steps to 
increase our retention rate from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we conservatively estimate the retention at 6 
months to be 80%. Therefore, we plan to randomize [ADDRESS_1007728] YGBM. 
Sample size calculations were carried out using PASS 12 (Kaysville, Utah) for logistic regression. 
For secondary outcomes (e.g., mental health, substance use), we will have 80% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_1007729], respectively, at a type I 
error rate of 0.01 (conservative due to multiple testing). These effect sizes are smaller than those 
found in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].

6. Process of Consent/Assent  (NOTE: When a study includes minor s, parent provide permission [not 
consent] for the child’s participation, and the child provides assent for participation)  
 
Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, including 
parental permission or surrogate permissi on and the steps taken to ensure participants’ 
independent decision -making.  
 
Informed consent will be obtained for all participants at two points – before completion of the 
phone screener and/or in -person screener and before completion of the first in -office baseline 
assessment.  A small selection of participants previously randomized to ESTEEM will also be 
contact[CONTACT_737696][INVESTIGATOR_737665].  
 
Before administering the phone screener, a project staff member will first assess participants’ 
willingness and capacity to consent to completing the brief (15 min) screener to determine 
eligibility.  Pa rticipants will provide their verbal consent for the phone screener. Participants’ 
identifying information, including their name, will be kept in a separate database from the 
remainder of their study responses.  
 
Before completing the in -person screener, participants will review an online consent form 
describing the screening purpose and risks/benefits and indicate their consent by [CONTACT_737697] 18 of 34 
 commensurate button. Participants’ identifying information, including their name, will be kept in 
a separate database from the remainder of their study responses. Participants who are deemed 
preliminarily eligible based on the in -person screen will be contact[CONTACT_737698].  
 
Participants who are deemed eligible  based on the phone screener will then be invited to the 
office for a baseline [ADDRESS_1007730] risk.  
Participants who choose to participate in the re mainder of the study will be asked to sign the 
consent form in the presence of the staff member (in -office) or provide verbal consent (phone 
screen).  
 
We will select video clips from approximately 12 total sessions delivered to approximately five 
currently  and formerl y enrolled study participants. These videos do not contain participants’ 
faces or identifiable information other than participants’ voice and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ image and voice. 
Selected p articipants who have completed ESTEEM therapy will be contact[CONTACT_737699] -based clinics 
and agencies . Participant will be contact[CONTACT_737700][INVESTIGATOR_253730] a research team 
member. The research team member or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737666]. T hey will also be reminded in that videos do not include the participant’s face 
or any identifiable information, only their voice and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s face and voice. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737667] . Newly recruited participants will be able to note on 
the informed consent form whether or not they consent to have a small selection of their therapy 
recording used in the future for new t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_737668].  
 
CMHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737669].  
 
7. Evaluation of Participant(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent:  Indicate how the 
personnel obtaining consent will assess th e potential participant’s ability and capacity to consent to 
the research being proposed, if applicable  
 
Prior to the in -office appointments, a trained Research Assistant (RA) will assess participants' 
consent in a private room. The RA will ensure that the  participant understands the risks 
associated with the disclosure of information that could indicate imminent threat to self or 
others. Verification of comprehension of informed consent will be accomplished by [CONTACT_737701] i n the consent process; points of confusion will be clarified. 
Once participants have fully understood the consent, they will be asked to sign the consent form.  
Page [ADDRESS_1007731] coordinator if he or she is unsure about an y 
participant's capacity to consent.   
 
For the phone screener, participants will be asked to provide verbal consent prior to answering 
the screener questions.  
 
For the in -person screener, recruitment staff will assess willingness and capacity to consent to 
completing the brief (4 min) screener  to determine eligibility (e.g., visible signs of substance 
intoxication).  Those who are deemed capable of providing consent will be asked to review the 
consent form and indicate their consent on the consent form delivered via iPad / tablet.  
Participants  who are deemed to be incapable of providing consent will be provided with a 
recruitment card with our contact [CONTACT_737702] a phone screen 
once they are not incapacitated.    
 
CMHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737670].  
 
 
8. Documentation of Consent/Assent:  Specify the documents or verbal scripts that will be used 
during the consent/assent process. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_737671], in 
the same format that they will be given or spoken to participants.  
 
Please find attached a copy of the: 1) phone screener consent text, 2) in -person consent, 3) in 
office consent, 4) therapy video viewing consent text, 5 ) consent form for CMHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . 
 
9. Non -English Speaking Participants:  Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for 
research involving non -English speaking participants. Translated copi[INVESTIGATOR_34724]. Do you speak the local language?  Will you require a 
translator? (If so, please elaborate on how the translators will be trained).  
 
At this point, only English speakers will be enrolled in this study.  
 
10. Are any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting 
requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -incidents 
of child abuse, elderly abuse, etc.). Please verify to whom such in stances will need to be reported.  
 
HIV and STI Testing  
We will be conducting HIV testing using OraQuick® HIV-1/[ADDRESS_1007732] 
[sensitivity: 99.6% (98.5 –99.9); specificity: 100% (99.7 –100)] on all participants at two time points 
(in-office baseline and 12 -month follow -up assessment appointments). All project staff will 
complete HIV/STI testing and counseling training.   
 
Like conventional HIV enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), rapid HIV tests are screening  (i.e., not 
diagnostic) tests tha t require diagnostic confirmation by [CONTACT_737703] (positive).  
Page [ADDRESS_1007733] preliminarily positive will be immediately referred to local community HIV 
clinics (e.g., Callen -Lorde Community Health or Beth Israel in NYC, Care Resources in Miami) for 
confirmatory testing, care, and treatment.  If a participant is unaware of his HIV status and tests 
positive for the first time in our study, he will be referred for immediate counseling and 
treatment. Appropriate risk -reduction counseling wi ll be provided to all participants as part of 
their study participation as part of the VCT condition, which all participants will receive. 
Participants testing HIV positive will not be randomized into the study, as HIV negative status is 
one of the inclusi on criteria, so they will receive immediate counseling by [CONTACT_464]. Study staff 
will provide all participants with lubricant and condoms. Study staff will seek HIV testing consent 
from the participants during the informed consent process. HIV test resul ts will be returned to 
participants by [CONTACT_737704]. If the participant is 
preliminarily determined to be HIV -infected, study staff will direct the participant to established 
services for HIV -infected individuals in NY C or Miami; study staff will make an appointment for 
participants at the participant’s desired confirmatory testing site (either our recommendation or 
their current provider). We will provide a staff escort to one of the recommended testing sites for 
parti cipants who explicitly request such.  
 
Participants will receive results of the HIV rapid testing in person from the VCT counselor, 
following the guidelines in the VCT manual. The rapid test results will be ready in [ADDRESS_1007734] prior to receiving the results, the counselor will 
schedule a time to return to the study site to be retested so that he can receive results in person. 
If for some reason, the participant cannot return to be retested, we will provide  results by [CONTACT_737705]. The clinical 
protocol will be followed.  
 
STI testing (chlamydia and gonorrhea) will utilize the Quest Diagnostics collection kits for urine 
sample and rectal  and oral swap collection. Participants will self -administer these sample 
collections following instructions of the trained research staff member. The counselor will follow 
Quest Diagnostics protocol for sending the samples to the assigned Quest laboratory  location for 
assaying. Quest will send the test results to ESTEEM within one week, at which point ESTEEM 
staff will immediately notify participants of the results. A positive test is sufficient for diagnosis 
and participants will be directed to the respec tive partnering community clinic for treatment and 
follow up, unless participant prefers to access care at health clinic of his choice.  
 
Sites that conduct screening tests such as our HIV screening test are required to connect 
participants to a site capabl e of providing confirmatory testing in the event of a preliminary 
positive.  With regards to gonorrhea or chlamydia testing, participants who test positive for 
gonorrhea or chlamydia must be reported to the Department of Health. However, participants 
thems elves will not be contact[CONTACT_737706], 
as planned for this study. Participants will be notified of this requirement in the written consent 
form given at the baseline assessment. In [LOCATION_012] law, there  is a provision for identity protection 
of participants for “authorized medical or epi[INVESTIGATOR_737672];” participants are assured of their identity 
protection throughout th e course of the study, and given the epi[INVESTIGATOR_737673] [ADDRESS_1007735] 911 to 
dispatch police or paramedics. Only the minimal necessary identifying information will be 
provided to these personnel.  In less imminent instances of distress, we will refer distressed 
participants to local mental or behavioral health services.  All self -report questionnaires assessing 
suicidality will be given in -office where participants can be monitored by a clinical staff member. 
Clinical staff members will receive an alert if the participant ans wers the online questionnaires in 
a manner that signals distress ; such participants will be met by [CONTACT_737707].   
 
Participants will be notified of the reporting requirements under these circumstances during the 
consent process.  
 
In the event that a participant is unable to complete the self -report questionnaires in the office, 
we will conduct remote assessments. Prior to these assesments, the Senior Research Assistant 
will contact [CONTACT_737708]. The  session will be 
completed via video or phone call depending on participant preference. It will be conducted by a 
clinically trained research staff member who will administer the assessment and will follow the 
same in -office clinical protocol for expressed imminent participant distress, by [CONTACT_69996]’s nearest emergency services  only in the instance of imminent risk .  
 
 
11. Consent/Consent Waiver: In certain circumstances, the IRB may grant a waiver of documentatio n 
of consent, or a full waiver of consent, depending on the study. If you will request either a waiver 
of consent, or a waiver of signed consent for this study, complete the appropriate section below.   
  I plan to obtain signed consent  
  I plan to obtain verbal or online consent        
  I plan to obtain signed consent for part of the study, and verbal or online consent for 
another part of the study.  
   I do not plan on obtaining consent due to the nature of the study ( explain):

Consent will be obtained for all study com ponents either verbally or signed or online as described 
above.  However, we will not require participants to provide their name [CONTACT_737720] (e.g., gay bars, 
clubs , parks).  This brief (4 min) screen will assess age, HIV status, HIV and substance use risk 
behavior, and depression and anxiety symptoms to determine preliminary eligibility for this study.  
This brief screen does not pose greater than minimal risk.  Bef ore completing this screen, 
participants will be told via online text that this screen will ask several personal questions to 
determine eligibility for a larger study and that participants can choose to provide their name [CONTACT_13255] [CONTACT_737709]. 
Preliminarily eligible participants will be asked to provide their name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_737710] a call or email containing more information on how to complete a more 
compre hensive phone screen to verify study eligibility.  Participants’ identifying information, 
including their name, will be kept in a separate database from the remainder of their study 
responses. Participants will provide consent before completing this more c omprehensive phone 
screen, as described above.   
 
 
 Requesting a full waiver of consent  
    
If requesting a full waiver of consent, please address the following:  
 
   a. Does the research pose greater than minimal risk to participants?

SECTION  VI: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS  
 
    Confidentiality & Security of Data:  
 
1. What participant information will you be collecting?  
 
The full packet of study measures and assessments is attached to this application.  We propose to 
collect information about participants’ general mental health status; HIV risk; demographics; HIV 
status; chlamydia and gonorrhea infection; experiences with stigma -related stress; depression and 
anxiety; cognitive, affective, and interpersonal functioning (e.g., rumination, social support, 
impu lsivity, assertiveness); mental health treatment history and perspectives; substance use; 
sexual compulsivity; and perceptions of intervention helpfulness.  We will also video tape -record all 
intervention sessions. Counselors will also complete session not es. Each participant will have a 
binder that contains all session notes. No name [CONTACT_737721], only participant ID. 
The binders will be locked in a filing cabinet.  
 
Participants will provide the following data at baseline and 4 -, 8-, and 12 -month follow -up 
appointments: (1) quantitative assessments, previously used with young gay and bisexual men,  of 
mental health, substance use, and stigma -related stress, (2) intervi ewer -administered timeline 
follow -back of HIV risk behavior, including condomless anal, sex while under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol, PrEP use and adherence, and number of sexual partners, during the previous 3 months, 
(3) interviewer -administered men tal health assessment with the Mini -International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) , (4) OraSure rapid HIV 1/[ADDRESS_1007736] (at baseline and 12 -
month follow -up), (5) urine sample and rectal and oral swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea testing 
(at baseline a nd 12 -month follow -up), and ( 6) engagement in the intervention.   
 
Participants who complete remote assessments will be asked to provide their address to research 
staff to aide in establishing contact [CONTACT_737711], if necessary. Th is 
information will be stored in a password protected contact [CONTACT_737712]. Once addresses are stored in the database, any emails containing identifiable 
participant information will immediately be hard deleted f rom study inboxes.  
 
2. Will any of the following identifiers be collected?  
 Names  
 All geographic subdivisions sm aller than a State, including: street address, city, county, precinct, 
zip codes  
 Telephone numbers  
 Fax numbers  
 E-mail addresses  
 Social Security numbers  
 Medical record numbers  
 Health plan beneficiary numbers  
 Account numbers  
Page 24 of 34 
   All elements of dates (except year) for dates related to an individual, including: birth date, 
admission date, discharge date, date of death, all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including 
year) indicative of such age, except that such ages a nd elements may be aggregated into a single 
category of age 90 or older  
 Certificate/license numbers  
 Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers  
 Device identifiers and serial numbers  
 Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)  
 Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers  
 Biometric identifiers, including finger and voiceprints  
 Full face photographic images and any comparable images  
 Any other unique identifying numbers, characteristics, or codes  
 
Other potentially identifying information to be collected:  
 Audiotapes  
 Videotapes  
 Faces (focus groups, photographs or other way that an individual would be physica lly recognized)  
 Potential for identification from the bulk of the information, even if direct identifiers are not collected (deductive 
disclosure).  
 
3. If applicable, what methods and procedures will be used to  safeguard the confidentiality and 
security of the identifiable study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the 
participant’s participation in the study?  
Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No 
         If no, see http://its.yale.edu/s ecure -computing/protecting -yales -data/data -encryption  and 
http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html  
 
The primary potential risk to participants is breach of confidentiality. Breaches of confidenti ality 
will occur if a participant reports a clear intention to harm himself or another person. Additionally, 
health care professionals are required by [CONTACT_206290].  
The likelihood that any additional breaches of confidentiality would occur is minimal, as steps will 
be taken to guard against this risk.  To protect participants’ confidentiality, we will obtain a Federal 
Certifica te of Confidentiality prior to enrolling participants . All counselors and research assis tants 
(RAs) will undergo rigorous training in maintaining participants’ privacy and confidentiality and will 
be in possession of valid Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) certificates.  Further, 
immediately upon providing consent, all pa rticipants will be assigned an identification number, 
which will only be kept on an electronic database that will be password protected and located on a 
designated study computer. This information will not be stored with any other data and no other 
identif ying information will appear on any form. All contact [CONTACT_737713][INVESTIGATOR_737674], emailing, or mailing information to participants. All materials wi th identifying 
information will be kept in one password protected electronic file.  Participants will provide the 
respective site, Yale or Miami, with alternative contact [CONTACT_3031] (email, phone numbers, and 
mailing address) for compensation and study re tention purposes.  This information will be treated 
in the same confidential manner as all participant information, as described here.  For participants 
Page [ADDRESS_1007737] or research team member 
acquiring this specific consent that all therapy video sessions only contain their voice and no 
images of their face or other identifying information.  
 
Secure digital (SD) memory cards for the recording equipment will be stored at the research study 
site. When the video cameras are at community sites they will be retrieved weekly and brought 
back to the study site in a lock box. Data will immediately be u ploaded to the Secure Box server on 
a Yale computer and the memory cards will be cleared.  
 
4. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored?  
 
Research data will be collected via telephone, on electronic tablets, electronic databases, survey  
websites, paper -and-pencil, electronic documents, video recording, and specimen sample for HIV, 
chlamydia, and gonorrhea.  
 
Preliminary screening data will be collected in the field using online tablets.  Screening data will 
also be collected on a secure survey website (Qualtrics.com) and via telephone, whereby a study 
staff member asks the potential participant a series of eligibility questions and enters this 
information into an electronic database at our research offices.  Participants will complete 
surveys at our study sites/offices via yale.qualtrics.com. Participants themselves will enter most 
data into Qualtrics.com directly.  However, study staff will enter interviewer -based data (e.g., 
clinical diagnostic assessment, timeline follow -back interview of risk behavior) into Qualtrics.com 
during the interview. Study sessions will be videotaped for quality control and will be 
downloaded to Yale’s HIPAA -compliant Secure Box drive upon retrieval from study cameras. 
Participant session notes will be stored i n a binder unique to each participant; these binders will 
be stored in a locked filing cabinet. Participant tracking and scheduling data will be recorded on a 
study database.  One password -protected linking database containing participant names and ID 
code s will be kept at each of our offices and accessible only be study staff.  
 
Participants  will be identified with participant ID number, not with participant name.  The 
diagnostic laboratory that will assay for chlamydia and gonorrhea will not have access to  
participants’ names, only their ID number.  
 
All study computers will be encrypted and password protected.  All filing cabinets will be locked.  
Online surveys (yale.qualtrics.com) will use an encrypted web service (https) and will not ask 
participants’ na me or other identifying information, only participant ID number.  The linking 
database will be kept separate from study data and will be password protected.  
 
5. How will the digital data be stored?  CD   DVD   Flash Drive   Portable Hard    
       Drive   Secured Ser ver   Laptop Computer   Desktop Computer  Audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_737675] 26 of 34 
 1. If applicable, how will transfer of data to Yale be completed? See http://its.yale.edu/secure -
computing/protecting -yales -data/data -and-information -classification -yale-university  
 
Data will be tran sferred from the University of Miami to Yale using the HIPAA compliant Yale Box. 
Videotape data from our CMHT sites will be retrieved in person by a study staff member 
transported via lock box to the research study office and downloaded to Yale Box upon ar riving to 
our offices.  
 
2. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy     
the identifiable data or the link to personal identifiers? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_737714]. If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be 
secured.  
 
After study completion, data will be stored on an encrypted, password -protected server at the Yale 
School of Public Health.  The identifiable data will remain separate from the remainder of 
participant data.  After three years of study completion, the link to personal identifiers will be 
destroyed.  
 
3. Will a Certificate of Confidentiality  be needed? ( See also the NIH Certificate of Confidentiality 
Kiosk, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/index.htm ) 
 
We have recei ved an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality.  
 
SECTION  VII: POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
1.  Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to participant privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with participants participating in the research. Note: All studies have the 
potential for risk, if not physical, there may be psyc hological, reputational, or financial risks or risks to 
breach of confidentiality  
 
The study participants are at minimal risk for harm as a result of participation in the proposed 
research study. Although unlikely, one risk of the proposed study is that pa rticipants will 
experience emotional discomfort as a result of completing the quantitative assessments or the 
intervention. Breach of participants' confidentiality presents another possible risk.  The 
investigative team's strategies to protect against both  risks are described below.  
 
Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above -mentioned risks will be minimized.  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent : The investigative team has conducted a number of studies 
involving young gay and bisexual men, which  have involved asking participants to complete 
potentially sensitive interviews and self -report measures.  Thus, we have extensive protocols in 
place for all aspects of the study.  All staff complete IRB (re)certification as required. All new staff 
and res earch volunteers will receive local training in issues pertinent to research among young gay 
and bisexual men, and will sign a confidentiality pledge prior to any contact [CONTACT_737715] [ADDRESS_1007738] used for active recruitment, 
including instructions t o call the number should they wish to participate.  Before completing phone 
screening questions, participants will be briefed on consent and asked to provide verbal consent 
specific to the screening.  
 
Prior to the in -office appointments, a trained Research  Assistant (RA) will assess participants' 
consent in a private room. The RA will ensure that the participant understands the risks associated 
with the disclosure of information that could indicate imminent threat to self or others. Verification 
of comprehe nsion of informed consent will be accomplished by [CONTACT_737716]; points of confusion will be clarified. Once participants have fully 
understood the consent, they will be asked to sign the consent form.  RAs will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_34723]'s capacity to 
consent.  
 
Protection Against Emotional Discomfort .  It is possible that participants may experience emotional 
discomfort in respond ing to assessments or receiving HIV/STD test results.  While every possible 
step will be taken to minimize such risk, consent documentation will make it clear that if 
participants have any concerns about any aspect of the study they may refuse to continue with the 
study at any time, without penalty. In addition, we will remind participants during the course of 
their assessments that they can refuse to answer any questions and may discontinue participation 
at any time.  Staff members at our Yale and Miami la bs will be thoroughly trained in appropriate 
responses to participant distress through tri -annual trainings by a licensed clinical psychologist.  
This training will address the appropriate handling of imminent threats and provision of referrals to 
free cou nseling services in less imminent clinical situations. We have developed a protocol for 
immediately referring participants who learn that they are HIV -positive or infected with chlamydia 
or gonorrhea as a result of our study to a local LGBT -affirmative HIV  care clinic (Callen -Lorde 
Community Health Center or Mount Sinai Beth Israel at the [LOCATION_001] site; Care Resource at the 
Miami site).  
  
Protection Against Breach of Confidentiality . The primary potential risk to participants is breach of 
confidentiality. Breaches of confidentiality will occur if a participant reports a clear intention to 
harm himself or another person. Additionally, health care professionals are required by [CONTACT_34762].  The likelihood that any a dditional breaches of 
confidentiality would occur is minimal, as steps will be taken to guard against this risk.  To protect 
participants’ confidentiality, we will obtain a Federal Certifica te of Confidentiality prior to enrolling 
participants . All counsel ors and research assistants (RAs) will undergo rigorous training in 
maintaining participants’ privacy and confidentiality and will be in possession of valid Collaborative 
Page 28 of 34 
 Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) certificates.  Further, immediately upon pro viding consent, all 
participants will be assigned an identification number, which will only be kept on an electronic 
database that will be password protected and located on a designated study computer. This 
information will not be stored with any other dat a and no other identifying information will appear 
on any form. All contact [CONTACT_737717], emailing, or mailing information to 
particip ants. All materials with identifying information will be kept in one password protected 
electronic file.  Participants will provide the respective site, Yale or Miami, with alternative contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (email, phone numbers, and mailing address) for com pensation and study retention 
purposes.  This information will be treated in the same confidential manner as all participant 
information, as described here.   
 
2. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: All studies require the inclusion of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) with an explicit statement of overall risks (e.g., minimal, greater than minimal/moderate, or 
high), a means to address attribution and grading of adverse events and a descriptio n of procedures for 
monitoring the ongoing progress of the research and reporting adverse events. The Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan should describe how the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34732]. It 
should document the procedures and means to protect the welfare and safety of subjects and protect 
the integrity of the data.   
 
The plan must include provisions for data review and perform ance of safety reviews, at a specified 
frequency, as well as the plan for reporting to the HSC and/or other internal or external organizations.  
When participating in a multi -site study, the Yale principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_737676]/ or reporting of serious adverse events from other sites will be provided to the Yale HSC.   
 
Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment 
stated below. (Note: the HSC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.).  
1. What is your assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study?  
 
minimal  
 
2. If children are involved, what is your assessment of the overall risk level for the children 
participating in th is study?  
 
N/A 
 
c. Copy, paste, and then tailor an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
from http://www.yale.edu/hrpp/forms -templates/biomedical.html   for 
1. Minimal risk  
2. Greate r than minimal/moderate risk  
3. High  
Page 29 of 34 
  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews quarterly. During the review process the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34734], require modification/amendment, or 
close to enrollment.  
 
The principal investigator, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB)  have the authority  to stop or suspend the stud y or require modifications.  
 
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event 
that such events occur, Reportable Events (which are event s that are serious or life -threatening and 
unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected)  and possibly, 
probably, or definitely related) or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that 
may require a  temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be reported 
immediately (if possible), followed by a written report within 5 calendar days of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20866] (using the appropriate forms from the 
website) and any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. The investigator will apprise fellow 
investigators and study personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_737677] (e.g., through regular study m eetings, via email as they are reviewed by [CONTACT_28824].)  The protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., the DSMBs, NIH, will be informed 
of serious or unanticipated adverse events within [ADDRESS_1007739] igator.  
 
3. For multi -site studies for which the Yale PI [INVESTIGATOR_22422]:  
1. How will adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others be reported, reviewed and managed?  
2. What provisions are in place for management o f interim results?  
3. What will the multi -site process be for protocol modifications?  
 
The Miami site -PI, [CONTACT_737724], will notify PI [INVESTIGATOR_737678]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_737679], 
the DSMB, and the NIH.  
 
This behavioral/edu cational intervention trial is sufficiently powered to detect effects consistent 
with those found in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] a highly similar intervention.  We therefore do not expect 
that this trial will produce results that warrant early termination of this s tudy or any of its 
components.   
 
Protocol modification will be coordinated between the two sites in meetings between [CONTACT_737725] (Yale) and [CONTACT_289310] (Miami).

 4. Potential Benefits:  Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the  research, 
either to the participant(s) or to society at large. ( Payment of participants is not considered a benefit in 
this context of the risk benefit assessment.)  
 
Sexual risk behavior among young gay and bisexual men is a clear public health concern. All 
participants in the present study will be exposed to information about HIV transmission risks in 
relation to social stress and co -occurring mental health disorders.  We anticipate that participants 
will acquire knowledge and skills and will receive support needed to improve their capacity for 
managing HIV risk. Benefits to society in general are anticipated through the dissemination of 
intervention findings  and commun ity trainings in the ESTEEM treatment approach . Results will 
better inform local and national public health agencies about potentially effective outreach and 
prevention strategies that can be delivered to YGBM who experience lifetime stress -sensitive 
menta l health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behavior. In sum, the 
potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to subjects, which are minimal.  
 
We propose to further test a preliminarily efficacious intervention to better help YGBM manage 
their HIV risk.  Findings from this study can be used to help guide prevention efforts for both YGBM 
and other socially disadvantaged groups who experience stress -sensitive mental health disorders 
and are at risk of HIV infection.  Given the public health importance addressed by [CONTACT_737718], we believe that the risk to subjects is 
reasonable. Further, the information from this intervention can serve to benefit more widespread 
sexual risk -redu ction efforts. Specifically, information from this study will inform public health 
agencies regarding the effectiveness of an intervention that addresses co -occurring behavioral risk 
factors for HIV infection.  This test will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the 
strategic implementation of this intervention alongside effective structural and biomedical 
approaches.   
 
         SECTION  VIII: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  
 
1.     Alternatives:  What other alternatives, if any, are available to the study participants outside of the 
research?  
 
All participants and potential participants will be provided with a list of community referrals, 
including medical, HIV/STD testing, psychological, substanc e use, and housing supports.  
 
2.  Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations):  Describe any payments that will be made 
to participants, if any, the amount and timing of payments and the conditions for receiving this 
compensation (if applicable). I f you plan to hold a drawing, be sure to include the following on 
any consent or recruitment materials mentioning the sweepstakes : 1) the value of the prize; 2) 
the sponsor of the prize (this cannot be a federal funding source); 3) the odds of winning; 4) that 
there are no restrictions to winning.  
 
Participants will receive $25 for completing each of the two baseline assessments (baseline 1 and 
baseline 2) , $50 for completing the  4-month  and 8 -month  follow -up assessments , and $75 for 
Page 31 of 34 
 completing the final 12 -month follow -up assessment (total = $ 225). Participants randomized to the 
ESTEEM condition and CMHT condition will receive $10 per session for $10 sessions (total = $100). 
Therefore, depending on condition assignment, participants will receive between $ 225 and $ 325 
for completing all aspects of the study.  Payment will be prorated for partial study completion (i.e., 
participants will only be paid for the parts of the study that they completed ). 
 
Throughout the course of the study, we will hold a monthly sweepstakes  at the [LOCATION_001] site for 
participants who have completed their 4 -month , 8-month , or 12 -month follow -up appointments in 
the previous month . This sweepstakes  winner will be selected u sing a random number generator. 
Winners will receive a $[ADDRESS_1007740] which will be emailed to them directly after the selection of the 
sweepstakes  winner. Participants will be notified about the sweepstakes  prize, odds of winning, 
and prize sponsor in their monthly appointment reminder emails from the ESTEEM research team.  
 
Annually , we will also hold a sweepstakes  at the [LOCATION_001] site for all randomized [LOCATION_001] 
participants who successfully completed all of their follow up  assessment s (4, 8, and 12 month) . 
This sweepstakes  will occur every October beginning in 2018 and ending in 2021.  Winners will be 
selected using a computer random number generators and receive a $[ADDRESS_1007741] of housing in Miami is 7.7% 
greater than the national average, where comparatively the cost of living in [LOCATION_001] city is 286.7% 
the national average.[ADDRESS_1007742] of living through the possibility to earn additional compensation through the 
sweepstakes.  
 
Participants will also receive welcome bags with upon randomization  into the study. The value of 
the welcome bags will be approximately  $5.00 -$10.[ADDRESS_1007743], stickers, a pen, and a stress ball .  
 
3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations):  Clearl y describe the participant’s costs 
associated with participation in the research, if any, and the interventions or procedures of the 
study that will be provided at no cost to participants. If participants screen inconclusive or receive 
an HIV+ result durin g the rapid HIV testing, the testing site provides the confirmatory testing at 
no cost to the study and bills the participant directly if either the testing site or participant 
insurance is unable to cover the costs. Either way, it will be at no cost to th e participant. 
Participants are welcome to use their private insurance for any confirmatory testing.     
   
Study participation will generate no cost for participants.  All study treatment (ESTEEM, CMHT, 
VCT) will be provided free of charge to all study participants.

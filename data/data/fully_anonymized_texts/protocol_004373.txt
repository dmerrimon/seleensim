Prediction of Findings from the Ongoing COBRRA-AF Trial Using Healthcare Database Analyses DUPLICATE – COBRRA AF March 7th, 2022  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 1. RCT Details This section provides a high-level overview of an ongoing RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely as possible given the limitations inherent in the healthcare databases. 1.1 Title Comparison of Bleeding Risk Between Rivaroxaban and Api[INVESTIGATOR_659619] (COBRRA - AF) 1.2 Intended aim(s) To compare the incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation diagnosed by [CONTACT_728432]. 1.[ADDRESS_994916] confirmed, adjudicated occurrence of a major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event up to 365 days after initiating anticoagulation treatment. 1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) The hazard ratio for the clinical trial is unknown because the trial is ongoing. Based upon Proietti et al., a systematic review of observational studies of api[INVESTIGATOR_728411], we calculated power based on an array of potential effect sizes. 1,2 1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding Secondary cardiovascular objectives: • To assess the frequency of major bleeding events and non-major clinically relevant bleeding events as separate outcomes Stroke All-cause mortality • • 1.6 Trial estimate The trial is ongoing and scheduled to complete in December of 2025. 1

We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B). 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up: 6.3.[ADDRESS_994920] (definitions provided in Appendix): ■ Primary outcome: Major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 365 days of treatment with api[INVESTIGATOR_470953]. Secondary outcomes: o To assess the frequency of major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding individually o To assess the frequency of intracranial and extracranial bleeding events o Stroke o All-cause mortality ■ 6.3.2 Study follow-up 7  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on day of cohort entry. The as-treated will be the primary analysis. An allowable gap of 10 days between records indicating each treatment will qualify as “continuous therapy” with respect to follow-up in the as-treated analysis. The follow-up will start the day after drug initiation (i.e., cohort entry date), and will continue until the earliest date of the following events: • • • • • • • • The first occurrence of the outcome of interest The date of end of continuous registration in the database End of the study period at 365 days Measured death event occurs Switch Discontinuation (10-day allowable grace period and risk window) Nursing home admission Initiation of another anticoagulant (dabigatran, heparin, warfarin, etc.) In the secondary ITT analysis, we will not censor for discontinuation, switching among study drugs, or addition of other anticoagulants 7.

Study Confidence and Concerns Deadline for voting on study confidence and listing concerns: Date votes and concerns are summarized: • • If final feasibility and power analyses are reviewed and approved, proceed to the remaining protocol steps. All study team and advisory board members that review this protocol should at this stage provide their level of confidence for the success of the RWD study in the Google Form. This form also provides space for reviewers to list any concerns that they feel may contribute to a failure to replicate the findings of the RCT, including differences in study populations, poor measurement of study variables, or residual confounding. All responses will be kept confidential and individual-level results will only be shared with the individual respondent. After the deadline for voting has passed, provide the distribution of responses and summarize all concerns here. • 12.

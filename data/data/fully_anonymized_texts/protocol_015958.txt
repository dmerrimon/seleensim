Synopsis
Primary Objective
To compare the analgesic efficacy of IV acetaminophen as an analgesic adjunctive medication to IV 
hydromorphone for the treatment of acute pain in the ED.
 
Secondary Objectives (if applicable)
To compare the side effect profiles and adverse events associated with the combination of 
acetaminophen and hydromorphone vs. hydromorphone alone.
 
Primary Outcome Variables
The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in NRS pain scores from baseline 
(immediately before administration of analgesics) to [ADDRESS_814506]-baseline.
 
Secondary Outcome Variables (if applicable)
Secondary efficacy outcomes: difference in proportion of patients who choose to forego additional 
pain medication [ADDRESS_814507]-baseline when asked the question, "Do you want more pain 
medication?”; difference in proportion of patients who receive additional pain medication before [ADDRESS_814508]-baseline ("rescue" medication) and after 60 minutes.  The incidence of adverse events 
and side effects in the two groups will be compared.

1 - Introduction
1.1 Introductory Statement
An estimated 44 million visits per year to US emergency departments (EDs) are associated 
with a painful condition.(1-2) Inadequate treatment of pain, has been demonstrated in many 
emergency departments.(3-6) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_514209], Todd's multicenter and multi-country study 
showed that only 50% of ED patients had at least a 2-point reduction of pain on a numeric rating 
scale (NRS) and 75% were discharged with moderate to severe pain.(7)  
Intravenous acetaminophen is one drug that has been suggested to provide analgesic relief 
as good as or better than intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_614240] (e.g. renal colic, 
post-operative pain).(8-10)  However, studies evaluating its use have been limited by [CONTACT_614264] a range of methodologic limitations.(11)  
Combination oral acetaminophen and oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_614241].  The 
rationale for combining different classes of analgesics is that the modes of action are different and 
may be at least additive if not synergistic.  While this same rationale holds for combining 
intravenously administered acetaminophen and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], there have been no studies that examined 
the efficacy of this combination.  Use of combination IV analgesics may provide enhanced analgesia 
and reduce the need for additional administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. 
2 - Background
2.1 Background/prevalence of research topic
IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_614242]. Recently 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_614243].  The intravenous (IV) form of acetaminophen has been widely used in Europe for more 
than 20 years. The IV form obtained full FDA approval in the [LOCATION_003] in 2010.  A recent literature 
review revealed a total of 14 randomized controlled trials involving IV acetaminophen in the ED 
setting (11). Three of these (12-14), found a larger reduction in pain in the IV acetaminophen arm

3 - Rationale/Significance
3.1 Problem Statement
Pain is a serious problem for many ED patients. Improving treatment is complicated by [CONTACT_614265][INVESTIGATOR_614244], which has resulted 
in initiatives designed to reduce the administration and prescribing of oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and to 
substitute non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen) to the 
extent that such strategies are consistent with provision of satisfactory analgesia. Determining the 
optimal approach to acute pain management in the ED represents an important area of 
investigation.
 
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact
The purpose of the current study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of [ADDRESS_814510] to hydromorphone, care of ED patients in pain may be improved. 
 
3.3 Potential Risks and Benefits
3.3.1 Potential Benefits
Determining whether IV acetaminophen is an efficacious adjunctive analgesic to IV 
hydromorphone will help the clinician choose effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614245]. Society will benefit from a greater understanding of the relative merits of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]-
opi[INVESTIGATOR_614246].
 
3.3.2 Potential Risks
It is likely that some subjects will experience adverse medication effects.  
All opi[INVESTIGATOR_614247], which include but 
are not limited to the following:
oCommon - not serious: nausea; vomiting; itching, drowsiness; flushing, dizziness, 
feeling light headed, drowsiness, constipation
oUncommon - serious: low blood pressure, low heart rate, slowed breathing, and 
decreased oxygen carried by [CONTACT_614266]. This medicine can stop your breathing 
which can be fatal if not treated promptly. 
IV acetaminophen:
oCommon side effects: nausea, vomiting and headache. 
oUncommon – not serious: itching, rash, constipation, stomach pain, pain at site of IV 
needle
oUncommon serious: none reported for short-term use
4 - Study Objectives
4.1 Hypothesis
IV hydromorphone in combination with IV acetaminophen will provide more efficacious pain relief 
compared to IV hydromorphone in combination with IV placebo (normal saline). The primary

9/5/[ADDRESS_814511] administration of study medications. 
 
4.2 Primary Objective
To compare the analgesic efficacy of adding IV acetaminophen to IV hydromorphone for the 
treatment of acute pain in non-elderly ED patients.
 
4.3 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)
To compare the side effect profiles and adverse events associated with the combination of IV 
acetaminophen and IV hydromorphone and IV hydromorphone alone.
 
5 - Study Design
5.1 General Design
This is a double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety 
of 1000 mg IV acetaminophen combined with 1 mg IV hydromorphone vs. 1 mg IV hydromorphone 
plus placebo for the treatment of acute severe pain (defined as < 7 days duration) in adult patients 
(age 21 through 64) presenting to the ED.
 
5.1.1 Study Duration (if applicable)
We anticipate achieving our target enrollment in approximately 5 months.
 
5.1.2 Number of Study Sites
This study will be conducted in the Emergency Departments on the Moses and Einstein campuses of 
Montefiore Medical Center. 
 
5.2 Outcome Variables
5.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables
The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in numerical rating scale (NRS) 
pain scores from baseline to [ADDRESS_814512] administration of study medications. The NRS is a 
previously validated and reproducible measure of pain intensity ranging from 0 = no pain, to 10 = 
worst possible pain. 
 
5.2.2 Secondary Outcome Variables (if applicable)
Difference in proportion of patients who choose to forego additional pain medication at [ADDRESS_814513]-baseline when asked the question, "Do you want more pain medication?"
Difference in proportion of patients who receive additional pain medication before [ADDRESS_814514]-baseline ("rescue" medication) and between [ADDRESS_814515] baseline.  Difference in 
incidence of adverse events and side effects. 
5.3 Study Population
Adult (ages 21 through 64 years of age) patients presenting to the ED with severe acute pain.
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_814516] size used in acute pain studies 
to indicate a minimally clinically significant difference(20-23), a within group standard deviation of 
2.8 NRS units, significance level of 0.05, and 80% power. In order to ensure enrollment of a 
minimum of 148 patients with analyzable data, an additional 14 patients (~10%) will be enrolled.  
Thus the targeted sample size is 162 patients.  
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8886
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/06/2018
9/5/2018 5We used nQuery Advisor version 7.0 (Los Angeles, CA) to calculate the sample size.

9/5/2018 7The Research Associate will remain at the patient's bedside for the first 5 minutes following 
the infusion of the medications.
At 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes after the end of the infusion of the study 
medication, the RA will measure vital signs (including SaO2 by [CONTACT_7852]), and record  
adverse events if they occurred.
No further monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_614270] 120 minutes.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  
The RAs will ask patients questions about side effects of the medications that include incidence of 
nausea, vomiting, and pruritis.  These are expected, usually minor adverse effects of the study 
medications.  The RAs will monitor adverse events that include alterations in vital signs: oxygen 
desaturation below 95%, hypoventilation –respi[INVESTIGATOR_614254] 10, hypotension – 
systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, and bradycardia – heart rate below 50 beats per minute. 
Thresholds for the vital signs and protocolized response to values below the thresholds are 
described below.
• Vital signs (SaO2 obtained via pulse oximetry), pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure) will be 
monitored at baseline, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and [ADDRESS_814521] 5 minutes after the infusion is completed in order to monitor 
for any adverse effects such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (RR<10) or oxygen desaturation (<95%).
• If the SO2 drops below 95% or the RR < 10 breaths per minute, a composite set of maneuvers will be 
performed:
The pulse oximeter will be confirmed to be properly placed on the patient's finger and be 
reading the patient's pulse, as determined by [CONTACT_614271].
The patient, if sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will be gently shaken and verbally asked to take a few deep breaths.
The head of the gurney, if in the reclined position, will be raised.
• If any patient in either arm does not achieve an oxygen saturation of 95% or above despi[INVESTIGATOR_614255], or if the oxygen saturation drops below 95% a second time, the patient will be placed 
on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen and the ED attending will be notified immediately to determine 
what additional maneuvers are needed, including consideration of administration of 0.4 mg IV 
naloxone in repeated doses as necessary.
• If the HR is below 50 beats per minute the patient will be reassessed and the ED attending will 
determine what additional maneuvers are needed, including consideration of administration of 0.4 
mg IV naloxone in repeated doses as necessary.
• If systolic BP is below 90 mmHg the patient will be reassessed, and a normal saline bolus will be 
administered if clinically indicated. The ED attending will then determine what additional 
maneuvers are needed, including consideration of administration of 0.4 mg IV naloxone in repeated 
doses as necessary.
All vital signs that fall below the thresholds described above will be reported to the Data Safety 
Monitoring (DSM) committee and included in the yearly progress report to the IRB.  The DSM 
committee will be headed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Esses, MD, the director of the Moses ED and include [CONTACT_614278], Director of Research Albany Medical Center. The committee will meet quarterly 
with the PI [CONTACT_1639] 1) monitor adverse events and develop strategies to minimize these; and 2) monitor 
recruitment and enrollment.

6.3 Study Procedures
• The RAs and attending physicians will identify eligible patients.  The attending physician will 
assess the patient’s capacity to consent.
• The RA and provider will describe the study to eligible patients and obtain patient consent.  Both 
will document their participation with a note in Epic and by [CONTACT_73768]. 
     This study in particular and research procedures in general are introduced during faculty 
meetings and reinforced with emails and Powerpoint presentations. The providers will be told 
that they will need to discuss the study with the patient, answer their questions, and sign 
consent document. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_614256]-on-one sessions to describe the 
procedures. 
• The RA will obtain a baseline pain score and baseline vital sign information.
• The healthcare provider will place an order in Epic for the study medication. The order will 
trigger a specific pocket in Pyxis to open. The research associate and the clinical nurse will then 
complete the RA/RN checklist (Appendix) to ensure verification, retrieval and administration of 
study medications. The RA will have the nurse remove the next study packet from the PYXIS, 
which will be a [ADDRESS_814522].
• All patients will receive 1 mg IV hydromorphone.
• After receiving hydromorphone, patients will receive the blinded study medication, which will 
either be 1000 mg IV acetaminophen in 100 ml or 100 ml normal saline placebo. This will be 
administered over 5-10 minutes.
• The RA will remain at the patient's bedside for the first 5 minutes following the infusion of the 
medications.
• At 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes following the completed infusion, the RA will 
obtain an NRS pain score, vital signs (including SaO2 by [CONTACT_7852]), and record incidence of  
side effects and adverse events.
• At 60 minutes following infusion, the RA will also ask all patients if they want additional pain 
medication. The RA will inform the treating attending physician if the patient wants additional 
analgesia. 
•  The treating physician will be notified if the patient wants more analgesics. The patient and the 
treating physician will be told that the study has finished 120 minutes after end of infusion of 
study medication. No further monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_614270] 120 minutes.
• The final diagnosis will be obtained from the chart and the treating attending physician at the 
time the patient leaves the ED.
• The RA will record all medications administered in the ED and the time of their administration 
from the chart and the treating attending physician.
  
6.3.1 Study Schedule

6.3.2 Informed Consent
All patients will be required to provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.
 
6.3.3 Screening
Screening, enrollment and data collection will be performed by [CONTACT_23872], full-time, bilingual 
Research Associates (RAs) who staff the ED [ADDRESS_814523] 
completed the University of Miami's Collaborative IRB Training Initiative Program for protection of 
human subjects in the social and behavioral track. We have had RAs collecting data in the 
emergency department for the past [ADDRESS_814524] it strictly according to protocol. Their training is 
described in detail in the Appendix.
The RAs will identify patients who are potentially eligible for the study in several ways. They will 
review the presenting complaint or triage description and consider all patients with complaint or 
mention of pain as potential participants. They will ask residents, nurses, physician assistants and 
attending physicians to refer potentially eligible patients for formal assessment of eligibility. The 
attending physician will be asked if they think a patient's pain warrants use of parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_614257].
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_814525] participation will conclude two hours after administration of study medication.  No further 
follow-up is planned.
 
6.3.7 Removal of subjects
Subjects may withdraw from study participation at any time.  Those who withdraw will receive 
"usual care" by [CONTACT_68071].
 
6.4 Statistical Method
6.4.1 Statistical Design
The statistical design is parallel group design with patients randomly allocated to the two 
treatments. 
 
6.4.2 Sample Size Considerations  
A sample size of 148 (74 per group) was calculated based on the following parameters:  alpha = 
0.05, power = 0.8, between group delta 1.3 NRS units (commonly used in research as the minimum 
clinically significance difference or MCSD), and standard deviation of 2.8 NRS units (based on prior 
studies we have performed). We will enroll an additional 14 subjects (approximately 10%) in order 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8886
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/06/2018
9/5/2018 10to account for potential protocol violations and missing data. Thus, our final sample size is 162 
subjects.
We used nQuery Advisor version 7.0 (Los Angeles, CA) to calculate the sample size.
 
6.4.3 Planned Analyses 
The planned analyses include: a comparison of the characteristics of the two treatment groups at 
baseline, the comparison of change in pain between baseline and [ADDRESS_814526]-baseline, 
comparison of proportion of patients who want additional analgesia at 60 minutes, comparison of 
the incidence of rescue medication, adverse events and side effects in the 120 minute period.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analyses
We will calculate the difference in NRS scores between baseline, immediately after the end of the 
infusion of the study medications (baseline) and [ADDRESS_814527] found this difference to be 
associated with the perception of change in pain, measured by [CONTACT_614272] “a little less” or “a little more pain.” (22)
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Objectives Analyses
We will calculate the difference in the proportion of patients in each group who choose to forego 
additional pain medication at [ADDRESS_814528]-baseline based upon a simple dichotomous yes/no 
response to the patient-centered question, "Do you want more pain medication?" A chi-square test 
will be used to compare the proportions.  We will also use chi-square tests to examine the 
proportion  of rescue medication in the two groups. If there are marked differences between the 
distribution of background characteristics a multi-variable logistic regression will be performed to 
control for possible confounding.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety
Prior experience suggests that we will have insufficient power to detect differences in the incidence 
of adverse events unless the incidence is higher and the differences between groups are much 
larger than what we have observed in the past.  Therefore we will report observed differences. Chi-
square tests to assess whether the proportion of patients with one or more side effect differs 
between treatment groups. The individual side effects will be described in tables. If there are 
marked differences between the distributions of background characteristics a multi-variable 
logistic regression will be performed to control for possible confounding.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Subject Characteristics
• Background characteristics: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, initial pain intensity, nausea and vomiting 
before administration of analgesics.  Means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile 
ranges, and proportions will be used to describe the sample as appropriate.
• Cause, location of pain, and diagnosis: The etiology of pain will be described as trauma-related or 
not trauma-related. The location of pain will be described as: abdomen/pelvis, extremities, back, 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8886
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/06/2018
9/5/[ADDRESS_814529], multiple locations, and other. The diagnosis will also be recorded.  Frequencies will 
be presented.
• Anthropometrical measures: Patients will be asked to report their height and weight.  Mean 
height and weight with standard deviations will be presented.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analysis (if applicable)
[CONTACT_614279] will perform an interim analysis after half the sample is enrolled to consider 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_614258], or if the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication is substantially different between 
arms. We will use the Peto-Haybittle rule of requiring a p value of 0.001 or lower to indicate a 
difference between groups that would contribute to the decision to halt the trial.(24) (25)   We 
calculated the size of the effect that would lead to rejection of the null hypothesis at this level of 
significance to assess whether it was clinically reasonable. A value that is thought of as a clinically 
important difference in pain between two treatment groups is 30 mm on a 100mm VAS for pain 
(equivalent to a 3 unit decrease on an NRS).(26)  Thus, for example, a test of the difference between 
a 4.[ADDRESS_814530] the originally planned sample size. 
One could assume that both regimens are providing adequate analgesia based on numerous studies 
of this dose of IV hydromorphone.
All adverse events will be reported promptly to the DSMB as they occur and the decision to stop the 
trial based on the incidence and severity of the adverse events will be used to determine if the trial 
should be stopped early rather than on statistical grounds.

Research Associate Training
All data are collected by a team of research associates (RA). Research associates are required to 
have basic medical certifications, including the skills to assess vital signs and how to interact with 
people as patients. We also require them to be bilingual English and Spanish speakers because we 
believe it is essential that our research subjects represent our patient population. Prior to being 
hired, every research associate must prove their ability to speak Spanish fluently by [CONTACT_7661] a 
conversation in Spanish with a departmental administrator, during which time we assess their 
ability to communicate with our patient population. After hiring, each research associate 
completes the required CITI coursework and then meets with each investigator one-on-one to 
discuss general themes of clinical research including research ethics, techniques of data collection, 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_614261] (incomplete data, missing data, and inaccurate data, such as race, which 
is particularly tricky in our patient population). Each new research associate then undergoes a 
two-month internship, during which time they shadow an experienced research associate, and 
learn the ins-and-outs of the job. Over these two months, the new research associate gradually 
takes on more and more responsibility under the tutelage of the seasoned research associate. At 
the end of the two-month period, each research associate has another in-person session with the 
investigators, during which time any questions are addressed.
Study specific training begins prior to IRB submission. The investigators discuss the study 
protocol and with the research associates, who are asked to provide their input. The research 
associates often comment on logistical issues of study flow. The research associates also provide 
feedback on the REDCap data collection instruments. Here too, they provide invaluable feedback 
on how to streamline these forms. Prior to initiation of the study, the investigator explains the 
study protocol and procedures to the RAs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_342560] a Powerpoint presentation in groups of 
1-[ADDRESS_814536] brought up. The investigators provide the research 
associates with feedback on data entry—such as when free texting was used rather than 
checkboxes, or when two different symptoms were lumped into one response category. The 
investigators remain in close contact [CONTACT_614275]—each investigator 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_614262] a half dozen calls per week when questions of eligibility arise.
The research associates are trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_614263] ([CONTACT_614280]) in any changes 
that are made in procedures.

2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
2.1 Indication to be Studied  
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intratracheal (IT) dose  of 
rhCC10 to intubated premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS)  to prevent long term respi[INVESTIGATOR_896037] (CRM ; asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] ).  
Traditionally, short term predictors of CRM have involved the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysp lasia 
(BPD). However, t he clinical definition of BPD has changed several times over the past decade.  The 
current consensus method for determining BPD is assessing oxygen requirements at 36 weeks 
corrected gestational age (CGA) using a target oxygen saturation range of 88 -94% or through oxygen

Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  5 challenge testing . However a cohort of premature infants followed to 18 -22 months CGA demonstrated 
that this definition correctly pr edicted CRM only 35 -40% of the time, although accuracy increased as 
the severity of BPD worsene d. A major problem for investigators studying BPD is that premature infants 
who do not develop BPD can also suffer CRM and have lung function abnormalities at fo llow-up. In 
view of these significant methodologic difficulties, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the NIH and 
FDA have recommended that clinical trials should evaluate CRM in the first 1 -2 years of life as a 
potentially more meaningful outcome.  
Extremel y low gestational age i nfants (ELGANs) with RDS are at particular risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_896038], a condition associated with marked inflammation , injury  to small airways , and arrest of 
alveolarization  that is believed to result in CRM .  BPD is associated with significant morbidity (asthma, 
repeated pulmonary infections, re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) and mortality, and affects up to 15,000 infants in the 
US annually. The lungs of p remature infants are deficient in factors that regulate inflammatory  
responses  (including CC10). This is critically important since intrauterine infection and inflammation are 
believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of preterm delivery as well as acute and chronic lung injury.  
These factors  are normally present in the  term lung in preparation for the transition to the extrauterine 
environment . RDS and the associated immature lung structure require rescue  with exogenous 
surfactant  and support with supplemental oxygen and positive pressure mechan ical ventilation, which 
amplifie s lung inflammation , injury , fibrosis , and impaired lung development .   
2.2 Study Drug  
 The study drug , rhCC10 , is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein.  Native CC10 
is produced primarily by [CONTACT_105] -ciliated respi[INVESTIGATOR_790793], called Club ( Clara ) cells and is the most 
abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs.  CC10  circulates in the blood and is 
excreted in the urine. The recomb inant version is nearly identical to the native protein and shares all 
biological properties with the native protein that have been characterized thus far.  rhCC10  is produced 
in E. coli  bacteria.  
The rhCC10  drug formulation to be used in this study  is a clear, colorless liquid formulated in 
unbuffered normal saline (0.9%) at a concentration of 5.5 mg/ml.  It is aliquoted into sterile septum -
capped, [ADDRESS_1256179] 18 months. This formulation has been administered 
by [CONTACT_896084].  
Drug administration : In the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_896039], a single dose  (1.5 and 5 
mg/kg/dose)  of rhCC10 was administered by [CONTACT_896085] 24 hours of birth in intubated 
premature infants treated for surfactant deficiency . In the present study, administration of rhCC10 will

CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_1256180] clinical trial , however, in the present study the administration  of study 
medication to each lung will be specifically instilled  over not less than a 30 second period (duration of 
instillation not specified in first trial).  In addition, just prior to instillation, adjust ventilator settings as 
follows:   
 Increase PIP by 1 -2 cm H 2O 
 Increase the rate to 35 (if not already there)  
 Increase FiO 2 by 5-10% 
 
Dose selection : The  IT dose  will replicate the single IT doses of 1.5 mg/kg a nd 5.0 mg/kg from the 
previous clinical study. Doses will be calculated based on the patient’s birth weight. )

60% of extremely low birth weight preterm infants. It is associated with significant mortality and short - 
and long -term morbidity . Long-term morbidities include CRM such as asthma  and repeated respi[INVESTIGATOR_896040] . Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes , retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and other 
significant morbidities of prematurity occur at increased frequency in infants with BPD. While 
exogenous surfactant therapy has reduced the overall severity of BPD, the prevalence of BPD has 
increased with improved survival of these infants. New treatments to prevent BPD and subsequent  
CRM  are urgently needed.  
There is ample  rationale for s tudying CC10 supplementation  in these patients . The phenotypes 
of two different strains of CC10 knockout mice indicate that CC10 is an autocrine factor required for the 
normal development of non -ciliated airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], including Club ( Clara ) cells. CC10  regulates 
inflammatory responses  and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary tissue while  preserv ing 
pulmonary mechanical function d uring various insults ( e.g. viral infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone , 
allergens,  hyperoxia ). Together these properties suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to 
facilitate development of normal airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_896041].    
2.4 Non-Clinical Studies: Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies  
Native CC10 is produced primarily by [CONTACT_105] -ciliated respi[INVESTIGATOR_896042], constituting up to 7% of the total extracellular protein. Native 
CC10 is synthesized by a number of tissues including the lu ngs, pancreas, uterine endometrium, 
prostate, and seminal vesicles. The normal physiological tissue distribution for CC 10 includes all 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  7 mucosal tissues  except the eye s and central nervous system . The concentration of endogenous CC10 
in the blood ranges from  10-120 ng/ml in normal, healthy adults and up to 5 g/ml in patients with renal 
dysfunction. From the blood, CC10 enters numerous tissues and organs and is also excreted in the 
urine. Several studies have found significantly lower endogenous CC10 protein concentration and 
expression  in the lungs of preterm infants who died or developed severe BPD , suggesting an integral 
role of this protein in normal lung homeostasis .  
The CC10 protein has potent anti -inflammatory and anti -fibrotic properties as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_896086].  Although there is no consensus as to the central mechanism of 
action, CC10 may mediate many of its short term anti -inflamm atory effects through its role in vesicle 
and protein trafficking in Club ( Clara ) cells. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_896043]10 knockout mice 
demonstrate a lack of secretory vesicles and the presence of unusual intracellular structures 
characterized by [CONTACT_7163] -layer stacked membranes  and disproportionate amounts of Golgi, rough 
endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomal compartments  compared to respi[INVESTIGATOR_896044] -
knockout mice . In the longer term, CC10 may mediate effects through development and /or 
maintenance of airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l cells , including Club ( Clara ) cells (autocrine function) , which secrete 
the majority of native CC10 in the lungs and circulation.  
rhCC10 follows the natural physiological distribution path for the native protein from  lung to 
blood and blood to urine. The circulating half -life of rhCC10 is 2 -2.5 hours, which is prolonged to 9 -11 
hours by [CONTACT_896087] a mucosal surface ( intratracheal instillation ). The 
circulating half -life decreases slightly with incr easing dose, sugges ting active clearance of the protein. 
Although all tissues and or gans are exposed to  CC10, tissues that primarily take up excess rhCC10 
include the lungs (airways and alveoli) , esophagus, and thyroid.  Not only is excess circulating rhCC10 
taken up specifically by [CONTACT_55964], but also small amounts of protein actually reach the extracellular 
mucosal fluid where it is detected in tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480382] ( TAF) and bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid 
(BAL).  
Several t oxicology studies have be en conducted with no evidence of acute or chronic toxicity or 
any significant tissue pathology, including IT administration in newborn pi[INVESTIGATOR_1515] (n=86), premature lambs 
(n=22), premature baboons (n= 4), and juvenile rabbits (n= 18).  No evidence of acute or chronic toxicity 
was observed in adult cynomolgus monkeys that received seven daily intranasal doses of rhCC10. No 
evidence of acute or chronic toxicity was observed in juvenile rats that received 14 daily IV doses of 
rhCC10 .  Several models of acute lung injury and infection  (RSV, influenza)  have demonstrated the 
protective effects of rhCC10  (by [CONTACT_896088] ) without evidence of toxicity.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 2.5 Previous Human Experience  
2.5.1  Previous Clinical Trials  
 Two Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1256182]  trial was performed in premature infants with RDS, in which a single dose of rhCC10 
was administered by [CONTACT_896089].  Two dose levels of rhCC10 (1.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) were evaluated 
in a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation design , conducted at 3  clinical 
centers  in the US .  A total of 22 infants were enrolled in three groups including placebo  (n = 7), low 
dose (n = 8), and high dose (n = 7).  Two infants in the study died. The first had received 1.5 mg/kg of 
rhCC10 and died of complications of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ).  The second had received 5 mg/kg 
of rhCC10 and died of complications  from respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  Neither death was deemed to be 
attributable to the study drug.  Significant reductions in total protein content, neutrophil counts, and total 
cell counts were observed in TAF in rhCC10 -treated infants compared to placebo  control s (unusual in 
this small a study population) . At the six month CGA  follow up, data were collected for a total of 17 
patients on measures of CRM  (one infant from each experimental group was lost to follow up) .  
Interestingly, none of the CC10 -infants (0/11) had been re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896045] , while 50% (3/6) of the placebo infants had been re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896046].  
The prevention of acute inflammation and preservation of norma l airway and alveolar development may 
contribute to this long term benefit . No anti -rhCC10 antibodies were detected in sera collected from all 
infants at 28 days of life.  
   The second trial was performed in healthy adults wit h seasonal allergies  in which rhCC10 was 
administered by [CONTACT_896090] (1.1 mg per day for seven consecutive days).  The study was a 
placebo -controlled, double -blinded, cross -over design at a single center in Sweden.  Patients were 
previously characterized with allergies to tree pollen but were otherwise healthy. Each subject was 
given a  daily intranasal instillation of rhCC10 immediately prior to receiving an intranasal instillation of 
allergen. This nasal allergen challenge (NAC) causes a mild inflammatory response in the n asal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603]. Total nasal symptoms scores  (TNSS)  were documented within [ADDRESS_1256183] TNSS in this model , but also  raised no safety 
or tolerability concerns. No blood was taken in this study  and it is not clear whether intranasal dos ing 
resulted in systemic exposure .

CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_1256184] been performed  to document CC10 TAF levels in term infants with normal lungs. One 
study documented  that CC10 mRNA is detectable in human fetal lungs as early as week 16, with the 
protein becom ing detectable in amniotic fluid around week 22 , and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_896047] 28 
then plateau ing at week 32 (~ 1 g/ml; a pattern similar to  surfactant proteins ). Another study showed 
that CC10 levels are lowest in preterm infants who die or develop BPD compared to those who do not, 
and that a greater proportion of the native C C10 in patients who die or dev elop BPD is oxidized .  It is 
notable that CC10  is also produced by [CONTACT_896091] s of pregnancy, such that the fetus is exposed to CC10 throughout pregnancy and 
before the fetal lungs start producing it.  
2.[ADDRESS_1256185] immunogenicity to be a problem.  Peak concentrations of rhC C10 in lung fluid and 
blood of infants  to be treated may exceed normal adult levels, but should be well within the ranges 
explored in non -clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies. rhCC10 has been tested in non -clinical 
toxicology studies at doses up to  25 mg/kg (IT) and 2 mg/kg (IV).   
CC10 is transcriptionally upregulated in the lungs by [CONTACT_13216] . Therefore, patterns of toxicity  
secondary to excessive CC10  that could occur secondary to treatment with corticosteroids were 
specifically examined  in the first study in preterm infants and in all animal pharm/tox studies. Although 
no such toxicities  have been detected , these effects will continue to b e monitored closely  in the present 
studies . 
The pharmacokinetic analysis of CC10 in TAF fluids in th e first trial demonstrated  a trend  that 
native CC10 expression was h igher in day 3  TAF of placebo infants than in CC10 -treated infants.  
Although t he number of day 3  TAF samples was extremely limited (n= 2-3/group  due to many infants

CONFIDENTIAL  10 being extubated ), there is a possibility that administration of exogenous rhCC10 may transiently 
suppress expression of the native protein in the lungs. This will be closely monitored during the present 
trial. 
There was a higher incidence of confirmed (n= 3) and suspected  (e.g. radiologic; n=5) NEC  in 
rhCC10 -treated infants compared to the placebo group  (P=NS) . This was not thought to be due to 
administration of study drug, since the NEC occurred 3-6 weeks after rhCC10 administration and 
because other infants in the NICU  who were  not enrolled in the study also developed NEC at the same 
time.  (NEC is known to occur in clusters). H owever, the incidence and severity of NEC , as well as 
other infectious related AEs (e.g. sepsis, pneumonia, etc.)  will be closely monitored during this study .  
[ADDRESS_1256186] UDY  
 The purpose of the placebo -controlled study is to deter mine the efficacy  of a single  IT dose  of 
rhCC10 (1.5 and  5 mg/kg  in a 2 ml/kg  fixed volume ) in improving survival without CRM as indicated by 
a reduction in  respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800]  12 months CGA  (using validated respi[INVESTIGATOR_896048], see Appendices D, E, and F). Based on these data, f uture studies will be 
designed to determine whether administration of rhCC10 to neonates with RDS is effective in improving 
survival without  CRM . 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 This study is designed as a randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled phase 2 trial. The study will 
enroll premature i nfants with a gestational age of 24 -29 weeks who are receiving positive pressure 
mechanical ventilation and surfactant replacement therapy for treatment of RDS . Placebo ( normal 
saline ) will be compared to two dose  groups of rhCC10 as shown in Table 1 :

Patients enrolled in the study will meet the prescribing criteria for Survanta  or Curosurf  and will 
receive the usual recommended clinical dose of surfactant replacement therapy.  Each patient will then 
receive a single IT dose of the study drug (or placebo) within  four hours after surfactant. Patients may 
be given subsequent doses of surfactant if r equired, but will not receive  additional dose s of rhCC10.  
Concentrations of rh CC10 will be evaluated in serum  derived from the infant, umbilical cord , or 
placental blood before drug administration and in serum  or plasma  and urine on day s 1 and 28, and 12 
months CGA . TAF will be  obtained  on similar days  if the infant is  still intubated  to evaluate the effects of 
a single IT  dose  of rhCC10 on native CC10 expression in the lungs . Total protein, TH2 cytokines, IL -6, 
and cellular infiltrates will also be evaluated in TAF samples, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_896092] .

was enrolled) .  The randomization scheme uses the permuted block randomization method, with 
stratification by [CONTACT_896095] (divided into 24 -27 wks CGA and 27 -29 wks CGA), 
with block sizes  2,2,4.  For Cohort 1, treatment groups are:  Placebo and 1.5  mg/kg.  When Cohort 1 is 
completed, Cohort 2 treatment groups will be:  Placebo and 5.0 mg/kg.  Cohort is also listed as a 
Stratification factor so that when Cohort [ADDRESS_1256190] cohort will not be filled.  
The Cohort is automat ically set to 1 at the start of the study.  Once Cohort 1 is done and Cohort 2 
starts, that will change.  Each site’s pharmacy will receive authorization to access the patient 
randomization assignment via the Internet on StudyTrax.  
The randomization assign ment must not be disclosed to anyone outside the pharmacy.  
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and are successfully enrolled will be assigned a patient 
Randomized ID number.  Due to the time critical nature of managing the respi[INVESTIGATOR_896049], it is permissible for the patient to be randomized before 
receiving the first dose of surfactant. The patient Randomization ID number  and the birth weight of the 
patient will then be communicated to the pharmacy  on a paper form requesting  study medication . The 
pharmacist will then access the StudyTrax randomization assignment on the Internet. The patient will 
be assigned to one of the three groups (placebo, low dose or high dose) as appropriate to the cohort, 
and an  opaque syringe containing an appropriate dose of the study drug or placebo will be sent to 
study personnel in a sealed envelope. In order to administer the study drug within 4 hours of surfactant 
administration, the patient’s birth weight should be commun icated to the pharmacy as soon as it is 
available. The syringe received from the pharmacy will be identified only with the patient Randomization  
ID number  and will contain 1.5 – 3.[ADDRESS_1256191] among the treatment groups in birth weight and/or gestational age.

administration) will include at least the following components:  
 Physical examination, including determination of body weight;  
 APGAR score;  
 SNAPPE II score  (performed within first 12 hours of life);  
 Chest radiograph , if available ; 
 Blood sample (for electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, CBC with differential and 
platelets, CC10 concentration);  and 
 TAF sample  taken prior to surfactant administration  (if possible ) for cell counts and 
concentration s of CC10, total protein, sIgA, and cytokines.  
 Urine  sample , if available  
 Stool  sample , if available  
All blood samples for CC10 concentration determinations will be limited to ~ [ADDRESS_1256192] ments  to the ventilator settings should be done : increase the PIP by 1 -2 cm H 2O, 
increase the rate to 35 breaths/min (if not already there) and increase FiO 2 by 5-10%. The study drug 
should be administered  IT in two aliquots. Initially, half the dose will be instilled into one lung (via a pre -
measured feeding tube placed into the distal third of the endotracheal tube with the patient in a lateral 
decubitus position and 30o of Trendelenburg), then the second al iquot will be given into the other lung 
in a similar fashion.   The administration of the study medication to each lung will be specifically instilled 
over not less than a [ADDRESS_1256193]-dosing period ( 28 days) , serum, urine, stool, and TAF sa mples 
will be taken on days 1  (baseline)  and 28.  If possible, samples will also be collected on days 7, 14, and

follow -up visits, including bringing the infant to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896055] 6, 12, and 18 months CGA along 
with the return of 28 -day diaries due at each visit.  
6.7 Procedure for Collection of Samples  
All samples will be labeled only with the type of sample (e.g. serum, TAF, urine, stool), the 
patient Randomization ID number, and the time and date of collection.   
Blood Samples for Electrolytes, CBC and Liver and Renal Function .  These samples should be 
collected according to standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896056].  Initial blood 
will be obtained from the umbilical cord or placenta, if available.   Infant serum or plasma  will also be 
obtained from scave nged samples, if available.  
Blood  Samples for Anti -CC10 Antibody and CC10 Assay . A single blood sample is required for 
both tests. Approximately 200 L of whole blood will be placed into a serum microtainer, allowed to clot 
for about ten minutes at room te mperature, and then spun in a clinical centrifuge.  The serum will be 
transferred to a sterile microtube and stored at –20oC for analysis by [CONTACT_456]. Initial blood will be 
obtained from the placenta  or cord , if available.  Drawing of blood required for CC10 tests will be 
coordinated with collection of blood samples required for routine lab tests, and if possible, from central 
lines.  The total maximum amount of blood to be drawn from each infant for CC10 -specific testing for 
the entire proto col (12 months ; 3 samples ) is about 3.1 mL.  
TAF Samples .  TAF samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_1299] 1 mL of sterile saline into  the 
endotracheal tube, followed by [CONTACT_302796]. A suction catheter is then passed with secretions aspi[INVESTIGATOR_656123] a Leukens trap  or other suitable collection device .  The catheter is then rinsed with an additional 1 
mL of sterile saline.   TAF samples will then be spun at 300 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The 
supernatant will then be transferred to a clean labeled tube and frozen immediately at -80o C.  Frozen 
TAF supernata nts will be transferred to the S ponsor when sample collection is complete. For samples 
requiring cell counts, t he cell pellet will then be resuspended in 100 L of sterile saline  and sent to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896057].   TAF samples will be 
collected prior to surfactant administration (if medically possible) since suctioning shoul d be avoided 
after surfactant is given for 1 -2 hours. TAF samples will continue to be collected  weekly  if the infant is 
still intubated (see tables 2 and 3).  
Urine and Fecal Samples .  When  urine is  collected for urinalysis in  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896058] 
a bag , excess  urine  collected  should be reserved for CC10 analysis by [CONTACT_1034]. (Note: Urine

CONFIDENTIAL  19 samples collected using cotton balls are not useful for CC10 measurements and should not be 
collected for the study.)  Each urine sample should be stored  at –20oC in a sealed plastic tube that is 
labeled with the patient Randomization ID, time and date.   Fecal material may also be collected from 
each infant within the first 24 -48 hours of life for further analysis of CC10  and oxidized CC10  by [CONTACT_429] .  Fecal material  will be  stored in a sealed plastic tube and  labeled with the patient ID, time, and 
date, and stored at -20°C.  
6.8 Analysis of Samples  
Blood Samples for Electrolytes, CBC and Liver and Renal Function .  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896059]. These will include CBC with differential and platelets; serum electrolytes, glucose, 
BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin  (total and direct) , total protein and albumin.  
Spots of Whole Blood for CC10 Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  The Sponsor will carry out these tests by 
[CONTACT_896098] , amplifying the CC10 gene sequences, and sequencing 
across  the four known alleles of the human CC10 gene that are associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_896060] . 
Serum Samples for Anti -CC10 Antibody and CC10 Assay .  The Sponsor will test for a nti-
rhCC10 antibody with standard titrations performed using serial dilutions of serum to bind rhCC10 
coated onto [ADDRESS_1256203] anti -rhCC10 
antibodies. To measure rhCC10 in serum, the CC10 ELISA described in the IND CMC section will be 
used.  To measure oxidatively modified/damaged CC10, a new ELISA has been  developed.  
TAF Samples . The clinical sites will measure cell  counts (total cells, neutrophils, etc.) . The 
Sponsor will carry out immunoassays to measure CC10 , sIgA, and cytokines ( TH2 panel, IL -6, TNF-, 
IFN-; Lumine x and ELISA ). The Sponsor will also use the BCA assay to measure total protein in TAF.  
Urine  and Fecal  Samples . The Sponsor will  measure u rine and fecal CC10 using the ELISA .  
6.[ADDRESS_1256204] care fo r this group of patients will be 
administered as needed. Postnatal c orticosteroids  (other than hydrocortisone utilized for the treatment 
of early hypotension/adrenal insufficiency)  will be avoided, except in cases in which the att ending 
physician determines that the infant’s life would be jeopardized without their use.  The MOO  will include 
a recommended protocol for postnatal corticosteroid treatment for severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_896061].

The impact of all medications will be examined in the final statistical analysis.  
[ADDRESS_1256206] normal life functions .  Important medical events that may 
not result in death, be life -threatening or require prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896062], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeop ardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   
Clarification of SAE definition .  In the context of the definition of an SAE, the phrase “associated 
with the use of the drug” means that the event is associated with a patient enrolled in the trial and is 
being reported as a result of the trial.  (This is not the same as relatedness of th e drug to the event. )  
An SAE is any adverse event occurring at any dose that ; 1) results in  death, 2) is life -threatening , 3) 
results in prolongation of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 4) is likely to lead to  a persistent or significant 
disability or incapacit y (including a medically significant event that may require medical or surgical 
intervention to treat or prevent one of the outcomes , as described  in Section 7.3 , Section 7.4,  and 
Appendix A) ,or 5) results in a substantial disruption of the ability to cond uct normal life functions.  In the 
context of this trial re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896063] (in follow -up period) 
is also an SAE.  An SAE may be related or unrelated to study medication or study procedures and 
relatedness is  not a consideration in the determination of whether an event is an SAE.  
Definition of a Life -Threatening Adverse Event .  Any medical event associated with the use of 
the study drug will be considered a Life -Threatening Adverse Event if it places the patient, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event .  Any Adverse Event associated with the use of the 
study drug will be considered an Unexpected Adverse Event if, in the view of the investigator, it is not 
consistent with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_896064] e vent among similar patients at 
the same institution  or it is not listed in the investigator brochure .

CONFIDENTIAL  21 7.2 Reporting of Serious, Life -Threatening or Unexpected Adverse Events  
Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events .  Adverse Events that are either  serious and /or 
unexpected must be reported to the S ponsor and CRO as soon as possible after the occurrence. Such 
events must be reported by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor to the FDA in writing as soon as possible after the occurrence 
but in no cas e more than 7 days (expedited) or 15 days  (non-expedited)  after the S ponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.    
Unexpected and Fatal or Life -Threatening Adverse Events . Adverse Events that are unexpected 
and are life -threatening or result in death must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as poss ible after 
occurrence. Such events must be reported by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor to the FDA by [CONTACT_6972] , mail, email,  and/or 
by [CONTACT_896099] , but in no c ase more than 7 days after the 
Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
All serious, life -threatening, or unexpected adverse events will be reported to the Medical 
Monitor and to the CRO within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event using the CRO’s 
secured e -mail portal.   
7.3 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting.  
Some Adverse  Events are of particular importance or concern in the patient population being 
treated. The purpose of monitoring Serious Adverse Events is to allow the independent DSMB to 
suspend enrollment in the study if there appears to be a higher incidence of such events among the 
treated patients than would be expected in a comparable group of premature infants (a difference may 
be considered clinically significant even though it is not statistically significant due to small patient 
numbers).  
For the purposes of th is study, the following will be considered Serious Adverse Events:  
 Air leak, including pneumothorax, pulmonary  interstitial emphysema ( PIE) and , 
pneumomediastinum  significantly impairing gas exchange ; 
 Pulmonary hemorrhage  (requiring blood products and escalating ventilator support) ; 
 Grades III/IV IVH, PVL, seizures;  
 Confirmed NEC ( >Bells stage II, based on attending Neonatologist diagnosis);  
 ROP Stage 3 or 4;  
 Overwhelming sepsis (early and late  – associated with shock );  
 Pneumonia  
 Death

CONFIDENTIAL  22 The population to be studied in this protocol is at high risk for morbidities associated with prematurity. 
Events listed below will, for the purposes of this clinical trial, be considered events commonly 
associated with prematurity. The following morbidities associated with prematurity will be entered on 
the CRF.  
 Air leak syndrome (e.g. pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastimum)  
 Anemia of prematurity  
 Apnea of prematurity  
 Bradycardia  
 Periventricular leukomalacia (confirmed by [CONTACT_60372])  
 Gastrointestinal perforation (confirmed by [CONTACT_896100])  
 Hyperbilirubinemia  
 Necrotizing enterocolitis (confirme d by [CONTACT_268899] ; < Bells Stage II ) 
 Patent ductus arteriosus (confirmed by [CONTACT_51541])  
 Periventricular or intraventricular hemorrhage (confirmed by [CONTACT_60372]  – grades I, II ) 
 Sepsis (culture -confirmed from sterile site e.g., blood, CSF, urine)  
 Retinopathy of prematurity  (Stage  II only) 
 
Adverse Events of Nosocomial Infection (specific definitions)  
Since rhCC10 is an immunomodulatory  protein, special attention will be paid to the AEs associated with 
nosocomial infection, with a particular emphasis on sepsis, pneumonia, NEC, UTI, and meningitis.  A 
diagnosis of nosocomial infection may be difficult in an intubated neonate and definitio ns vary.  It is 
recognized that an inflammatory process can arise in the absence of infection.  Since uniform reporting 
is required, the terms sepsis and pneumonia should be reserved for those AEs meeting the criteria 
defined in Appendix A.  In the absence  of documented infection, manifestations of a systemic 
inflammatory response should be listed by [CONTACT_896101].  Separate summaries of 
adverse events associated with nosocomial infection will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_896102], the site IRBs, and FDA as soon as possible 
after recognition of their importance.  
7.5 Criteria for Suspension of the Trial (Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]).  
The DSM B will receive information on the occurrence of Se rious  Adverse Events on an ongoing 
basis as patients are enrolled and treated in the study.  They will receive the reports and the 
assignment  of infants to groups A, B, or C . If serious adverse events are increased in one group

CONFIDENTIAL  23 compared to the other, then the randomization code will be used to determine which of the reported 
Serious  Adverse Events occurred in patients treated with the study drug.  If the DSM B determines at 
any point during the study, using appropriate medical judgment, that there appears to  be a greater 
incidence of Se rious  Adverse Events related to the study drug among the treated patients than would 
be expected among similar p atients  (even if not statistically significant) , they will contact [CONTACT_32816] [INVESTIGATOR_896065] a determination can be made as to whether

Several measures of efficacy in reducing respi[INVESTIGATOR_896066] .  The trends and effects observed in this study will be used to determine  appropriate efficacy 
outcome variables and  the numbers of infants that would be required to be enrolled in a larger Phase 2 
or Phase 3 study.    
8.1 Primary E ndpoint : Long Term Efficacy  – 12 months  
The primary  outcome of the study will be survival without CRM  through  12 months CGA as 
measured by a validated respi[INVESTIGATOR_896067] (presence of wheezing and/or 
coughing 2 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks)  and pulmonary questionnaires ( decrease in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_896068] , unscheduled medical visits and/or ER or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] ) 
which have been shown to correlate closely with abnormalities on pulmonary function testing . The 12  
month CGA endpoint has been shown to be more predictive of respi[INVESTIGATOR_896069] a diagnosis of BPD at 36 weeks CGA in previous studies of high frequency oscillatory ventilation 
in preterm infants.   
8.2 Secondary Endp oints: Long Term Efficacy – 6 & 18 months  
A secondary outcome of the study will be survival without CRM through  6 months CGA as 
measured by [CONTACT_896103][INVESTIGATOR_896070] (presence of wheezing and/or coughing 2 days per week for 
3 consecutive weeks) and pul monary questionnaires (decrease in respi[INVESTIGATOR_896071]/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) which have been shown to correlate closely with abnormalities on 
pulmonary function testing.  Infants will be also be evaluated by [CONTACT_896104]  18 months 
CGA to evaluate respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219], growth , and neurological development.   
8.3 Second ary Endpoint s: Short Term Efficacy  
Short term efficacy evalu ations will include time of mechanical ventilation , oxygen requirement at 36 
weeks CGA, and survival without BPD at 36 weeks CGA  (or NICU discharge)  as measured by [CONTACT_896105].  Oxygen challenge testing involves the withdrawal of supplemental oxygen for a 30 
minute  period , during which the infant is closely monitored .  At the end of the 30’ pe riod, oxygenation as

infant ’s BPD status is then de termined by [CONTACT_724495] ; a diagnosis of BPD will be made if the 
infant’s oxygen saturation is 90% or less  (<90%)  at or before the end of the thirty minute period.  If the 
infant’s oxygen level remains above 90% for the entire period, then the diagnosis will be “No BPD”.  
Failure to  complete the test due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_896072].   The severity of 
BPD will be assessed using NIH consensu s guidelines  for infants born at <[ADDRESS_1256207] -natal age and at 36 weeks PM A or at NICU discharge (whichever 
comes first) , as described in  Jobe and Bancalari . (2001 ), as follows:

8.4 Secondary Endpoint s: Safety and Efficacy - Adverse Events  
  The s afety of the study drug will continue to be assessed by [CONTACT_896108]. Safety evaluations will include all serious 
adverse events up to  at least 12 months CGA , and routine laboratory monitoring prior to NICU 
discharge (CBC, electrolytes, liver function studie s, urinalysis, head ultrasound) .  In addition to 
evaluating the safety of rhCC10, preliminary  efficacy of rhCC10 in this patient population may also be 
indicated by [CONTACT_896109]/or specific types of SAEs  (ie. IVH, PVL, ROP,

CONFIDENTIAL  25 8.5 Statistical Considerations.  
Power Analysis:  A total of 88 preterm infants will be randomized to placebo, lower dose, or 
higher dose rhCC10 with an allocation ratio of 2:1:1.  The primary analysis will be the comparison of 
placebo versus  both rhCC10 dose groups combined.  The prior trial demonstrated that the two doses 
are likely to yield similar results.   Two doses  will be used  for the purpose of extending the safety profile 
for each individual dose, as that safety data may facilitate th e choice of dose for a future Phase III 
confirmatory study.  For SAEs or AEs with background rates of 5%, 10%, or 15%, the sample size of 22 
in either dosing group will provide a probability of observing it of 68%, 90%, and 97%, respectively.  
The proposed  trial is powered for the comparison of the two doses combined versus placebo for the 
composite endpoint of death or development of CRM.  Secondarily, the study will yield effect size 
estimates for each individual dose versus placebo.  Our assumptions rega rding the comparison of 
placebo versus rhCC10 are based on the previous study with 7 placebo, 8 lower dose, and 7 higher 
dose infants (one infant in each of the rhCC10 treatment groups died).  It is important to address the 
combined endpoint of death or re -admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896073].  In the previous 
study, one loss -to-follow -up occurred in each of the three experimental groups and one death occurred 
in each of the rhCC10 groups.  At [ADDRESS_1256212] been 0.57 and 0.27.  If the proportions 
in the proposed study are similar, with 44 subjects on placebo and 44 subjects in the two  dose groups 
combined, power will be 82% with =0.05.  nQuery Advisor version [ADDRESS_1256213] to: 1) baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics and 2) efficacy and safety ob servations and measurements. 
Analyses will be conducted on both the intention -to-treat (ITT) and ‘per protocol’ cases.  Between -
treatment or between -group comparisons will be examined using chi -square tests ( or Fisher’s Exact 
tests when cell frequencies ar e small) for categorical outcomes and Student t -tests (alternatively, 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) for scalar measures. Two -sided statistical tests will be conducted and the 
significance level will be set at 0.[ADDRESS_1256214]. The efficacy and safety a nalyses will be 
conducted on both the ITT and per protocol population. ITT cases will be all randomized subjects who 
receive the study medication, while per protocol cases will be randomized subjects who complete the 
study (including all cause deaths) with out any major deviations from the protocol procedures. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to detail the sample characteristics. Between -treatment arm

CONFIDENTIAL  26 differences on key baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be tested. This latter step wil l 
be used to identify potential pre -treatment covariates for subsequent secondary analyses. Key baseline 
variables include race, gender, length, weight, head circumference, SNAP PE-II score, and gestational 
age. Descriptive statistics for the total exposure  to study drug during the treatment period (number of 
doses), timing of initial study dose, timing of discontinuation in the event of early termination, and rate 
of study dropout will be provided. Between -treatment differences will be tested using the stat istical 
methods described earlier. Concomitant medications will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1728]/pharmacological class and treatment group. In addition, they will be listed by [CONTACT_6490], name [CONTACT_61144], dates administered, dose, frequency and indication.  
Efficacy evaluation: If CC10 is mor e efficacious than placebo, the  CC10 treatment groups  will 
have a higher rate of survival without BPD at 36 weeks CGA and/or survival without CRM at 12 months 
CGA  (we are exploring which of these factors are more accurate predictors of long term respi[INVESTIGATOR_428679]) . A [ADDRESS_1256215] will be conducted to examine treatment differences in this binary 
endpoint  and Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be construc ted and any differences between the 
treatments will be tested using a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model. Secondly, a logistic 
regression will be employed to further detail the main and interaction effects of treatment and centers 
on the primary out come. Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be provided.

CRITERIA FOR ADVERSE  EVENTS A SSOCIATED WITH NOSOC OMIAL INFECTION , 
AIR LEAKS AND PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE  
 
1. Sepsis  
A number of terms confuse the definition of sepsis, including infection, bacteremia, sepsis syndrome, 
and septic shock.  For the purpose of this study, only the term sepsis should be used for AE reporting.  
Sepsis occurring in the first 3 days after birth (early onset) is considered congenital and should be 
recorded under past medical history, not as an AE.  Sepsis will be defined as the systemic inflammatory 
response to infection, with criteria adapted from the Centers for Dise ase Control (CDC) Surveillance of 
Nosocomial Infection Control Program.  All infants with suspected sepsis should have at least 2 sets of 
blood cultures from 2 separate sites, a urine cul ture and a cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) culture, with other 
cultures a s determined by [CONTACT_093].  If a central line is in place, one blood cult ure should be 
drawn from the ce ntral line (if possible) and one peripherally.  A diagnosis of sepsis will require meeting 
at least one clinical sign or symptom, one invention s urvey, and one therapy condition.  
Definition of nosocomial sepsis  
Clinical signs/symptoms Criteria - must meet at least one  
Lethargy  
Fever (>38°C), hypothermia (<37°C) or t emperature instability

Diagnostic single -antibody titer (IgM) or 4 -fold increase in paired sera (IgG) for pathogen  
2. Pneumonia  
Although pneumonia is an important nosocomial infection in the NICU, the diagnosis is often  difficult to 
make due to the inadequacies of current diagnostic methods. For the current trial, pneumonia will be 
more rigorously defined according to the Centers for Disease Control  prevention algorithm.  Pneumonia 
occurring in the first 3 days after bir th (early onset) is  considered congenital and should be recoded 
under past medical history, not as an AE.  All AEs of pneumonia must meet at least one radiographic, 
one gas exchange, and 3 clinical or vital signs criteria listed below.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_896077] (i.e. pneumothorax, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
sepsis, etc.) or by [CONTACT_324532] (i.e. apnea, bradycardia).

While all cases meeting the definition of nosocomial pneumonia must be recorded as AEs, additional 
information will also be collected on each pneumonia epi[INVESTIGATOR_896078] n of the diagnosis 
into probable  or definite pneumonia.  Criteria for conf irmation of a case of definite pneumonia require 
microbiologic confirmation of an infecting organism.  All cases of definite pneumonia must meet one of 
the criteria defined below.  
Criteria for the confirmation of a diagnosis of pneumonia  – must meet at lea st one  
Endotracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] >106 cfu/ml

3. Air leaks  
The group of AEs comprising “air leaks”, and including pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial 
emphysema  (PIE), and pneumomediastinum , are typi[INVESTIGATOR_896081].  Pneumothorax occurs when air collects in the pleural space between the lung and chest wa ll 
and can make breathing difficult.  PIE occurs in connection with pneumothorax and is detected by 
[CONTACT_896111]. Pneumomediastinum occurs when air leaks into the mediastinum , 
putting pressure on the heart and lungs . 
Pneumothorax  
Definitive diagnostic criteria for pneumothorax include increased requirement for respi[INVESTIGATOR_896082] X -ray showing free air in the chest, collapsed lung and/or displacement  of the heart and 
mediastinum . The most serious cases of pneumothorax req uire a chest tube to alleviate the pressure 
on the affected lung.  
PIE 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  31 PIE is diagnosed radiologically  and appears as small round, oval, and/or linear pulmonary lucencies 
which may be focal or diffuse. Lung volumes are increased and the heart size decrease s as 
intrathoracic pressure increases.  If subpleural cysts rupture, PIE potentially may lead to pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastinum, or even pneumopericardium.    
Criteria for the confirmation of a diagnosis of PIE.  Confirmation of a diagnosis of PIE is made  by a 
second neonatal radiologist who concurs with the positive diagnosis.   
Pneumomediastinum  
Pneumomediastinum is confirmed radiologically when a radiolucent outline around the heart and 
mediastinum is observed in the thoracic cavity.  
 
Air leak s can be life-threatening. For purposes of this study, all air leak AEs will be reported as SAEs 
and followed closely.  
 
4. Pulmonary Hemorrhage  
Pulmonary hemorrhage occurs when blood leaks into the lungs of infants in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  It is 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_896112][INVESTIGATOR_1413], bradycardia, drop in blood pressure, 
and is often associated with patent ductus arteriosis  (PDA) .  Severe pulmonary hemorrhage is treated 
with increasing end expi[INVESTIGATOR_896083] s. This condition can be life -
threatening and will be reported as a SAE.

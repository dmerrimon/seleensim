primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy  of ACTH versus placebo in reducing fatigability 
in patients with RMS.  Secondary objectives include  assessment of the tolera bility and safety of twice-
weekly ACTH treatment vs. placebo and evaluation of  ACTH on depression, slee pi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and quality of 
life measures and correlati ons between these measures. 
 
B. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
With the advent of disease modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809131], the 
importance and impact of excessive fa tigue on quality of life in patients  with MS has come into clearer 
focus.  Quality of life (QOL)-altering fatigue has been reported to occur in as many as 92% of patients 
with MS, for many patients constituting the most importa nt source of disability.  Furthermore, there is a 
strong association between fatigue  and clinical depression, sugge sting shared pathophysiological 
mechanisms and/or anatomic substrates for th ese two important sympto matic features of MS. 
 Fatigue may result from sleep distur bances due to frequent nocturia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea 
or weakness-induced hypoventilation, as well as pa in from nocturnal muscle spasms, and central 
neuropathic pain syndromes.  Ot her contributors may include hypothyroidism, cardiac or pulmonary 
disease, medication side effects, and depression. However, a large numbe r of patients with MS have what 
we will refer to as Primary MS Fatigue (PMSF), the cau se(s) of which are unknown, but which appears 
to be the direct result of MS-i nduced CNS impairment.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], su ch MS patients report that despi[INVESTIGATOR_809132]-rested and not fatigue d, they develop severe physical and /or mental fatigue that may be 
disabling and preventing them from any further activity, even in the absence of excessive exertion, and, 
at times, with rapid or sudden onset.  Resting or sl eepi[INVESTIGATOR_809133], and patients may be compelled to  spend the day taking frequent naps.   
 
It is evident  that PMSF bears litt le or no relationship to the degree of physical impairment (Flachenecker 
et al., 2002; Murray, 1985) in all but the most extrem e cases of physical disability (Mills & Young, 2010).  
There is a strong correlati on with clinical depression, which also fails, in many cases, to correlate with 
degree of physical disability, an d suggests the possibility that th ey share common pathophysiological 
mechanisms.  When other potentia l fatigue-induced confounders are e liminated, there remain a large 
number of MS patients with severe , excessive fatigability, and it is th ese patients, who we refer to as 
having PMSF.  Although the neurogenic mechanism(s) of PMSF are not understood, and the success at pharmacologic management has been extremel y limited (Brown, Howard, & Kemp, 2010; Lange, 
Volkmer, Heesen, & Liepert, 2009; Moller et al., 2011; Murray, 1985; Pucci et al., 2007), earlier studies 
have suggested that dysregulation of the hypothala mic-hypophyseal axis, and the CNS limbic system, as 
well as impaired ACTH and corticosteroid release,  may contribute to fatigue in patients in MS.  
Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are up-regulated in patients with MS, are known to 
produce fatigue.  As an example, the pro-inflamma tory cytokine IL-6, up-re gulated in MS and up-
regulated following interferon admi nistration, is reduced following corticosteroid administration.  
Corticosteroid-induced reduction of IL-6 following interferon treatme nt has been associated with 
reduction in fatigue in patients with  MS (Kumpfel et al., 2007).  Thus , one potential mechanism by [CONTACT_809139].  However, di rect effects of 
ACTH, mediated via CNS melanocortin receptors, may influe nce fatigue, as well as affective state.  Lastly, 
there are no therapeutic agents for the treatment of PMSF that have demonstrated significant efficacy, and 
the development of a significant th erapeutic agent for fatigue in MS  would profoundly affect large 
numbers of patients with MS.  
ACTH-MS Fatigue                                                                                          12/30/[ADDRESS_1118846] 
RMS and fulfill the definition of PMSF when treated w ith ACTH compared to placebo.  Known biological 
actions, both directly and indirectly , of ACTH upon the CNS make it a plausible candidate agent for the 
reduction of PMSF.    The secondary endpoints are: 1) stat istically signif icant improvement in patient self-assessmen t of quality 
of life; 2) statistically significant reduction in patie nt self-assessment of depr ession; 3) statistically 
significant reduction in patient self-assessment of sl eepi[INVESTIGATOR_809134], as 
compared to placebo, and 4) the safety and tolerability  of twice weekly ACTH injections compared to 
placebo.  The rationales for the secondary endpoints ar e: 1) the demonstration that quality of life 
improvements with ACTH use in patients with PMSF w ould increase the clinical  significance or ACTH-
induced reduction in PMSF; 2) fatigue and depression are so strongly correlated in patients with MS that 
reduction in depression with ACTH tr eatment would strengthen the possibility that depression and fatigue 
share, at least in part, a common mechanism, and a pa rallel decrease in depres sion would strengthen the 
validity of the potential causative action of ACTH upon fatigue; 3) sleepin ess is strongly correlated with 
MS-induced fatigue and thus reduction in daytime sleep iness would be an additi onal measure of validity 
for ACTH-induced reduction in MS-indu ced fatigue; 4) ACTH use, although demonstrated to be safe in 
treating patients with MS, is being used on a twice-w eekly basis over a 6 month pe riod, which is a regimen 
that has not been previously employe d, to our knowledge, in MS patients. 
   
C. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Study Design 
The proposed study is a 28-week randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind trial comparing the 
efficacy of ACTH versus placebo for the treatment of  fatigue in patients with RMS (RMS).  Ninety 
patients with RMS who meet all of the eligibility criter ia will be enrolled from five participating sites.  
Eligible patients will be consented by [CONTACT_809140].  Subjects will be randomi zed to ACTH or plac ebo at 1:1 ratio.  
  
Endpoints 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of ACTH versus placebo in reducing 
fatigability in patients with relapsing MS.  The primar y endpoint is a statistically  significant reduction of 
fatigue measured by [CONTACT_809141], which will be administered at baseline, week 8, 16, 24, and 28.  Secondary objectives include assessment of the tolera bility and safety of weekly ACTH treatment vs. 
placebo and evaluation of ACTH on depression, sleep iness, and quality of life measures and the 
correlations between measures.  The secondary endpoi nts are measured by [CONTACT_748651]-II, ESS, SF-36 at baseline, 
week 8, 16, 24, and 28.  Clinical and laboratory advers e events (AE) and serious  adverse events (SAE) 
will be monitored continuously during the study period to capture safety and to lerability information.

5. Patient becomes pregnant  
Treatment Overview 
Dosage and Administration of Acthar®  or matching placebo 
The study drug (ACTH 40 units or identical-appearing placebo) will be given subcutaneously twice 
weekly for 2 weeks. If the patient tolerates this dosage regimen, the dose will be increased to 80 units or 
placebo twice weekly.  If the 80 unit dosage is not to lerated, the dosage will be reduced to 40 units twice 
weekly for the remainder of the 24 week participation. The weekly doses will be given 3 days apart, for 
example, on every Monday and Thursday or every Tu esday and Friday. Patients are not allowed to take 
doses on consecutive days. If a patie nt cannot take a dose on a schedule d day, the dose can be taken either 
a day early, or a day late. Patients that forget to take  their scheduled dose will be encouraged to take their 
dose the following day.    
Randomization/Treatment assignment and blinding 
A total of 90 patients will be randomized either to active drug (ACTH), or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_1118857] a unique study ID, which identifi es the patient and the study site 
at which they participate throughout th e study.  Within each site, subjects w ill be randomized in blocks of 
4, 2 ACTH and 2 placebo treated patients, to achieve ba lance in the allocation of  subjects to study drug 
versus placebo arms.  The order in  which each of the 4 samples is se lected will be predetermined by a 
ACTH-MS Fatigue                                                                                          12/30/[ADDRESS_1118858] 
containing drug kit numbers and drug assignment (ACTH or placebo) will be  kept in a password-protected 
computer file in the coordinating si te pharmacy.  Each study site will be required to assign patients in the 
order of the randomization schedule and dispense medications according to the medication kit numbers 
indicated on the predetermined randomization schedule.    The investigators, study coordinators/nurses, 
and subjects will remain blinded to randomization assignment until study completion, and the blind will 
only be violated if, in the judgment of the treating physician, unblinding is necessary for patient safely in 
the setting of a serious adverse event.  The DSMB will not be blinded.  
Drug Administration and Storage Instructions 
The study drug is supplied in a [ADDRESS_1118859] is to return used and 
unused vials, along with their injection log, at each follow-up visit, be fore they receive their next allotment 
of drug.  Investigational drug use will be recorded in the accountability log by [CONTACT_9137]/nurse 
at each site, and the unused vials will  be retained until they are returned to the central coordinating center.  
 
Laboratory Testing and Study Procedure 
Review of medical history, physical exam, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Severity Scale 
(FSS), Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS), Beck Depressi on Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Expanded Disability 
Status Scale (EDSS) will be performed at screeni ng to assess the eligibility of the patient, and the 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating S cale will be administered.  The outcome measures, including MFIS, 
FSS, BDI-II, ESS, and SF-36, will be administered at  baseline, week 8, week 16, week 24, and week [ADDRESS_1118860] ACTH or placebo dose.  In addition, office visits with the treating physician 
will be conducted at the same interval for physical exam, review of concomitant medications and adverse 
events, and monitoring of patient safety and eligibil ity, and administration of th e C-SSR. Laboratory tests 
will be performed at the time of study visits.  A sepa rate serum sample ([ADDRESS_1118861] tube) will be collected 
at baseline, week 16, and w eek 28. This sample will be stored at -20c until shipped to the coordinating 
center. The specimen will then be st ored at the study coordinating cent er for future research use.

 Concomitant therapy and AEs 
 * The C-SSR must be reviewed by [CONTACT_809146], or 
laboratory changes that o ccur during the study.    
 
Study withdrawal 
If a patient is lost to follow-up after all mean s of contact [CONTACT_809147], she/he will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
 
Patient Monitoring and Evaluation 
Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_809148] a 
relapse. 
ACTH-MS Fatigue                                                                                          12/30/[ADDRESS_1118864] has completed 
visit 4(week 16). This analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_809149] d clinical and biostatistician 
members of the data safety monitoring board (DSMB).  While this analysis is being performed, no new subjects may enroll in the investigation, but treatment of those already enrolled will 
continue while the analysis is taking place. If  more subjects in the placebo arm demonstrate 
20% or greater improvement than in the ACTH  arm on both the MFIS and FSS, the study will 
be halted and subjects in the study will cease receiving inves tigational agents.  If the ACTH 
arm is equal or superior to the placebo arm in MFIS and/or FSS, the study will continue, as 
will recruitment of the additional 45 subjects.  If the study is halted due to lack of efficacy after 
the Stage 1 analysis, an additional analysis for efficacy will be performed utilizing those subjects who completed 6 months enrollm ent at the time the study was halted.  
 
Treatment compliance 
Patients will be instructed to complete a medi cation administration log an d return the logs to 
study coordinator at each visit.  Information on missed doses and total number of missed doses 
will be captured.  Missing more than 2 doses in an 8-week interval is considered non-
compliant.  The investigator will discuss th e medication regimen with non-compliant patients 
and they will be encouraged to con tinue with their injection schedule. 
 
Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_809138]-administration of an inj ectable agent.  Thus there is a risk of non-
compliance on the part of the subjects either due to needle phobia, intolerance to injections or 
lapse memory on the part of the subjects.  
Data Processing and Analysis  
Data forms will be faxed to the data coordinatio n center within 3 business days after each study 
visit and processed by [CONTACT_809150].  The forms will be entered by [CONTACT_809151]. The completeness of the data and whether th e data values are in 
an appropriate range will be checked periodical ly. Study sites will be as ked to complete data 
clarification requests for c onfirmation of missing data or  questionable information. 
 
Statistical/Analytical Plan  
Primary endpoint  
Statistical analysis will be perf ormed to test the change from baseline to end of study in two 
fatigue measures (MFIS and FSS) to be comple ted by [CONTACT_809152] e, Week 8, Week 16, 
Week 24, and Week 28. 
 
Secondary endpoint  
Statistical analysis will be done to test the change from baselin e to end of study in depression, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and quality of life m easures (BDI-II, ESS, and SF-36)  to be completed by [CONTACT_809153], Week 8, Week  16, Week 24, and Week 28. 
 All AEs are to be coded and grouped by [CONTACT_664115].  AEs will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_809154].  Summary tables of the AEs will be 
presented to show the incidence and fre quency by [CONTACT_809155]. 
ACTH-MS Fatigue                                                                                          12/30/[ADDRESS_1118865] 
the changes of the fatigue scores over time.  
 
Sample Size Justification 
Ninety subjects will be recruited and randomized  1:[ADDRESS_1118866] 
and examining physician-blinded manner.  If th e MFIS score decreases from 38 for about 20% 
with standard deviation =16.[ADDRESS_1118867]  with alpha= 0.5 would be 86%. If  the difference of the changes 
of MFIS score between two treatment group is  7.[ADDRESS_1118868] deviation=16.[ADDRESS_1118869] with alpha= 0.5 would be 
87%.   Ziemssen and colleagues (Ziemssen, Hoffm an, Apfel, & Kern, 2008) studied the effect 
of glatiramer acetate on fatigue in MS patients.  Glatiramer acetate was found to be associated 
with a reduction in absence from work and a significant reduction in fatigue symptoms, as 
measured by [CONTACT_198445].  The data from Ziemssen et al . were used for the sample size calculation 
for this study.  
D. REGULATORY, SAFETY AND MONITORING  
Members and Responsibilities of DSMB 
There will be [ADDRESS_1118870] experience in 
statistical analysis of clinical studies of MS and one will be a physician with adequate expertise 
in endocrinology.  The DSMB will review all adverse events (including all MS relapses) that 
occur during the study, independe ntly conduct the inte rim analysis, the timing of which as 
described above, and the final analysis for safety and efficacy of the investigational treatment.  
The DSMB will also meet at any time they may c hoose if there are concerns for patient safety.  
Records of all committee reviews and input  will be kept in the study binder. 
 
Regulatory Requirements 
The study will be performed in accordance with ICH GCP Guidelin es and the Code of Federal 
Regulations for clinical researc h.  Any amendments to the study protocol must be approved by 
[CONTACT_809156]/IEC of each site before implementation.  AEs and protocol 
violations or deviations must be reported according to the guideline of the IRB/IEC of each 
site.  
Safety Assessments 
 Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be conducted at every visit.  Any worsening or new 
abnormality that is clinically significant is to be  recorded as an AE and will be analyzed as 
such.  MS related symptoms are not to be re ported as AEs unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the symptoms are unusually serious and relevant. 
 
 Vital Signs 
Vital signs including body temperature, pulse, re spi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], systolic  and diastolic blood 
ACTH-MS Fatigue                                                                                          12/30/[ADDRESS_1118871] ECG will be performed at screening visit. 
 
 Clinical Laboratory Parameters 
The following laboratory assessments will be performed at the local laboratory at selected 
visits: 
 CBC 
 Urinalysis 
 CMP 
 TSH 
 Pregnancy Test (for female subjects only) 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that is 
experienced by a subject who has received an in vestigational drug, whether or not there is a 
causal relationship with the inve stigational drug. At the signing of  the informed consent form, 
each subject will be given the names and telepho ne numbers of investigational site personnel 
for reporting adverse events and medical emer gencies.  The investigator must conduct 
thorough assessment to determine the severity of the AE and the relationship to the study drug.  Any clinically significant AE of severity mo derate or higher,  requires follow up until 
resolution or stabilization.  
Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that: 
 Results in the outcome of death 
 Places the subject at immediate risk of  death (a life-threatening event)   
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928] 
 An event that results in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity. 
 Require intervention to prevent permanent impa irment or one of the other outcomes listed 
in the definition above.   
 
Adverse Event Recording/Reporting 
All adverse events (including pr e-dosing and treatment-emergent) should be recorded in the 
subject’s Adverse Event CRF regardless of severity or relationship to study drug.  The 
investigator must review the laboratory findings and sign and date the laboratory report.  Any 
moderate or severe laboratory abnormalities should be reported to the coordinating center as outlined below. All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_809157]/ Regulatory office by [CONTACT_25541] [EMAIL_15377]  or fax to 503-215-
6547 within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowle dge of the event.  Providence Health & 
Services will report SAEs to the FDA.  A ll SAEs must be recorded on SAE forms and be 
reported, whether or not the event is considered by [CONTACT_7185].

15 Severity 
The intensity of severity of an  AE will be graded as follows: 
 Mild Symptoms(s) barely noticeable to  subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence perf ormance or functioning; prescription 
drug not ordinarily needed for relief of  symptoms(s) but may be given because 
of personality of subject 
 Moderate Symptom(s) of a sufficient se verity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced ; subject is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed. 
 Severe Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on subject’s daily li fe; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with investigational drug; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
 
Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug will be characterized as follows: 
 Not related Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investiga tional drug AND that is likel y to have been produced 
by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject. 
 Unlikely Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational drug OR that is likely to have been produced 
by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject. 
 Possibly Any reaction that follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from administration 
of investigational drug OR that follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug AND  that could not be reason ably explained by [CONTACT_93735]’s clini cal state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject. 
 Related Any reaction that follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from administration 
of investigational drug AND  that follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug AND  that recurs with re-challenge, AND/OR  is improved by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_279085].

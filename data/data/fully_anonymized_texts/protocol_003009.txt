3 INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1 BACKGROUND  
 3.1.1 A
TRIAL FIBRILLATION  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachycardia that manifests as a rapid, irregular atrial rhythm with no clearly defined P- wave on the electrocardiogram . AF that terminates within 
seven days is defined as paroxysmal, while AF lasting longer than seven days is defined as persistent . Long-standing persistent AF is defined as continuous AF persisting for longer than 12 
months [1].   AF carries significant risks . AF leads to dramatically increased risk of stroke and mortality , 
particularly among patients with persistent forms of AF . Furthermore, AF is often symptomatic, 
leading to fatigue and reduced quality of life (QOL); however, it carries similar risks with or without symptoms [1].   3.1.2 D
EMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS  
AF affects an estimated 37 million people worldwide [2]. The lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_885659] 40 was 26% and 23% for men and women, respectively, in the Framingham Heart Study [3]. AF incidence rises rapi[INVESTIGATOR_885660], and approximately one-fourth of adults diagnosed with AF are at least 80 years old [3, 4] . AF incidence is higher among whites than 
among African Americans [5].   Awareness of atrial fibrillation is poor [6], and disparities in awareness and treatment of AF have been identified. Factors identified as being associated with lack of awareness of AF have included race, lower education, rural location, lower number of gen eral practitioner visits, and 
lower cognition [7, 8].   In the PRECEPT and STOP Persistent AF studies for catheter ablation to treat persistent AF 
(PerAF), the mean age was approximately [ADDRESS_1239072] deviation of 9 years. Approximately 70% of treated subjects in each study were male. Less than 10% of subjects treated in each study were non-white, and less than 2% were B lack or African American [9, 10]. 
 3.1.3 A
BLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION  
Thermal ablation using radiofrequency (RF) energy has become a widely accepted t reatment for 
many tachyarrhythmias and is considered first-line therapy in some cases [11, 1]. The success rate of RF catheter ablation for treating atrial fibrillation has been found to be superior to that of antiarrh ythmic drugs. For example, the RAAFT -2 trial found that catheter ablation led to a 55% 
recurrence rate for atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia at 2 years follow -up compared to 72% 
recurrence using antiarrhythmic drugs [1]. Similarly, recurrence of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia in the CABANA trial favored catheter ablation over drug therapy with a hazard ratio of 0.53, and analysis based on treatment received suggests a benefit from ablation in terms of death an d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  [12]. 
 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 86 
Catheter ablation is considered a reasonable treatment (C lass I Ia) for the treatment of 
symptomatic persistent  AF refractory or intolerant to antiarrhythmic drugs. Two ablation 
catheters have been approved for treatment of drug -refractory persistent AF: the 
THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF Catheter, which is a focal RF ablation catheter; and the 
Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac Cryoablation Catheter. Electrical isolation of all pulmonary veins (PVs) is recommended (Class I) as part of all AF ablation procedures . However, PV  
reconnection is common, and repeat ablation is often necessary [1, 13].   Catheter ablation of AF is often accomplished by [CONTACT_885693] a point-by-point fashion to create circles (e.g. to isolate PVs ) and/or lines (e.g. to block an arrhythmogenic 
channel) . RF energy delivery through an electrode at the tip of an ablation catheter causes 
resistive heating in tissue, which, along with conductive heating, leads to thermal ablation of cardiac tissue. Features such as saline irrigation and temperature feedback can help to avoid the formation of thrombus and char due to blood heating during RF delivery [1].   Pulsed field (PF) ablation, also known as irreversible electroporation, relies on the application of non-thermal electrical pulses to form pores in the cell membranes of target tissue resulting in 
tissue apoptosis or necrosis. Re cently published preclinical and clinical research suggests that PF 
ablation may be as effective as RF ablation while reducing risks associated with RF ablation such as damage to collateral structures  [14, 15, 16, 17]. 
 In the recent PRECEPT pi[INVESTIGATOR_885661]® SF catheter for treatment of persistent AF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), only PV isolation was required; linear ablation lines including left atrial roof line, mitral isthmus line, left atrial floor line, and cavotricuspid isthmus line were only required to treat documented macro- reentrant atrial 
tachycardias. Results of the PRECEPT study showed that a left atrial roof line was delivered in just under half (48.6%) of the per-protocol group, and a cavotricuspid isthmus line was delivered in just over one-third (35.2%) of the per protocol group. A left inferior PV mitral line and other linear lesions were each delivered in less than 10% of patients in the per-protocol group (7.8% and 8.9%, respectively) [9].  3.1.4 S
AFETY OF AF ABLATION  
A review of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2000 and 2010 found an overall incidence of complications of 6.3%, with a trend of increasing complications over that period  
[18]. A 2010 questionnaire-based survey of centers performing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation reported a major complication rate of 4.5%  [19]. A 2017 analysis of prospective data 
from the ESC -EHRA Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Long -Term Registry reported procedure-
related complications in 7.8% [20]. In the recent PRECEPT pi[INVESTIGATOR_885661]® SF catheter for treatment of persistent  AF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
which used a similar primary safety endpoint to this protocol, the rate of the primary safety endpoint was 4.7% [21]. The PRECEPT study used an objective performance criterion (OPC) of 16%, based on an expected safety event rate of 8% and an 8% region of indifference,  for 
analyzing the primary safety endpoint [22].   
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1239073] also used similar primary 
safety endpoints. The DIAMOND-AF pi[INVESTIGATOR_885662] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) reported a primary safety event in 3.3% of subjects treated with the investigational device and in 6.6% of subjects treated with the control device (TactiCath™ Quartz) [23] . The SMART -SF study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), which evaluated the 
THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF catheter for the treatment of paroxysmal AF, reported a primary adverse event in 2.6% of subjects (95% CI 0.7-6.5%). However, the SMART-SF study only evaluated early safety and acute effectiveness, so the chronic effectiveness of the treatments was not reported [24]. An OPC of 14% was used for analysis of the primary safety endpoint in SMART -SF [25]. The SMART-AF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) study was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_885663]® catheter for treatment of paroxysmal AF, with primary safety and effectiveness endpoints similar to this protocol. The incidence of primary adverse events in SMART-AF was 9.9% (95% CI 5.8-15.6%) [26]. The OPC used for SMART- AF was 
not reported [27] but was presumably higher than the upper confidence bound of 15.6% based on the study’s success.  
 3.1.5 C
LINICAL OUTCOMES OF AF ABLATION  
In a 2018 systematic literature review, single- procedure clinical success in treating persistent AF 
was estimated at 47% (95% CI 40 -54%) across 18 cohorts between 2010 and 2015. Single-
procedure cli nical success in treating any AF with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) plus linear 
ablation was estimated at 44% (95% CI 36-53%) across 10 cohorts over the same time period. Overall, this review found declining clinical success for AF ablation between 2001 and 2015 [28, 28]. The 2017 HRS consensus on AF ablation recommended a minimum acceptable success rate for treatment of persistent AF of 40%  [1]. Subsequent single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_885664], including 
the PRECEPT study, used this minimum rate as an objective performance criterion for primary effectiveness. In the recent PRECEPT pi[INVESTIGATOR_885661]® SF catheter for treatment of persistent AF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), primary effectiveness success was 59.3% through the end of the nine- month effectiveness evaluation 
period [21]. However, in contrast to this protocol, PRECEPT used a 6-month blanking and therapy consolidation period, and repeat ablation was allowed during that period (which occurred in 5.7%) [29].   3.[ADDRESS_1239074] widely used curative treatment for cardiac arrhythmia . However, 
the reliable application of durable ablation lesions remains an unmet need [1, 13, 30]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_885665], conduction gaps remain in a substantial minority of ablation lines in the left atrium [31]. Gaps between lesions may lead to electrical reconnection in the heart and the recurrence of the treated arrhythmia, requiring repeated treatment, or may create new arrhythmia circuits that may be more symptomatic  [11].  
 Contiguity of linear lesions depends on factors such as lesion size and placement [1]. Delivery of focal ablation lesions with a wider surface area may reduce the likelihood of gaps by [CONTACT_885694]-by-point ablation. An ablation electrode with stable tissue engagement may improve the predictability and reliability of lesion

5 CONTROL DEVICE INFORMATION  
 
5.1 INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF Catheter is indicated for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and for drug refractory recurrent symptomatic persistent AF (continuous AF > 7 days but < 1 year), refractory or intolerant to at least 1 Class I or III AAD, when used with the CARTO® 3 System.  The intended use of the CARTO® 3 System is catheter- based cardiac electrophysiological (EP)  
procedures. The CARTO® 3 System provides information about the electrical activity of the heart and about catheter location during the procedure. The system can be used on patients who are eligible for a conventional electrophysiological procedure. The system has no special contraindications.  The use of the SMARTABLATE™ RF Generator and all accessories is indicated in combination with compatible therapeutic catheters f or use in conventional intracardiac RF ablation 
procedures.

7 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
7.1 PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT  
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of the following device- or procedure- related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) following the index ablation procedure: 
Within 7 days: 
• Death  
• Myocardial infarction 
• Phrenic nerve paralysis  
• Transient ischemic attack (TIA)  
• Stroke/cerebrovascular accident  (CVA)  
• Thromboembolism 
• Major vascular access complications / bleeding  
• Heart block  
• Gastroparesis  
• Severe pericarditis  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial and prolonged) due to cardiovascular or pulmonary AE‡ 
Within 30 days: 
• Cardiac tamponade / perforation  
Within 90 days:  
• Atrio -esophageal fistula  
Within 180 days: 
• Pulmonary vein stenosis 
‡ Excludes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885666]/AFL/AT recurrence  Definitions related to Primary A es are provided in Table 13. Adverse events occurring during or 
after a repeat ablation procedure will not be considered Primary A es (see Section 9.10).  
 As discussed in Section 3.1.4, an objective performance criterion (OPC) of 16% was used for the primary s afety endpoint in the PRECEPT study of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF 
catheter for treatment of persistent AF (NCT0281 7776) based on an expected rate of 8% with an 
8% region of indifference [22]. The reported rate of the primary safety endpoint in that study was 4.7% [21]. Other recent studies of RF ablation for the treatment of AF (paroxysmal or persistent) have reported primary adverse event rates as high as 9.9% [26]. For this study, a non- inferiority 
margin (NIM) of 8% between the investigational group and the control group will be u sed for the 
primary analysis of the Primary Safety Endpoint.  7.2 P
RIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom from documented recurrence of AF, atrial tachycardia (AT), or atrial flutter (AFL) based on electrocardiographic data through 12-month follow-up and excluding a 90-day blanking period. The following are considered primary effectiveness endpoint failures: 
• Inability to isolate all targeted pulmonary veins during the index procedure. 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 86 
• Ablation using devices other than the assigned study device for any left atrial ablation 
during the index procedure. (The assigned study device is the Sphere- 9 Catheter for the 
investigational arm and the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF for the control arm.) 
• Any repeat ablation, surgical ablation, or arrhythmia surgery for treatment of recurrent AF/AT/AFL  after the index procedure. 
• Documented AF/AT/AFL recurrence after the 90 -day blanking period. 
• Class I  or III AAD dose increase from the historic maximum ineffective dose (prior to t he 
index procedure) or initiation of a new Class I or III AAD for treatment of AF/AT/AFL 
after the 90 -day blanking period. 
• DC cardioversion for AF/AT/AFL after the 90-day blanking period. 
 A documented recurrence of AF/AT/AFL based on electrocardiographic data is (a) an epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ≥ 30 seconds in duration documented by [CONTACT_90660], TTM, or Holter monitor  or (b) a n epi[INVESTIGATOR_885667] 12- lead ECG recording lasting at least [ADDRESS_1239076] 90 days after the index ablation procedure. The effectiveness 
evaluation period will be from Day 91 through Day 360.  Failure to complete the ablation procedure due to failure of non-study equipment (e.g., fluoroscopy, intracardiac echocardiography, or electrophysiology recording system) during the index procedure will not be considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure.  If the procedure 
cannot be completed due to failure of non-study equipment, the subject will be discontinued as described in  Section 8.8. 
 Use of multiple devices of the assigned type during the ablation procedure (e.g., due to device deficiency) is not  a primary effectiveness endpoint failure. Failure to isolate a pulmonary vein 
that wa s not targeted for isolation (e.g., due to unusual anatomy) is not a primary effectiveness 
endpoint failure.  The historical maximum ineffective dose for an AAD is the highest dose administered for AF 
that was ineffective in controlling AF or produced intolerable side effects prior to the ablation procedure. For amiodarone only, the maintenance dose is  considered as the historic maximum 
ineffective dose. A new AAD is an AAD that the subject has never taken for AF prior to the 
ablation procedure.  During t
he blanking period, use of a new or previously failed AAD is not a primary effectiveness 
endpoint failure, regardle ss of dose. 
 Use of any new Class I  or III  AAD (as defined above) for treatment of AF/AT/AFL recurrence 
during the effectiveness evaluation period will be considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure. Use of any previously failed Class I or III  AAD at a dose greater than the historic 
maximum ineffective dose (as defined above) for treatment of AF/AT/AFL recurrence during the 
effectiveness evaluation period will be considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure.

8.8.3 DISCONTINUED  SUBJECTS  
Discontinued subjects are those who are enrolled in the study, meet all eligibility criteria,  and 
undergo a procedure in which the assigned study device is introduced into the heart, but no ablation  energy is delivered. Subjects may be discontinued due to non-investigational equipment 
failure or based on intra-operative findings (e.g., if only non-study arrhythmias are present or if PVI is contraindicated due to a finding during the procedure). Discontinued subjects will count against the maximum study enrollment. Discontinued subjects will be followed through the Day 30 visit to evaluate safety  and will be included in evaluation of study endpoints. Discontinued 
subjects may  not be re- enrolled.  
 8.8.4 T
REATED SUBJECTS  
Treated subjects are those who are enrolled in the study, undergo the index ablation procedure, and are treated with a study device (i.e., ablation energy is delivered). Treated subjects will count toward the maximum study enrollment. Treated  subjects will be followed through the Day [ADDRESS_1239080] withdrawal within five (5) working days.   Subjects will be considered lost to follow- up if contact [CONTACT_885695] (3) 
documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_885696] (2) documented phone calls and one (1) written attempt by [CONTACT_279594].   The investigator will make every effort to collect information about subjects who withdraw or are lost to follow -up. Withdrawal should be treated as an unscheduled office visit as described in 
Section 9.15.8. No additional data may be collected after a subject has been withdrawn. 
However, data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used.  8.8.[ADDRESS_1239081] completed  the final study visit.

9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The schedule of study evaluations and visits is summarized in Table 6. Study procedures are 
illustrated in  the flowchart in  Figure 3. Details are provided below. 
 9.1 P
ATIENT SCREENING  
Patients ≥[ADDRESS_1239082] of care treatment outside of this study.   The Sponsor intends to enroll patients reflecting, as well as possible, the demographics of the study population. Similar to the recent PRECEPT and STOP Persistent AF trials for catheter ablation to treat PerAF, the Sponsor expects to enroll roughly 70% males and 30% females [9, 10].   9.[ADDRESS_1239083] approval from the site’s IRB/EC prior to consenting patients for the study.  The investigator or designee will document the process of obtaining informed consent in the patient’s source documents . The potential benefits and risks of participation will be explained to 
the patient . The patient will be provided a copy of the informed cons ent for review and will be 
given ample opportunity to review and ask questions. If the patient agrees to participate, both the patient and the investigator will sign the informed consent, and the patient will be recorded on an enrollment log . Failure to obtain informed consent renders the patient ineligible for participation.  
 Adverse events will be collected from the time informed consent is provided until the subject exits the study.  9.[ADDRESS_1239084].  Roll-In procedures are not required prior to randomizing subjects at a site. Roll- In procedures are 
recommended to allow investigators not familiar with the investigational device to gain 
experience with the investigational device. Until the site has completed two Roll-In procedures, 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1239085] does not meet the study eligibility criteria  and may not undergo the index ablation 
procedure.  
 9.8 A
BLATION PROCEDURE  
The goal of the index ablation procedure is isolation of all PVs  as demonstrated by [CONTACT_885697]. Starting with transseptal puncture, the ablation procedure may only be performed by [CONTACT_10733].  Photos, video, and/or audio recordings of the procedure may be taken during the ablation procedure for future training purposes.   The following sequence is recommended for the ablation procedure: 
• Esophagus temperature probe placement 
• Diagnostic catheter placement (e.g. , in the coronary sinus) 
• Thrombus screening (if ICE is used ) 
• Initial heparin bolus 
• Confirmation of target ACT , with monitoring minimally at 30- minute intervals thereafter  
• Transseptal puncture 
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_885670](s) 
• Introduction of catheter(s) into the left atrium 
• High -density mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885671] 
• Phrenic nerve pacing  
• PV isolation  
• Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885672] 
• Confirmation of PV isolation after waiting period  
• Confirmation of block across linear lesions 
• Screening for phrenic nerve injury 
Additional details are provided below.  A single or double transseptal puncture may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. A constant heparinized drip is recommended for all long sheaths with access to the left atrium.  If an esophagus temperature probe is used, it is recommended that the probe be placed prior to administration of a heparin bolus. Thrombus screening is required prior to introduction of the ablation catheter and prior to any cardioversion. The target ACT should be maintained while the ablation catheter is in the body. If the ACT drops below the target during the ablation procedure, the ablation procedure may continue while additional heparin is administered.  Cardioversion may be used to restore sinus rhythm at the discretion of the investigator.   At the end of the procedure, phrenic nerve function must be assessed by [CONTACT_5640] (a) direct pacing of the phrenic nerve or (b) observation of diaphragm motion on fluoroscopy during spontaneous breathing. If new phrenic nerve injury is observed or suspected b ased on assessment at the end of 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1239086] or inhalation-exhalation fluoroscopy will be performed prior 
to discharge.  9.8.1 P
ULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION  
See Section s 9.8.4 and 9.8.5 for specific requirements  and recommendations regarding ablation 
with the investigational device  and the control device.  
 High -dens ity mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885673] (i.e., the Affera 
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885674]® 3 System) is required prior to pulmonary vein isolation. Prior to any RF delivery near the right superior PV  (RSPV) ostium, pacing maneuvers must be used to 
evaluate phrenic nerve location.
 
 
Wide antral circumferential ablation (WACA, i.e. , adjacent ablation lesions encircling ipsilateral 
veins 1 – 2 cm outside of the vein ostium) must be used to encircle and isolate all targeted PVs.   
 Entrance block will be confirmed in each targeted PV (a) after a [ADDRESS_1239087] ablation delivery for that PV or, a s part of routine practice at experienced centers with 
prior approval from the Sponsor, (b) during provocative testin g with adenosine or isoproterenol. 
It is recommended that entrance block be confirmed using a circular or multi- spline catheter or, 
for subjects treated with the investigational device, the Sphere- 9 Catheter  (see section 9.8.4). 
According to the 2017 HRS consensus on AF ablation, “Entrance block of the left PVs should be assessed during distal coronary sinus or left atrial appendage pacing in order to distinguish far-field atrial potentials from PV potentials.”  [1] 
 Failure to isolate all targeted PVs will be considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure. Ablation using devices other than the assigned study device to isolate a targeted PV  will also be 
considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure. Failure to isolate a PV  that was not targeted 
for isolation (e.g., due to unusual anatomy) is not a primary effectiveness endpoint failure.  9.8.[ADDRESS_1239088] 
be documented. Ablation using devices other than the assigned study device for any left atrial ablation during the index procedure will be considered a Primary Effectiveness Endpoint failure.  The following linear ablations are only required in order to treat documented macroreentrant tachycardias:  
• Linear lesions between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava (cavotricuspid isthmus line)  
• Linear lesions between the left and right PVs (roof line and/or posterior line), optionally including homogenization of the posterior wall of the left atrium 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 86 
• Linear lesions between the mitral annulus and the left PV s (mitral isthmus line), with 
ablation permitted in the apposing coronary sinus. 
Cavotricuspid isthmus linear ablation is required in cases with documented typi[INVESTIGATOR_885675]. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_885676].  
 Additional ablation beyond these lesion sets (e.g., ablation at sites of fractionated electrograms) 
is not permitted unless the target is shown to be a critical isthmus or focal source in an organized atrial tachycardia (e.g. , atypi[INVESTIGATOR_169208]).   
 Delivery of ablation lesions that are not part of routine clinical practice is not recommended.  
Bidirectional conduction block across each ablation line must be confirmed with mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or pacing  as appropriate. 
 9.8.3 D
ATA COLLECTION  
Data collected during the procedure will include the following: 
• Adverse events  
• Cardiac medications  
• Device deficiencies  
• Rhythm(s) prior to and during the ablation procedure 
• Rhythm at the end of the ablation procedure 
• Devices used for mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or verification 
• Lesion sets applied  
• Method(s) of confirming each lesion set 
• Use of RF and/or PF for each lesion set/group 
• Device(s) used for each lesion set/group 
• Total number of RF and PF deli veries  
• Total RF and PF delivery time  
• Total fluid infused from mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885677] 
• Total fluoroscopy time 
• Time(s) of catheter introduction and removal 
• Ablation data (electronic or paper records) captured by [CONTACT_885698][INVESTIGATOR_16816], ablation 
system, and/or EP recording system 
 After the ablation procedure, an investigator involved in performing the procedure will evaluate electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885678]. Scoring of electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885679] a 
scale from 1 – 5, with [ADDRESS_1239089] acceptable.  9.8.4 I
NVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE USE

9.10 REPEAT ABLATION  
Repeat ablation for treatment of recurrent AF /AT/AFL  at any time after the index ablation 
procedure will be considered a primary effectiveness failure. A ny repeat ablation must be more 
than 30 days after the index ablation procedure. It is strongly recommended that any repeat ablation be more than 90 days after the index procedure. Repeat ablation using the investigational device is not permitted.  
 If a repeat ablation procedure is performed : 
• Diagnostic evaluation related to adverse events (e.g., chest CT or MRI for subjects with symptoms suggestive of PV stenosis) should be completed prior to a repeat ablation procedure. 
• See Section 9.6 for anticoagulation requirements. 
• Thrombus screening must be repeated acco rding to Section 9.7. 
• A pregnancy test must be repeated for women of childbearing potential. 
• Assessments will include medical history as well as cardiac medications and anticoagulation 
• The schedule of follow-up vi sits will not reset.  
 9.11 A
NTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS  (AAD S) 
See Section 7.2 for definitions of AAD use related to the Primary Effectiveness Endpoint.   During the 90-day blanking period, subjects may receive new AADs or previously failed Class I or III  AADs without affecting their primary effectiveness classification.  It is recommended that a 
Class I  or III AAD be selected according to the ACC/AHA/ESC 2014 Guidelines for the 
Management of Patients with AF  [42]. Initiation, re -initiation, or up- titration of amiodarone is 
not recommended post ablation. In addition, it is recommended to discontinue use of Class I or III AADs used for treating AF/AT/AFL by [CONTACT_2671] 90-day blanking period.  During the effectiveness evaluation period (Day 91 through Day 360): 
• Continuation or initiation of any new Class I  or III  AAD for treating AF/AT/AFL  
recurrence will be considered a primary effectiveness endpoint failure. 
• Use of any previously failed Class I or III  AAD at a dose greater than the historic 
maximum ineffective dose for treating AF/AT/AFL recurrence will be considered a primary effectiveness endp oint failure.  
Use of a previously failed AAD at or below the historical maximum ineffective dose during the effectiveness evaluation period is not a primary effectiveness endpoint failure.   9.12 T
RANSTELEPHONIC MONITORING (TTM)  
A transtelephonic monitor (TTM, or other event monitoring device) will be provided to each subject prior to the end of the 90-day blanking period. Subjects will be instructed to transmit recordings at least monthly and  when AF-related symptoms occur. Subject s will use the

Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 86 
monitoring device to report symptoms at the time of transmission. Missed TTM recordings will 
not be considered a protocol deviation.  TTM recordings will be analyzed by a core laboratory. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_885681] (AF/AFL/AT) record ed on TTM within the effectiveness evaluation period and lasting longer 
than 30 seconds will be reviewed by [CONTACT_487116] 180 and Day 360 visits . 
Symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrences will be identified  by [CONTACT_89709]. The 
number of TTM recordings will be documented.  9.13 H
OLTER MONITORING (HM)  
Prior to the Day [ADDRESS_1239090] a 24 -hour Holter Monitor (HM). 
HM recordings will be analyzed by a core laboratory. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_885681] 
(AF/AFL/AT) recorded on HM within the effectiveness evaluation period and lasting longer than 
30 seconds will be reviewed by [CONTACT_487116] 180 and Day 36 0 visits .  
 
9.14 12-L EAD ECG  RECORDINGS  
12-lead ECG will be recorded as part of any in -person visits at Day 30, Day 90, Day 180, and/or 
Day 360, as well as any unscheduled visit (if possible). 12-lead ECG recordings during the effectiveness evaluation period wil l be analyzed by a core laboratory to identify epi[INVESTIGATOR_885682] (AF/AFL/AT) (a) lasting longer than 30 seconds or (b) covering an entire recording lasting at least 10 seconds.  9.15 F
OLLOW -UP VISITS  
A Pre -Discharge Visit will be conducted prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885683]. Telephone 
follow-up will be conducted at Day 10 (7-13 days) to assess medications and adverse events. Follow- up visits are at 1 month (Day 30, 14-42 days), 3 months (Day 90, 76 -104 days), 6 months 
(Day 180, 150-210 days), and 12 months (Day 360, 330-390 days). The Day 30 visit may be either an in -person visit or a “hybrid” visit as described in section 9.15.3. U nless an office visit is 
needed to assess adverse events  or as part of the Neurological Assessment Sub-Study, office 
visits at Day 90, Day 180, and Day 360 may be conducted as telehealth visits , with transmission 
of TTM recordings in lieu of 12- lead ECG . Additional telephone follow-up will be conducted at 
75 days (Day 75, 60-90 days) unless the Day [ADDRESS_1239091]-approval study with subjec t follow -up for up to 5 years may be requested  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory body as a condition of approval of the investigational device. As a result, follow-up visits including medical history, arrhythmia history, and adverse events may extend for up to [ADDRESS_1239092] undergoes a repeat ablation procedure.  9.15.1 P

10 ADVERSE EVENTS  AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES  
 
10.1 DEFINITIONS  
 10.1.1 A
DVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. This definition in cludes 
events related to the investigational device or the control device. This definition includes events related to the ablation procedure. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational medical device.  
 
Conditions or diseases that are chronic but stable should not be recorded as an AE. For example, 
recurrence of AF or of a pre -existing atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) and 
associated treatment  (including repeat ablation or pharmacological or electrical cardioversion) 
are considered progression of pre-existing disease and do not meet the definition of an AE. Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease progr ession are 
not considered Aes, but these medical conditions should be adequately documented in the subject’s medical history . An underlying disease or pre-existing condition will not be reported as 
an AE unless it significantly worsen s in severity  or frequ ency in a manner that is not attributed to 
natural progression.  10.1.2 S
ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that : 
• Led to death  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in : 
o A life -threaten ing illness or injury , or 
o A permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or 
o In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (> 24 hours), or 
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury , or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or body function, or 
o Chronic disease 
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition or for a procedure that is required as part of this study, without a serious deterioration in health, is not an SAE.  10.1.[ADDRESS_1239094] (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the device. This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational device.  
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1239095] (SADE) is an ADE that that resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a SAE.  
 An unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is an SADE which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity , or outcome has not been identified in the current risk assessment. An 
anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  An unanticipated a dverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation al plan or application (including a supplement ary plan or application ), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 10.1.[ADDRESS_1239096] exits the study: 
• All device or procedure related AEs , including AEs related to either the investigational or 
control device, and including possible relationship to the device or procedure 
• All cardiovascular related AEs  
• All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the device or procedure 
Adverse events will be recorded, reported, and followed regardless of which device (investigational or control) was used to treat the subject.  AEs will be reported to the Sponsor using an electronic case report form (eCRF). The following information should be obtained for each AE: 
• A description of the event including diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, and other 
supporting data 
• Date of onset  
• Date of awareness of the site 
• Action taken including treatment 
• Outcome including date of resolution 
• Severity (see Table 8) 
• Seriousness 
• Expectedness (see Table 9)

The Primary Safety Analysis will be performed at a one- sided Type I error rate of α = 0.05 using 
the Farrington-Manning method. If the upper 95% confidence bound is less than 0.08, the study 
will be considered to have demonstrated safety of the investigational device.   Primary Effectiveness Analysis  
The n ull hypothesis (H 0) is that the true rate of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint success (no 
failures through Day 360) for the investigational device ( PI) is less than or equal to the true rate 
for the control device ( PC) minus the NIM of 0.15. The alternative hypothesis (H A) is that the 
success rate for the investigational arm ( PI) is greater than the success rate for the control device 
(PC) minus the NIM of 0.15. 
 
H0: PI ≤ PC – 0.15 
HA: PI > P C – 0.15 
 The Primary Effectiveness Analysis will be performed at a one- sided Type I error rate of α = 
0.025 using the Farrington-Manning method. If the lower 97.5% confidence bound is greater than −0.15, the study will be considered to have demonstrated effectiveness of the investigational device.  
 11.1.1 P
OOLABILITY ACROSS SITES 
Data from different sites are expected to be poolable based on (i) consistent site selection criteria based on the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), (ii) the use of a consistent clinical investigation plan with well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and (iii) site monitoring to ensure compliance. To minimize the influence of any individual site, each site should not enroll more than 20% of the total enrollment.  A regression approach will be used to evaluate homogeneity of treatment effect (Primary Safety and Primary Effectiveness)  across sites  using the PAC . This will use a logistic regression model 
with fixed terms for randomized treatment group, site, and the interaction of treatment group and site. If necessary, Firth’s adjustment will be used to handle sparse data. If heterogeneity across 
sites is found to be potentially significant ( p < 0.1), additional analyses will be conducted to 
investigate sources of the apparent differences across sites. If data from different sites are not found to be poolable, a random- effects model will be fit to examine the impact of site 
heterogeneity on the primary endpoints.   11.1.2 S
ENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  
Multiple imputation of the primary effectiveness endpoint will be employed to address missing data. This will be based on a fully conditional specification logistic regression approach with 100 imputed data sets. Imputation will be performed separately by [CONTACT_1570]. The imputation model will include the following covariates: age, sex, and LA s ize. Details will be provided in 
the statistical analysis plan.

outcomes are increased (and decreased) to explore the impact of potential missing not at random on the primary effectiveness analysis.  
 Reasons for missing data within the follow -up period will be reported. TTM compliance will be 
calculated for each subject in the PAC  as the number of TTM recordings during a given period 
divided by [CONTACT_885699]. Expected transmissions will be estimated based on a [ADDRESS_1239100] the following 
demographic and baseline va riables:  
• Age 
• Sex 
• LA size  
 
The primary endpoints will be assessed separately within each patient subgroup.    11.1.4 S
AMPLE SIZE 
A sample size of 350 evaluable subjects is planned for the PAC . Power calculations were 
performed using the Farrington-Manning method [44]. A sample size of 350 subjects in the PAC (175 in each arm) provides 82.2% power for Primary Effectiveness and 84.0% power for Primary Safety in the P rimary Analysis.  
 To ensure that investigators have adequate experience with the investigational device, each site will be permitted to use the investigational device in up to two  enrolled non-randomized subjects 
(Roll -In Cohort). Subjects in the Roll- In Cohort will be analyzed separately from the PAC .  
 It is estimated that the attrition rate will be approximately 15%, leading to a planned randomized total of [ADDRESS_1239101] the following secondary hypotheses using the PAC : 
 
1. Total Energy Application Time Superiority : The
  null hypothesis (H 0) is that the mean 
total energy application time during the ablation procedure for the investigational device (µ
ETI) is greater than or equal to the mean time for the control device ( µETC). The 
alternative hypothesis (H A) is that the mean total energy application time for the 
investigational device is less.

12 RISK ANALYSIS  
 
12.1 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Available clinical data for the Sphere-9 Catheter and the Affera Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885669] [32, 33, 34] suggest the following potential benefits of the investigational device: 
• Improved durability of ablation lesions 
• Reduced procedural and energy delivery time 
• Safety benefits associated with PF ablation including reduced risk of thermal injury to the 
esophagus 
There may be other benefits that are unforeseen at this time.  
 
12.2 P
OTENTIAL RISKS 
Risks to subjects enrolled in this investigation include all risks currently associated with percutaneous electrophysiology procedures and RF catheter ablation procedures, which are well understood [1, 22, 36]. A brief summary of published complication rates can be found in Section 3.1.4. Anticipated adverse events are listed in Table 12, and some more common adverse events are listed in Section 10.3. Serious adverse events (SAEs) have also been reported for the PRECEPT pi[INVESTIGATOR_885661]® SF catheter for treatment of persistent A F ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [21]. Specific risks are described in more detail 
below based on published literature and study results for catheter ablation for AF.  Some pain and/or ecchymosis at the groin access sites is common. The incidence of major vascular access complication s has  been reported between  0.2% and 1.5%. Access site 
complications can include hemorrhage or hematoma at the groin access sites after the ablation procedure [1]. The results of the PREC EPT study included hemorrhage reported as an SAE in 
0.6% [21]. Access site complications can also include AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm . Ultrasound 
should be performed if AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm is suspected  [1]. 
 The ablation procedure may cause cardiac perforation  leading  to pericardial effusion and 
potentially tamponade. The incidence of tamponade has been reported between  0.2% to 5% [1]. 
Tamponade was reported as an SAE in 1.4% in the PRECEPT study [21]. Cardiac tamponade has been reported as the most frequent cause or periprocedural death [45]. Echocardiography should be performed if tamponade or significant pericardial effusion is suspected  [1].  
 The reported incidence of cardiac valve damage is low (≤0.5%) [1, 20, 18] . Cardiac valve 
damage can be caused by [CONTACT_885700]  [1].  
 The reported incidence of PV  stenosis is less than 1%. PV  stenosis can  potentially lead to chest 
pain, shortness of breath, coughing, hemoptysis, or other pneumonia- like symptoms . There is 
also a risk of pulmonary hemorrhage , which  has been reported in cases of pulmonary venous 
occlusion [46]. Chest CT or MR imaging should be performed if PV  stenosis is suspected  [1].  
 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 86 
The reported incidence of coronary artery stenosis or occlusion is low ( less than 0.1%) [1]; 
however, the incidence of myocardial infarction has been reported up to 0.4% in the literature  
[18], and myocardial infarction was reported as an SAE in 0.6% in the PRECEPT study [21]. 
 There is a small risk of cardiac arrest  (less than 0.1%) [1]. Heart block was reported as an SAE in 
approximately 0.6% in both the PRECEPT study and the SMART-AF study of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® catheter for treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal AF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [21, 26]. Arrhythmias are common after the ablation procedure [26] and may include a trial or ventricular fibrillation, tachycardia or bradycardia, possibly requiring 
cardioversion or pacemaker implantation .  
 Hypotension has been reported in previous studies of RF ablation for paroxysmal AF in up to 1.2% of subjects , and syncope has been reported at a similar rate [26, 23]. Unexplained 
hypotension should be evaluated promptly with echocardiography to rule out pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade [1] .  
 The incidence of death reported in the literature is 0.1% to 0.4% [1]. Two subject deaths (0.5%) were reported in the PRECEPT study [21].  Pleuritic chest pain with or without a “trace” peric ardial effusion due to pericarditis is very 
common after catheter ablation for AF  [1]. There is also a risk of pulmonary edema (1.4% 
reported as SAEs in the PRECEPT study) [21] or pneumothorax ( reported between 0.1% to 0.4% 
in the literature) [20, 18]. There may be a risk of bronchial injury, particularly when ablating near the superior pulmonary veins [47, 48].  RF a blation  near the posterior wall of the left atrium may cause esophagus injury, in rare cases 
leading  to atrio -esophageal fistula, which is often fatal [1]. While esophageal injury is relatively 
common (15%) [49]; the incidence of atrio -esophageal fistula has been  reported between 0.02% - 
0.11% [1], with 0.2% reported in one single-center study [50]. When ablating near the esophagus with the control device in this study, reduced RF power is recommended to reduce the risk of thermal injury  [1]. When ablating with the investigational device, only PF energy delivery is 
permitted on the posterior wall of the left atrium. PF ablation has not been shown to injure the esophagus [16].  RF ablat ion near the phrenic nerve can lead to tempora ry or permanent  injury (diaphragmatic 
paralysis) . The incidence of permanent phrenic nerve paralysis has been reported between 0% 
and 0.4 [1]. Diaphragmatic paralysis was reported as an SAE in one subject (0.3%) in the 
PRECEPT study  [21]. Pacing maneuvers should be used to evaluate the location of the right 
phrenic nerve prior to any RF ablation near the right superior PV  [1].  
 RF ablation on the posterior wall of the left atrium can injure the vagal nerves, which can lead to pyloric spasm and gastric hypomotility (gastroparesis). Gastric hypomotility has been reported with an incidence of up to 17%, and asymptomatic functional impairment has been reported in 
 Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with the Sphere -9 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885657]-[ZIP_CODE]  Revision: G 
 
Affera, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 86 
up to 74% of patients. The risk can be reduced using the same techniques used to avoid 
esophageal injury [1], which are described above.   There is a risk of thromboembolism or air em bolism leading to stroke or transient ischemic 
attack, asymptomatic cerebral emboli, or occlusion of other vessels (e.g., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). The incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been reported between 0% and 2%, and air embolism has been reported with an incidence less than 1% [1]. One stroke (0.3%) and two pulmonary embolisms (0.6%) were reported in the PRECEPT study [29].   Asymptomatic cerebral ischemia is often observed on cerebral MRI following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation  but has not been linked to decline in neurocognitive function [1]. A 2015 
review defined a silent cerebral event (SCE) as an “acute new MRI -detected brain lesion typi[INVESTIGATOR_885684] a patient without clinically apparent neurological deficit”, which is detected based on new DWI hyperintensity with corresponding ADC reduction. A s ilent cerebral 
lesion  (SCL) is an SCE with corresponding FLAIR hyperintensity. This 2015 review found 
reported incidence of SCE following RF catheter ablation for AF (paroxysmal or persistent) between 6.8% and  24%, with reported incidence of SCL between  7.4% and 8.3% [51]. 
Publications since that time have reported widely varying incidence of post-ablation asymptomatic cerebral ischemia. A 2020 report of 285 AF patients undergoing catheter ablation with either RF or cryoballoon, targeting only PVI , found SCE in 23% [41]. Another 2020 report 
of 55 AF patients undergoing RF catheter ablation, including PVI and optional substrate ablation, found SCE in 42 – 67% depending on MRI parameters [52]. Meanwhile, a 2019 r eport 
of 97 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing ablation with a novel gold- tip RF ablation catheter 
found ischemia in 9.3%, which the authors called SCL but defined as being independent of FLAIR [40].   The risk of thromboembolism can be reduced by [CONTACT_885701], during, and after the ablation procedure [1]. Continuous, uninterrupted anticoagulation is 
required in this study before, during, and after the ablation procedure, and the target activated clotting time (ACT) must be maintained while the ablation catheter is in the body.  
 Air embolism is most often caused by [CONTACT_885702], including during catheter exchanges or associated with long apnea. Sheaths with access to the left atrium should be carefully managed according to the catheter  instructions for use and 
training in order to minimize this risk. However, air embolism can also be caused by [CONTACT_885703]-esophageal fistula , which should be excluded if air embolism occurs post-procedure [1].   
 Nausea or lightheadedness/fainting is common in procedures involving anesthesia. The subject may have an allergic reaction to anesthesia, sedatives, contrast dye, heparin, protamine, or other agents administered during the ablation procedure.   There is also a small risk of radiation injury, potentially increasing the lifetime risk of fatal malignancy  (estimated at ≤0.1% for 60 minutes of fluoroscopy)  [53].

While PF ablation may potentially reduce risks associated with RF catheter ablation such as damage to the phrenic nerve s, vagal nerves,  and esophagus, theoretical risks of PF ablation 
include arrhythmia induction, transient phrenic nerve injury, and asymptomatic cerebral emboli due to microbubble formation [15, 17].  The assessments included in this investigation are considered stand ard of care at the participating 
sites. Additional follow -up required as part of this investigation is not expected to increase risk to 
subjects.   12.[ADDRESS_1239102] been confirmed in nonclinical bench, laboratory, and animal testing.  This investigation plan has been designed to minimize risk to participating subjects in several ways:  
• Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude subjects who may be at increased risk 
for complications from – or who are less likely to benefit f rom – catheter ablation for 
PerAF.  
• Subjects will be screened to ensure compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
• Investigators and sites will be selected for participation based on demonstrated 
experience with similar mappi[INVESTIGATOR_885685], and personnel will be trained on the use of the investigational devices prior to participation.  
• Ablation settings available on the Affera Ablation System will be limited based on data obtained from a nimal and clinical studies.  
• Affera personnel will be present for ablation procedures involving the investigational device and will monitor the use of the investigational device. 
• Data monitoring will be conducted regularly to identify and address protocol deviations.  
• A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review data from the clinical investigation on 
an ongoing basis and advise the Sponsor regarding the safety and well-being of subjects 
any changes to the risk- benefit analysis.  
The degree of risk to each subject relative to potential benefits of participation in the investigation should be evaluated by a qualified physician.

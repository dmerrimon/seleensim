[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Purpose of the Study  
  
The prevalence of diabetes in adults over the age of 20 is significantly higher in  the Hispanic/Latino  
population compared to non -Hispanic whites. Admitted  patients with diabetes are at higher risk for 
readmission and Emergency  Department (ED) visits than those without diabetes especially those in 
lower  socioeconomic status and racial/et hnic minority groups. The goals of this  proposed study are to 
explore patients and providers perceptions (n=15, 6  providers and 4 patients) of the current discharge 
process which will inform  the development of a patient -centered transition of care model fo r Hispanic  
/Latino adults (≥18 years of age) with diabetes from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385673]. It is hypothesized that a 
culturally tailored transition of care  model tailored for Hispanic/Latinos adults with diabetes will result in 
fewer  ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369644], and re -admissions.  
 
The objective remains the same for Aim2. Our hypothesis is that participants enrolled in the newly 
developed transition of care model will have less Emergency Room visits post discharge, lower rates of 
unplanned readmission a t [ADDRESS_482502] discharge and will report more follow up visits with a health care 
provider within 30 days of discharge than those individuals discharged on the usual transition of care plan.  In addition , patient experience will be better in those in the ne w transition of care model.  
  
 
Background & Significance 
 
The prevalence of diabetes in adults over the age of 20 is significantly higher in the Hispanic/Latino 
population compared to non - Hispanic whites.  Diabetes imposes a large economic burden partially due 
to the significantly higher rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385674].  
In 2014, a total of 7.2 million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385675] U.S. adults aged 18 years or older.  Admitted patients with diabetes are at higher risk for 
readmission and Emergency Department (ED) visits than those without diabetes especially those in 
lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority groups, history of prior admission, diabetes associated comorbidities, public insurance, and emergent or urge nt admission.   
  
Diabetes is one of the most common conditions managed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], yet how to transition a patient 
with diabetes to the outpatient setting is understudied and outcomes of patients with diabetes after 
discharge is unknown. The importan ce of the transition of care from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385676] a major area of improvement in diabetes care. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_385677], a paucity of re search exists 
focusing on the transition of care among patients with diabetes.  The American Diabetes Association 
(ADA) recommends a well -structured, patient -centered, transitions of the care, which includes a 
discharge plan and follow up within [ADDRESS_482503] -discharge in patients with diabetes shows that being Hispanic/Latino is 
associated with a higher risk for multipl e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126483]- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_385678], Hispanic/Latino patients remain a leading subgroup of patients not reaching 
diabetes goals.  Therefore, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a transition of care model that is patient/cultura lly centered for 
Hispanic/Latino adults with diabetes from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308936]/home will reduce the existent gap in diabetes care.  
 
 
Design & Procedures  
 
Aim 1:  To develop the transition of care model for Hispanic/Latino adults, patients and providers will be 
selected from Duke Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DRH) and Duke University Health System (DUHS), the local 
Hispanic/Latino community, and local clinics in Durham delivering care to Hispanic/Latino patients with 
diabetes. Drs. Corsino and Padilla will collect the data. It is anticipated that a total of 15 participants (4 
patients) and (6 providers - physicians [MD, DO], nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants 
(PAs)) will be obtained. We seek to explore patients' and providers' perspectives on the transition of 
care from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385679]. All participants will complete a brief questionnaire. The information 
collected will be instrumental in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a transition of care model that is culturally/patient 
centered.  
 
Aim 2:  Overall common themes have been collected from the [ADDRESS_482504] a Community Consultation Studio with community Engaged Research Initiative 
Core as a part of Pro00103450. They will interview 6- 8 participants from Hispanic/Latino communities 
with diabetes. The common themes from this interview along with the common themes from the first [ADDRESS_482505] (PDSA) framework. Changes can be reassessed 
and modified swiftly as a part of the continuous improvement cycle to allow f or adjustments that 
facilitate the desired outcomes.  
 The second set of [ADDRESS_482506] strictly for research purp oses. We would like to keep the face to face 
option available for consent and questionnaires because some participants may be recruited by [CONTACT_385684].  
 The Hispanic/Latino population has limited access to e -mail and smart pho nes. In the event that 
participants do not have access to email and cellphone we will obtain verbal consent. The informed 
consent, questionnaires and [ADDRESS_482507].  
 
3 additional providers will be reconsented and repeat the original interview.  
  
Selection of Subjects  
  
Aim 1 inclusion criteria: 
Patients:  
1. 18 years or older  
2. Self -Identified as Hispanic/Latino  
3. Previous diagnosis with Diabetes Mellitus  
4. Ability to provide informed consent without a proxy  
5.  An admitted patient at a Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385680].   
6.  English or Spanish speaking  
  
Providers:  
1.  See patients at Duke Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385681]  
2.  Working in the local clinics proving care for the local Hispanic/Latino patients.  
 
For Aim [ADDRESS_482508]. Padilla or other key personnel. They are both 
bilingual. Approximately 4 patients will be recruited from Durham, NC. Inclusion criteria include age ≥18 
years, self -identified as Hispanic/Latino, pr evious diagnosis of diabetes, Spanish and/or English speaker, 
ability to provide informed consent without a proxy, with a recent (within 3 months) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385682] (DRH) or Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Maestro care/Epic slicer dicer w ill be used to 
identify participants with a recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Patient word of mouth may also be used from local 
Hispanic organizations. Both methods have been previously implemented by [CONTACT_15957] -PI (Corsino) while 
enrolling Hispanic/Latino participants in r esearch studies. Approximately 6 health care providers will be 
recruited from the DRH and Duke Univ ersity Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We aim to enroll a diverse group of providers 
including MDs, DOs, NPs and PAs. Providers will be approached for recruitment by [CONTACT_24478] -PIs o r 
designated trained research staff. Both inpatient and outpatient providers will be targeted. 
Compensation will be $10 per person. If the participant is not interested in sharing their social security 
number with the research team they will receive a gift  of similar monetary value.  
 Aim 2:  Participants will be recruited using Slicer Dicer or the inpatient diabetes admission list.  Trained 
key personnel on the study will introduce the potential subjects to the study. A total of 32 subjects will 
be recruited and enrolled. The subjects will be compensated $25 dollars from petty cash for their 
participation. For the re -interviews (providers) will receive $10 dollars.  
 
 
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 This is a minimal risk study.  We will not include vulnerable populations. 
  
This study should result in better understanding of factors that impact  the transition of care of 
Hispanics/Latinos patients with diabetes. Identifying and understanding internal and external barriers to 
the transition of care should be determined when considering designing a culturally sensitive transition 
of care model. A b etter method to transition from inpatient setting to home for Hispanic/Latinos with 
regard to factors such as lower socioeconomic status, language, and health literacy along with a 
fragmented delivery system may result in better outcomes during the transit ion phase from acute to the 
outpatient setting.  
 
The benefits to the subject are that the participant may require fewer visits to the ED and less 
admissions to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385683] 30 days following their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
The importance of this study is t o optimize the transition of care of Hispanic/Latino patients with 
diabetes because it is poorly understood. This study will inform a more aligned discharge and follow -up 
process for Hispanic/Latino patients discharge in future and will also inform future larger randomized 
trials.  
  
 
Data Analysis & Statistical Con siderations  
 General Data Analytics. The recording will be reviewed by [CONTACT_24478] -PI, each independently, they w ill 
identify themes and will color code them. Subsequently themes will be combined into common themes.  
 
Analysis. For all outcomes and demographic information collected, descriptive analysis (means  
and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequ encies and percentages for categorical 
variables) overall and by [CONTACT_385685]. The non-feasibility outcomes will be compared  
between the usual care and intervention group. Chi -squared or Fisher’s Exact tests will be  
conducted to assess the difference s of each outcome between groups. Logistic regression models  
will be conducted to access the adjusted differences of each outcome between usual care and  
intervention groups. The models will be adjusted for a limited number of variables that are  theoretica lly 
thought to explain some variation in the value of the outcomes.  
 
For Aim [ADDRESS_482509] a difference in the primary 
outcomes in the number of Emergency Department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577]-admissions.

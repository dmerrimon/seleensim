Introduction  
The goal of the analyses described here is to use data we collected through an online 
randomized trial to examine consumer responses to receiving health, climate, or health and 
climate swap recommendations while grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This analysis plan pre -specifies the 
analyses before collecting data and therefore serves as our ex -ante planned analysis.  
 
Study Protocol  
Participants will complete an online randomized  trial. Participants will complete  3 online 
study visits, each  separated by ~[ADDRESS_771446] 
study visit (baseline), participants will provide  electronic informed consent and then complete 
the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586326]. At the end of the first visit, participants will 
be randomized to  1 of 4 trial arms: 1) health swaps, 2) climate  swaps, 3) combined  health and 
climate  swaps, or 4) control. For the second and third study visit, participants will complete the 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586327] , then respond to survey questions .  
In the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989], participants will be instructed to shop as they usually would for 
items in the following food groups: beverages, boxed and frozen meals, dairy and dairy 
alternatives, meat and meat alternatives , soups, and sweets and snacks. They will be given a 
budget of $50. To checkout, participants need to have spent between 0.5 and 1.5 times this 
budget (i.e., $25 to $75), but otherwise will be  free to shop as they wish. To incentivize 
participants to behave as they would in a real store, we will inform  them that [ADDRESS_771447] for $50.  
 
Statistical Considerations  
General Principles  
We will use a two -sided critical alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_771448] all statistical tests. All confidence 
intervals presented will be 95% and two -sided. Unless otherwise noted, analyses will be intent -
to-treat, examining all participants in their randomized groups  (regardless of the extent of the  
study they complete after randomization ).  
 
Co-Primary Outcome s 
There are t wo co-primary outcomes : 
1. The first co -primary outcome is the healthfulness of participants’ selections, 
operationalized as the average Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model score of the products the 
participants select in the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989].  
2. The second co -primary outcome is the carbon footprint of participants’ selecti ons, 
operationalized as the average carbon footprint (in CO 2-equivalents) of the products the 
participants select in the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989].  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
The secondary outcomes are:  
• Selection outcomes:  
3. Calorie density, kcal per 100g  
4. Sugar density, g per 100g  
5. Sodium density, mg per 100g  
6. Saturated fat density, g per 100g  
7. Fiber density, g per 100g  
8. Protein density, g per 100g  
9. Total s pending, USD ($)

10. Thinking about health  
11. Thinking about climate impact  
12. Thinking about taste

Statistical Methods  
1. We will describe p articipant characteristics  by [CONTACT_159344] . We will use m eans and standard 
deviations to characterize continuous variables . We will use  frequencies and percentages 
to characterize  categorical variables . We will  also describe the number of swaps offered 
and proportion of swaps accepted in the intervention arms.   
2. Analyses of the co-primary outcome s: 
a. We will use mixed effects linear  regression to evaluate the effects of the 
interventions  on the healthfulness and carbon footprint of participants’ selections. 
In separate models for healthfulness and carbon footprint, we will regress the 
outcomes on indicator variables for trial arm (excluding the control arm as the 
reference category), an indicator variable for time period (baseline vs. follow -up) 
and the inter action between trial arm and time period. We will treat the intercept 
as random to account for repeated measures within particip ants. The treatment 
effects are given by [CONTACT_586329].  We will test whether 
each intervention arm (i.e., Health  Swaps, Climate  Swaps, or Combined Health + 
Climate  Swaps ) affects healthfulness and carbon footprint of participants’ 
selections compared to the  control arm.  We will  also test whether the effects of 
the 3 intervention arms on  the healthfulness  and carbon footprint  of participants’ 
selections differ from one another  using Wald tests.   
b. We will test whether the effects of the interventions on the  healthfulness and 
carbon footprint of participants’ selections are moderated by  [CONTACT_551] (young 
adult ages 18 -25 vs. older adult ages 26 and older), health consciousness (average 
responses to 4 items adapted from prior studies,1,2 treated continuously) , and 
environmental consciousness (average responses to the GREEN scale,3 treated 
continuously) . To test for moderation, we will add to the primary model indicators 
for the moderator , interactions between the moderator and trial arm, interactions 
between the moderator and time period (baseline vs. follow -up), and t hree-way 
interactions (i.e., difference -in-difference -in-differences) between  the moderator,  
trial arm, and time period . We will use separate  models for each co-primary 
outcome ( healthfulness and carbon footprint ) and moderator . We will test the joint 
significance of the difference -in-difference -in-differences interaction terms.  If the 
primary analyses  do not reveal differences between the three intervention arms, 
we may collapse across these arms for the moderation analyses.  
c. We will test whether the effects of the intervention on the co -primary outcomes 
differ between first and second exposure using mixed effects linear regression. 
Similar to the main model, we  will regress the outcome on indicator variables for 
trial arm (excluding the control as the referent), week of data collection (i.e., week 
2 or week 3, excluding week 1 [the baseline week] as the referent category), and 
the interactions between trial arm and w eek of data collection . We will use the 
model to estimate effe cts of the interventions on the outcomes during week 2  (vs. 
baseline)  and week 3  (vs. baseline)  and to test whether these effects differed from 
one another. If the analyses described above do not reveal differences between the 
three intervention arms, w e may collapse across these arms for this analysis.  
3. Analyses of secondary outcomes:  
a. We will use a similar mixed effects regression approach to evaluate the effect of 
the interventions on the secondary outcomes (e .g., calorie density, thinking about 
health ).  
4. Analyses of other outcomes  
a. We will descriptively report participants’ responses to the perceived helpfulness , 
liking , and acceptability  outcomes.   
 
Sample Size Needs  
We used G*Power to estimate sample size needs.[ADDRESS_771449] of each intervention (health, climate , and combined) vs. the control of d=.15. This effect is 
considered small69 and is conservative based on prior studies.31,70,71 Assuming a two -tailed 
critical alpha of 0.05 and a correlation among repeated measures of 0.4, a sample size of 904 
(226 per group) would yield 90% power to detect an effect of this size or larger. To account for 
potential missing data, we aimed to recrui t a sample of 1,200 (300 per group).  
 
Exclusions  
In week 1, we will exclude participants who do not complete the survey. These participants will 
not be randomized and will not be invited to complete the remaining weeks of the study.

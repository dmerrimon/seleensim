Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ 27  Apr 2018  Introduction:  
Cervical ripening and induction of labor continues to be a significant problem for 
patients with premature rupture of membranes (PROM) at term and near term with 
an unfavorable cervix. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_875282], their effectiveness is unpredictable in PROM patients. The 
purpose of this study is to compare the Cook Cervical Ripening  Balloon (CRB) 
plus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875283].  
 
Objectives:  
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CRB to expedite labor in term and near term PROM patients not in labor in conjunction with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875284].  
   
The primary effectiveness endpoint  is the  time from start of labor induction t o 
delivery . 
 
The primary safety endpoint  is the incidence of protocol -defined chorioamnionitis.  
 
Study Design:  
This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter study to compare the 
safety and effectiveness of the CRB plus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875285].  
 This study intends to enroll up to 200 patients, randomized 1:1 into two treatment 
groups, at up to five investigational sites.  
 
Inclusion Criteria:   
1. Intrauterine pregnancy ≥ 34 0/7 and ≤ 42 0/7 weeks  
2. P ROM not in labor  
3. Bishop score ≤ 6 
4. Maternal age ≥ 18 years old

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ 27  Apr 2018  Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient unwilling or unable to provide informed consent  
2. Evidence of chorioamnionitis at enrollment  
3. Malpresentation (e.g., transverse fetal orientation, breech presentation)  
4. History of prior cesarean section or uterine surgery  
5. Major fetal anomaly or aneuploidy (anomalies that require immediate 
medical or surgical intervention)  
6. Significant vaginal bleeding  
7. Multiple gestation  
8. Contraindication to vaginal delivery (e.g., placenta  previa, vasa previa, 
placenta percreta, prolapsed umbilical cord, active genital herpes 
infection, invasive cervical cancer)  
9. Contraindication to labor induction  
10. Abnormal (Category III) fetal heart rate patterns  
11. Maternal heart disease requiring medication or resulting in significant 
cardiac dysfunction  
12. Severe maternal hypertension (chronic or preeclampsia)  
13. Patient receiving or planning to undergo exogenous prostaglandin 
administration  
14. Polyhydramnios  
15. Pelvic structural abnormality that would preclude labor  
16. Presenting part above the pelvic inlet (i.e., - 4 station and above)  
  
Study Considerations:  
The CRB is indicated for mechanical dilation of the cervical canal prior to labor induction at term when the cervix is unfavorable for induction. The CRB is cleared 
for commercial use and is routinely used in labor and delivery patients at many 
institutions for cervical ripening. It has been adopted over the past several years 
as an important method of ripening the cervix in nulliparous and multiparous 
women who have an indication for delivery.  
 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 6 of 22 
Evaluation of CRB in PROM Patients  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ 27  Apr 2018  Although it has been used more frequently in term or near term patients, the CRB 
has also been used at other gestational ages where delivery is sought in a patient 
who has an unfavorable cervical exam, i.e., the cervix is not ripe or is unlikely to 
respond to the normal labor stimulants. In many of these circumstances the 
contraindications to the use of this device are discounted because of the inherent 
benefits the device affords in achieving labor in a reasonable time period.  One of 
these conditions is the event of rupture of membranes (ROM), which is listed as a contraindication in the CRB Instructions for Use (IFU). This contraindication is 
based on the idea that anything that breeches the cervix might increase a 
woman’s risk for infection. Several devices that impose the same risk and are 
approved for this indication are already in use: the fetal scalp electrode, which 
actually attaches to the fetus, and the intrauterine pressure catheter. Both of these 
devices have been part of clinical practice for over 30 years. In each of these 
cases the device is being used during labor to improve the quality of monitoring or 
safety of labor.  
 It is known that a longer latency period, the period from ROM to delivery, 
increases the chance for infection in the form of chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, 
or postpartum endometritis. It is for this reason that once ROM has occurred in the term or near term pregnancy, it is important to expedite the course of labor to 
avoid this infectious outcome. In the current clinical environment there are 
approved products and products used off -label to  achieve delivery. The use of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933], Cytotec
®, Cervidil® and the CRB have been the primary methods to 
achieve this goal.  
 
Risks and Foreseeable Adverse Device Effects:  
Please reference the CRB IFU for a list of adverse events that may be considered potential risks to patients participating in this study. Additional risks unique to the 
use of the CRB in term and near term PROM patients include intrapartum 
infection, adverse material reaction and entanglement of the umbilical cord.

Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ [ADDRESS_1222429] procedures will be used to manage the 
risks unique to the use of the CRB in term and near term PROM patients.  
 
Study Procedure Initiation:  
Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be invited to 
participate in the study. Patient eligibility for enrollment will be based on known 
information at the time of enrollment; information obtained at a later date may 
contradict  this information but will not be considered a noncompliance with the 
study protocol. Patients will have the study procedures, risks and benefits explained to them and will have the opportunity to ask questions. Point of 
enrollment occurs when the patient is randomized into the study.   
 For patients who have not received any prenatal care or who, for any other 
reason, have not been assessed for abnormal placentation, it is recommended 
that an ultrasound be performed prior to study enrollment to assess the location of 
the placenta. Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with the CRB plus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933] (Group A) or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875286] (Group B). Randomization will utilize a 
computer generated randomization assignment that is stratified for parity, i.e., 
nulliparous and multiparous women will be accounted for in the randomization 
assignment. Approximately 200 pregnant women who meet the eligibility criteria 
will be enrolled into the study.  
 Both groups A and B will receive Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875287] 90 minutes of study enrollment. Limit 
ambulation per site’s standard of care following administration of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933].  
 
Patients randomized to Group A will undergo CRB placement within 90 minutes of 
study enrollment. Please reference the CRB IFU for a description of patient 
preparation and suggested instructions for use.  In this study, the intrauterine 
balloon should be inflated with 60 cc of saline, and the vaginal balloon should be 
inflated with 30 cc of saline.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875289]. Details of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875290], including the 
maximum amount of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875291], amount of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875292] (prior to post -delivery bolus) and total amount of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875293], 
will be recorded for each patient. Providers are permitted to suspend Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875294].  
 
Intrap artum Procedure Management:  
The CRB will remain in situ  for up to [ADDRESS_1222430] the cervix; 
please reference the IFU for a description of device removal. The removal of the 
CRB will have no impact on the use of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933], its dosage, or its continued use. 
Those decisions will be made based on progress of labor and institutional 
standard of care, and in accordance with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875295].  
 All other aspects of labor management will be at the discretion of the primary 
obstetrical provider. Patients known to be group B streptococcus (GBS) positive 
will receive prophylaxis in accordance with CDC guidelines. A cervical exam 
including Bishop score should be completed at baseline (i.e., within 90 minutes of 
point of enrollment and prior to start of labor induction) and every 6 hours until delivery.  
 The use of fetal scalp electrodes and intrauterine pressure catheters will also be at 
the discretion of the obstetrical provider. Women will be able to choose analgesia or regional anesthesia depending on their preference. If a spontaneous delivery is 
not possible the ultimate decision to deliver by [CONTACT_875318].

Statistical Considerations:  
Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness endpoint, the time from start of labor induction to delivery, will be analyzed on a per -patient basis based on the intent -to-treat 
population. The primary effectiveness hypothesis is that patients treated with the CRB and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875296].

with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875299] 
a p-value < 0.025.  
 
Primary Safety Hypothesis  
The primary safety endpoint, the incidence of protocol -defined chorioamnionitis, 
will be analyzed on a per -patient basis based on the per -protocol population. The 
primary safety hypothesis is that patients treated with the CRB and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875300]- inferior rates of protocol -defined chorioamnionitis than patients 
treated with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875286].

Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed on a per -patient basis based 
on the per -protocol population:  
• Incidence of failed induction,  
• Incidence of cesarean section,  
• Incidence of post -partum endometritis, and  
• Incidence of cord prolapse.  
 
For each outcome, the CRB and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875302], to 
assess for a significantly reduced rate. P-values will be adjusted using the Holm 
method controlling the family -wide Type I error rate at 0.05.

The following additional measures will be reported:  
• Time from PROM to delivery,  
• Length of each stage of labor,  
• Amount of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875303],  
• Incidence of post -partum hemorrhage,  
• 1 minute, 5 minute, and 10 minute Apgar scores,

Sample Size Calculations  
Sample size calculations for the primary effectiveness hypothesis were performed 
using data from Sanchez -Ramos, et al.[ADDRESS_1222431] with α =0.025, 
power=0. [ADDRESS_1222432] deviation of 300. The expected mean time 
from start of labor induction to delivery was 416 minutes for the CRB and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875304] 539 minutes for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_875286]. This resulted in a required sample size of 
190 patients, or 95 per group.  
 Sample size calculations for the primary safety hypothesis were performed using 
an expected rate of 4% for each group, derived from the rate of chorioamnionitis 
observed in the literature.
 1,2,3,4,5,6,[ADDRESS_1222433], α=0.025, power=0.80 
and non- inferiority margin of 10% resulted in a required sample size of 
124 patients, or 62 per group.

General Statistical Analyses  
Statistical analyses will be performed using  SAS® for Windows® (release 9.3 or 
higher) or other widely accepted statistical software. Clinically relevant baseline 
variables will be tabulated and compared between the treatment groups. 
Categorical variables will be assessed using appropriate contingency table 
analyses (chi -square test or Fisher's exact test) and logistic regression to assess 
the importance of covariates. Continuous variables will be tested using appropriate tests such as ANOVA, unpaired Student's t -test, or Wilcoxon rank -sum test, 
depending on variable distribution, and linear regression and repeated measure where appropriate. Survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan- Meier or Cox 
Proportional Hazards will be incorporated if censoring of data occurs.  
 
Measures to be Taken to Avoid or Minimize Bias  
This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to 
minimize bias in both assigning patients to treatments and in analyzing the results.  
 
Randomization  
Assignment of patients to a treatment group will be by [CONTACT_875319]. Sites will not be informed of the block size.  
 
Missing Data  
Due to the short -term follow -up of this study, a minimal amount of missing primary 
safety and effectiveness data is expected. Ten additional patients have been 
added to the required sample size to account for missing data. If necessary, 
multiple imputation will be used where the imputed values will be samples from the

Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ 27  Apr 2018  Chorioamnionitis10 – A complication of pregnancy caused by [CONTACT_875327]. A diagnosis of chorioamnionitis will 
include maternal fever > 100.4°F (38.0°C) plus at least two of the following 
symptoms with no other documented source of infection:  
• Sustained maternal tachycardia with heart rate > 100 bpm,  
• Fetal tachycardia with fetal heart rate > [ADDRESS_1222440] 10 minutes,  
• Foul smelling amniotic fluid,  
• White blood cell (WBC) count > 15,000,  
• C- reactive protein more than 2 mg/dL,  or  
• Uterine tenderness.  
 
Cord prolapse  – A condition that occurs when the umbilical cord descends 
alongside or beyond the fetal presenting part.  
 
Dystocia – Pathologic or difficult labor, which may be caused by [CONTACT_875328], shape, position, or condition of 
the fetus.  
 
Febrile  – Temperature > 100.4˚F (38.0˚C).  
 
Labor  – A patient will be considered in labor if she is having regular, painful 
uterine contractions > 6/hr resulting in progressive cervical effacement and 
dilatation.

Protocol 09- 014-07 ∙ 27  Apr 2018  Non-reassuring fetal heart tones (NR FHT)11 – For this study, only Category III 
NR FHT will be considered adverse events. NR FHT  are considered Category III 
(abnormal) when the fetal heart rate tracing shows EITHER of the following:  
• Sinusoidal pattern or  
• Absent variability with recurrent late decelerations, recurrent variable 
decelerations, or bradycardia.  
 
Postpartum endometritis12 – An infection of the decidua (i.e., pregnancy 
endometrium). Evidence of postpartum endometritis will include maternal fever 
> 100.4°F (38.0°C) on any two of the first [ADDRESS_1222441] 
24 hours, with no other documented source of infection; symptoms generally include foul -smelling uterine discharge and uterine tenderness. A positive 
laboratory result may be obtained for verification of the diagnosis.   
 
Postpartum hemorrhage13 – The loss of greater than 500 mL of blood following 
vaginal delivery or 1000 mL of blood following cesarean section.  
 
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM)  – Ruptured membranes prior to the 
onset of labor will be confirmed by [CONTACT_7053]: 
• Non-invasive fetal membranes rupture diagnostic test (e.g., AmniSure),  
• Amniocentesis with indigo carmine instillation, or

Protocl Short Title: Vascular normalization in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab 
using [11C]temozolomide PET and Vascular M RI 
08/23/[ADDRESS_1045912] on drug delivery. Results from this study will shed light on the vascular normalization hypothesis. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma will undergo simultaneous PET with radiolabeled temozolomide and MRI to assess changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, vessel caliber, and vascular permeability while simultaneously measuring the pharmacokinetics and brain penetration of temozolomide  
(TMZ).  
 We plan to study patients with recurrent glioblastoma whose clinical care plan includes treatment with bevacizumab and temozolomide.  Patients taking daily temozolomide 50 
mg/m
2/day will undergo a PET scan using radiolabeled temozolomide (TMZ -PET) at 3 time 
points: 7-13 days after initiation of temozolomide but before beginning bevacizumab 
(“baseline” - temozolomide steady -state scan) , 1 day after initiation of bevacizumab (day 15) , 
and before the third bevacizumab infusion. Arterialized venous blood samples  will be 
collected during the imaging in order to measure radioactivity, blood metabolites , and the 
relationship between radiotracer uptake and tumor features such as blood- brain barrier (BBB) 
breakdown and tumor blood flow.    In addition, we will explore the link between flow, permeability, and tumor temozolomide retention. These studies will  be performed using our human simultaneous MR -PET imaging 
camera. No diagnostic decisions or therapy decisions will be based on any results obtained from these PET scans, and we expect no change in the care of these patients. The success of these studies s hould enable methods that could be used in larger studies to more completely 
understand the role of anti- angiogenic agents in the treatment of cancer.  
 1.2 Primary Objectives  
1. To assess temozolomide delivery before and after bevacizumab in glioblastoma. 
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
1. To explore the link between flow, permeability, and tumor temozolomide retention. 
a. Measure tumor blood flow with MRI perfusion and compare with temozolomide  retention. 
b. Estimate permeability from K
trans MRI measurements and compare with 
temozolomide retention. 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent(s)  
 
[11C]Temozolomide  
 The study agent is a radiopharmaceutical that is chemically identical to the prescription drug temozolomide except that it has a substitution of the positron 
Protocl Short Title: Vascular normalization in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab 
using [11C]temozolomide PET and Vascular M RI 
08/23/13  
 7 used PET and a dual labeling strategy , where  [11C]temozolomide  was radiolabeled 
in two different positions: at the 4 -carbonyl and 3- N-methyl  positions of the 
molecule.  Besides determining the mechanism of action, the study also determined 
that there was no difference the amount of observed ring opening between tumor 
and normal tissues (p>0.05), suggesting that the ring opening of temozolomide was tissue specific but not tumor specific.   
Rosso  et al.  (2009 ) used a new PET system analysis method to characterize 
temozolomide distribution in tissues and predicted normal brain and brain tumor temozolomide concentration profiles for different temozolomide dosing regimens.  They concluded higher temozolomide exposures in brain tumor relative to normal brain was attributable to breakdown of the blood brain barrier and possibly to 
increased intratumoral angiogenesis.  
  
2.2 Study Disease  
 
An estimated 51,410 primary brain tumors were diagnosed in 2007, and 19% of these tumors were glioblastomas 
1.  GBM is the most common malignant primary brain tumor 
and is a uniformly fatal disease with 5 -year survival rates less than 4% despi[INVESTIGATOR_763362], radiation and chemotherapy.  There is no curative t herapy for 
patients with G BM.  Current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is 
concomitant involved field radiation and oral temozolomide chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_279420] 6 -12 months ( Stupp et al., 2005).  If patients rel apse, there is no 
standard of care treatment and some patients will be treated with temozolomide again, albeit on a different dosing schedule.  Instead of 5 consecutive days every month, patients may be treated with a lower daily dose of temozolomide but f or more days every month (Perry et 
al., 2010).  The goal of this dose dense regimen is to saturate the enzyme,  MGMT, which is 
believed to counteract the DNA -damaging effects of temozolomide. Bevacizumab was 
approved by [CONTACT_763370].  
 
2.3 Rationale 
 
The dependence of tumor growth and metastasis on angiogenesis — which has been 
extensively demonstrated in animal models — has provided a powerful rationale for 
anti-angiogenic approaches to cancer t herapy  (van de Beek, 2007; Carmeliet & Jain, 
2000; Kleihues, Burger, & Scheithauer, 1993).  Targeting blood vessels in brain tumors 
has been a particularly attractive strategy, given the characteristic high degree of endothelial proliferation, vascular permeability, and pro- angiogenic growth -factor 
expression (for example, VEGF) (Dvorak, 2002; Sundberg, 2001) .  The approval of 
bevacizumab, which neutralizes VEGF, in May 2009 for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) represented the first new therapy for this disease in many years. A strong anti -
edema effect is clearly seen with anti -VEGF therapy in many patients. Whether this 
conveys a survival benefit is still not clear; cediranib did not improve survival over lomustine in rGBM in a recent phase III trial, and while definitive phase III studies of 
Protocl Short Title: Vascular normalization in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab 
using [11C]temozolomide PET and Vascular M RI 
08/23/[ADDRESS_1045913], recent data suggests that bevacizumab does not improve 
overall survival when given to newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients ( Lai et al ., 2010). 
 
Bevacizumab is not an effective monotherapy outside  the brain, but it is effective when 
combined with other drugs. The mechanism of this clinical efficacy is still incompletely  
understood. Anti-VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763363] 
“normalization” (Batchelor  et al., 2007;  Jain, 2005;  Willett e t al.,  2004) in many 
patients, which could improve local tumor blood flow and therefore cytotoxic 
chemotherapy delivery to the tumor. We have shown that the ‘normalization window’ of the anti -VEGF agent cediranib can be detected using serial, non-invasive MRI 
techniques in rGBM ( Batchelor  et al., 2007), and we have seen increases in blood flow
2. 
However, since anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763364], in theory these agents could potentially also inhibit drug delivery to the tumor (Jain, 2005; Jain, 2001).  An additional complication in the brain arises due to the 
presence of efflux pumps (Sharom, 2008) .  These pumps actively remove 
chemotherapeutic drugs from the brain tissue and are a key component of the blood-brain barrier. Our data from autopsy specimens obtained after cediranib suggests not only that vascular normalization has occurred but that the efflux protein P -glycoprotein 
is upregulated (di Tomaso et al, 2011)
3, which suggests that vascular normalization 
could lead to increased perfusion but decreased retention of temozolomide. If this is the case, drugs or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763365], such as radiation, might be a better strategy. A tool that could assess the true delivery of the specific therapy under consideration could integrate all these potentially conflicting and/or synergistic effects and provide a summary result.  
 
Beyond the scientific question of t he mechanisms of anti -angiogenic therapy, such a 
tool could potentially have clinical value. Because both bevacizumab and cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  are routinely administered to glioblastoma patients, there could be very 
high value to tools that could identify whether bevacizumab is changing the delivery of chemotherapy  in a given patient. This in turn could provide opportunities to personalize 
and optimize these specific treatments and dose regimens for each patient.  
 
In previous studies , an increased uptake of [
11C]temozolomide  in tumor tissue as 
compared to white and gray matter  was observed (Saleem et al, 2003). However, to  date 
it has been not possible to determine if the higher uptake was due to actual higher (specific) retention of temozolomide in tumor  tissue, or simply due to a more 
compromised blood- brain barrier in the tumor location resulting simply in a higher 
delivery of the drug.  Our novel hybrid MR -PET technology should allow us to assess if 
temozolomide delivery is indeed related to the level of blood- brain barrier disruption, as 
we will be able to quantify this disruption by [CONTACT_763371].

08/23/[ADDRESS_1045932] of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the agents administered in this study appear below and will determine whether dose delays and modifications will be made or whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition  to routine 
reporting.  
  
6.1.1 Adverse Event Lists(s) for [
11C]temozolomide  
There are no known adverse effects of [11C]temozolomide , although there are 
adver se effects of temozolomide. [11C]TMZ will be administered at >0.1 
mCi/nmol.  Assuming a maximum injection of [ADDRESS_1045933] specific 
activity, 150 nmols (29 micrograms) will be the maximum amount of the active component [11C]TMZ administered.  
   
6.1.2 Adve rse Event Lists(s) for temozolomide  
Myelosuppression (including neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia, an thrombocytopenia), has been reported inpatients receiving temozolomide and is a dose-limiting side effect. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia reach grade 2 or higher 
in up to 40% of patients on temozolomide therapy. Leukocyte/platelet nadirs usually occur in 3 weeks (about day 22) with a 5 -day schedule, although leukocyte 
nadirs may be seen slightly later (day 29). Dose -limiting thrombocytopenia has  
persisted for [ADDRESS_1045934] was lymphopenia, which reached grade 3 and grade 4 in 41% and 15%, respectively, receiving a 5 -dayschedule of temozolomide. Corresponding incidences of 
neutropenia were 2% and 4%. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 11%. The incidence of myelosuppression may be higher with the use of a dose 
intense regimen. Opportunistic infections (e.g., pneumocystis j eroveci pneumonia 
(PCP)) have been  reported with the use of temozolomide. Rarely, aplastic anemia 
and secondary leukemia have been described with temozolomide.  
Hepatic toxici ty: Mild transaminase elevations (up to 40% of patients) and 
hyperbilirubinemia (up to 19%) have been reported; increases in alkaline phosphatase have also occurred in some patients. Grade [ADDRESS_1045935] been seen rarely. There are no report ed cases of overt hepatotoxicity.

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
10.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any  dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caus ed death had it 
occurred in a more sever e form.  
Protocl Short Title: Vascular normalization in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab 
using [11C]temozolomide PET and Vascular M RI 
08/23/13  
 24 • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/o r surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital an omaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition tha t did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
 
10.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigato r’s Brochure, the package insert or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agent(s).

08/23/[ADDRESS_1045952], the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
10.1.4  Attribution  
 Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
10.[ADDRESS_1045953] or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms.   The descriptions and grading scales found in the re vised NCI Common Terminology

IRB Approval  Period  
  HRPP  Revision Date: September 17, 2015  Why is this research  being  done ? 
This research study is being done to evaluate the ability of two commonly used wound care treatments 
(Prevena Incision Management System or Dermabond) in preventing infections of a surgical groin 
incision in patients who have vascular surgery  (an operation on blood vessels) .  We will also evaluate 
the cost of each treatment.  Information from this study will help surgeons to make better decis ions 
regarding which treatment can best prevent infection .  Answers from this study can potentially save 
future patients the time and hardship associated with the additional care necessary to treat wound 
infections and may possibly lower health care costs by [CONTACT_500202].  
How long will the research last ? 
We expect that you wil l be in this research study until your first postoperative visit with your surgeon 
or his/her designee which should be between 25 -40 days following your operation.  
How many people will be studied?  
We expect about 140 people in this research study . Half will be treated with Prevena  Incision 
Management System  and the other half will be treated with Dermabond.   
What happens i f I say yes, I want to be in this research ? 
If you agree to be a part of this study , your surgeon will perform the operation on your blood vessels 
exactly as if you were not part of the study. At the end of your operation, the treatment used to prevent 
infection of your groin incision will be chosen by [CONTACT_3364], like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin  instead of by [CONTACT_500203] . Each of these treatment s is commonly used and the surgeons participating in this study have 
had much experience with both . Your chances of getting Prevena  Incision Management System  or 
Dermbond will be equal. Both you and your surgeon will know which tre atment you received. Prevena  
is Incision Management S ystem  is made up of a dressing  that is placed on the incision to cover and 
protect it from  bacteria in the surrounding area . The dressing is connected with a small tube to a 
lightweight battery powered remote which creates a vacuum like seal that helps  to remove any fluids 
from the incision which can cause infection . The Prevena Incision Management S ystem must be used 
for at least [ADDRESS_644177] and

What are my respons ibilities if I take part in this research?  
If you take part in this research  and are chosen to receive The Prevena  Incision Management S ystem, 
you, a family member or helper  may be responsible  for caring for the device if you are discharged 
from the hospit al before the device is  ready to be  removed. If this happens, you and your family/helper 
will be taught how to care for the device, given written instructions and the name [CONTACT_500206] a 
contact [CONTACT_500204] .  
What happens if I do not want to be in this research?  
Your participation in this research study is completely voluntary. You may cho ose not to enroll in this 
study and it will not affect the care that you receive. At the completion of  your operation, your surgeon 
will decide which wound treatment to use rather than the decision being made by [CONTACT_3364].  
What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?  
You can change your mind right up to the time that your surgery is to be completed and it will not be 
held against you.  Your care will be the same regardless of your participat ion in the study and there will  
be no consequence of withdrawing. If the Prevena Incisio n Manageme nt System has been used, you 
have the right at any time following surgery to ask that it be removed after thorough discussion with 
your surgeon. Premature removal of the system may be associated with increased risk of infection.  
Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me ? 
  Both Prevena  Incision Management System  and Derma bond are current wound treatments  that are 
used commonly to prevent infection of surgical incisions, so the risks of particip ating in this study 
beyond those routin ely associated with an operation on blood vessels requiring groin incision are 
minimal. There are no additional psychological, legal, social or economic risks associated with this 
study. Taking part in this research study will lead to no additional costs t o you .  You and your 
insurance company will be charged for the health care services that you would ordinarily be 
responsible to pay. Allergic reaction which is uncommon for either Prevena  Incision Management 
system or Dermabond may be a potential risk. T o minimize this risk you will not be able to participate 
if you have a  known allergy to adhesives, formald ehyde, cyancoacetate or silver. Loss of 
privacy/ confidentiality  is an unlikely  but possible risk . We will take every effort to assure 
confidentiality.  You will be assigned a study number which we will use to identify all i nformation that 
we collect about you. This  information will be recorded on a case report form  and kept in a locked 
cabinet . Your name [CONTACT_500207] o n the case report form.

a separate locked cabinet in the study coordinator’s office. Information that w e collect will also be

Will being in this study help me in any way ? 
We cannot promise any benefits to you from your taking part in  this research. However,  information 
obtained from this study may help to determine the best way to prevent infection of groin incisions 
after surgery.  This  may benefit you if you require future surgery on the blood vessels in the groin, and 
would benefit  future patients , surgeons  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500194], expense and hardship 
associated with treating groin infections.  
What happens to the information collect ed for the research ? 
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal  inform ation, including your 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500195] , to people who have a need to review 
this information . We cannot promise complete  privacy . Monitors or auditors  from the sponsor  
(Acelity) , the Institutional Review Board ( IRB), will be granted direct access to your medical records 
to conduct and oversee the research. By [CONTACT_189189].  We may 
publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name [CONTACT_147300] . A description of this clinical trial will be available on 
http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information 
that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a s ummary of the results. You can se arch this 
Web site at any time.  Federal law provides additional protections of your medical records and related 
health information . These are described in  the HIPAA section of this  document.  
Can I be removed from the resear ch without my OK ? 
 Although unlikely , the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_500196]. Possible reasons for removal would include your failure to see your surgeon for 
follow -up within 25 -40 days after your operation.  
What else do I need to know?    
This research is being funded by [CONTACT_500205]. Although it is very unlikely that you would be injured from taking part in this study, it is 
important th at you tell your study doctor if you feel that you have been injured because of participating 
in this study.  You can tell the doctor in person or call.  You will get medical treatment if you are 
injured as a result of taking part in this study.  Your study  doctor will explain the treatment options to 
you and tell yo u where you can get treatment. Generally, this care will be billed to you, your insurance 
or other third party . Buffalo General Medical Center, Kaleida Health  has no program to pay for 
medical ca re for research -related injury.   
You will not be paid for participating in this study.  
 If you are interested in learning the results of the study you may contact [CONTACT_9137] . This 
study is expected to take place during 2016. Results are not li kely to be available until June of  2017.

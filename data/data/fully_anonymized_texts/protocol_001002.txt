AQUARESIS UTILITY FOR HYPON ATREMIC ACUTE HEART FAILURE (AQUA -AHF) STUDY  
Protocol #  HS-13-[ADDRESS_159861] -based regimen to a loop diuretic -based regimen for 
hyponatremic heart failure patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140855].  
2. Compare the safety (renal function, electrolyte abnormalities, and 
hemodynamics)  of vasopressin receptor antagonist -based to a loop 
diuretic -based regimen  for hyponatremic heart failure patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140856].  
 
Interventions  1. Tolvaptan (with rescue loop diuretic or metolazone).  
2. Furosemide (with rescue m etolazone)  
 
Eligible patients will be randomized within 48 hours of presentation to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Tolvaptan will be dosed initially at 30 mg daily, with the option to 
titrate up to a maximum of 60mg daily.  Furosemide will be initiated as a 
continuous infu sion at 5mg/h, with the option to titrate higher.  Monotherapy 
with the study medication must be continued fo r at least the first 24 hours.   If 
after 24 hours the diuretic response is deemed inadequate, the dose of study 
medication may be increased and/or  the use of additional diuretic agents may 
be initiated at the discretion of the treating physician.   Physicians will be 
encouraged to increase the primary study drug before the use of additional 
diuretic agents as clinically acceptable.

In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140859] (ICU and total)  
 
Statistical Plan  A total of 50 patients (25 in each group) would provide 93% power to detect a 
difference of 50% in urine output at 24 hours between treatments, alpha=0.05.  
The power was calculated based on the magnitude of difference in urine output 
seen in the ACTIV -CHF (24 hour mean urine output for tolvaptan was 
approximately 4100±2100mL vs 2300±1100mL compared to placebo when 
added to standard therapy) and in the Udelson et al study (24 hour mean 
increase in urine output with tolvaptan monotherapy 2600±1500mL vs 
900±8 50mL with furosemide).  Based on our previous data demonstrating poor 
response to loop diuretics in the hyponatremia acute HF population, we believe 
AQUA- AHF Study Protocol  
PIs: Ng T  and Elkayam U  
 
Page 4 
 a 50% difference (standard deviation of 25%) is a reasonable and conservative 
estimate of what the differen ce will likely be.     
 
Descriptive statistics will be computed for each treatment group. For all 
comparative analyses between the two treatment groups, independent 
samples t -test and Chi -Square test (or Fisher’s exact test) will be performed for 
continuou s variables or categorical variables, respectively.  If either the 
normality or equal- variance assumptions underlying the traditional t -tests are 
violated, a non -parametric test will be used.  
 
Amendment August 9, 2017:  
Due to slow enrollment, we anticipate  not achieving our desired sample size of 
[ADDRESS_159864] deviation between groups (e.g. 
mean difference is 1000 ±1000mL), our power will be between 80 -90% with a 
sample size between [ADDRESS_159865] 34 subjects, which should allow 
the results to be meaningful despi[INVESTIGATOR_140860].

Page [ADDRESS_159869] commonly encountered electrolyte abnormalities in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138592] .1-5 In clinical practice, hyponatremia is usually defined as serum sodium of ≤ 135 mmol/L  
(mEq/L). Although hyponatremia is commonplace in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103139], the true incidence of this 
condition r emains poorly characterized.  Zilberberg and colleagues in a retrospective cohort study of 
over 190,000 patients reported a 5.5% incidence of hyponatremia at the point of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].[ADDRESS_159870] that the incidence may be as high as 15%.[ADDRESS_159871] reported mortality in hyponatremic patients ranging from 5 -51% 
depending on study design and serum sodium cut - offs. One prospective observational, case controlled 
study found that mortality of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140861] 27% compared to 9% in 
normonatremic patients.7  This study also found that patients with hyponatremia had higher serum 
creatinine  concentrations  and longer length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140862].  Zilberberg et. al. 
also foun d a higher in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140863] (5.9%) compared to 
normonatremic patients (3%).6  In addition, even mild hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration 
between 130 -134 mEq/L) may be detrimental, increasing in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140864] 37% compared to 
those with normonatremia.2  It remains unclear why hyponatremia is associated with increased 
mortalit y.  It is hypothesized that hyponatremia may be a signal for important physiologic abnormalities 
in patients with cardiovascular diseases, or a predictor of other severe consequence associated with 
sodium irregularities such as cerebral edema.2 
 
1.2 Hyponatremia and H eart Failure Outcomes  
Heart failure (HF) patients are especially prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_140865]. Several retrospective 
analyses have reported the prevalence of hyponatremia in the chronic HF population to be 19.7 -27% 
based on admission serum sodium concentration s.8-[ADDRESS_159872] suggested 
that hyponatremia in HF is associated with increased length of stay, morbidity, and mortality.8-12 In the 
OPTIMIZE -HF registry, lower admission sodium (<135 mmol/L) was associated with higher in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77087] (6.0% vs. 3.2%), longer length of stay (6.4 days vs. 5.5 days), and 60- 90 day mortality (12.4% vs. 
7.1%) compared to normal admission sodium.  For each 3 mmol/L decrease in admission sodium below 
140 mmol/L, the risk of in -hosp ital mortality was increased by 19.5% in patients with left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and by 8.6% in patients with non -LVSD.[ADDRESS_159873] baseline serum sodium (median < 134 mmol/L) experienced longer length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and higher in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 60 -day mortality. Consistent with the results from OPTIMIZE -
HF, each 3 mmol/L decrease in admission sodium values was associated with an 18% relative increase in 
the probability of death within [ADDRESS_159874] that a 
significant proportion of normonatre mic patients on admission also developed hyponatremia during  
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  This study found a 15.9% incidence of acute hyponatremia, although the association

PIs: Ng T  and Elkayam U  
 
Page [ADDRESS_159875] a mark er of disease severity . The ACTIV in CHF trial 
suggested that correction of hyponatremia was associated with a survival advantage. The 60 -day 
mortality among patients with serum sodium levels that improved was 11.1% compared to 21.7% in 
those with persiste nt hyponatremia.[ADDRESS_159876] importance during the acute management of 
HF i.e. influenc ing responses to treatment.  One concern related to the p harmacologic management of 
acute HF is the development of hypotension.  Data from ADHERE, a registry of acute HF patients, 
demonstrated that low systolic blood pressure is an independent predictor of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].15  
Hyponatremia may predispose patients to hypotension.  In the OPTIME -CHF study, sustained 
hypotension defined as a low systolic blood pressure for > [ADDRESS_159877] quartile of serum sodium (132 -135 mEq/L).8  We also 
demonstrated that hyponatremia was associated with an increased risk of sustained hypotension  in our 
acute HF patient population .14 
 
Another  major concern in the management of acute HF is diuretic resistance.  Patients on chronic loop 
diuretic therapy may fail to respond to escalating doses of diuretics.  One proposed mechanism is the 
routine use of diuretics , which promotes the excretion of sodium, leads to the development or 
exacerbation of hyponatremia.13,16 Decreased sodium delivery to the kidney as a result of the decreased 
plasma sodium concentration would stimulate the macula densa to release renin, thereby [CONTACT_140883] -angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS). This increase in RAAS activation may lead to further 
vasoconstriction  and water retention, essentially counteracting the desired diuretic effect.  In support of 
this contention, we’ve recently shown that acute or chronic hyponatremia, especially <130 mEq/L, was 
associated with higher loop diuretic dose requirements and more  frequent need for escalation of the 
diuretic regimen to achieve the same level of diuresis as normornatremic HF patients.14  Severity of 
hyponatremia was also associated with a greater than two -fold increase in the incidence of diuretic 
resistance, acute worsening renal function, sustained hypotension, increased length of stay, and in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].  Our study results raised two important questions: 1) whether correction of 
hyponatremia can preven t or lower the risk of complications with conventional diuretics and 2) whether 
alternative treatments such as aquaretics (i.e. vasopressin receptor antagonists) represent a superior 
treatm ent modality for these patients.    
 
1.[ADDRESS_159878] clearly demonstrated the efficacy of tolvaptan for 
augmenting diuresis when  administered in combination with furosemide for the management of 
congestive HF symptoms.17-22  In addition, tolvaptan was also associated with a favorable safety profile, 
devoid of significant effects on serum electrolytes and incidence of acutely worsening renal function.  
The potenti al for tolvaptan to be used as an alternative to furosemide was recently considered in a 
study by [CONTACT_140884].23  Eighty -three patients with stable NYHA FC II -III systolic HF and evidence of 
congestive symptoms were randomized to tolvaptan 30mg, furosemide 80mg, or the combination for 7  
days.   Tolvaptan was associated with a significantly greater daily urine output (approximately 
1700mL/24h greater than furosemide monotherapy) and decrease in body weight compared to 
furosemide or the combination.   Importantly, this study did not evaluate patients in an acute 
AQUA- AHF Study Protocol  
PIs: Ng T  and Elkayam U  
 
Page [ADDRESS_159879] common electrolyte abnormality in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].1,3  Hyponatremia, 
based on admission values, has been associated with higher in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], 60 -day mortality, 
longer length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and requirement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394].2,4,5  Similar findings are 
applicable to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140866].8-11  However despi[INVESTIGATOR_140867], the importance of 
hyponatremia to influence acute treatment decisions in acute HF remains equivocal due to a lack of 
data.  Importantly, we've recen tly shown that moderate to severe hyponatremia, especially <130 mEq/L, 
was associated with higher loop diuretic dose requirements and more frequent need for escalation of 
the diuretic regimen to achieve the same level of diuresis as normornatremic patients .14  Severity of 
hyponatremia was also associated with a greater than two -fold increase in the incidence of diuretic 
resistance, acute worsening renal function, sustained hypotension, increased length of stay, and in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].  Our study results raised two important questions: 1) whether correction of 
hyponatremia can prevent or lower the risk of complications with conventional diuretics and 2) whether 
alternative treatments such as aquaretics  (i.e. vasopressin receptor antagonists) represent a superior 
treatment modality for these patients?  Data from small subgroups of hyponatremic patients in the 
EVEREST and ACTIV -CHF studies indicated that tolvaptan is effective at raising serum sodium and urine 
output in these patients.20,[ADDRESS_159880] on 
urine volume and weight loss than a fixed dose of furosemide in stable NYHA FC II -III systolic HF 
patients.23  However, these were not acutely decompensated patients, and a fixed dose of tolvaptan was 
being compare d to fixed dose oral furosemide.  Therefore, there is a critical need to evaluate the role of 
aquaresis with tolvaptan as an acute treatment modality for acute HF complicated by [CONTACT_140885] .  
These patients pose a particularly difficult challenge when att empting to gain effective diuresis with 
loop diuretics.  The purpose  of the current study is to prospectively evaluate the comparative efficacy 
and safety of a tolvaptan -based diuretic regimen compared to conventional diuresis with a furosemide -
based regim en on short -term clinical and treatment outcomes in hyponatremic acute HF patients.  Both 
reduced and preserved left ventricular systolic function patients will be studied.  
 
The following are the study objectives:  
1. Compare urine output and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l stay between a vasopressin receptor antagonist -based 
regimen to a loop diuretic -based regimen for hyponatremic heart failure patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140868].  
2. Compare the safety (renal function, electrolyte abnormalities, hemodynamics , neurohormonal 
activation ) of vasopressin receptor antagonist -based to a loop diuretic -based regimen for 
hyponatremic heart failure patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140869].

Page [ADDRESS_159888] prognostic importance in acute HF and is a more stable 
marker of glomerular filtration rate compared to serum creatinine .  These additional laboratory 
assessments will be obtained to provide a more complete pathophysiologic model for the safety 
comparison between the two treatment groups.  
 
4.2.1 Assessments of Investigational Laboratory Parameters  
Blood samples will be obtained for analysis of cystatin C, plasma renin activity, and copeptin A at 
baseline, 24 hours and 96 hours .  Urine sam ples will be collected and stored for potential future analysis 
of renal injury markers.  
 
4.2.2 Performance of Investigational Laboratory Parameter Assays  
The investigational laboratory assessments (cystatin C and plasma renin activity) will be outsourced to 
Quest Diagnostics.  Copeptin A will be determined using a commercially available immunoassay (Brahms 
Copeptin Immunoassay, Thermofisher Scientific, Middleton, VA) . 
 
5. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
 
5.1 Definitions  
Acute worsening of kidney function will  be defined as an increase in Scr of 0.3 mg/dL or 25% above 
baseline (Scr at time of randomization).  
 
Electrolyte abnormalities will be defined as an occurrence of a laboratory value beyond the upper or 
lower limit of normal as defined by [CONTACT_8236]’s  laboratory standards (hypokalemia K+<3.5  mEq/L , 
hypomagnesemia Mg2+<1.7  mEq/L , hypernatremia Na+>145  mEq/L ) 
 
Serum sodium overcorrection will be defined as the occurrence of an increase in serum Na+ > 8 mEq/L in 
8 hours or > 12 mEq/L in 24 hours.  For each event, a ny new neurologic sequelae (dysarthria, mutism,  
dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma and death)  of 
overc orrection will also be recorded , otherwise the subject will be noted to be asymptomatic.  
 
Hypotens ion will be defined as a systolic blood pressure reading < 80 mmHg (confirmed by [CONTACT_140888]) or a systolic blood pressure < [ADDRESS_159889] death during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140873].  
 
Safety Information will be collected in accordance with the current Code of Federal Regulations.   
AQUA- AHF Study Protocol  
PIs: Ng T  and Elkayam U  
 
Page 16 
  
Safety information is defined as “Any information from any source containing information ” such as:  
• Adverse event or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_140874]  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Overdose, abuse, misuse (even without resulting adverse reaction)  
• Medication error  
• Exposure during pregnancy or lactation (including uneventful)  and reports where the embryo or 
fetus may have been exposed to medicinal product s (either through maternal exposure or 
transmission of a medicinal product via semen following paternal exposure)  
• Counterfeit product  
• Transfer of infectious disease by [CONTACT_123276]  
• Product complaint report which includes medically important information  
• Pediatric use  
• Occupational exposure   
• Off-label use  
 
5.2 Reporting  
Study subjects will be continuously monitored during the trial for the development of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events which were not present at the time of randomization  in accordance with the 
current Code of Federal Regulations .  This information will be obtained through examination of the 
patient, laboratory work -up, and discussion with the patient and/or nursing staff.  All adverse events will 
be record ed and assessed for severity .  Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours to 
Otsuka  (IRAE.Receipt@otsuka- us.com ), and the Food and Drug Administration AERS via the Medwatch 
website (Form 3500).  
 
Otsuka will be notified of any adverse events or  other safety information arising out of or relating to 
your study in accordance with the following timeline:  
(a) Twenty -four (24) hours from Date of First Receipt for Serious AE’s. (defined below );  
A serious adverse event includes any event that results in any of the following outcomes:  death, is life -
threatening (opi[INVESTIGATOR_140875]), persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908], c ongenital 
anomaly/birth defect, other medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above; or  
(b) Three (3) working days for pregnancy cases; or  
(c) End of study for non -serious adverse events or during the study upon Otsuka’s request.  
(d) At least two (2) weeks prior to submission of an aggregate safety report.  
 
AQUA- AHF Study Protocol  
PIs: Ng T  and Elkayam U  
 
Page 17 
 A line -by-line listing of all serious adverse events will be sent once fifty percent (50%) enrollment is 
reached and at the end -of-study in order for Otsuka Safety & Pharmacovigilance to perform a 
reconciliation.    
 
The estimated start date for this study is August 15th, 2013.  Data collection will be consid ered complete 
once the final study subject has been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   This event is estimated to occur 
January 15th, 2015.  A study report will be finalized within one year of the end of data collection.  
 
6. Statistical Analysis  
 
6.1 Sample Si ze Calculation and Power Analysis  
A total of 50 patients (25 in each group) would provide 93% power to detect a difference of 50% in urine 
output at 24 hours between treatments, alpha=0.05.  The power was calculated based on the magnitude 
of difference in urine output seen in the ACTIV- CHF20 (24 hour mean urine output for tolvaptan was 
approximately 4100±2100mL vs 2300±1100mL compared to placebo when added to standard therapy ) 
and in th e Udelson et al23 study (24 hour m ean increase in urine output with tolvaptan monotherapy 
2600± 1500mL vs 900±850 mL with furosemide) .  Based on our previous data demonstrating poor 
response to loop diuretics in the hyponatremia acute HF population, we believe a 50% difference  
(standard devi ation of 25%)  is a reasonable and conservative estimate of what the difference will likely 
be.     
 
Amendment August 9, 2017:  
Due to slow enrollment, we anticipate not achieving our desired sample size of [ADDRESS_159890] 
deviation between groups (e.g. mean difference is 1000 ±1000mL), our power will be between 80 -90% 
with a sample size between [ADDRESS_159891] (or Fisher’s exact test) will be 
performed for continuous variables or categorical variables, respectively.  If either the normality or 
equal -variance assumptions underlying the traditional t -tests are violated, a non -parametric test will be 
used.  
  
7. Risk Analysis  
  
7.1 Data Safety Monitoring  
The principal investigators will be responsible for monitoring adverse events which may occur during the 
course of the study, and determine if the benefit to risk of amending study procedures or continuing the 
study is appropriate in order to mitigate any unforeseen risks.

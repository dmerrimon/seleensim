Peak Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1901] (PIF) in COPD Protocol ID: [ADDRESS_1269784] Michigan  Final Protocol Nov 11, 2020  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Document Updated April 3, 2023    
Peak Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1901] (PIF) in COPD Protocol ID: [ADDRESS_1269785] Michigan  Scientific Rationale/ Background Inhaled medications are the cornerstone of therapy for respi[INVESTIGATOR_904636], delivering medication directly to the organ of concern and allowing for reduced systemic exposures and side effects of needed drugs. Since medication delivery to the lungs is essential for this form of therapy, the delivery device chosen plays a critical role in the effectiveness of these medications.  Multiple factors can lead to ineffective handheld inhaler drug delivery, including components unique to how the drug is compounded, unique characteristics of each delivery device and various individual patient limitations (e.g cognitive impairment, mechanical usage difficulties in patients with arthritis and neuromuscular diseases, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_357058]).   Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are one of the most common handheld delivery systems used by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_904637]. Importantly, they are breath actuated, which helps many patents with timing and ease of device use. However, DPIs require a certain level of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904638].   Failure of effective drug delivery will lead to failure of whatever clinical outcome for which an inhaled device is being used. It has recently been suggested that a low peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PIF) during DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904639]. Indeed, a subset of patients with low PIF in an observational hospi[INVESTIGATOR_904640] a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904641]. However, other investigators have observed that a low PIF is a minor clinical problem in outpatients and inpatients with COPD. Overall, specific information about how PIF measurements are made and how they relate to therapeutic and clinical responses in the use of DPIS for COPD patients is lacking.  Peak Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1901] (PIF) Ohm’s law defines the relationship between inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65168], inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904642]. For any given resistance, the level of airflow generated is directly dependent on the pressure gradient across the resistance. In the case of DPIs, each device has a defined fixed resistance. Thus, the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904643]. The inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904644], in turn, depends on the degree of effort applied by [CONTACT_102], the manner in which the effort is performed and any medical conditions that might reduce or limit a patient’s capabilities to generate an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904645] (even with a maximal effort). 
 Identifying the level of effort required to properly use a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904646], each having different resistances and varying instructions for how to inhale when using the device. Clinical patient data is limited related to the degree of effort and flow needed by a patient for effective drug delivery for any given DPI, with even less known about the clinical consequences of inadequate DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904647].  Various patient characteristics have been suggested that might predict patients with risk for poor inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904648], including female gender, short stature, severe airflow limitation and lung hyperinflation. However, none of these are sensitive and specific enough to prospectively identify patients in a clinical situation who may not be able to effectively use a DPI.   Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904649] a part of spi[INVESTIGATOR_904650] a DPI.  However, airflows measured during spi[INVESTIGATOR_904651] a large bore mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_904652] a resistance typi[INVESTIGATOR_274867] a DPI.   InCheck Dial Device Recently, it has been suggested that the InCheck Dial, a device originally designed to train and coach patients on how to use their inhalers correctly, might be used to determine whether a patient’s peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PIF) is sufficient for effective DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904653], by [CONTACT_904696][INVESTIGATOR_904654] a resistance appropriate to the DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904655]. It has also been suggested that there may be a suboptimal PIF below which effective medication delivery from a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904656], leading to a risk of a lower clinical effectiveness. A minimal or critical PIF has also been suggested, below which no medication is effectively delivered. Since DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904657], measured PIF will vary based on the resistance against which it was measured, with implications for suboptimal and minimal PIF changing accordingly. Nevertheless, the concept of suboptimal PIF as a tool to help identify patients who might not be able to effectively use a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904658].  PIF Measurement Technique Before any diagnostic tool can be used in clinical practice, it must meet criteria showing the robustness of the test and defining any limitations that the test may have. Ideally, test sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) should be determined. In the case of PIF, none of these qualities have been determined to date.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_904659], it has been suggested that a PIF of <60 l/min is suboptimal and a PIF <30 l/min is minimal for DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904647]. Recommendations about the use of PIF to dictate device selection has also been made based on these results.    
Critical questions remain for PIF, including at what resistance it should be measured and exactly how the PIF effort should be performed. To be most meaningful, the effort should mimic the effort used when the patient inhales with their DPI, which should match the effort recommended by [CONTACT_904697] [INVESTIGATOR_904660], and the outcome measured should relate to the expected clinical response desired for the medication being used.  Common variables that change with patient inspi[INVESTIGATOR_904661], speed, depth and duration of the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_21266]. Each can change the pressure applied to the DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904662]. By [CONTACT_108], one might assume that PIF would best be measured as a maximal effort, since it is “peak”.  However, to achieve such a “peak” measurement, one needs to inhale with a very sharp, rapid, intense effort starting from residual volume (RV).  Although breathing down to RV provides maximal stretch of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_904663], breathing down to RV can be difficult. Lesser degrees of forced exhalation prior to a PI[INVESTIGATOR_904664] a lower “PIF” measurement, even when otherwise performing a sharp, maximal efforts. On the other hand, a sharp, maximal effort may give a “peak” inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], but might not be able to effectively performed during routine DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904665]. An intense “peak” effort could also lead to increased oropharyngeal drug impaction, reducing the amount of medication delivered to the lower airways.   What level of reproducible effort is needed to provide a reliable PIF measurement is also uncertain. Three efforts has been suggested, but the variability allowed between efforts and whether the best or average PI[INVESTIGATOR_904666]. These decisions become critically important when performing “effort-dependent” testing, since variable submaximal efforts will give inadequate results and could inappropriately define a patient with a “suboptimal” PIF when, in fact, they are fully capable of inhaling sufficiently to use a DPI.  Study Purpose The purpose of this research is to determine whether PIF is clinically important when using the Ellipta DPI [INVESTIGATOR_16897]. In addition, the study will validate the best/most clinically appropriate way to perform a PIF maneuver, to determine the testing capabilities of the preferred PIF maneuver and to relate this PIF measurement to meaningful clinical outcomes in COPD patients.  Hypothesis  A standardized method for determining PI[INVESTIGATOR_904667] • to determine if low PIF is a meaningful clinical problem in patients with COPD using the Ellipta DPI • to identify what clinical features predict a risk of inadequate response to an inhaled medication delivered by [CONTACT_904698] • to detect the presence, prevalence and risk of low PIF in patients with COPD • to identify what clinical features in COPD patients may predict a lower PIF

Thus, the measurement of an acute bronchodilator response after delivering a long acting bronchodilator may not identify whether a medication has been effectively delivered to a patient.  • However, if a long acting bronchodilator has not been effectively delivered to the lung, then subsequent delivery of a short acting bronchodilator should produce a significant additional bronchodilator response. On the other hand, if a long acting bronchodilator has been effectively delivered to the lung, then subsequent delivery of a short acting bronchodilator should not produce any further significant bronchodilation.    • Based on this rationale, comparison of the acute bronchodilator response to a short acting bronchodilator after receiving a long acting should identify whether drug delivery is ineffective in a selected patient population, irrespective of baseline FEV1 and of any partial response to the long acting bronchodilator. Comparison of the short acting bronchodilator measurement between patient groups with differing PIF thresholds should identify whether PIF has an impact of drug delivery of a long acting bronchodilator via a DPI. • Open label design comparing the acute bronchodilator response after delivery of a long acting bronchodilator via Ellipta DPI [INVESTIGATOR_904674], suboptimal and minimal PIF.

However, a comparative study between Anoro and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_904681] a 1 sided 2.5% significance level with a within subject standard deviation of 140 ml and a 90% power to detect [ADDRESS_1269803] deviation for short-acting bronchodilator after long acting bronchodilator in COPD patients with an FEV1 <50% predicted likely has a smaller FEV1 standard deviation, the projected numbers to determine non-inferiority in this study are too large to be obtained by a single center.   We therefore propose this study as an observational and an exploratory study that will likely be underpowered for meaningful comparison. Noninferiority and subsequent superiority will be assed within the study to provide estimates for potential future evaluations. Our proposed numbers are in line with previously reported studies that have been used for current recommendations for suboptimal and minimal PIF measures. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_904682], we believe this information will provide significant added information about PIF and the use of the Ellipta device.  Limitations Statistical limitations as described above. The challenge of finding subjects with a PIF of <60 l/min in outpatient COPD patients (estimated at <20% of severe/very severe COPD patients).

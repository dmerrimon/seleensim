Section 3.3.1: 
Dose 
Escalation 
procedure 
 
The dose escalation criteria and optimal dose 
are clarified.
 
If two of the first 3 patients in a cohort 
experience a DLT, that dose level will be 
defined as exceeding MTD, no further dose 
es
calation will occur.
 
 
The previous dose level 
will be considered the MTD and will be 
expanded to further elucidate safety, to define 
PK, and to evaluate efficacy.
 
An optimal dose is defined as the threshold dose 
at which the study drug is clinically active
 
/ 
efficacious (shows complete response or partial 
response) in a specific disease population and is 
at or below the maximum tolerated dose.
 
The dose escalation 
criteria and optimal dose 
are clarified as requested 
by [CONTACT_206830] (CRC) o
f 
MDACC.

The DRG will continue to monitor toxicity for 
serious adverse events as well as for toxicity 
trends that may be of concern at interval of 3 
months from initiation of expansion cohort 
to 
completion of the study. Toxicity will be 
monitored across cohorts combined together, as 
the expansion will be done at the specific dose 
(either MTD or optimal dose).
 
Frequency of monitoring 
safety in expansion cohort 
is clarified as requested by 
[CONTACT_206831] (CRC) of 
MDACC.

kinases (PI3Ks) are pi[INVESTIGATOR_206777], cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking 
and immunity. The delta (δ) and gamma (γ) isoforms of PI3K are highly expressed 
in cells of hematopoietic
 
origin, and often dysregulated in various hematologic 
malignancies. Because these isoforms contribute to the development, maintenance, 
transformation, and proliferation of immune cells, dual targeting of PI3K δ and γ

a novel, highly specific dual PI3K δ/γ inhibitor with nanomolar inhibitory potency 
at the enzyme and cellular level. Besides, RP6530 
is 
effective in inhibiting Akt 
phosphorylation and inducing apoptosis in various l
ymphoma and leukemic
 
cell 
lines and patient derived primary CTCL cells.

Phase I Dose Escalation:
 
Sequential dose escalation will begin with Cohort 1. A minimum of three patients 
of either CTCL or PTCL will be entered into each opened dose level 
(
cohort
)
.  The 
first cohort of patients will receive RP6530 at 
2
00 mg twice 
a 
da
y (BID
).  Dose 
levels will b
e increased in successive increments according to the dose escalation 
scheme in the Table below
. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD/optiomal 
dose has been identified or as determined by [CONTACT_206834], PK and/or efficacy dat
a. Dose determination will be documented 
appropriately.

Statistical 
Methodology:
 
 
This is an open
-
label, dose
-
escalation study to determine the MTD (or 
recommended dose based on available safety, PK and response data) to 
support of 
dose determination for further clinical studies, and preliminary information on the 
safety profile; and to evaluate PK profile and
 
anti
-
tumor activity of RP6530 given 
as a single agent in patients with T
-
cell lymphoma. 
 
This trial will enroll ap
proximately 58 patients. The actual number of dose 
escalations will depend upon the MTD/optimal dose (or recommended dose).
 
Biomarker 
Assessments:
 
During the treatment blood samples will be taken for exploratory evaluation of 
relevant biomarkers.  The ana
lyses for biomarkers are exploratory, and will not be 
used to guide treatment decisions.  The results may be pooled with data from other 
studies to generate hypotheses to be tested in future studies.

INTRODUCTION
 
1.1
 
Background
 
 
Phosphoinositide
-
3 kinase (PI3K) 
belongs to a class of intracellular lipid kinases that 
phosphorylate the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphoinositide lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (PIs) 
generating lipid second messengers. While α and β isoforms are ubiquitous in their distribution, 
expres
sion of δ and γ is restricted to circulating hematogenous cells and endothelial cells
. 
 
 
The scientific evidence for PI3K involvement, in particular the δ and γ isoforms in various cellular 
processes stems from studies using small molecule inhibitors and g
ene
-
targeting approaches. 
Although PI3Kδ expression has been assigned to B
-
cells and PI3Kγ is associated with T
-
lymphocytes and neutrophils, there appears to be a significant synergy rather than a redundancy 
between the two isoforms in various leukemias an
d lymphomas. In addition dual inhibition is 
expected to result in better targeted destruction of abnormal lymphocytes. In relapsed/refractory 
T
-
cell lymphomas for instance, blockade of the PI3K δ/γ isoforms at clinically achievable 
concentrations could pot
entially prevent T
-
cell activation/proliferation and alteration of tumor 
microenvironment with the former attributed to the γ and the latter to the δ isoform. Simultaneous 
inhibition of PI3K δ/γ isoforms was shown to prolong survival in a mouse model of T
-
cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. Dual targeting of PI3K δ/γ therefore is strongly implicated as an 
intervention strategy in leukemias/lymphomas that are hard to treat by [CONTACT_206839]
-
inflammatory potential that helps modulate 
the tumor microenvironment.
 
 
Many PI3K inhibitors are in clinical development including PI3K δ specific inhibitor 
Idelalisib 
(by [CONTACT_10866]
; now approved by [CONTACT_206840]
)
1
-
6
 
and PI3K δ and γ inhibitor IPI
-
145 (by 
[CONTACT_206841])
[ADDRESS_246665] reported ALT/AST elevation and 
neutropenia as major side effects, IPI
-
[ADDRESS_246666] PI3K δ and γ isoforms. Based on the 28
-
day tolerability studies in rat and dog, 
monitoring of liver
 
and 
thyroid
 
parameters 
is advised since these were 
the
 
major target organs 
noted 
du
ring repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs.
 
 
1.2
 
RP6530
 
RP6530 is a highly specific and orally available dual PI3K δ
/
γ inhibitor with nanomolar inhibitory 
potency and several fold selectivity over the 
α and β
 
PI3K isoforms.  Chemically, RP6530 is an 
isoflavone substituted adenine. 
 
The specificity of RP6530 towards PI3K δ and γ is evidenced by >1000 and >100 fold selecti
vity 
over α and β isoforms in an enzyme based assay.  PI3K δ and γ isoforms are expressed in 
hematopoietic cells and contribute to their development, maintenance, transformation and 
proliferation. Although PI3K δ expression has been assigned to B
-
cells whi
le PI3K γ is associated 
with T
-
lymphocytes and neutrophils, there appears to be a significant synergy rather than a 
redundancy between the two isoforms in various leukemia’s and lymphomas.
 
Dual targeting of 
PI3K δ/γ therefore is strongly implicated as an i
ntervention strategy in leukemia/lymphomas that 
are hard to treat by [CONTACT_206842]. 
 
 
Protocol No. RP6530
-
[ADDRESS_246667] human PI3K δ and γ was evaluated in a HTRF based enzyme assay in 
the 
presence of 100 µM ATP
.
 
Selectivity over the other two isoforms, namely, α, and β were also 
determined
8
-
11
.  Data demonstrated the specificity of RP6530 towards PI3K δ and γ with >[ZIP_CODE] 
and >100
-
fold selectivity over α and β i
soforms, indicating that the primary mode of action of this 
compound is via dual inhibition of the δ and γ isoforms (Figure 1).  Functional selectivity of 
RP6530 in a 245 Kinase Panel
12
 
indicated >50 fold selectivity over oth
er tyrosine and 
serine/threonine kinases.
 
 
Cellular specificity towards PI3Kδ and γ was determined in an anti
-
IgM induced human B cell 
proliferation
13
 
and complement component 5a (c5a) induced pAKT in RAW macrophages
14
 
wherein potency of RP6530 was equivalent to the enzyme assay. PI3K α or β
-

phosphorylation of AKT by [CONTACT_206843]
-
derived growth factor (PDGF)
15
 
or lysophosphotidic acid
16
 
in 
3T3 fibroblasts mediated through α or β, isoforms of PI3K was determined by [CONTACT_137430]. 
Results were in line with enzyme inhibition data with the fold
-
selectivity being maintained for α 
and β (Figure 2).

Proliferation of immortalized T and B

(Table 1)
. Cells were incubated with RP6530 for different time
-
periods (72 
-
96 h) based on their doubl
ing time.  Data demonstrated the ability of RP6530 to inhibit 
leukemic cell proliferation albeit with different potencies based on the cell type. 
 
 
Overall, a 50% growth inhibition for majority of B, T, and monocytic cell lines was achieved at a 
concentration between 0.[ADDRESS_246668] of RP6530 on AKT phosphorylation

an

(Figure

effects of PI3K activity and modulates several cell processes including survival and growth.

Toxicology
 
 
To assess the
 
safety and 
toxicity 
of
 
RP6530
 
a
 
28
-
day repeat dose 
study with a 14
-
day recovery 
period 
was conducted in 
Rat
 
and 
beagle 
dogs, to evaluate the potential reversibility of findings and 
to support the use in humans.
 
 
 
Once daily oral administration (by [CONTACT_206846]) of RP6530 was well tolerated in rat at dose levels of 
5, 20, and 100 mg/kg/day for 28 days. At the terminal euthanasia (Day 29/30) thyroid gland 
enlargement was a test article
-
related gross pathology finding in ma
les at 100 mg/kg/day.  
Follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid glands and hepatocellular hypertrophy in the liver were 
test article
-
related histopathology findings in males and females at 100 mg/kg/day. Following the 
14
-
day recovery period (Day 43), tes
t article
-
related findings observed at Day 29/30 were 
diminished or absent.  Target organ effects were observed at levels of 100 mg/kg/day and consisted 
of thyroid and liver. Based on these results, the no

of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day.
 
 
At terminal euthanasia (Day 30/31), small thymuses correlating with 
decreased organ weight and lymphoid depletion were observed in males of the 10 and 30 
mg/kg/day and females of th
e 30 mg/kg/day groups.  Following the 14

Clinical experience 
 
In hum
an, RP6530 is being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials: 
A Phase I Dose Escalation Study 
Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual PI3K δ/γ inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed 
or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies 
(European study: Protoco
l Number RP6530
-
1301
)
 
and 
A Phase I/Ib, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual PI3K δ/γ 
inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory T
-
cell Lymphoma 
([LOCATION_003] study: Protocol number 
RP6530
-
1401)
.
 
In addition, 
an open label
, randomized, single dose, crossover study was 
undertaken to evaluate food effects on relative bioavailability of RP6530 administered in fasting 
and fed conditions in healthy volunteers 
(Protocol no: 
RP6530
-
1501
). 
 
 
In 
the 
European study, RP6530 has 
been safe and well tolerated up to [ADDRESS_246674] been no dose
-
limiting toxicities (DLT).
 
In the US study, a total of 
19  
patients 
were treated at 200 mg BID (n=4)
,
 
400 mg BID (n=4), 800 mg BID (Fasting) (n=5) and 800 mg 
BID (Fed) (
n=6) in dose escalation part of the study. 
RP6530 demonstrated acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile 
up to 800 mg BID (fasting). 
Reported 
SAEs 
were assessed not related to 
RP6530 but attributed to the disease under study/concomitant disease conditions
.
 
Three DLTs 
(transaminitis, neutropenia and skin rash each) were reported in RP6530 800 mg BID (fed) cohort, 
therefore this dose is
 
defined as exceeding MTD
. RP6530 800 mg BID (Fasting) is considered as 
a MTD dose in patients with T
-
cell lymphoma.

determined on Cycle 1
/
Day 1 (C1D1) at 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200 mg BID, 600 and 
800 mg TID. Dose related exposure observed 
across the doses. On Day 29, no accumulation 
observed. Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of RP6530 as determined on Cycle 2
/
Day 1 
(C2D1) revealed no accumulation.  
Similar findings were reported in US study. 
The healthy 
volunteer (food effect) study 
showed that administration of RP6530 after a high
-
fat meal increases 
the bioavailability of RP6530.

As T
-
cell lymphomas (both CTCL and 
PTCL) are 
unmedical need, d
ual targeting of PI3K δ/γ therefore is strongly implicated as an intervention 
strategy in leukemia/lymphomas that are hard to treat by [CONTACT_206842]. 
RP6530
 
is a highly 
specific and orally available, PI3K 
δ and γ 
inhibitor w

fold selectivity over the alpha
 
and beta
 
isoforms.  Inhibition of PI3K

Patients 
received starting dose of 25 mg

was 
reasonable to consider 200

Notes: 
 

 
The first 28

days of safety follow up 
data as confirmed by [CONTACT_737](s)
,
 
and C1D1 PK 
data is essential for dose
-
escalation decisions.   
 

 
Dose escalation may occur if no patient within a three
-
patient cohort experiences a DLT as 
defined in 
Section 
6.6
.
 
If one of three patients within a 3
-
patient cohort experiences a DLT, an 
additional three patients will be treated at the same dose level.  If one of six patients within a 
dose level experiences a DLT, dose escalation will c
ontinue.  If two or more of six patients 
within a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined as exceeding MTD, 
no 
further dose escalation will occur.
  
The previous dose level will be considered the MTD and 
will be expanded to further eluc
idate safety, to define PK, and to evaluate efficacy.
 

 
If two of the first 3 patients in a cohort experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined as 
exceeding MTD, no further dose escalation will occur.
 
 
The previous dose level will be 
considered the MTD 
and will be expanded to further elucidate safety, to define PK, and to 
evaluate efficacy
.
 

 
The actual number of dose cohorts explored will depend upon the MTD and the safety profile 
observed during the conduct of the trial.  Intermediate dose levels and dos
ing schedules may 
be explored if deemed appropriate.
 

 
An optimal dose is defined as the threshold dose at which the study drug is clinically active / 
efficacious (shows complete response or partial response) in a specific disease population and 
is at or 
be
low the maximum tolerated dose.
 
 
Protocol No. RP6530
-
[ADDRESS_246686] their dose of RP6530 increased.  However, the rules remain the same as listed above.
 
At the 
discretion of the
 
treating investigator(s), the dose escalation may be done in patient who received 
lower doses (de

escalation) due to safety reason.
 
 
 
    
 
3.3.3
 
Alternative Dosing Cohorts
 
Depending on the nature and the timing of the toxicities encountered and the pharmacokine
tic data 
from continuous daily dosing of RP6530, alternative dosing regimens and schedules may be 
examined.  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_206784]
, observed toxicities (DLTs and/or non
-
dose limiting 
adverse events of concern) are likely to have resulted from a cont
inuous exposure to the study drug 
or cumulative effect, alternative dosing regimens or schedules may be explored.  The 
DRG
 
will 
determine the alternative schedule, based on PK data, nature and timing of toxicities, and the 
required recovery periods for the
 
observed toxicities encountered. Dose escalation would proceed 
with an alternative schedule 
to determine the MTD
/optimal dose.
  
 
 
3.4
 
Part 2: Phase 1b, dose expansion 
 
Once the 
MTD/
optimal dose has been confirmed, patients who complete the Dose Escalation 
Phase will be permitted to enter the expansion cohorts (Phase Ib). Additional CTCL and PTCL 
patients may be e
nrolled to reach a maximum of 58
 
patients (including the Phase I patient
s) in 
each of the CTCL and PTCL groups.

Precautions and Risks Associated with Investigational Products
 
Monitoring of liver enzymes and levels of TSH, T3, and T4 in subjects receiving 
RP6530
 
is 
recommended based on target organ toxicity. Patients should be monitored for increased 
ALT/AST, skin rash, neutropenia as these events are reported with 
RP6530
. Monitor patients for 
signs and symptoms of these events and interrupt 
RP6530
 
for Grade 3 or hig
her event. In addition, 
enteritis (colitis), pneumonia/pneumonitis as these events are reported with other PI3K inhibitors. 
 
 
RP6530
  
may  cause  serious  infections  that  may  include  sepsis  and  other  infections. Monitor 
patients for signs and sympto
ms of infection and interrupt 
RP6530
 
for Grade 3 or higher infection.
 
RP6530 elicit no photo instability upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations. However, in 
absence of an in
-
vitro data, possibility of phototoxicity with RP6530 cannot be ruled out. 
Th
erefore, patients should be warned about the possible photosensitivity and advised to be careful 
with the UV exposure while on RP6530 treatment. Patients should be recommended to wear loose
-
fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure, in case they 
need to be outdoors. If sunburn 
like reaction or skin eruption occurs, patients should contact [CONTACT_70852].

of these drugs increasing the risk of adverse events. 
 
 
Similarly, as 
RP6530
 
is 
metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2C9, there is possibility of drug 
interaction with 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. 
If concomitant treatment of these 
drugs are clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised. 
Raised INR has been 
reported with concomitant warfarin administration. Therefore, use of heparin o
r warfarin is 
generally avoided. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is advised for prophylaxis and 
treatment of venous thrombosis.
 
In absence of reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity data, the 
study participants should be advised to follow post treatment
 
contraceptive measures.

days cycle
. 
The dose 
and schedule 
of 
RP6530
 
will be determined during the dose escalation phase of the study.  
RP6530
 
will be self
-
administered 
by [CONTACT_102]. 
Tablet
 
(
s
) of relevant strenghs
 
should be taken at approximately the same time each 
day. Patients should be 
instructed to swallow 
RP6530 
tablets as a whole 
with a full glass 
(approximately 8
 
ounces) of water in a fasting state
 
(fasting cohort
s
); and with food in fed cohort
s
 
([ADDRESS_246701] and dinner)
; 
and should not chew or crush them.  
Patients wil
l fast [ADDRESS_246702] the vomited dose.
 
Study drug compliance should be reviewed with the p
atient 
at the 
beginning of 
each 
new 
treatment cycle. Missed doses should be documented. 
No routine 
prophylactic antiemetics 
or premedications
 
will be given.  However, 
these medications 
may be 
administered 
for symptoms 
when they occur, and may be given prop
hylactically afterwards
. 
 
 
5.2
 
Concomitant Medications
 
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications during the course of the study 
without prior consultation with the research team. At each visit, the patient will be asked about 
any 
new medications he/she is taking or has taken after the start of the study drug.
 

 
Use of erythropoietin replacement or bisphosphonates is considered supportive care, and 
their use is permitted if initiated >2 weeks prior to trial treatment.


 
Use of antimic
robial or anti
-
viral prophylaxis can be used according to local standard 
practice
; PCP and Zoster prophylaxis is strongly recommended unless there is known 
adverse events from the prophylactic therapy in the individual. 
 

 
Initiation or escalation of growth 
factor therapy (erythropoietin, GM
-
CSF, G
-
CSF) is not 
allowed during the first month of study treatment.  However, patients who have been on 
stable erythropoietin or darbepoetin therapy for two
 
weeks 
preceding
 
trial treatment 
may 
remain on the same dose du
ring the first month.  
Growth factor therapy, if initiated in the 
first month for the treatment of study drug 
related
 
AE (e.g. RP6530 related neutropenia), 
such patients will be discontinued. 
Growth factor therapy is allowed after the first month
 
as are ch
anges in the dose level of erythropoietin and darbepoetin. 
 

 
Transfusions may be given, based on standard criteria and clinical judgment.
 

 
Patients are permitted to receive palliative radiation therapy on study after Cycle 1 at the 
discretion of the treating
 
physician for existing bone lesions if there is no evidence of 
progressive disease elsewhere. 
 

 
Prophylactic antiemetics will be withheld until the patient has experienced 
≥ CTCAE grade 
1 nausea or vomiting. The patient may then receive prophylactic antiem
etics at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Premedications for hypersensitivity (allergic reactions) will 
not be administered prophylactically.  
 

 
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_206792] (TLS) is significant, 
allopurinol may be given prophylactically.
 

 
RP6530 demonstrated moderate to high inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymes. Therefore, 
concomitant administration of RP6530 with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. calcium channel 
blockers, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], macrolide antibiotics, lovas
tatin, simvastatin, terfenadine) may 
reduce clearance of these drugs increasing the risk of adverse events. 
Similarly, as 
RP6530
 
is 
metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2C9, there is possibility of drug interaction with 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C
9. 
If concomitant treatment of CYP3A4 
substrates are clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly 
during treatment initiation.
 
Raised INR has been reported with concomitant warfarin 
administration. Therefore, use of hep
arin or warfarin is generally avoided. Low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) is advised for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis.
 
 
5.3
 
Prohibited Medications
 
The following treatments are prohibited while on clinical trial:  
 

 
Other investigational drug 
treatments or study participation, radiation therapy (except as 
described above), hormonal therapy for cancer, cancer immunotherapy or other biologic 
therapy excluding trial drugs.
 

 
Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the trial.  Exam
ples include:  
St. John’s wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), ginko biloba, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] 
(DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.  Patients should stop using these herbal 
medications at least [ADDRESS_246703] dose of study drug.

responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable regulatory body.
 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_246705] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
All Grade 3 and grade 4 AEs irre
spective of causality constitute 
clinically significant AE.  
 
 
6.1.2
 
Recording of Adverse Events
 
All adverse events of any patient during the course of the trial will be reported in the case report 
form, and the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_64337]
e relationship of the adverse event to 
trial drug treatment (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to trial drug administration).  If 
the adverse event is serious, it should be reported immediately to Sponsor.  Other untoward events 
occurring in 
the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur 
prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol
-
mandated intervention, including 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no tr
eatment run
-
in).
 
 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to RP6530 (study drug), spanning from the first 
dose of study drug until 
[ADDRESS_246706] dose of study drug, discontinuation or 
completion of protocol
-
specific treatment
 
as
 
defined by [CONTACT_56485], are to be 
recorded in the CRF. 
The data review group (DRG), comprise of PI

sponsor representative, will be constituted to review safety data on ongoing basis. 
 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_246707] be 
reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the adverse event 
or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this 
case, the investig
ators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical 
Protocol No. RP6530
-
[ADDRESS_246708] and as a comment on the CRF. After 30 days of completion of protocol
-
specific treatment 
or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by [CONTACT_1694] t
reatment related are 
to be reported.
 
 
6.2
 
Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Causality Assessment 
 
Causality is assessing the relationship of the trial treatment to the adverse event.
 
For this study, the 
causality assessment will be categorized as related and
 
not related. 
 
Related:
 
A
ll toxicities should be considered to be related to RP6530 unless there is a clear 
alternative explanation.
 
 
 
Not related:
  
If there is n
o temporal association, or another etiology has been identified as the 
cause, or the 
trial treatment cannot be implicated based upon the current information.
 
 
6.3
 
Serious Adverse Events
 
6.3.1
 
Definitions of Serious Adverse Events
 
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206795].
 
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life
-
threatening, requires at least a 24
-
hour in
-
patient hosp
italization or prolongation 
of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.
 
 
The definition of SAE also includes any important medical event.  Medical and scientific judgment
 
should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such 
as important medical events that may not be immediately life
-
threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may requ
ire intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dys
crasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Progression of malignancy (including fatal 
outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_206852] (for example, as per Cheson et al. 2007 
Revised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma), should not be reported as a serious adverse 
event. 
 
 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in
-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE 
criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):
 

 
Emergency Department or Emergency Room
 

 
Outpatient or same
-
day surgery units
 

 
Observation or short
-
stay unit
 

 
Rehabilitation facility
 

 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341]
 

 
Nu
rsing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_206796] a pre
-
planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the trial), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the 
Sponsor.

Serious Adverse Event Reporting by [CONTACT_206853] “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily b
e considered serious.  For
 
example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which 
results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild s
troke, but would be 
considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording 
AEs on the CRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form.
 
 
Adverse events classified by [CONTACT_206854].  Serious adverse events may 
occur at any time from the signing of the informed consent form through the [ADDRESS_246709] trial treatment.

terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on 
the SAE Report Forms and AE CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
 
All AEs, including 
those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be recorded on the AE CRF; AEs that meet the 
definition of an SAE
 
should additionally be reported following 
the procedures noted in 
above 
s
ection
s. 
 
 
6.4.1
 
Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
 
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_206797] d
esignated physician, the AEs constitute components 
of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs 
and/or sy
mptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the 
relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequ
ently established, 
it should be reported as follow
-
up information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent 
to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect 
the diagnosis.
 
 
6.4.2
 
Persistent or Recurr
ent Adverse Events
 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the 
AE
 
CRF.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or l
essens in severity, it should be recorded 
at 
once with highest grade of severity 
on a SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF.  
 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoints, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should b
e recorded 
s
e
p
a
rately 
on an SAE Report Form 
and/or AE
 
CRF.
 
 
6.4.3
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values
 
Any grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant grade 1 or 2 hematology or 
biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE.  If an a
bnormal laboratory value or 
vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be 
reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional 
information that must be collected 
on the relevant CRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of 
a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE 
CRF.

Pre
-
Existing Medical Conditions
 
A pre
-
existing medical condition is one that 
is present at the start of the trial.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History CRF. A pre
-
existing medical condition should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens 
during 
the trial.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE
 
CRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the pre
-
existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215].
 
 
6.4.7
 
Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies
 
Preg
nancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  Please 
refer to 
pregnancy section 
6.[ADDRESS_246716] developed after the inclusion of the patient into 
the study.  They do not include new lesions of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the 
new lesions itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered 
to be disease 
progression.

Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies:
 
Female patients who are not of child
-
bearing potential (see 
Appendix 
C
) or female patients of 
child
-
bearing potential  who
 
have a negative serum   pregnancy test within 72
 
hours prior to initial 
trial treatment are eligble for the study. Female patients of child
-
bearing potential (see 
Appendix 
C
), and all male partners must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception 
throughout the study period and for 4 weeks plus 5T1/2 (48 hrs) after the last dose of RP6530. A 
barrier method of contraception must be inc
luded.   
 
During the course of the trial, all female patients of childbearing potential (the definitions of 
“women of childbearing potential” are listed in 
Appendix 
C
) must contact [CONTACT_206856] (a missed or late menstrual period should 
be reported to the treating investigator).  
 
 
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnan
t prior to administration of trial drug(s), 
the trial drug(s) must be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, the patient must not receive any trial drug(s), and must be discontinued from the 
trial.  
 
 
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been receiving trial 
drug(s), the trial drug(s) must immediately be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is 
confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(
s) must be immediately and permanently 
stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the trial, and the investigator must notify the 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor Representative as soon as possible.  If a patient becomes pregnant 
while enrolled in the trial
, a Pregnancy Form should be completed and faxed to the Sponsor.   
 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects 
always
 
meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnanc
y Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect 
the outcome of the pregnancy.
 
 
RP6530 Overdose
 
Symptomatic and non
-
symptomatic overdose must be reported in the CRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the 
trial treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a seriousness 
criterion, is to be reported to the Sponsor immediately (within one
 
 
day) using the corresponding 
screens in the CRF, and following the same process described for SAE reporting
,
 
if the overdose 
is symptomatic.

Toxicity will be assessed utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0 (
http://evs.
nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE
)
.
 
All toxicities should be considered to be related to RP6530 unless there is a clear alternative 
explanation. 
A toxicity will be considered dose
-
limiting if it occurs during the first cycle (4

scribed
 
the statistical methods to be used to 
analyze the safety and efficacy as de
scribed
 
in the objectives. These methods may be revised and 
updated due to reasons such as regulatory requirements or need for further clarifications. The final 
analysis plan will 
be documented in a formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) that must be finalized 
before database lock. The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, how missing 
data will be handled, and how censoring procedures will be applied to time to 
event related 
variables as well as the details on statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses. 
The final clinical study report will discuss deviations from the SAP, if any.

assessment
. 
PP population will include all ITT population without major protocol violations.   
 
The efficacy endpoints will include:
 

 
Overall response rate (ORR)
 

 
Duration of Response (DoR)
 
 
These variables will be 
analyzed/summarized based on the ITT population as well
 
as the PP 
population as approp
riate.  The percentages of CR, CR+PR, and CR+PR+SD will be presented, as 
will the median duration of response.  The 95% confidence intervals of these percentages may also

Confidentiality
 
10.5.1
 
Patient Confidentiality
 
Confidentiality of patient’s 
personal data willbe protected in accordance with the Health 
 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and national data protection laws, 
 
as applicable. HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the trial, a patient mu
st 
 
sign an authorization from the trial that he or she has been informed of following:
 
a. 
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this 
trial
;
 
b. 
Who will 
have access to that information and why;
 
c. 
Who will use or disclose that information; 
d. 
The 
information collected about the research 
trial
 
will be kept separate from the patient’s medical 
records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after the conclusion of the 
trial
;
 
e. 
Whe
ther the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and
 
f. 
The rights of a research patient to 
revoke his or her authorization. 
 
 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains t
he ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the
 
patient is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled 
trial
 
period.
 
 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines
 
and applicable parts of [ADDRESS_246739] access to review the patient’s original medical records at the site for

Contraceptive Guidelines and Pregnancy
 
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are Defined as Follows:
 
Women are considered post
-
menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural 
(spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor 
symptoms) or six months of spontaneous a
menorrhea with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL] or have had surgical 
bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, 
only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] u
p hormone level assessment is 
she considered not of child bearing potential.
 
Contraceptive Guidelines for 
Women of Child
-
Bearing Potential:
 
 
Women of child
-
bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use 
highly effective contraception during the study and 
for 5 T1/2 (
48 hrs
) 
plus an additional 4 weeks 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_206816]
. The highly effective 
contraception is defined as either:
 
1.
 
True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post
-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
method
s of contraception.
 
2. 
 
Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at 
least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has 
been confirmed by f
ollow up hormone level assessment.
 
3. 
 
Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post
-
vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the 
ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for t
hat 
patient.
 
4. 
 
Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):
 
a)   Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
 
b)  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or   cervical/vault caps) with 
sp
ermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.
 
 
The following are 
unacceptable

23.
 
Bone marrow biopsy: 
PTCL p
atients entering the study with low grade lymphoma must have a morphology and flow cytometry performed 
≤3 months prior 
to study entry and/or to confirm a complete response.  Patients with high grade lymphoma must 
have a morphology and flow cytometry performed 
≤28 
days prior to study entry and/or to confirm a complete response.
 
The lymph node will be required to perform only if the diagnosis is not confirmed at the 
baseline
;
 
and if required at other time points.
 
23a
 
PTCL patients without measurable disease but assessable disease
 
(e.g. marrow disease without other radiographically measurable disease) will have 
a
 
bone marrow biopsy
 
at screening /baseline and
 
on C3D1 (± 7 days) and C5D1 (± 7 days) and approximately 12 w
eeks thereafter (± 7 days) and/or to 
confirm a complete response. CTCL patients with predominantly blood involvement (confirmed by [CONTACT_4133])
 
will have a
 
bone marrow biopsy
 
at 
screening /baseline (unless it has been shown to be negative within the las
t 6 months) and
 
as indicated
 
to confirm a complete response occurring
 
at all
 
other 
sites.
 
Specific molecular exams for some particular malignancies will be performed according to institutional diagnostic guidelines.
 
If bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_206823], it
 
will be processed and shipped according to the laboratory manual. Bone marrow disease alone may be used for disease assessmen
t. 
In this case, response would be CR or non
-
CR only, determined by [CONTACT_206886].
 
Post 
C
ycle 8, d
is
ease assessments should be performed at 12 weekly intervals (± 7 days), and/ or at the EOT. For example, the appropriate radi
ological 
investigation (e.g. CT scan, PET
-
CT or PET) will be performed in PTCL patients at C11D1, C14D1, C17D1, C20D1, etc. Similar
ly, mSWAT and/or 
CAILS and radiological assessment (as required) will be performed in CTCL patients on this schedule. 
 
24.
 
The study 
drug 
RP6530 will be administered orally twice a day in [ADDRESS_246757] 8 months. Treatment will be 
continued in patients experiencing clinical benefit for 2 years unless progression of disease or toxi
city warranting discontinuation of therapy. The decision 
to continue the treatment will be taken by [CONTACT_976]
/
Co
-
PI [INVESTIGATOR_206786].
 
 
Beyond 
C
ycle 8,
 
all visits 
will be 
monthly. During these monthly visits, RP6530 will be dis
pensed, medication compliance will be monitored and AEs will 
be assessed. Efficacy assessments will be done at scheduled visit. An End of treatment (EOT) visit will be performed within 3
0 days after treatment ends.
 

 
Safety assessments:
 
Ongoing safety assessment is to occur during the monthly visits and AEs are to be reported as required by [CONTACT_760]. There
 
is no 
specific safety labs or evaluations to be done as per protocol. As part Standard of care, laboratory evaluations can be don
e and recorded per Investigator’s 
discretion. 
Adverse events (AEs, SAEs and deaths) will be recorded and reported for 30 calendar days after discontinuation or completion 
of protocol
-
specific treatment. After the 30 day reporting period, only AEs, SAEs, or
 
deaths 
assessed by [CONTACT_206887].
 

 
Efficacy assessments:
 
D
isease assessments should be performed at 12 weekly intervals (± 7 days), and/ or at the EOT. For example, the appropriate 
radiological investigation (e.g. CT scan, PET
-
CT or PET) will be performed in PTCL patients at C11D1, C14D1, C17D1, C20D1, etc. Simil
arly, mSWAT 
and/or CAILS and radiological assessment (as required) will be performed in CTCL patients on this schedule.

Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
 
International Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et. al. 2007)
 
Complete Response (CR): 
 
The 
designation of CR requires the following:
 

 
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence
 
of disease and 
disease
-
related symptoms if present before therapy.
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]
-
avid lymphoma: in patients with no pretreatment
 
PET 
scan or when the PET scan 
is 
positive before therapy, a
 
post
-
treatment 
residual mass of any size is permitted as long
 
as it is PET negative.
 

 
Variably FDG
-
avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients
 
without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatm
ent PET scan
 
i
s 
negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed
 
on CT to 
normal size (
≤1.[ADDRESS_246764] transverse diameter
 
for nodes >1.5 
cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes
 
that were 1.[ADDRESS_246765] decreased
 
to 
≤1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
 

 
The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy
 
on the basis 
of a physical examination or CT scan, should not
 
be palpabl
e on physical 
examination and should be considered
 
normal size by [CONTACT_20521], 
and nodules related to lymphoma
 
should disappear. However, 
determination of splenic involvement
 
is not always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in
 
size may still c
ontain lymphoma, whereas an 
enlarged spleen
 
may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use 
of
 
hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma.
 

 
If the bone marrow 
is 
involved by [CONTACT_22679],
 
the 
infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.
 
The biopsy 
sample on which this determination is made must be
 
adequate (with a 
goal of >20 mm unilateral core). If the
 
sample is indeterminate by 
[CONTACT_5293], it should be negative
 
by [CONTACT_9064]. A sample 
that
 
is negative by [CONTACT_206890] a small 
population of clonal lymphocytes
 
by [CONTACT_127891] a 
CR until data become
 
available demonstrating a clear difference in patient 
outcome.
 
 
Complete 
Response/Unconfirmed 
(
CRu):
 
The use of the above definition for CR and those below for PR eliminates the 
category of CRu.

Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
 
(continued)
 
Partial Response (PR): 
 
 
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
 

 
At 
least
 
a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters
 
(SPD)
 
of up 
to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.
 
These nodes or masses 
should be selected according to all of
 
the following: they should be clearly 
measurable in at least
 
2 perpen
dicular dimensions; if possible they should be 
from
 
disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal
 
and 
retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are
 
involved.
 

 
No increase should be observed in the size of other
 
nodes, liver,
 
or spleen.
 

 
Splenic and hepatic nodules must
 
regress by 
≥50% in their SPD
 
or, for single 
nodules, in the
 
greatest transverse diameter.
 

 
With the exception of splenic
 
and hepatic nodules, involvement
 
of other 
organs is usually
 
assessable and no 
measurable disease
 
should be present.
 

 
Bone
 
marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a
 
PR if
 
the sample 
i
s positive before treatment. However, if
 
positive,
 
the cell type should be 
specified (e.g., large
-
cell
 
lymphoma or
 
small neoplastic B cells)
. Patients 
who achieve
 
a CR by [CONTACT_206891], but who have persistent 
morphologic
 
bone marrow
 
involvement will be considered partial 
responders.
 
 
When the
 
bone marrow i
s involved before therapy and a clinical
 
CR i
s
 
achieved, but with no bone marrow as
sessment after treatment,
 
patients 
should be considered partial responders.
 

 
No new sites
 
of disease should be observed.
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]
-
avid lymphoma:
 
for patients with no pretreatment
 
PET scan 
or if the PET scan
 
i
s positive before therapy, the

t PET should 
be
 
positive in at least one previously
 
involved site.

avid lymphomas/FDG
-
avidity unknown: for patients
 
without
 
a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan
 
i
s negative,

should be used.
 
 
In patients with 
follicular lymphoma or mantle
-
cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only 
indicated with one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 
50% on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET 
negative and should be considered
 
partial responders.

Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
 
(continued)
 
Stable Disease (SD):  
 
 
Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following:
 

 
A patient is
 
considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain
 
the criteria
 
needed for a 
CR or PR, but does not fulfill those
 
for progressive
 
disease (see 
Relapsed Disease [after CR]/Progressive
 
Disease
 
[after PR, SD]).
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358]
-
avid lymphomas: the PET should
 
be positive at
 
prior sites of 
disease with no new areas of involvement
 
on the
 
po
st
-
treatment CT or PET.
 

 
Variably FDG
-
avid lymphomas/FDG
-
avidity
 
unknown: for patients
 
without 
a pretreatment PET scan or if
 
the pretreatment PET i
s
 
negative, there must be 
no change in
 
the size of the previous
 
lesions on the post
-
treatment CT
 
scan.
 
 
Relapsed Disease (after 
CR) / Progressive Disease 
(after PR, SD):  
 
 
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm 
regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it 
should only be considered
 
abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0. Lymph nodes 
≤1.0 x ≤1.0 cm will not be considered as abnormal for relapse or progressive 
disease.
 

 
Appearance of any new lesion more than
 
1.[ADDRESS_246766] 
are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic
 
decision should not
 
be made solely on 
the basis of the PET without
 
histologic confirmation.
 

 
At least a 50% increase from nadir
 
in the SPD of any previously
 
involved 
nodes, or in a single
 
involved 
node, or the size of
 
other lesions (e.g., splenic 
or
 
hepatic nodules). To be considered
 
progressive disease, a lymph
 
node with 
a diameter of the short
 
axis of less than 1.[ADDRESS_246767]
 
increase by 
50% and 
to a size
 
of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than
 
1.5 cm in the l
ong axis.
 

 
At least a 50% increase in the longest
 
diameter of any single
 
previously 
identified node more than
 
1 cm in its short axis.
 

 
Lesions should be PET positive if
 
observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]
-

Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (continued)
 
Measurable extranodal
 
disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease. For these 
recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease.  Disease that is only assessable (e.g., pleural effusions, bone 
lesions) will be recorded as present or absent onl
y, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_124454], it is found to be histologically negative. 
 
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majority of participants, or where PET is not deemed necessary or
 
appropriate for use (e.g., a trial in patients with MALT lymphoma), response should be assessed as above, but only using 
CT scans.  However, residual masses should not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

Ann Arbor staging system
 
Stage I
 
Either of the following means the disease is stage I:
 

 
The lymphoma is in only 1 lymph node area or lymphoid organ such as the thymus (I).
 

 
The cancer is found only in 1 area of a single organ outside of the lymph system (IE).
 

 
 
Stage II
 
Either of the followi
ng means the disease is stage II:
 

 
The lymphoma is in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the same side of (above or below) the 
diaphragm (the thin band of muscle that separates the chest and abdomen). For example, this might 
include nodes in the 
underarm and neck area but not the combination of underarm and groin nodes 
(II).
 

 
The lymphoma extends from a single group of lymph node(s) into a nearby [CONTACT_90628] (IIE). It may also 
affect other groups of lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm.
 

 
 
Stage I
II
 
Either of the following means the disease is stage III:
 

 
The lymphoma is found in lymph node areas on both sides of (above and below) the diaphragm.
 

 
The cancer may also have spread into an area or organ next to the lymph nodes (IIIE), into the spleen 
(II
IS), or both (IIISE).
 
 
Stage IV
 
Either of the following means the disease is stage IV:
 

 
The lymphoma has spread outside of the lymph system into an organ that is not right next to an 
involved node.
 

 
The lymphoma has spread to the bone marrow, liver, brain or
 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or the pleura (thin lining 
of the lungs).
 
Other modifiers may also be used to describe the lymphoma stage:

opsy
 
 

 
Excisional biopsy is indicated in those patients with a node that is either 
≥1.5 cm in diameter and/or 
is firm, irregular, clustered, or fixed
 

 
Site of biopsy
 
o
 
Preference is given to the largest lymph node draining an involved area of the skin or if 
FDG
-
PET scan data are available, the node with highest standardized uptake value (SUV).
 
o
 
If there is no additional imaging information and multiple nodes are enlarged and otherwise 
equal in size or consistency, the order of preference is cervical, axillary,
 
and
 
inguinal areas.

A biopsy of normal appearing skin is unnecessary to assign a complete response. However, a 
skin biopsy should be performed of a representative area of the 
skin if there is any question of 
residual disease (persistent erythema or pi[INVESTIGATOR_138716]) where otherwise a complete 
response would exist. If histologic features are suspi[INVESTIGATOR_206829]/Sézary syndrome (see histologic criteria

Appendix 
M
: Monitoring of Liver enzymes
 
 
Grade III elevation of ALT or AST [> 5 X the upper limit of normal (ULN)] have been observed with 
RP6530 treatment in Dose Escalation Part. Most transaminase elevations were reversible with dose 
interruption. 
Multiple lines of evidence from literature sugg
est that this hepatotoxicity was immune 
mediated.
 
In in view of this, frequent monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended in patient 
presenting with transaminitis. Steroid can be initiated by [CONTACT_206895].
 
 

 
Grade 
≥ 1 Transaminitis: 
 
o
 
Maintain RP6530 dose and initiate 
prednisone [ADDRESS_246778] >[ADDRESS_246779] (> Grade 1) until resolved. 
 
o
 
Withhold RP6530 in case of development of grade 2 transami
nitis or worsening 
of Grade 1 transaminitis while on steroids. 
 

 
Grade 
≥ 3 Transaminitis: 
 
o
 
In of ALT/AST >5
–
[ADDRESS_246780] (Grade 3), it is recommended to withhold RP6530 
and monitor ALT/AST twice a weekly until levels are Grade 

1; once this occurs, 
RP6530 may b
e resumed at a reduced dose of 400 mg BID. 
 
o
 
Wait for a week, initiate 
prednisone
 
1 mg/kg 
in case no improvement with 
discontinuation of RP6530 in 1 week. 
 
o
 
Monitor ALT/AST twice a weekly until levels are Grade 

1; once this occurs, 
RP6530 may be resumed at 
a reduced dose of 400 mg BID and taper steroid. 
 
o
 
For patients with grade 
≥3 transaminitis without immediate response to steroids, 
mycophenolate mofetil could be considered after 7 days of steroids.                                  
 
o
 
If ALT/AST elevation >[ADDRESS_246781] occurs, RP6530 should be permanently 
discontinued.
 
o
 
In case of recurrence of transaminitis at reduced doses, discontinue RP6530 
permanently after assessing risk versus benefit.

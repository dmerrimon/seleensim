Prenatal breast pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_89097] :  
 
Compelling evidence exists that breast milk helps protect premature infants from prematurity -specific 
morbidities, including feeding intolerance, late onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Unfortunately, 
mothers of VLBW infan ts often exhibit delayed lactogenesis stage II (when the milk “comes in”) and inadequate 
breast milk production. Earlier initiation of breast milk expression following delivery is associated with 
increased lactation success. However,  lack of nursing time a nd lack of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89098]. The proposed study will follow a pros pective cohort  
of racially and economically diverse mothers of premature infants for [ADDRESS_97977]  1 
primary  aim and 1 secondary aim. Aim 1 : will evaluate the f easibility of antenatal BM pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_89099]. Issues related to recruitment, randomization acceptance of the intervention, 
and refinement o f the education materials and process will be scrutinized. Aim [ADDRESS_97978] milk sodium levels will be analyzed on Day 1 -7, Day 14 and 
21. 
 
Background:  
 
Each year over ½ m illion infants, or one out of eight born in the [LOCATION_002], are premature  (less than 38 
weeks gestation) . Prematurity occurs among non -Hispanic African -American babies at a disproportionate rate 
of 13.6 % compared to 7.2 % for non -Hispanic White babies an d 6.9 % for Hispanic babies (CDC, 2010). The 
majority (70%) of premature births consist of “late preterm” infants delivered between 34 and 3 7 weeks  (term 
infants are considered 38 weeks and greater). Approximately 12% of premature infants are born between 3 2 
and 33 weeks, 10% between 28  and 31 weeks , and 6% at less than 28 weeks (March of Dimes, 2010). In the 
not too distant past, infants born earlier than 32 weeks and weighing less than 1500 grams either did not 
survive or survived for only short periods of  time (Seri & Evan, 2008 ). With advances in health care and 
technology, the survival of infants as young as [ADDRESS_97979] ( Horbar et al., 2008 ). Unfortunately, many of these very low birth  weight 
(VLBW ) infants have significant health complications in the immediate post -birth period and in the years to 
come.  
 
Reducing Complications  
 
One approach for reducing health complications is ensuring that VLBW infants are fed breast milk, either 
through feeding at the breast or via gastric tube before they are able to feed directly from the breast. Breast 
milk has been found to decrease some of the short and long -term morbidit ies associated with prematurity, 
including feeding intolerance, late onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (Ronnestad et al., 2005; Sisk et 
al., 2007, 2008). Breast milk not only provides nutrition but helps establish immunological and gastrointestinal 
competence. Furthermore, premature infants who were fed breast milk were  found to have better 
neurodevelopmental outcomes than those who were formula -fed (Vohr et al., 2005).  Reducing complications of 
prematurity shortens length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89100] -term

 social /monetary  costs associat ed with developmental delays and special needs (Child Trends Data Bank, 
2010 ).  
 
Lactation and Milk Formation  
 
Synthesis of milk production begins early in pregnancy, with formation of milk components occurring by 22 
weeks’ gestation (Hartman et al., 2003) . The lactation process is dependent upon several hormones, including 
prolactin, oxytocin, insulin, cortisol, and progesterone. Progesterone, produced by [CONTACT_89119], assists in 
alveolar breast development and inhibits milk production during pregnancy (Hu mphreys et al., 1997). Prolactin, 
involved in alveolar development during pregnancy (Ostrum, 1990) is necessary for lactogenesis and likely 
plays a role in the volume of milk produced (Kent, 2007). Stimulation of the breast by [CONTACT_89120] (Johnston & Amico, 1986). Lower baseline 
(pre-stimulation) levels have been demonstrated in mothers delivering prematurely, suggesting a relationship 
between premature delivery and decrea sed lactation hormon e levels ( Hill et al., 2009). Oxytocin is released 
during breast stimulation, resulting in milk being ejected into the ducts and cisterns of the breast (Geddes, 
2007). Oxytoxin levels in preterm mothers have been shown to be comparable to those of term mothers with 
adequate breast expression (Chatterton et al., 2000). Additional hormones, including insulin and 
corticosterioids, are also necessary for the synthesis of breast milk.  
 
Lactation , the onset of milk secretion, can be divided i nto two stages. Stage I begins during pregnancy and 
occurs as levels of progesterone, prolactin, and placental lactogen increase (Neville & Morton,  2001) . 
Elevations in the level of these hormones result in expansion of the terminal duct lobular unit and preparation 
of the breast for milk production. During mid -pregnancy, essential elements, including mRNA and specific 
enzymes necessary for milk pro duction, begin to increase. Milk droplets in mammary cells also swell  in 
preparation. At this point, milk production does not occur, but the breast is ready to produce  milk soon after 
delivery (Neville & Morton, 2001; Neville, Morton, & Umemora, 2001) . Following delivery, s mall amounts of 
colostrum are produced and are available for infant consumption (Neville  et al.,  2001).  
Lactogenesis stage II signals the change from production of small quantities of colostrum to copi[INVESTIGATOR_89101]. This stage occurs followin g delivery due to a dramatic decrease in progesterone  and 
maintenance of prolactin levels (Kuhn, 1983) . Initiation of lactogenesis stage II is experienced by [CONTACT_89121] (a) “milk coming in” or feelings of notable fullness in her breasts (Perez -Escamilla & 
Chapman, 2000)  and (b) increases in milk volume to over 100ml/d (Neville  et al., 2001). Maternal perception of 
a sudden feeling of fullness in the breast has been a traditional method of determining the timing of 
lactogenesis stage II and is correlated with actual timing of this stage (Perez -Escamilla & Chapman, 2000).  
 
Delayed Lactogenesis Stage II  
 
Lactogen esis stage II usually occurs approximately 30 -40 hours following the bi rth of full -term infants (Hurst, 
2007), but delay has been known to occur in 22 to 31% of women who deliver at term  (Dewey, Nommsen -
Rivers, Heinig, & Cohen, 2003) . Delayed or impaired lactoge nesis stage II has been found in up to 82% of 
women who deliver prematurely (Henderson, Hartman, Newnham, & Simmer, 2009; Cregan et al., 2001).  
Delayed progression to stage II among women who deliver full -term has been associated with delayed 
initiation o f breastfeeding, gestational diabetes, obesity, cesarean section, prolonged second stage of labor, 
primiparity, administration of pain medications during labor, breast implantation and reduction mammoplasty 
(Chen, Nommsen -Rivers, Dewey, & Lonnerdal, 1998; Hildebrandt, 1999; Morton, 1994; Neifert, et al., 1990; 
Neubauer et al., 1993).  
Delayed lactogenesis stage II has both immediate and longer -term negative consequences. If such delays 
result in an inadequate amount of bre ast milk for infant consumption, breast milk feedings are replaced with 
commercially prepared  formula, or feedings are withheld until breast milk is available. Both options may be 
potentially detrimental to the VLBW infant. Since both intestinal and gastri c hormone secretion and motility are 
dependent on enteral feedings, a delay in feeding can potentially decrease future feeding tolerance (Berseth, 
1990). Provision of even small amounts of formula is associated with abnormal changes in the microflora of the 
 
 
Protocol #201400318   Page 4 of 9  
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  6/16/[ADDRESS_97980], potentially resulting in increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis ( Taylor, Basile, Ebeling, & 
Wagner, 2009 ). A delay in lact ogenesis stage II is also associated with decreased success in later lactation 
(Chapman & Perez -Escamilla, 2003; Hurst, 2007).  
 
Insufficient Milk Supply  
 
Breast milk volume is correlated with gestational age; thus, mothers of premature VLBW infants produc e 
significantly less milk than mothers of term infants (Henderson, Hartmen, Newnham, & Simmer, 2009; Hill et 
al., 2009) . Also , milk volume in mothers of VLBW infants often substantially decreases at around 3 to 4 weeks 
following d elivery (Hill, Aldag, Chatterton, & Zimanman, 2005a). This decreased production may be due to 
decreased exposure to lactation hormones and decreased mammary gland development  during a shortened 
pregnancy. It may also be related to the mothers need to mecha nically express her breasts because her infant 
is unable to feed directly from the breast due to developmental, physiologic  and gastrointestinal immaturity .  In 
one study mothers of VLBW premature infants were 2.[ADDRESS_97981] an insufficient milk supply 
than mothers who delivered at term (Hill, Aldag and Chatterton, 1999). In another study, many were unable to 
sustain their milk suppl y, with 51% failing to produce adequate milk volumes at 6 weeks following delivery (Hill 
et al., 2005b). In mot hers of VLBW infants, longer term adequacy of overall milk production is a reflection of the 
amount of milk produced during th e first week following delivery —underscoring the need for early strategies to 
increase milk production in this population (Hill, A ldag, & Chataterton, 1999; Hill et al., 2005a).   
 
Optimizing Milk Supply  
 
Rate of milk synthesis is related to the degree the breast is emptied during breastfeeding or milk expression 
(Daly, Kent, Owens, & Hartmann 1996). In term infant s, maintenance of lactation is dependent on suckling 
frequency and intensity; lactation success has been correlated with a breastfeeding frequency of 10 -12 times 
per day (Chen, Nommsen -Rivers, & Dewey, 1998). A positive association between frequency of mil k 
expression and milk volume in mothers of VLBW infants has also been demonstrated in several observational 
studies  with expression frequency of at last 5 times per day associated with increased milk production (Furman 
et al., 2002). Kangaroo Care (holding  of an infant dressed only in a diaper upon a mother’s bare chest) has  
also been shown  in observational studies  to increase milk volume in mothers of VLBW infants but the 
frequency or the duration of kangaroo care needed to increased milk volume has not be en determined and 
may not be possible due to the critical status of the infant (Lau et al., 2007). Duration of individual expression 
sessions have not been shown to influence milk volume in this population. Lactation support may impact 
lactation success in  mothers of VLBW infants; however the majority of studies have focused on the effect of 
lactation support on breast feeding success rather than milk volume following breast expression (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_89102]. 
2001; Gonzalez et al. 2003; Merewood et al. 2006). The u se of evidenced based interventions and the use of 
peer support groups are associated with improved lactation success including the amount of breast milk 
received by [CONTACT_89122] (Meier et al., 2004).  The presence of lactation con sultants in 
the NICU also increases the number of women providing breast milk to their infants (Gonzalesz et al., 2003). 
However, little information exists regarding the effect of lactation support on milk volume or lactogenesis stage 
II in mothers of VLBW  infants.  Maternal stress and depression are associated with decreased breastfeeding 
success in term infants.  Little, however has been reported concerning the impact of stress and depression in 
milk volume or lactogenesis in the premature infant (Gagliard i et al., 2010; Zanardo et al., 2011).  Hill et al., 
[ADDRESS_97982].  
 
Earlier initiation of milk expression has been associated with increased milk volume in mothers of VLBW 
infant s (Hill et al., 1999; 2001; Hill & Aldag, 2005; Hill et al., 2005b; Hopkinson, Schanler, & Ganza, 1988). 
However, all studies assessing the effect of initiation timing on milk volume have been observational and no 
randomized controlled trials  regarding  precise  timing of initiation of milk expression on either milk volume or 
timing of lactogenesis stage two have been reported.  Furthermore, previously published studies have focused 
on initiation of expression very late following delivery of the  infant . Hill and colleagues (2005b) in an 
observational study found that initiation of milk expression occurred 27.3 + 14.9 hours following birth and 
timing of initial milk expression inversely correlated with milk volume at one week following delivery.  With the 
 
 
Protocol #201400318   Page 5 of 9  
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  6/16/2019     
 same group of mothers, Hill & Aldag (2005) found timing of expression initiation correlated with adequate milk 
production at the 6th week. Hopkinson, Schanler, & Ganza (1988) also reported a positive correlation between 
day of milk expression init iation and milk volume at Week 2, with the earliest expression initiation occurring on 
Day [ADDRESS_97983] effective  (Furman, Minich, & Hack, 2002).    
 
Education  
 
While prenatal education has been shown to increase lactation duration in mothers of premature infant, 
education of support pe rsons has not been studied nor has the effect on timing of initiation of milk expression, 
timing of lactogenesis stage II or milk volume has not been studied  
 
Infant Breast Milk Intake  
 
Healthy People 2020 goals include an exclusive breastfeeding rate of 46.2% for the first 3 months of life 
(Healthy People, 2020). This is rarely attained in term infants and due to an insufficient milk supply, even less 
likely to occur in mothers of VLBW infants thus depriving them of the essential benefits of breast milk.  Milk 
volume in these mothers also often substantially decreases at around [ADDRESS_97984] milk to their infants (Hill et al., 2005a)  
 
Preliminary Work  
 
In order to i mprove breastfeeding success, it is strongly recommended that women who deliver term infants 
begin breastfeeding within 30 -60 minutes following delivery.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_89103], by [CONTACT_89123] a gestational age between 23 and 32 
weeks ( n=20) within 1 hour following delivery ( n=10) and compared milk volume and timing of lactogenesis 
stage II with mothers who began milk expression 1 -6 hours following delivery ( n=10). Only 1 mother who was 
approached declined to participate in the study. No statistically significant differences were found between the 
groups for demographic characteristics or behavioral factors including kangaroo care and expression 
frequency.  Although  the study was small (n=20), women who began milk expression with in [ADDRESS_97985] hour also produced significantly more milk at  3 
weeks following delivery and also had a statistically significant  earlier lactogenesis stage II .  Stress and pain 
associa ted with initial milk expression session was also analyzed between groups with no significant 
differences found between groups. Women in the earlier expression group tended to report less stress and 
pain (Parker et al., 2012 ).  
 
In addition, we compared wo men who began milk expression within [ADDRESS_97986] 7 days following delivery  
 
In a survey of 8 0 obstetrical nurses from 3 large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89104], over 30% stated that a major barrier to 
assisting mothers of VLBW infants to begin timely breast milk expression following delivery was a lack of time 
and lack of personnel.

Research Design  
 
A randomized clinical trial will be conducted to determine the effect of a prenatally delivered lactation 
educational program for expectant mothers of premature infants and their SP on timing of initiation of milk 
expression and lactation success. Timing of lactogenesis stage II will be d ocumented,  volume of breast milk 
produced will be measured for the first [ADDRESS_97987] been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89107] a premature infant will be sampled by 
[CONTACT_89124] a maternity unit at Shands Teaching  Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307], a Level III tertiary care center. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89108] a Level III (52 bed) NICU. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89109] N orth Central [LOCATION_012] and Southern Georgia , a predominantly rural and semi -rural popula tion. 
120 VLBW infants per year are delivered with 95% of these women electing to express breast milk for their 
infants. This will also include enrollment of 80 support persons as a couplet with mom.  
 
Inclusion criteria  for the mothers  are: 1) at least 18 years of age , 2) English speaking, 3) stated intent to 
breastfeed , 4) anticipating the birth of a  premature infant < 3 5 weeks gestation. E xclusion criteria  are: 1) known 
illicit maternal drug use, 2) history of breast reduction or augmentation, 3) positive  HIV status, or 4) infant  not 
expected to live over 2 weeks following delivery.   
 
Inclusion criteria for the support person :  1) is expected to be present immediately following delivery, 2) at least 
18 years of age, 3) English speaking  
Randomization  
 
Informed consent will be obtained  from b oth mother and SP  prior to delivery.  Following consent, the pair  will be 
randomly assigned to one of two  groups .  Group [ADDRESS_97988] care.      
Procedure  
 
Once the pair is  randomly assigned to one of the  groups, the PI, or a research assi stant  will make an  
appointment and meet with the mother  and her support person  (the person or persons stated to be with her 
during labor and the delive ry of her infant). During this meeting the mother and her support person will be 
provided the following educational activities  
1. Viewing of a video regarding  the benefits of breast milk for premature infants.  
2. Viewing of video with instructions regarding how  to use a breast pump and instructions regarding milk 
expression.   
3. They will be given the standard written and verbal pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_89110] m ilk for their infants .

remain in the mother ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] . A demonstration of how the pump works and how to set up the 
pump will be provided.  
 
Mothers will be visited by [CONTACT_23164], PI, or a research assi stant  prior to her discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89111]. 
Mother s will also have access to lactation services and nurses on the unit . At this visit, mothers and the SP  will 
be questioned regarding stress associated with the initial milk expression (Appendix A).  Part icipants w ill be 
asked to indicate their level of s tress on a visual analogue scale and will mark their response on a 100mm 
horizontal line continuum from n one to severe.  The score was determined by [CONTACT_89125] t he point where the subject marked .  Since single -item measurements are easier 
to administer, less burdensome to participants and have been shown to be a valid and reliable tool, 
participants will be asked to answer only one question pertaining to stress.  The mother and SP will also be 
asked to complete a survey regarding the educational experience (Appendix B ,C).    
 
Mothers will be provided with a s upply of pre -weighed  milk vials  and labels  in which they will place the milk 
following expression per standard NICU policy. During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89112], 
mothers will have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89113] u se.  Upon discharge, all mothers will be 
provided the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89114]. Mothers will be asked to bring vials from all pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_89115], regardless of appare nt 
results. While mothers  are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the mother or nurse will bring the vials to the NICU following each 
expression , where they will be deposited  in a refrigerator specified for storage of breast milk for all infants in 
the NICU. Once mothers go home, they will be instructed to store their vials of expressed breast milk in the 
refrigerator or freezer at home, and to bring vials to the NICU when visiting their infants (standard NICU policy ). 
All breast milk will be weighed by a breast milk techn ician blinded to th e group assignment  (Appendix D ). 
Mothers will be reminded 3 times per week —through phone calls , texts  or during visits to the NICU —to bring in 
their breast milk when they visit.

Data Entry and Management   
 
All data will be entered into a REDC ap database having integrated data quality and consistency checks (e.g., 
data-range) as part  of the data procedure. REDCap is a secure, web -based application for building and 
managing online surveys and databases. Using REDCap's stream -lined process for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89117], projects are designed and created online  from a  web browser using  the Online Designer  or  by 
[CONTACT_2164] a 'data dictionary' template file in Microsoft Excel, which is uploaded into REDCap. Both surveys 
and databases can be built using these methods.  REDCap provides automated export procedures for 
seamless data downloa ds to Excel and common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R), as well as a built -
in project calendar, a scheduling module, ad hoc reporting tools, and advanced features, such as branching 
logic, file uploading, and calculated fields.  The study databas e created in REDCap will be password -protected 
and housed on a designated database server,  which is protected by a computer firewall. Data quality will be 
monitored and assured: 1) as reported; and 2) as entered into the database. For the former, all hardc opy forms 
will be visually inspected before data entry. Furthermore, a manual comparison of randomly selected data 
hardcopy forms with data output listing generated from the study database will be performed, and consistency 
checks will be generated by [CONTACT_89141].  
 
All subjects eligible for eligible for enrollment will be registered and entered into the study database designed 
by [CONTACT_89142]. The system includes designated web servers and suppor ting database servers.

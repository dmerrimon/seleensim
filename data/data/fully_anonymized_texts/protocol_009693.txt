[ADDRESS_1194451] two conditions (Lyric4 only and Lyric4+Mod ified  Seals) across a sample 
of [ADDRESS_1194452] hearing ability associ ated with participation in this 
study. All sounds used in this study will be presented at safe listening levels. While using hearing aids, 
the following are possible occurrences:  
 •Cerumen impaction  
 •Ear discomfort, pain or soreness  
 •Sweat or moisture accumulation in the ear canal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_24277]  
 •A feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear  
 •Itching, blisters, or sores in the ear canal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_24277]  
 •Headache  
 •Redness of tissue  
The research personnel will review these risks with the subjects and answe r any questions they have. 
Hearing aids are not a significant risk investigational device as defined in the FDA 21 CFR 812.3(m).  
 
6 Endpoints  
To satisfy the primary objective, a subjective questionnaire will be administered to each pa rticipant after 
the 30 day trial period, before devices a re removed. Question domains will focus on intent to purchase, 
but may also include topi[INVESTIGATOR_857321].  
 
7 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteri a: 
-Mild to moderate bilateral hearing loss 
-Ear canal length minimum of 4 mm  
-Ear canal geometry such that a Lyric device can fit comfortably and is dee med an appropriate fit by [CONTACT_984]  
-Meets all other candidacy requir ements listed on the Lyric Candidacy form  (exclusions below)  
-18+ years  
-Willing to trial devices for 30 days with the k nowledg e they may not be able to purchase  
Exclusion crite ria: 
-History of radiation therapy to the h ead or neck  
-Middle ear conditions such as TM performation, PE tubes, or cholesteotoma  
-Requ ires regular MRI testing which would occur during study period  
-Unable or unwilling to tolerate the physical fit of a Lyric devie  
-Inability or unwilling to be seen for [ADDRESS_1194453] details and asked about their intent to purchase, before 
being told which device they were wearing. Simulated TSR for each group will be calculated based on 
the participants’ intent to purchase.  
All analysis of the results will occur at the conclusion of the study. All study data will be stored digitally. 
The data w ill be collected from the participants using paper questionnaires  or an online survey tool (i.e. 
Alchemer ) and then stored in an excel file for analysis. Collection of the questionnaire results will occur 
on an ongoing basis. The lead investigator will scan any paper questionnaires and send them to the 
study monitor via email. All original copi[INVESTIGATOR_857322] . 
 
[ADDRESS_1194454]’s status at each phase during the course of study. 
Participants cannot be identified in the CRF by [CONTACT_857323] d birth date but an appropriate coded 
identification is used. All study team members are authorized for the CRF entries and it is assured that 
any authorized person can be identified both for pCRFs and eCRFs. If pCRFs are used, the investigator’s 
initials and subject ID are documented and data are entered into an electronic file for analysis by [CONTACT_204054]. In case of a self -evident 
corrections, either the subject does it by [CONTACT_857324] i nvestigator undertakes the correction by 
[CONTACT_77679]/sentence with a single horizontal line and by [CONTACT_174319].  
The pCRFs/eCRFs are only available to the local s tudy team and to the monitor of the study.  
In the case of an audit or a serious adverse event, the CRFs may need to be de -anonymized and sent to 
the governing body (i.e FDA)  or insurance company.  
Any paper -based data will be stored in a locked filing cab inet at the investigation site. All electronic data 
will be stored on an access -restricted server owned, operated, and maintained by [CONTACT_204056]. Servers 
used to store data in this investigation are physically located in the US. Permission to access data wi ll be 
limited to study manager, monitor, PI, and essential research staff, as designated by [CONTACT_1961].  
The extent and nature of monitoring appropriate for the clinical investigation including the strategy for 
source data verification (SDV) are based on c onsiderations such as the objective, design, complexity, size 
critical data points and endpoints of the clinical investigation. A de -tailed plan for monitoring 
arrangements is provided separately from this CIP.  
 
12 Amendments to the CIP  
Any necessary amendments to the CIP will be communicated to the study manager/sponsor.  
A new version of the CIP will be written, with the necessary changes and justification, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_77661]. The a mended CIP will go through the approval process and necessary 
signatures obtained from the study manager/sponsor, PI, and statistician. The amended CIP will be 
uploaded to the eQMS system as an additional revision.  
 
[ADDRESS_1194455] the rights, safety and well -being of human participants under 
emergency circumstances may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the EC – such 
deviations will be documented and reported to the sponsor represent ative (Study Manager) and the EC 
as soon as possible. Apart from that the investigator is not allowed to deviate from this CIP unless that 
deviation does not influence the investigation data.  
 
[ADDRESS_1194456] in a private office 
located in the sub-investigat or’s clinic.  
 
Informed Consent will only be obtained by [CONTACT_204057].  
 
16 Adverse events, adverse device effects and device deficiencies  
Device deficiencies and all adverse events (AE) including all serious adverse events (SAE) are collected, 
fully investigated and documented in the source document and appropriate case report form (CRF) 
during the entire investigation period, i.e. from participant’s informed con sent until the last protocol -
specific procedure, including a safety follow -up period (ISO -[ZIP_CODE], 2020). Documentation includes dates 
of event, treatment, resolution, assessment of serious -ness and causal relationship to device and/or 
investigation procedure.  
Information on AEs is systematically collected during the regula r investigation visits, and phone calls (if 
applicable).  
The investigator(s) will follow -up on a biweekly basis with any participant experiencing an AE until either 
a) the participant reports resolution of the AE or b) [ADDRESS_1194457] passed since the partic ipant’s final 
visit. If, however, the participant’s condition worsens throughout the 8 week follow -up period, the 
investigator will continue to follow -up biweekly until the AE is resolved or the participant’s condition 
stabilizes over an 8 week period.  
The reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies follows the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 
and the MDCG 2020 -10/1 Safety Reporting in Clinical Investigations of Medical Devices under Regulation 
(EU) 2017/745.  
The causality assessment of the SAE wil l be conducted according to MDCG 2020 -10/1 Safety Reporting 
in Clinical Investigations of Medical Devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745.  
 
17 Vulnerable populations  
This investigation will not include any vulnerable populations.  
 
18  Suspension or premature termination of the clinical investigation  
The study will be terminated if the majority of the participants are not able to wear the devices for the 
study visit.  
The study will be terminated if the participants or researchers are exposed to safety risks other than 
those outlined in this document.  
The study may be terminated in the event natural disasters, widespread outbreak of illness, 
compromised structure of the investigation site, etc. that would make continuation of the study 
impossible or impractical. The study will be suspended within 5 days of determination that the study or 
device put participants at an unreasonable risk.  
If a participant is suspended, term inated, or withdraws from the study, their data can be traced with 
their unique study identification number.  
According to the FDA, follow -up is required for participants who experience Serious Adverse Events. 
Follow up will be conducted by [CONTACT_857325]/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_204050].  
 
19 Publication policy  
The clinical investigation will be registered in clinicaltrials.gov, a publicly accessible database, as required 
by U.S . regulations.  
The results of the clinical investigation will be published on clinicaltrials.gov no later than one calendar 
year following the final participant appointment.  
An internal report of the results of this investigation will be completed and uploaded to eQMS.

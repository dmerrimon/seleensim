Study Design:  This is a Phase [ADDRESS_489826] s 
will be randomized  (1:1 ratio)  to receive either KarXT or placebo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Subjects will start o n a lead -in dos e of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50  mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID  for the first 
2 days (Days  1 and 2) followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 (xanomeline 
100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week  1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards t o KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_489827]  is continuing to experience AEs from the previous 
dose increase of KarXT 100/[ADDRESS_489828] s who were increased 
to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_489829] the option to return to KarXT 100/[ADDRESS_489830] not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) 
of the study and may be decreased for tolerability reasons no more than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 
BID may  not occur outside of the p ermitted visit window for 
Visit  5/Day  8. 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed 
for all those subjects who d o not ro llover in to the long -term open -label 
study KAR -008.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489831] the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophreni a subjects with acute psychosis will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and 
secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_489832] and step down through 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marde r Factor score, CGI -S, 
and percentage of PANSS responders will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is sign ificant at the 0.05 alpha level (P  ≤ 0.05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key secondary 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, then formal statistical 
testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Reference Therapy:  Matching  placebo BID oral  
Treatment Duration:  Total study duration is up to 8 weeks, including a 7 -day screening phase (up 
to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is  allowed, if necessary) , a 
5-week treatment period , and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR -008 study) . Subjects completing this study will have 
the opti on of rolling over into a long -term open -label study (KAR -008) in 
which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy  Assessments : PANSS total score, PANSS positive score , PANSS negative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score,  and CGI -S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits . 
Safety  Assessments : Spontaneous AEs, cholinergic symptoms,  SAS, BARS , AIMS, body weight, 
body mass index , waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical 
laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, 
urinalysis, and drug screen), prolactin levels, physical examination, and 
C-SSRS will be evaluated throughout the study as scheduled.  
Pharmacokinetic  Assessments : AUC , Cmax, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population : All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population.  
Modified ITT (mITT) population : All subjects who are randomized, received 
at least [ADDRESS_489840] 
1 postbaseline PANSS  assessment will be included in the mITT population 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis.  
Safety population : All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in the safety 
analysis.  
PK population : All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will b e 
included in the PK population and will be used in the PK analysis. Subjects 
must have  received at least [ADDRESS_489841] 
1 measurable plasma  concentration  of study drug .  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 
PANSS total score at Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo  
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures.  The key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in PA NSS 
positive score, PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor 
score , CGI-S score , and percentage of PANSS responders at Week  5. The 
statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will 
account for multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a f ixed sequence testing procedure. This 
testing procedure will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested.  
Assuming the treatment difference in the change from baseline in PANSS 
total score at Week 5 is 8 points betwee n KarXT and placebo (standard 
deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 172 subjects  (86 evaluable 
subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  20 of 92 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long -term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive abilit y[1]. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the [LOCATION_002]  (US)  population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5.1  per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs) [5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. First-
generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with  these agents is marked 
by [CONTACT_240462] (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia , and they 
consequently have limited use today. The second -generation agents that include risperidone, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasi done, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34770] e, and lumateperone tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD class. However, 
the second -generation drugs also have problematic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic dis turbances, sedation , and akathisia [6, 7, 8]. These side effects contribute to 
poor medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] [9, 10]. Thus there 
is a need for medications for schizophrenia which  act through alternative mechanisms.  
Central m uscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1 -M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to 
the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease  [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by [CONTACT_390709] 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on  KarXT  (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240430])  
Xanomeline tartrate  is a muscarinic -cholinergic receptor agon ist. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M 1 and M 4 receptors  and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects 
(Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very potent M 4 muscarinic Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489853] in vivo, measured by [CONTACT_240464] [14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240431] a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate [15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action  is unrelated to direct dopamine invo lvement.  
Previous double -blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy.  In a multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) a nd placebo were assessed for 
26 weeks [16, 17]. Significant dose -dependent improvement s in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placeb o were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240432] s who 
were symptomatic at baseline and a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive imp rovement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive 
enhancement [16, 17]. In a subsequent small (N  = 20) double -blind, placebo -controlled inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relati vely rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed [18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “ pro-cholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by 
[CONTACT_240465]’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic  treatment. 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390586] a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes [19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ) and by [CONTACT_240466] [19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390587], consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure [20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390588] s ide effects 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating and hyper -salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers o f this combination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone [21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AE s were generally mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature, 
often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single -epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. In general, Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489854] s (KAR -004). KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001), with statistical separation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4 , and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability.  
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy o f KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg) administered twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnosis of schizophrenia . A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.

 Nonclinical Studies  
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice and rats. All animals w ere 
observed for [ADDRESS_489855] ivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typi[INVESTIGATOR_390590] s 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy were generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous -filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing).  
KarXT -301 was a 14 -day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats where relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390591], with either xanomeline alone or in combination with 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were a dministered either vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (split into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390592] 150/200 mg/kg/day or 
225/400  mg/kg/day, respectively (split into BID  doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma after the first and last doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in support of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target -organ toxicity revealed by [CONTACT_390710]. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489856] animals  administered 300 mg/kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral discharge, dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], irregular or labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and rough h air 
coat, among other observations. These findings are generally consistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three  TK animals in the low -dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combinati on treatment effects versus the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed to these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), then they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no microscopic evidence of toxicity was seen in any toxicity animals  
in this group or in the higher -dose combination group.  
Three  toxicology and 3 TK animal  deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high -dose combination 
group. Two toxicology animals h ad evidence of gavage accidents. For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined , and a test article -related effect cannot be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of esophageal muscular  is indicated some dosing -related trauma. If 
gavage accidents we re involved, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ microscopic findings in GI tract or any other tissue of any animal, 
including the early death toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics -mediated re duction in GI  motil ity is consistent with the anti -muscarinic 
effects of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390593]. Fecal retention, malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deterioration followed with continued dosing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose c ombination animals that survived led to rapid recovery, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics -related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any 
xanomeline -alone group. The lack of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any earl y death or 
surviving animal implies that the adverse effects were pharmacologically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity.  
Twenty -eight Day Repeat -Dose Studies with Xanomeline in Rats and Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0 %, 0.05 %, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monkeys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body weight in the high dose group, increases in gamma -glutamyl -
transferase, chole sterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), and lower serum globulin (females). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrhe a, hypoactiv ity, 
weight loss, and treatment -related tachycardia in the high -dose animals.  
Forty -Day Repeat Dose Study of KarXT in R ats (KarXT -302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were given vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 m g/kg/day, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390594] 100  mg/kg/day, 
or xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390595] 75/50 mg/kg/day or 150/100 mg/kg/day, with Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  24 of 92 all doses split into BID doses. Satellite rats (TK animals) were included for collection of plasma 
after the first and last doses to determine conce ntrations of each drug. Dosing was initially 
planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxicity was seen. Safety findings included pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the t rospi[INVESTIGATOR_390596]-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4 unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high -dose xanomeline alone group (150 g/kg/d ay) and 2 in the high -dose 
combi nation group (150  mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]). Both 
xanomeline -only animals had necropsy gross findings of a gavage accident , and cause of death 
could not be determined. All toxicology animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. Sp onsor

Based on the results of the 90 -day rat toxicology study, oral administration of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390597]:CD  (SD) rats BID (12 hours ±  60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 and 50 mg/kg/d ose trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 and 75  mg/kg/dose 
xanomeline tartrate , and a combination of 37/25, 75/25 , and 75/50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390598] a minimum of [ADDRESS_489857] 
hyperplasia in the livers of t he xanomeline tartrate and combination (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]) group males. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when comparing the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combination group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50  mg/kg/dose 
combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the 
terminal euthanasia. The bile duct hyperplasia was considered adverse in the h igh-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group males and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no -observed -adverse -effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 mg/kg /dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25  mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 146,000 
pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg •hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day  91. At these dosages  for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 9230 
pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] ; 267,000 pg •hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 16,700 + 171,000  pg•hr/mL for 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]  + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in females 
cannot be explained from differences in drug exposure. At the recovery euthanasia, bile duct 
hyperplasia was still present but was limited to minimal severity , and there was a decreased 
incidence in b oth the xanomeline tartrate and combination group males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combination groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased incidence/severity, in combination with the improved histolog ic 
appearance of bile ducts at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smaller/flattened epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], 
noninflammatory, and an absence of portal bridging), changes at the recovery euthanasia were Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489858] been tolerable by [CONTACT_390712]. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose 
was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 75  mg/kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. For 
males, corresponding  mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] ; 
822,000  pg•hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For females, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230  pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] ; 2,090,000  pg•hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 17,600 + 
950,000  pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91.  
In summary, no new  findings on the  “combination” of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerations of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomeline or trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390599]. 
Target organ findings with xanomeline alone were limited to biliary hyperplasia in the 28 -day rat 
study but not the 2 8-day or 12 -month  monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT, biliary hyperplasia was not observed in the 14 -day rat 
study but was reported in the 40 -day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre -neoplastic lesions, because they were  of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary -related 
serum chemi stry.  
 Completed Clinical Studies  
Refer to the IB for complete information regarding previous clinical studies conducted with 
xanomeline by [CONTACT_13440], and studies KAR -001, KAR -002, KAR -003, and KAR -[ADDRESS_489859] been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the combination drug KarXT ) in 
18 completed clinical studies conducted either by [CONTACT_240467] , some for as 
long as 3  years.  In those studies, significant improvements in cognition and reduced psychotic 
symptoms were observed.  
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the effects of xanomeline were examined in 20  subjects with  schizophrenia 
utilizing a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4 -week study design. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly better than subjects in the placebo group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24 -point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group showed improvements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domains of verbal learning and short -term memory function. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489860] blind manner. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). AEs 
included watery diarrhea, nausea, dizzine ss, sweating, shivering, mild disorientation, increased 
blood pressure (BP), increase in sitting and standing heart rate, slight increase in supi[INVESTIGATOR_390600], and postural hypotension.  
The clinical experience with KarXT initiated by [CONTACT_390713] t o date includes 
3 completed Phase 1, clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (KAR -001, KAR -002, 
and KAR -003) and one completed  Phase 2 study (KAR -004) in adult  inpatients with DSM -[ADDRESS_489861] study conducted b y Karuna, KAR -001 wa s “A Phase 1 , double -blind, randomized ,

[ADDRESS_489862], trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890].  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 m g daily + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 40 mg daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and well tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (although not statistically significant) in visual analog scale ( VAS ) 
scores for cholin ergic events for the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390602]. Specifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390603].  
Results of the clinician -administered scales were supportive of a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and sweating that interfered with daily activiti es in the 
xanomeline  + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390604].  
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in heart rate , resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment a rms had transient increases in heart rate  and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone arm) experienced syn cope. The incidence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one -half that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489863] commonly reported treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) in KAR -001 ( ≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were hyperh idrosis, salivary hypersecretion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences of these 5 TEAEs was higher in the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390605] (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with x anomeline [ADDRESS_489864] profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. The incidence 
of TEAE s and cholinergic TEAEs was lower in the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390606].  
Study KAR -002 was a Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, multiple -dose adaptive design pi[INVESTIGATOR_390607]. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + [ADDRESS_489865] time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as 
only 3  doses were given.  
Study KAR -003 was a Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, multiple -dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pi[INVESTIGATOR_390608]. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarXT at various dose combinations, administered BID . Subjects 
received either KarXT or placebo (3:1 ratio). All subjects on KarXT received 2 days of 50 mg

xanomeline on the PK and bioavailability of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], the PK results suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK behavior of the other drug.  
During th e 2-day lead -in phase, the most common AEs (≥20% of subjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that

Page  28 of 92 (66.7%) group compared to KarXT 125/40 group (88.9%) , the incidence of cholinergic TEAEs 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) was similar between the [ADDRESS_489867] commonly reported TEAEs (20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, dyspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria.  For the treatment groups that did not complete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were generally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing.  
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur primarily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390610] (KarXT 150/40  BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID , suggesting to consider slightly lowering 
the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390611] 40 mg BID in future studies . All TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs or deat hs. T reatment -emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few anticholinergic). Doses of 100 mg and 125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], respectively. The safety and 
tolerability p rofile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID was acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar doses in future studies. Doses of KarXT 150/20 BID and 
150/40  BID were not well tolerated in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg

tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM -5 schizophr enia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390613]. The primary objective of the study was to assess the ef ficacy of KarXT 125 /30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS total scores in adult inpatients with a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either K arXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/[ADDRESS_489868] 2 days 
followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 BID on Days  3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_489869] was continuing to experience AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/[ADDRESS_489870] as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction s in total 
PANSS score s at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001) in the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT ) population. The KarXT group showed a n adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to a n adjusted  mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS  score  (Figure 1). Substantia l significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; moreover, the difference appears 
to be widening with each successive timepoint. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the primary Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489871] , and Per Protocol populations (all 
with p  < 0.0001). Also, analyses exploring missingness via imputation for missing data at

The overall safety/tolerability data were also fairly unambiguous; among the highlights:  
 The overall discontinuation rate on KarXT was 20%, similar to placebo (21%). The  number 
of discontinuations due to TEAEs  was equal in the  KarXT and placebo arms (N  = 2 in each

 The overall TEAE  rate on KarXT was 54% vs 43% on  placebo  
 Most common TEAEs were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia,  and vomiting . 
None of these TEAEs were rated as severe, and none led to  discontinuations

Another Phase 3 study (KAR -007) is planned  at approximately 20 study sites in the US. 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT  and Study Rationale  
The risks and benefits of KarXT in humans are not fully known . KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890].  The available clinical trial data indicate that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs . Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful  EPS 
changes . In contrast, these serious side  effects pose a significant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead to discontinuation of treatment and sig nificant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration quality pi[INVESTIGATOR_240436] 182 subjects met the primary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo ( -17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 placebo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reduction in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points ( Weeks 2, 4 , and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0. 75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demonstrated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive symptom subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores , and CGI-S scores.  
More tha n [ADDRESS_489873] been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revealed any specific contraindications to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic related effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sweating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390615] a better tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT.

In a Phase 2 (K AR-004) c linical study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophren ia in subjects with acute psychosis  after treatment for [ADDRESS_489875]  common TEAEs being constipation, 
nausea,  dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic disorder) was reported by a single subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study.  KarXT was generally well -tolerated and found to be safe in this patient 
population.  
KarXT represents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningful alternative to current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population  by [CONTACT_240468] 3 trials . 
Subjects assigned to active study drug may benefit by [CONTACT_390714] a symptoms.  
Since subjects will be having an acute psychotic event, subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390617] 24 hours a day. In addition, the inpatient setting represents 
an important venue for research , examining the effects o f KarXT and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible, subjectivity and bias. Furthermore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adherence.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

7-day screening phase (up to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to 
KAR -008 study). Subjects com pleting this study will have the opt ion of rolling over into a 
long-term open -label study (KAR -008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Screening Period :  
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a  
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US  and 10 sites in Ukraine . Subjects will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1  ratio to receive either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5  weeks.  
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all subjects assigned to KarXT will start on a lead -in dose of 
KarXT  50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg /trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for th e first 2 days  (Days 1 and 2)  
followed by [CONTACT_240469]  100/20  (xanomeline 100 mg /trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_489877] is continuing to experience AEs from t he previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All

A randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study design is suitable for 
conductin g any interventional studies. This design will minimize bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safety parameters of the investigational drug.  
Schizophrenia is a long -term mental disorder which requires a chronic therapy.  A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered an acceptable treatment duration to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint can be achieved) . The [ADDRESS_489882]  has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study  visit (Visit 10/Day 35  (End of 
Treatment)  for subject s who roll over into KAR -008 or Visit 11/ Day 42 (Follow -up) for subject s 
who do not roll over into the KAR -008 study ) as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2) in accordance with the protocol . 
Subject s completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a long -term open -label 
study (KAR -008) in which every subject  will receive KarXT.  
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for subjects 
who d o not rollover in to the long -term open -label study.  
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety data from the clinical study. This 
committee will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new toxicities that might be 
involv ed with KarXT.  
The reviews will be of unblinded data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important safety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the details of the types of data to be  reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no triggers), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489883] meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:

Individuals who sign the  informed consent form  (ICF) to participate in the study  but who do not 
subsequently meet all the requirements for safety laboratory assessments  and therefore do not 
enroll  (screen failures)  may be rescreened , upon approval of the medical monitor on a case by 
[CONTACT_413] . Such individual s may be allowed to rescreen up to 1 time.  When re -testing within the 
same screening procedure, only the exclusio nary laboratory tests will be repeated once in case 
the exclusionary laboratory result was not due to a pathological condition and was occasional 
(except for individuals who have positive serology results).  
8.[ADDRESS_489892] be recorded on the electronic case report form (e CRF ). Subject s who 
complete or discontinue early from the study will be discharged  from  the study site , if clinically 
warranted  after completing all the Visit 10/early termination  assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed [ADDRESS_489893]  discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or 
baseline  values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_240471].  
Once a subject  is withdrawn from the study, the subject  will not re -enter the study.  
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study  at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following:  
 progressive disease  
 unacceptable toxicity or AE  
 subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a  subject ’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request or on the basis o f the investigator’s clinical judgment.  The 
reason for  subject  withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF.  
 intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study  
 general or specific changes in the  subject ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject  has need for a 
medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760])  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row] )  
 violation of entry criteria; ie, subject s who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria  
 development of suicidal or assaultive behavior  
 alcohol or illegal drug use  
 pregnancy, as indicated in Section  12.7.[ADDRESS_489894] who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study treatment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term.  
 Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study.  
Subject s wit hdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subject s who completed the stud y. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_1130] s who leave the unit or are lost to follow -up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of 
study will be followed until the AE is resolved  (regardless of w hether they enroll in the 
long-term open -label study KAR -008) or the subject  is considered to be in stable condition.  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making further treatment of subject s 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination.  
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240444], but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C).  
Therefore, women of childbearing potential in this study must be willing to use a highly effective 
method of birth control  (see APPENDIX [ADDRESS_489895] of acceptable highly effective methods of 
contraception) during the study and for [ADDRESS_489896] 
on Day 1 (before receiving KarXT) and Day 35.   
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_390621].  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489897] agree to use a highly effective  method of birth control ( see APPENDIX [ADDRESS_489898] of

during or for [ADDRESS_489899]  to undue risk 
will be performed . See Section 12.7.7  for further reporting and monitoring details.  
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form) of the eCRF, or 
a pregnancy  report will be completed if the subject has completed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted on the  Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using 
the same procedure as described for reporting SAE (Section 12.7.4 ).

8.6 Study Termination  
The availability of any new adverse safety information related to KarXT may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_77474]. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent E thics Committee (IEC) /Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take such actio ns. If the study is terminated for safety reasons, subjects 
will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow -up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subject s, and IEC/ IRB will be 
informed about the reason for such action. Similarly, if the Sponsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the IEC/ IRB, and the subject s of the reason for such an action. Similar 
notifications will be sent by [CONTACT_6179]/ IRB if it  takes such an action.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489901]

which is  loaded with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Each capsule contains the freebase equivalent of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240447]. In addition to the active 
ingredients, the drug beads contain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The beads are n ot coated 
and are formulated for immediate release of the active ingredients.  
 Identity of Study Treatments  
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish orange -white, opaque, and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be prepared in matching capsules ; 
therefore , an unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense study agent at each day of 
dosing. For the 2 -day lead -in period (Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will 
receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 B ID, followed by 2 capsules of KarXT 50/10 mg  BID or a 
dosage  of 100/20 BID for a total daily dosage  of 200/40 mg xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390622] 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week 2, dosing may be increased to 
2 capsules of Ka rXT 62.5/15 mg  or a dosage  of 125/30 BID for a total daily dosage  of 
250/60  mg xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], depending on clinical response and tolerability.

KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature  15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel.  
 Study Drug Retention  
Study drug  not used in KAR -009 may be used for the long -term extension study (KAR -008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study  must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program , and written authorization from the Sponso r has been 
received. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified 
by [CONTACT_2728]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, an d that appropriate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully 
accounted for by [CONTACT_11200].

 If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated  until the study visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20  or placebo before escalating  
to KarXT  100/20 or placebo.  
 This may res ult in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo dose at Visit  5/Day 8,

Considerations  
 If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is confirmed by [CONTACT_390716] 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for serial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table  2, 
Footnote  p). 
 Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must  accompan y the 
actual day of dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
 For Visit [ADDRESS_489906] ’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses ; there fore, Visit [ADDRESS_489907] accompany the actual day of 
Visit 8  if a window is used .

 Subjects willing to rollover in to Study KAR -008 will continued to be dosed at 
Visit  10/Day [ADDRESS_489908] dose will be the evening of Visit 10.  These subjects will 
start their at-home dosing on Day 1 of Study KAR -008. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject 
identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489909] s will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_489910] generated by  
[CONTACT_390717] . Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each  site participating in 
the study . For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance  (see Section 9.1.2 ). No other study site personnel  (except the pharmacist or other 
designated unblinded individual) , subject s, informants /caregiver s, Sponsor personnel , or Sponsor 
designees  (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor)  will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study  unless unblinding is required . Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the sub ject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject ’s study treatment, that  subject  will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be 
discontinued; approval from  the Sponsor /medical monitor must be obtained in such instances.  
VERISTAT  will generate and maintain the security of the randomization code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject ’s safety  or wellbeing,  the investigator may break the randomization code for just that 
subject  via the IWRS , by [CONTACT_390718]/Sponsor . The unblinding and its cause will  also be 
documented in the eCRF.  Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study.  
If an AE is thought to be related to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investigational t reatment and/or treat the subject . Subject  withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject has an AE that requires that the investigator be unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study 
medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in the subject ’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: I n most circumstances , it is not necessary to unblind a Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489911] s will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous preclinical and 
clinical studies (see Section  5.2). Per the protocol , subject s will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_489912] , and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor  or designee  for storage or disposal.  These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subject s. 
Administration of study drug will be supervised by [CONTACT_240473].  
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subject s were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply  and reconcile the products  received from the drug  
dispensing center.  Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor  or designee  until 
accountability has been fully monitored  through the end of the study . Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by [CONTACT_390719].  
9.[ADDRESS_489913] s will be asked for all prior medications he/she were taking up to [ADDRESS_489914] be recorded on the eCRF.  
During the stud y (ie, from the time of enrollment at the screening visit until study completion), 
subject s will refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without the specific prior Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489915] the minimum washout periods specified below and not take the 
medications for the duration of the study.  
 Within 5 half -lives  or 1 week , whichever is longer,  before  baseline ( Day -1), subjects  
could not hav e taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibitors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or any other 
psychoactive  medications except for anxiolytics that were taken on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
 Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could not have received a dose of 
medication for a t least 12 weeks ( 24 weeks for INVEGA TRIN ZA®).  
Note:  Please direct questions relating to prohibited medications to the Medical Monitor.  
 Concomitant  Medication s for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid  
Subject s are allowed to take benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (up to 6  mg lorazepam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitatio n, and insomnia. Subject s may also use non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_205657] 
(eg, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zaleplon) as a sleep aid. Study sites must record the use of rescue medications in 
the eCRF and subject ’s source document. Note: Cognition  testing should not be done within 
8 hours of receiving a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_390623].  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

subjects where it seems warranted, but this should  not be done  automatically.  
h. ECG on Day 1 will be done at 2 hours + [ADDRESS_489919] morning dose. ECGs  at all other scheduled visits will be performed before blood withdrawal for 
any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and QTcF  (msec)  
measurements should be obtained .  
i. Refer t o Table  [ADDRESS_489920]  may be performed at unscheduled visit s based on the Investigator’s discretion.  
k. Blood sample for prolactin must  be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug  at scheduled visits  (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests completed at Screening: anti -HCV antibody, HBV surface antigen, HBV c ore antibody, 
HIV-[ADDRESS_489921] tests positive for anti -HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain reaction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection.  
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subject s will be asked whether they have experienced constipation (per the ROME III criteria  and 
Bristol Stool Form scale ; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject  answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subject s to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant  
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not already an inpatient, the subject should be admitted to the inpatient  unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID  (first dose of study will be administered in the morning of Day 1, and evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.[ADDRESS_489922] PK sampling  [for Visits 5 and 8 ] is completed ), on an empty stomach  (ie, at least 
1 hour before a meal)  or [ADDRESS_489923] 4 dos ages of the 50 /20 BID before dose escalation to  KarXT  100/20  BID.  
p. For Visit 5/Day 8 and Visit 8/Day 28, 7 PK blood draws are required: before the morning dose, and at 0.5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 5 minutes, 
2 hours  ± 10 m inutes, 4  hours ± 10 minutes, 8 hours ± 10 minutes , and 12 hours ± 10 minutes after the morning dose  (Note: The [ADDRESS_489924]

not escalated  at Visit 5 /Day 8 ±  2 days . For Visit 10/ET, a single PK blood sample should be drawn before  discharge (preferably in t he morning) for 
completed (and early termination) subjects. One PK blood sample may also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported d uring a scheduled visit 
or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reported during an unschedule d visit (no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to 
an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and should be drawn before  discharge.  
q. It should be performed before PANSS assessment.  
r. It is recommended, if at all possible, that the  PANSS assessment should be performed before all the other scale assessments for all visits at 
which it is performed. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder  Factor.  
s. C-SSRS  first time use lifetime, other  times  use “Since Last Visit” version. At  the Unscheduled visit,  the C-SSRS  should  be performed  to monitor  subject s 
for suicidality.  
t. During screening, subject s will complete each of the CANTAB tests for familiarization purposes. These same tests will then be administered o n Visit s 
2a, 7, and 9. Note: Cognition testing cannot be done within 8 hours of receiving benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_390624] s.

10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing s are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Asse ssments 
(Table  2). Section  12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatmen t unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table  2). 
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include  PANSS and CGI -S scores . 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs ; cholinergic 
symptoms ; cognition testing  (CANTAB) ; SAS; BARS ; AIMS ; body weight ; BMI; waist 
circumference ; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory assess ments (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen) ; prolactin levels ; physical examination ; and 
C-SSRS . 
PK assessments are described in Section [ADDRESS_489930] igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject  to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require  follow  up or are considered by [CONTACT_190370].  The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  The assessments and procedures that may be  performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). Additional assessments

rating form contains [ADDRESS_489932] er Factor.  
It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments for all visits at which it is performed.   
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity  
The CGI -S is a rating scale  completed independently by a clinician  that is  used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subject s with mental disorders . It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of asse ssment. The modified CGI-S asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7 -point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline  
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating i s based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 
[ADDRESS_489933] the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

include s date of birth (alternatively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity , which  will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be rec orded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the  subject ’s preexisting conditions , including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history  at screening. Medical 
history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within [ADDRESS_489935] occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically note worthy must be recorded as AEs.  
12.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic v ital signs ( systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). All vital signs will be measured 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_240441] 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study.  During treatment, beginning with Day 1 , orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning  dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator ’s discre tion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out -of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measu rements must be recorded as 
AEs.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table  2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
12.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained.  ECG at Day 1 will be  performed 2 hours (+ 
15 minutes ) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis.  
All the ECGs obtained will be interpreted by [CONTACT_390720] (s) at the 
central laboratory.  
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject  from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.

Other Laboratory Assessments : 
 A National Institute on Drug Abuse -5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and cocaine) will be performed at screening and at 
Visit 2a (baseline) .  
 Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or blood alcohol test.  
 If a subject leaves the study site , he/she should have a urine drug screen test and test for 
alcohol (breathalyzer or blood alcohol test) upon returning to the study site . 
 Blood Sam pling for Pharmacogenetics  
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central laboratory facilit y, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The 
collection, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], processing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be 
used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.  
The gene tic variants  to be analyzed may include SNPs and any other variants as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  
The details on the statistical analysis will be provide d either in the statistical analysis plan (SAP)

12.7 Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those relat ed to the indication under study) Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489940]  enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical 
condition should  be reported in the subject ’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period , and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed  symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of  the study as soon as the results of the final lab oratory  tests 
are available.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of ev ent, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from th e 
time immediately after the administration of study drug on Day 1  until the End of Study (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over and Visit 11 for subjects who d o not roll over to Study KAR -008 
study)  or early termination . Follow  up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the ev ent should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events, version  5.0 (Grades 1 through 5).  
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_202847]  4 and Table  5. 
Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_390721] : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_19578] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

Page  66 of 92 Table  5. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_240481] : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test  drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_240482], environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administ ered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could n ot readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those  AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of th e drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_240483], environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pat tern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy adminis tered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the test drug.

 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AEs of special interest will be monitored. AE of special interest is orthostasis . 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate.  
 Serious Adverse Events  
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor , 
that: 
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening , 
 results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]

 results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity , and/or  
 is a cong enital anomaly/birth defect . 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs  if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject  and/o r require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220].  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug  is administered , during the study , or 
within [ADDRESS_489941] Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance email address  is:  
The event s must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by [CONTACT_202852], including clear and anonymized photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_73932], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and oth er documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. The investigator must report all additional follow -up evaluations to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance group within [ADDRESS_489942] ’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilize s, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures.

 Hepatic adjudication of cases should include an evaluation for alternative causes such as 
viral, autoimmune, alcohol, hepatobiliary disorders, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , 
concomitant medications, etc.  
 Follow  up to resolution of elevated liver enzymes.  
 Gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase elevations alone should not prompt drug 
discontinuation.  
 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions

Warnings and Precautions  
Risk of Urinary Retention : 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390625].  
Angioedema : 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], the 
active ingredient in trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390626]. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life 
threatening. If involvement of the  tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390627]/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided.  
Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility : 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390628]. Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with conditions such as ulcer ative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis.  
Controlled Narrow -angle Glaucoma : 
In subjects being treated for narrow -angle glaucoma, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390629].  
Central Nervous System Effects : 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390630]. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects  should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489947] experienc es 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.  
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Renal Impairment : 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390631]. The effects of moderate renal impai rment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in su bjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
 Pregnancy  
WOCBP  must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. After  administration of study drug, 
any known cases of pregnancy in female subject s will be reported until the subject  completes or 
withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor  (or designee) within 24  hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the investigator will follow up 
with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest 
possible time but not more than 30  days after completion of the pregnancy. The investigator 
should notify the Sponsor  (or desig nee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up 
pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved  spontaneous or therapeutic abortion 
(any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented ), stillbirth, neonatal

objectives.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC).  All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  
Summary statistics wil l be presented by [CONTACT_7169].  For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of subject s (N), mean  and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by [CONTACT_1570].  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the 
number  and proportion of subject s for each category by [CONTACT_1570].  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of change from baseline in  PANSS total score  at Week 5 is  
8 points between drug and placebo  (standard deviation 1 6), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90 .3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05  
(P ≤ 0.05) . With a dropout rate of 30% , a total of [ADDRESS_489960] s are estimated to be enrolled .

Negative Marder Factor score , CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS responders  will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant a t the 0.05 alpha level  (P ≤ 0.05), and  testing would 
continue through a pre -ordered list of key secondary efficacy endpoints . If at any point P  > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested . Table 7 outlines the testing procedure.

14.4 Efficacy Analysis  
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5  will be estimated using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM).  The model will include the  change from baseline 
PANSS t otal score s at Week 2, Week 3, Week 4 , and Week 5 as the response. The treatment 
difference at Week 5  will be estimated using contrasts. The MMRM will include the treatment 
group  (KarXT  or placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment group an d visit as 
fixed factors. Site, age, sex, and baseline PANSS total  score will be used as covariates in the 
model.  Low-enrolling sites will be pooled, if necessary, for modeling purposes. The algorithm 
for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP.  
Sensiti vity analys es of the primary efficacy endpoint may be performed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying treatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be specified in  the SAP. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score , and CGI -S) will be analyzed in 
the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie , using MMRM).  
The categorical secondary endpoint (percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups ( KarXT  and placebo) using the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis o f the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for 
multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequence testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested . 
14.5 Safety Analysis  
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher . The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by S ystem Organ Class and 
Preferred Term . All AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130] , along with information regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome . 
Orthostatic vital signs, clin ical laboratory data, prolactin levels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including observed  and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subject s with values outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by [CONTACT_1570]. Similar descriptive summaries will be provided for

may be performed. The details of the PK analysis will be desc ribed in the SAP. The 
noncompartmental analysis will be de scribed as a part of final clinical study report . 
14.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
14.8 Handling of Missing Data  
Several different methods to handle the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used.  
 For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood -based modeling approach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied.  
 Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoin t will be conducted using the last 
observation carried forward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_240486].  
 Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by [CONTACT_240487] a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute ). Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Helsinki and/or all relevant regulations , as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312, Subpart D, of Title 21 of 
the US Code o f Federal Regulations (CFR), in compliance with International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) and good clinical practice ( GCP ) guidelines , and all applicable local, state 
and federal government regulations and laws . 
 Independent Ethics Committee /Institutional Review Board  
Conduct of the study must be approved by [CONTACT_390724]/ IRB.  Approval is required for 
the study protocol, protocol amendments (if applicable), IB, ICFs,  recruitment material  and 
subject  information sheets  and other s ubject -facing material . 
 Informed Consent  
For each study  subject , written informed consent will be obtained before  any protocol -related 
activities.  As part of this procedure, the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_390636], its purpose, procedures, expected duration, alternative 
therapy available, and the benefits and risks involved in study participation . The subject  should 
be informed that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and the subject  will receiv e all 
information that is required by [CONTACT_99433].  The principal 
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_390637] a copy of the IEC-/IRB-approved 
ICF before  the start of the study.  
The ICF should be revised whenever there are substantial changes to procedures or when new 
information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the subject to participate. 
Revisions to the consent form required during the study must be approved by [CONTACT_390725]/ IRB, and a copy of the revised consent form is provided to the Sponsor. For any updated or 
revised consent forms, the subjects must be re -consented for continued participation in the study.  
A caregiver informed consent (Ukraine only) should be obtained befor e any data pertaining to 
him or her and the subject is collected.  
Subject  Registry (for the US only) : 
Clinical trial registries, such as clinical trial subject database (CTSdatabase) and Verified 
Clinical Trials (VCT), seek to reduce duplicate enrollment b y identifying potential protocol 
violations and duplicate subjects before randomization. At the time of providing the informed 
consent for the study, the investigator or designee will explain the IRB -approved Subject 
Database Authorization to the subject a nd witness the signature.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489964] received training and login 
information access (www.subjectregistry.com) to the database will enter the subject study ID 
number and authorized subject identifiers. Two reports, one from CTS and one from VCT , 
detailing any potential protocol violations or dual enrollment attempts will be generated and 
should be printed for source documentation. The reports will detail each protocol violation 
detected and specific wash out period dates where applicable.  Participants who are identified as 
verification failures by [CONTACT_390726].  
At the last subject contact, CTSdatabase and VCT staff will automatically close out the subject 
(safety follow -up, ET, or completer) based  on interactive response system  (IXRS) . 
Verified Clinical Trials  Registry (for Ukraine only) : 
At participating sites in Ukraine, VCT will be used to verify participants’ current and past 
research study status in order to mitigate safety concerns associated with duplicate enrollment 
and protocol deviations associated with multiple trial enrollment. Following proper regionally 
compliant informed consent and after obtaining a subject  number from IXRS, each participant 
will be checked in the VCT database. Partial identifiers will be utilized. Participants who are 
identified as verification failures by [CONTACT_390727].  
15.2 Data Handling  
Any data to be recorded directly on the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be 
identified at the start of the study.  Data reported on the eCRF that are derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepancies must be 
explained.  See also Section 15.3.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.[ADDRESS_489965] only include coded identifiers such 
that directly  identifying personal information is not transmitted.  The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet -based electronic data capture (EDC) system main tained by 
[CONTACT_80383].  Access to the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s 
secured internet web site, where a  user unique  assigned username [CONTACT_240489].  
Any changes made to data after collection will be  made through the use of the EDC system . 
Electronic CRFs will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been 
resolved.  
15.[ADDRESS_489966] 
access to source documents and/or source data in the fa cilitation of trial -related monitoring, 
audits, review by [CONTACT_80227]/IRBs, and regulatory inspections.  
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the si te’s trial  subject s. Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to 
source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be explained if necessary.  
Data recorded on source documents will be transcribed onto eCRFs. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_390638]. The completed eCRFs will 
be retained by [CONTACT_093].  
15.[ADDRESS_489967] 15 years after the completion 
or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study , at least [ADDRESS_489968]  health information, inclu ding, but not limited to, the

appropriate times during the study.  The Principal Inv estigator will assure him/her  and adequate 
site personnel are available throughout the study  to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical 
monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to check the completeness, 
clarity, and consisten cy of the data recorded in the eCRFs for each  subject . 
The invest igator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the invest igator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations , and GCP  
guidelines.  
15.6 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor  or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor  lies with the invest igator g enerating the data.  
The Sponsor  will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that 
the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP, and all applicable regulatory requiremen ts. Audits will be independent of and separate 
from the routine monitoring and quality control functions.  Quality assurance procedures will be 
performed at study sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data are 
adequate and well  documented.  
15.[ADDRESS_489970] of the study will be classed as administrative amendments 
and will be submitted to the IEC/ IRB for information only.  Syneos Health  will ensure that

will not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received other than in the case of an 
urgent safe ty measure . 
 Protocol  Deviations  
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor  must be informed as soon as possible.  Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study 
report.  Reporting of protocol de viations to the I EC/IRB and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory authority mandates is an invest igator ’s responsibility.  
 All protocol deviations will be tracked in the eCRF/ EDC system . Deviations considered 
major will be identified as such before study  unblinding  during medical monitor periodic 
review . 
Major protocol deviations will be tabulated including the frequency and percentage of subjects 
with each type of deviation by [CONTACT_1570].  
15.[ADDRESS_489972] ance with this protocol, the accepted version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and/or all relevant federal regulations, as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312,

Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must 
use at least [ADDRESS_489978] dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becomi ng 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cau se. A high 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_489979] a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently a nd correctly) and include:  
 combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
 progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibit ion of ovulation  
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)  
 intrauterine device  
 intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
 vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
 sexual  abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk  in relation to the duration of the clinical trial , in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the  subject ) 
All subject s will be strongly advised that t hey (or the female partners of male subject s) should 
not become pregnant wh ile on study treatment or for [ADDRESS_489980] report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and

Title of Study: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel-group, Placebo-co ntrolled, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the  Efficacy and Safety of KarXT in Acutely 
Psychotic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240423]-5 Schizophrenia 
Protocol Number: KAR-009 
Study Sites: Approximately 10 sites in the Un ited States and 10 sites in Ukr aine 
Phase of Development: Phase 3  
Objectives: Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to e valuate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434] [xanomeli ne 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in red ucing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome S cale (PANSS) total scores in ad ult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual‒Fifth Editi on (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS positive score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the improvement in C linical Global Impression-Sever ity 
(CGI-S) results in subjects trea ted with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS negative score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of P ANSS Marder Factor negative 
symptoms score in subjects treat ed with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390642] a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia 
Exploratory Objective: 
The exploratory objective of the study is to evaluate the singl e nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) regarding schizophrenia subtypes and SNPs related to 
drug metabolism.

Study Design: This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter in patient study in adults who a re 
acutely psychotic with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subj ects 
will be randomized (1: 1 ratio) to receive either KarXT or place bo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Su bjects will start on a lead-in d ose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the first  
2 days (Days 1 and 2) followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_489986] is continuing t o experience AEs from the pre vious 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID . All subjects who were increa sed

of the study and may be decrea sed for tolerability reasons no m ore than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 12 5/30 
BID may not occur outside of t he permitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8.

for all those subjects who do not rollover in to the long-term open-label 
study KAR-008.  
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophrenia subjects with acute psychosis will resul t in 
significantly greater reduction (i e, improvement) in the primar y and 
secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_489989] and step down t hrough 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an  alpha of 0.05 . Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive sco re, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S , 
and percentage of PANSS responder s will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0. 05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key seconda ry 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.0 5, then formal stati stical 
testing would stop. This will c ontrol the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Page 10 of 92 Planned Sample Size: A total of approximately 246 adult subjects (aged 18 to 65 year s, inclusive) 
are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment grou ps, either 
KarXT or placebo. 
Investigational Therapy: 1. Fixed dose KarXT 50/20 BID (50 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]), 
oral (Days 1 to 2) 
2. Fixed dose KarXT 100/20 BID (100 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]), oral (Days 3 to 7) 
3. Fixed dose KarXT 125/30 BID (125 mg xanomeline/30 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]), oral (Days 8 to 35, if tolerated) 
Reference Therapy: Matching placebo BID oral  
Treatment Duration: Total study duration is up to 8 w eeks, including a 7-day screen ing phase (up 
to a 7-day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if nece ssary), a 
5-week treatment period, and a 7- day follow-up period (only for  subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this stu dy will have 
the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label study (KAR-008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy Assessments: PANSS total score, PANSS positive score, PANSS ne gative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, and  CGI-S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits. 
Safety Assessments: Spontaneous AEs, cholinergic symptoms, SAS, BARS, AIMS, body we ight, 
body mass index, waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical 
laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagula tion, 
urinalysis, and drug screen), prolactin levels, physical examin ation, and 
C-SSRS will be evaluated through out the study as scheduled. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: AUC, C max, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits. 
Statistical Methods and Planned Analyses: Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population. 
Modified ITT (mITT) population: All subjects who are randomized , received 
at least [ADDRESS_490000] 
1 postbaseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT po pulation 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis. Safety population: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of  study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in t he safety 
analysis. PK population: All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile wi ll be 
included in the PK population an d will be used in the PK analys is. Subjects 
must have received at least [ADDRESS_490001] 
1 measurable plasma concentration of study drug.  The primary efficacy endpoint of t he study is the change from b aseline in 
PANSS total score at Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. Th e key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in P ANSS 
positive score, PANSS negative sc ore, PANSS Negative Marder Fac tor 
score, CGI-S score, and percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5. The 
statistical analysis of the pri mary and key secondary efficacy variables will 
account for multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequence testing proc edure. This 
testing procedure will control th e overall Type 1 error rate ac ross all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

5.1 Background on Schizophrenia 
Schizophrenia is a long-term men tal disorder involving a breakd own in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and pers onal relationships into fantasy  and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination , disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of sch izophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United Sta tes (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5 .1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, wit h males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schiz ophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs)[ 5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blocka ge of all or subsets of dopami ne receptors in the brain. First-
generation APDs include chlorpr omazine and haloperidol; treatme nt with these agents is marked 
by [CONTACT_390733] (EPS) and  tardive dyskinesia, and they 
consequently have limited use t oday. The second-generation agen ts that include risperidone, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasidone , aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and lumateper one tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are  currently the most commonly p rescribed APD class. However, 
the second-generation drugs also have problematic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic disturban ces, sedation, and akathisia[ 6, 7, 8]. These side effects contribute to 
poor medication adherence resulti ng in frequent relapses and ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_602][ 9, 10]. Thus there 
is a need for medications for s chizophrenia which act through a lternative mechanisms. 
Central muscarinic receptors  have been hypothesized to be thera peutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarin ic receptors (M1-M5). The th erapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor a gonism is thought to be due to ago nism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous  system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric  binding sites that  the receptor s share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of t hese peripheral receptors. Thus , any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophren ia (or other indications such  as Alzheimer’s disease [AD]) has 
been outweighed by [CONTACT_390734] 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390585])  
Xanomeline tartrate is a muscarinic-cholinergic receptor agonis t. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially s
timulates M 1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects 
(Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomelin e is a very potent M [ADDRESS_490010] in vivo, measured by [CONTACT_390735][ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240431] a brain to plasma ratio of greater than  10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate[ 15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any di rect binding activity on dopamin ergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action is unrel ated to direct dopamine involve ment. 
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relev ant antipsychotic efficacy. In a  multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo  were assessed for 
26 weeks[ 16, 17]. Significant dose-dependent imp rovements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placebo were observed. Moreover, p sychotic symptoms resolved qu ite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_390644] a nd a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analy sis, cognitive improvement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be nec essary for cognitive 
enhancement[ 16, 17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-control led inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant s ubjects with schizophrenia, xanom eline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid imp rovement in psychosis compared t o placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia t rials, as well as in previous  healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting , nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side e ffects were frequent and, at t he higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of disconti nuation in the AD studies. This “pro-cholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of  xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procho linergic AEs associated with xano meline are mediated by 
[CONTACT_240465]’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically a menable to counteracting peripher al anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390586] a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonis t which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes[ 19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by [CONTACT_390736] (FDA) and by [CONTACT_390737][ 19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390645], consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of t rospi[INVESTIGATOR_390646] 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweat ing and hyper-salivation) and  thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic re ceptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this co mbination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
rema
ining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in se verity and transient in nature, 
often lasting a few hours without  recurrence and were generally  single-epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. In general,

Page 22 of 92 KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These enc ouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for  the treatment of schizophrenia  and potentially other CNS 
disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well-controlled, randomized, multi-center 
Phase 2, placebo-controlled, inpa tient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subjects (KAR-004). KarXT demonstrated a statisticall y significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Nega tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), with statistical s eparation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4, and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg) administer ed twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophr enia. A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.  Xanomeline is currently not approved or marketed in any country . Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390647]. 
Nonclinical Studies 
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice  and rats. All animals were 
observed for [ADDRESS_490011] article included excessive 
muscarinic-mediated pharmacology, such as excessive salivation,  hypoactivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typi[INVESTIGATOR_390648] 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy wer e generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous-filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing). 
KarXT-301 was a 14-day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats wher e relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390591], with either xanomeline alon e or in combination with 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were administered e ither vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (spli t into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390649] 150/20 0 mg/kg/day or 
225/400 mg/kg/day, respectively (s plit into BID doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma af ter the first and la st doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in sup port of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target-organ toxic ity revealed by [CONTACT_390738]. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article. 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490012] was identified.  
Clinical observations noted in mos t animals administered 300 mg /kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral dischar ge, dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], irregular o r labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and rough hair 
coat, among other observations. The se findings are generally co nsistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three TK animals in the low-dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus  the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed t o these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), the n they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no mic roscopic evidence of toxicity w as seen in any toxicity animals 
in this group or i n the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination group. Two toxicology animals had evi dence of gavage accidents.  For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined, and a test article-related effect canno t be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of es ophageal muscular is indicated s ome dosing-related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involve d, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ micros copic findings in GI tract or an y other tissue of any animal, 
including the early deat h toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics-mediated reduction in GI motility is consist ent with the anti-muscarinic 
effects of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390650]. Fecal retention,  malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deteriora tion followed with continued do sing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose combination animals tha t survived led to rapid recove ry, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics-related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any xanomeline-alone group. The lac k of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or 
surviving animal implies that t he adverse effects were pharmaco logically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity. 
Twenty-eight Day Repeat-Dose St udies with Xanomeline in Rats an d Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0% , 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monke ys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived  until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body wei ght in the high dose group, incre ases in gamma-glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), a nd lower serum globulin (femal es). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of  intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrh ea, hypoactivity, 
weight loss, and treatment-relate d tachycardia in the high-dose animals. 
Forty-Day Repeat Dose Study of Kar XT in Rats (KarXT-302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were given vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day, tr ospi[INVESTIGATOR_390594] 100 mg/kg/day,

after the first and last doses to determine concentrations of e ach drug. Dosing was initially 
planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxic ity was seen. Safety findings inc luded pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390651] m ild biliary hyperplasia in the 
high-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4  unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high-dose xa nomeline alone group (150 g/kg/da y) and 2 in the high-dose 
combination group (150 mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]). Both

Based on the results of the 90-day rat toxicology study, oral a dministration of tro spi[INVESTIGATOR_390597]:CD (SD) rats BID (12 hours ± 60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 a nd 50 mg/kg/dose trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390652], 37 and 75 mg/kg/dose 
xanomeline tartrate, and a combination of 37/25, 75/25, and 75/ 50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390598]  a minimum of [ADDRESS_490013] 
hyperplasia in the livers of the  xanomeline tartrate and combin ation (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]) group mal es. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when compa ring the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combin ation group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose 
combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the terminal euthanasia. The bile duc t hyperplasia was considered a dverse in the high-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group male s and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed-adverse-effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the comb ination of xanomeline tartrate /trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 146,000 
pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi [INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 9230 
pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 267,000 pg• hr/mL for xanomeline; and 16, 700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL for 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in females 
cannot be explained from differe nces in drug exposure. At the r ecovery euthanasia, bile duct 
hyperplasia was still present but  was limited to minimal severi ty, and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomelin e tartrate and combination group  males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combinatio n groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased i ncidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts  at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smal ler/flattened epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], 
noninflammatory, and an absence of  portal bridging), changes at the recovery eut hanasia were 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490014] been tolerable by [CONTACT_390740]. Therefor e, the maximum tolerated dose 
was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dos e for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 75 mg /kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomelin e tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. For 
males, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL  for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For fem ales, corresponding mean plasma  AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 
950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Da y 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerati ons of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomelin e or trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390599]. 
Target organ findings with xanom eline alone were limited to bil iary hyperplasia in the 28-day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12- month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT , biliary hyperplasia was not o bserved in the 14-day rat 
study but was reported in the 40-day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre-neoplastic lesions, because they were of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary-related 
serum chemistry.

A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the effects of x anomeline were examined in 20  subjects with schizophrenia 
utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study desi gn. Subjects treated with

Overall, treatment with xanome line 225 mg daily + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 40 m g daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and w ell tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (a lthough not statistically signif icant) in visual analog scale (VAS) 
scores for cholinergic events for  the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390654]. S pecifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390655].  
Results of the clinician-administered scales were supportive of  a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and s weating that interfered with  daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390604]. 
There were no meaningful diffe rences between treatment groups i n heart rate, resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardi ogram (ECG) parameters includ ing QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment arms  had transient increases in hear t rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in  those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone a rm) experienced syncope. The inc idence of orthostatic AEs in the

and diarrhea. Subject incidences  of these 5 TEAEs was higher in  the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390605]  (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline [ADDRESS_490020] profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was  lower in the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390606].

the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390611] 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs w ere mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs  or deaths. Treatment-emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few antic holinergic). Doses of 100 mg and  125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] , respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID w as acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar dos es in future studies. Doses of  KarXT 150/20 BID and

Study KAR-004 was a Phase 2 ra ndomized, double-blinded study to  assess the safety 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM-5 schizophrenia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390657]. The primary objective of the study was to assess the  efficacy of KarXT 125/30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS to tal scores in adult inpatien ts with a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead-in dose of KarXT  50/[ADDRESS_490024] 2 days 
followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing w as titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490025] was continuing to experienc e AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/[ADDRESS_490026] as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically mea ningful mean reductions in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001) in the modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjuste d mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score (Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; more over, the difference appears 
to be widening with each succes sive timepoint. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the

5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT and Study Rationale 
The risks and benefits of KarXT  in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trosp ium. The available clinical trial data indica te that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs. Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these seri ous side effects pose a signifi cant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead t o discontinuation  of treatment and significant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration qualit y pi[INVESTIGATOR_240436] 182 subjects met the pr imary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo  with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.[ADDRESS_490029] bo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reductio n in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (Weeks 2, 4,  and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0.75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demons trated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive sympto m subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores, and CGI-S scores. 
More than [ADDRESS_490030] been exposed to xanom eline tartrate (oral 
formulation, either alone, in c ombination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These  early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revea led any specific contraindica tions to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic relat ed effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sw eating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The  addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390659] a bett er tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT.

In a Phase 2 (KAR-004) clini cal study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30 ) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia in sub jects with acute psychosis afte r treatment for [ADDRESS_490032] common T EAEs being constipation, 
nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TE AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic d isorder) was reported by a singl e subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study. KarXT was generally well-tolerated and f ound to be safe in this patient 
population. 
KarXT represents a novel appro ach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningf ul alternative t o current ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population by [CONTACT_240468] [ADDRESS_490033] s will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390617] 24 hours a day. In add ition, the inpatient setting represents

enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adher ence.

 Page 40 of 92 7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
A randomized, double-blind, parall el-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimiz e bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safet y parameters of the investigational drug. 
Schizophrenia is a long-term menta l disorder which requires a chronic therapy. A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered  an acceptable treatment durati on to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint ca n be achieved). The 5-week tre atment duration is substantiated 
by [CONTACT_390743] t outcome of the KAR-[ADDRESS_490040] has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit ( Visit 10/Day 35 (End of 
Treatment) for subjects who ro ll over into KAR-008 or Visit 11/Day 42 (Follow-up) for subjects 
who do not roll over into the KAR-008 study) as indicated in th e Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects completing this study wil l have the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label 
study (KAR-008) in which every sub ject will receive KarXT. 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for subjects 
who do not rollover in to the l ong-term open-label study. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee 
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group  of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a re gular basis accumulating safety data from the clinical study. This 
committee will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirm ing the safety of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for an y new toxicities that might be 
involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinde d data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important sa fety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the detail s of the types of data to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no trigger s), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.

complete or discontinue early f rom the study will be discharged  from the study site, if clinically 
warranted after completing all the Visit 10/early termination assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed [ADDRESS_490054] discontinues prematurely from the s tudy because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEA E will be followed up until it res olves (returns to normal or 
baseline values) or stabilizes , or until it is judged by [CONTACT_240471]. 
Once a subject is withdrawn fro m the study, the subject will no t re-enter the study. 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the stu dy at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE 
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject’s partici pation in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request  or on the basis of the investigat or’s clinical judgment. The 
reason for subject withdrawa l will be noted on the eCRF. 
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated  to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatmen t and necessitated the subject’s  termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes i n the subject’s condition that ren ders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the  inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject has need for a

• violation of entry criteria; ie,  subjects who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria 
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.7. Any study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study tre atment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term. 
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study. 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, pa rticularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who compl eted the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_390745] t he unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of study will be followed until the AE is resolved (regardless of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open-label study KAR-008) or the subject is considere d to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in  case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making fu rther treatment of subjects 
impossible. In this event, the i nvestigator(s) will be informed  of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy 
No evidence of mutagenicity, o r treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animal s following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well-controlled studi es in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390665], but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C). 
Therefore, women of childbearing potential in this study must b e willing to use a highly effective 
method of birth control (see APPENDIX [ADDRESS_490055] of acceptable highly effective methods of 
contraception) during the study and for [ADDRESS_490056] 
on Day 1 (before receiving KarXT) and Day 35.

available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subjects, and IEC/IRB will be 
informed about the reason for  such action. Similarly, if the Sp onsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the I EC/IRB, and the subjects of the reason for such an action. Similar

 Identity of Study Treatments 
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish orange-white, opaque, and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be pr epared in matching capsules; 
therefore, an unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense  study agent at each day of 
dosing. For the 2-day lead-in period (Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will 
receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 BID, followed by 2 capsule s of KarXT 50/10 mg BID or a 
dosage of 100/20 BID for a total daily dosage of 200/40 mg xano meline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390622] 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week  2, dosing may be increased to 
2 capsules of KarXT 62.5/15 mg or a dosage of 125/30 BID for a total daily dosage of 
250/60 mg xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], depending on clinical r esponse and tolerability.

 Study Drug Retention 
Study drug not used in KAR-009 may be used for the long-term ex tension study (KAR-008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program , and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at t he site or returned, as specified 
by [CONTACT_2728]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure t hat the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropri ate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully 
accounted for by [CONTACT_11200].

 Visit 2b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning, and the evening dose will be administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose.  
• All subjects must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 100/20 BID.

 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• When Day [ADDRESS_490065]’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day  visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated until the stud y visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20 or placebo before escalating to KarXT 100/20 or placebo. 
• This may result in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo d ose at Visit 5/Day 8, 
which is acceptable. 
• All subjects must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK Considerations and Visit 8/Day 28 P K 
Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is conf irmed by [CONTACT_390716] 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for ser ial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2 , 
Footnote p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of dose escalation for Visit 5.  
• For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; there fore, Visit [ADDRESS_490066] accompa ny the actual day of 
Visit 8 if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• Subjects willing to rollover in to Study KAR-008 will continued  to be dosed at 
Visit 10/Day 35, and their last dose will be the evening of Visit 10. These subjects will start their at-home dosing on Day 1 of Study KAR-008. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: S tudy Treatment Assignment 
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment 
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will a ssign a unique subject 
identification number to the s ubject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490067] of a t3-digit study code and a 3-digit site  identification followed by a 3-digit 
number assigned sequentially with in each site, starting at .  
On Day -1, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a  1:[ADDRESS_490068] generated by 
[CONTACT_390717]. Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or othe r 
designated unblinded individual) , subjects, informants/caregive rs, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study  treatment, that subject will be 
discontinued from the study unle ss there are ethical reasons fo r that subject not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be  obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT will generate and maintain the security of the randomi zation code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject’s safety or wellbeing, t he investigator may break the r andomization code for just that 
subject via the IWRS, by [CONTACT_390746]/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be relat ed to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investig ational treatment and/or treat t he subject. Subject withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. I f discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever t he duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject has an AE that requires that the investigator be  unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study 
medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in  the subject’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: In most circumstances, it is  not necessary to unblind a 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490069], even if an SAE has occu rred. For many drugs there is n o specific therapy for AEs. The 
appropriate course of action is t o stop the investigational dru g and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE. 
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the sa fety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subjects will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous pre clinical and 
clinical studies (see Section 5.2). Per the protocol, subjects  will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_490070], and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or d isposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects. 
Administration of study drug w ill be supervised by [CONTACT_240473]. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document th at the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigationa l product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by [CONTACT_390747] m onitor. 
9.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects will be asked for all prior medications he/she were ta king up to [ADDRESS_490071] be rec orded on the eCRF. 
During the study (ie, from the time of enrollment at the screen ing visit until study completion), 
subjects will refrain from the use of any new concomitant medic ations without the specific prior 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490072] the minimum washout periods spe cified below and not take the 
medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half-lives or 1 week, whichever is longer, before base line (Day -1), subjects 
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibi tors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tri cyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibito rs, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken  on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could no t have received a dose of 
medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRINZA®).  
Note: Please direct questions relating to prohibited medication s to the Medical Monitor. 
 Concomitant Medications for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subjects are allowed to take benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (up to 6 mg loraze pam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation, and insomnia. Subjects may also use non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_205657] 
(eg, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zaleplon) as a sl eep aid. Study sites must record the use of rescue medications in 
the eCRF and subject’s source document. Note: Cognition testing  should not be done within 
8 hours of receiving a benzodiazep ine or sleep medication.

The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician-admini stered scale used for measuring symptom severity of subjects 
with schizophrenia and is widel y used in the study of antipsych otic therapy[ 23]. The PANSS 
rating form contains [ADDRESS_490084] em scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. S ubjects are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion  of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approx imately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is  the sum of all scales with a m inimum score of 30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder Factor. 
It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments for  all visits at which it is performed.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI-S is a rating scale com pleted independently by a clinician that is used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subjects with mental disorders. It is u sed to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of  assessment. The modified CGI-S  asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical  experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 =  normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline 
mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating is based upon observe d and reported symptoms, behav ior, and function in the past 
[ADDRESS_490085] the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

Safety assessments (spontaneous AEs; cholinergic symptoms; cogn ition testing [CANTAB]; 
SAS; BARS; AIMS; body weight; BMI; waist circumference; orthostatic vital signs; ECG; 
clinical laboratory assessments  [hematology, clinical chemistry , coagulation, urinalysis, 
prolactin, and drug screen]; physi cal examination; and C-SSRS) are to be performed at 
protocol-specified visits, as s pecified in the Schedule of Asse ssments ( Table 2 ).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical and Psychiatric History 
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screenin g. The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alterna tively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity, which will be  obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Medical and psychiatric history w ill be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms  of the subject’s preexisting co nditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surg ical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include his tory of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within [ADDRESS_490086] occurring or de tected during the study and/or w orsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be docum ented as AEs on the eCRF in acc ordance with Section 12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medica l history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic vital signs (systol ic and diastolic  BP and heart ra te measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the  Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_240441] 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During tre atment, beginning with Day 1, orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning dose of the specified vi sit days, but additional orthos tatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically signific ant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repea ted at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinica lly significant vital sign me asurements must be recorded as

musculoskeletal, and circulator y systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination) will be performed at visits as specif ied in Table [ADDRESS_490087] Circumference 
Height (screening only), weight, a nd waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table 2 . BMI should be calculated at these visits. All findings should  be recorded 
in the eCRF. 12.5 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). During the ECG, ventricular ra te (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained. ECG at Day 1 will be  performed 2 hours (+ 
15 minutes) post morning dose. ECG s at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety lab oratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be i nterpreted by [CONTACT_390750](s) at the 
central laboratory. 
At screening, the investigator w ill examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed o r artifacts are present.

All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug-induc ed liver toxicity, detailed in 
Section 12.7.5 , during the study. 
Other Laboratory Assessments: 
• A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and cocaine) will be perf ormed at screening and at 
Visit 2a (baseline).  
• Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or blood alco hol test.  
• If a subject leaves the study site, he/she should have a urine drug screen test and test for 
alcohol (breathalyzer or blood al cohol test) upon returning to the study site. 
 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics 
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for explor atory pharmacogenetic analysis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA  extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central lab oratory facility, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The 
collection, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], p rocessing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be 
used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.

12.7 Adverse Events 
 Adverse Events 
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardle ss of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiat ric conditions (except those rel ated to the indication under study) 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490090] enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the c onditions were known before stud y inclusion; the medical 
condition should be reported in t he subject’s med ical history. 
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period,  and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. A Es will be elicited by [CONTACT_390752] e subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the r esults of the final laboratory tests 
are available. 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study d rug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is t o be classifie d as being seri ous or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are  to be documented on the eCRF. 
For the purposes of this st udy, the period of observation for c ollection of AEs extends from the 
time immediately after the ad ministration of study drug on Day 1 until the End of Study (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over a nd Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR-008 
study) or early termination. Follo w up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists un til the event resolves or stab ilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator. When changes in the intensity of  an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event shoul d be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be rec orded separately (with distinct  onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be grade d according to the National Ca ncer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classify ing AEs by [CONTACT_390753] 4  and Table 5 .

• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appr opriate medical judgment, are c onsidered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for  the identificati on of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into accoun t both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either t he Sponsor or the investigator  believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered, during the study, or 
within [ADDRESS_490092] Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance email address is:  
The events must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminar y reports of SAEs must be

Warnings and Precautions 
Risk of Urinary Retention: 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390626] s hould be administered with caution to subjects with clinically 
significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. 
Angioedema: 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tong ue, and/or larynx has been re ported with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], the 
active ingredient in trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390669]. In one case, an gioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Angioedema associated with upper air way swelling may be life 
threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or lary nx occurs, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390627]/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided. Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390670] G I obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastri c retention. Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], like other  antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with co nditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis. 
Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma:  
In subjects being treated for narro w-angle glaucoma, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390671] t he risks and in that circumsta nce only with careful monitoring. 
Central Nervous System Effects:  
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390672] d with anticholinergic CNS effects. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have bee n reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects should be mon itored for signs of anticholi nergic CNS effects, particularly 
Approved

anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinua tion should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Ren al Impairment:  
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390673] d by [CONTACT_10521]. The effects o f moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely  increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
 Pregnancy 
WOCBP must have a negative pregna ncy test at screening. After a dministration of study drug, 
any known cases of pregnancy in female subjects will be reported until the subject completes or 
withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow up 
with the subject until completi on of the pregnancy and must ass ess the outcome in the shortest 
possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the  pregnancy. The investigator 
should notify the Sponsor (or de signee) of the pregnancy outcom e by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up

the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Approximately 6 mL of blood to be collected at each 
scheduled time point. The actual date and time of each blood sa mple collection will be recorded. 
• Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanome line and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390632] 5/Day 8 ± 2 days  (first dose of fixed titrati on period) and Visit 8/Day 28 
± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time points on these days:  
• Before the morning dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours af ter the morning dose (Note: 
The 12-hour sample must be collected before administration of t he evening dose).  
• The 0.5 and 1 hour samples should be collected within ± 5 minut es of the scheduled time. 
The 2, 4, 8, and 12 hour samples should be collected within ± [ADDRESS_490106] time of each PK draw 
and dosing times are recorded in the eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the 
specified times of collection. 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of potential dose escalation for Visit 5. 
•  For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If vi sit windows are used for 
Visit 8, the PK sampling should occur at least [ADDRESS_490107] 
accompany the actual day of Visit 8.  
Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before discharge (pref erably in the morning) at 
Visit 10/Day 35 -2 days or ET. In addition, one PK sample may b e drawn if a 
relevant/significant AE is repo rted during a scheduled visit or  if there is a dose adjustment 
or relevant/significant AE repor ted during an unscheduled visit  (no multiple draws). For an

Page 76 of 92 14 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This doc ument will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analy sis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences. 
The statistical evaluati on will be performed using SAS® software vers ion 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary  tables will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_7169]. For continu ous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of s ubjects (N), mean and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by [CONTACT_1570]. For categorical variables, data  will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subjects for each category by [CONTACT_22058] t group. 
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of  change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 
8 points between drug and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 9 0.3% for a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects  are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
All subjects who are randomize d to the study will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population 
All subjects who are randomize d, received at least [ADDRESS_490108] and step down 
through the statistical testi ng of each endpoint using an alpha  of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS n egative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS re sponders will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha l evel (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would 
continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy e ndpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control t he overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested. Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

KarXT vs Placebo 
1. Change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 
2. Change from baseline in PANSS positive score at Week 5 
3. Change from baseline in PANSS negative score at Week 5

5. Change from baseline in CGI-S score at Week 5 
6. Percentage of PANSS responders ( a 30% change in PANSS total sco re) at Week 5  
 
14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from b aseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5 will be estimated using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include the change from baseline 
PANSS total scores at Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, and Week 5 as the  response. The treatment 
difference at Week 5 will be estimated using contrasts. The MMRM will include the treatment 
group (KarXT or placebo), visit, a nd the interaction between th e treatment group and visit as 
fixed factors. Site, age, sex, a nd baseline PANSS total score w ill be used as covariates in the 
model. Low-enrolling sites will  be pooled, if necessary, for modeling purposes. The algorithm 
for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be pe rformed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying tr eatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. The sensitivity analy ses of the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP.

 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Wee k 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in 
the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMR M).  
The categorical secondary endpoint ( percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT and placebo) using  the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary effic acy variables will account for 
multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequence testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested. 
14.5 Safety Analysis 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher. The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by  [CONTACT_177346]. All AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], along with i nformation regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome. 
Orthostatic vital signs, clinical laboratory data, prolactin levels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, i ncluding observed and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with value s outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by [CONTACT_1570]. Similar descriptiv e summaries will be provided for 
C-SSRS, SAS, BARS, change in c ognition (CANTAB), AIMS, body wei ght, BMI, and waist 
circumference. 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
• PK results will be listed for all subjects who received active treatment. The profiles or time 
points obtained with protocol de viations affecting PK results w ill be flagged and may be 
excluded from summaries and analyses. 
• The data will be presented graphi cally via individual plots and  mean plots summarized by 
[CONTACT_29628], visit, and time point.  
• PK parameters for xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390635]. Actual time elapsed from d osing will be used to 
estimate all individual PK parameters. The primary PK parameters of interest will include 
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from [ADDRESS_490109] measurable concentration).

noncompartmental analysis will be  described as a part of final clinical study report. 
14.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is  planned for this study. 
14.8 Handling of Missing Data 
Several different methods to handl e the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used. 
• For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling ap proach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied. 
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the last 
observation carried for ward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_390759] P ANSS total score carried forwar d.  
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by [CONTACT_390760] a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute).

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men whose sexual pa rtners are WOCBP must 
use at least [ADDRESS_490121] dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarch e and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bila teral oophorecto my. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 mont hs without an alternative medic al cause. A high 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_490122] a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contrac eption associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administ ration may be oral, intravagin al, or transdermal) 
• progestogen-only hormonal contrace ption associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(administration may be oral, injectable, or implantable) 
• intrauterine device 
• intrauterine horm one-releasing system 
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion 
• vasectomy (provided that the mal e has a medical assessment of surgical success) 
• sexual abstinence (defined as re fraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk in relation to the  duration of the clinical tria l, in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject)

Title of Study: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel-group, Placebo-co ntrolled, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the  Efficacy and Safety of KarXT in Acutely 
Psychotic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240423]-5 Schizophrenia 
Protocol Number: KAR-009 
Study Sites: Approximately 10 sites in the Un ited States and 10 sites in Ukr aine 
Phase of Development: Phase 3  
Objectives: Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to e valuate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434] [xanomeli ne 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in red ucing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome S cale (PANSS) total scores in ad ult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual‒Fifth Editi on (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS positive score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the improvement in C linical Global Impression-Sever ity 
(CGI-S) results in subjects trea ted with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS negative score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of P ANSS Marder Factor negative 
symptoms score in subjects treat ed with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390642] a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia 
Exploratory Objectives : 
The exploratory objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the change in cognition measuring core domains of 
impairment in schizophrenia using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) 
• To evaluate the change in prolactin levels after administration  of 
KarXT 
• To evaluate the single nucleotid e polymorphisms (SNPs) regardin g 
schizophrenia subtypes and SNPs related to drug metabolism.

Study Design: This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter in patient study in adults who a re 
acutely psychotic with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subj ects 
will be randomized (1: 1 ratio) to receive either KarXT or place bo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Su bjects will start on a lead-in d ose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the first  
2 days (Days 1 and 2) followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490127] is continuing t o experience AEs from the pre vious 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID . All subjects who were increa sed

Page 7 of 96 BID may not occur outside of t he permitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8. 
A safety follow-up v isit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be pe rformed 
for all those subjects who do not rollover in to the long-term open-label 
study KAR-008.  The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophrenia subjects with acute psychosis will resul t in 
significantly greater reduction (i e, improvement) in the primar y and 
secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_490130] and step down t hrough 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an  alpha of 0.05 . Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive sco re, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S , 
and percentage of PANSS responder s will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0. 05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key seconda ry 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.0 5, then formal stati stical 
testing would stop. This will c ontrol the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Page 20 of 96 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia 
Schizophrenia is a long-term men tal disorder involving a breakd own in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and pers onal relationships into fantasy  and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination , disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of sch izophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United Sta tes (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5 .1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, wit h males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schiz ophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs)[ 5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blocka ge of all or subsets of dopami ne receptors in the brain. 
First-generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; t reatment with these agents is 
marked by [CONTACT_390765] n extrapyramidal symptoms (E PS) and tardive dyskinesia, 
and they consequently have lim ited use today. The second-genera tion agents that include 
risperidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi [INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasidone, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and lumateperone tend to have 
lower levels of EPS or tardive  dyskinesia and are currently the  most commonly prescribed APD 
class. However, the second-gene ration drugs also have problemat ic side effects that include 
significant weight gain, metabo lic disturbances, sedation, and akathisia[ 6,7,8]. These side effects 
contribute to poor medication adh erence resulting in frequent r elapses and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602][ 9,10]. 
Thus there is a need for medica tions for schizophrenia which ac t through alternative 
mechanisms. 
Central muscarinic receptors  have been hypothesized to be thera peutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarin ic receptors (M1-M5). The th erapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor a gonism is thought to be due to ago nism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous  system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric  binding sites that  the receptor s share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of t hese peripheral receptors. Thus , any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophren ia (or other indications such  as Alzheimer’s disease [AD]) has 
been outweighed by [CONTACT_390734] 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390585])  
Xanomeline tartrate is a muscarinic-cholinergic receptor agonis t. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M
1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects

Page 21 of 96 (Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomelin e is a very potent M [ADDRESS_490150] in vivo, measured by [CONTACT_390735][ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240431] a brain to plasma ratio of greater than  10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate[ 15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any di rect binding activity on dopamin ergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action is unrel ated to direct dopamine involve ment. 
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relev ant antipsychotic efficacy. In a  multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo  were assessed for 
26 weeks[ 16,17]. Significant dose-dependent imp rovements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placebo were observed. Moreover, p sychotic symptoms resolved qu ite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_390644] a nd a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analy sis, cognitive improvement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be nec essary for cognitive 
enhancement[ 16,17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-control led inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant s ubjects with schizophrenia, xanom eline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid imp rovement in psychosis compared t o placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia t rials, as well as in previous  healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting , nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side e ffects were frequent and, at t he higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of disconti nuation in the AD studies. This “procholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of  xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procho linergic AEs associated with xano meline are mediated by 
[CONTACT_240465]’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically a menable to counteracting peripher al anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390586] a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonis t which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes[ 19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by [CONTACT_390736] (FDA) and by [CONTACT_390737][ 19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390645], consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of t rospi[INVESTIGATOR_390646] 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweat ing and hyper-salivation) and  thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stim
ulate brain muscarinic re ceptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this co mbination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in se verity and transient in nature,

Page 22 of 96 often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single-epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. In general, 
KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These enc ouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for  the treatment of schizophrenia  and potentially other CNS 
disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well-controlled, randomized, multi-center 
Phase 2, placebo-controlled, inpa tient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subjects (KAR-004). KarXT demonstrated a statisticall y significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Nega tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), with statistical s eparation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4, and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg) administer ed twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophr enia. A placebo arm is included

Nonclinical Studies 
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. 
More detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice  and rats. All animals were 
observed for [ADDRESS_490151] article included excessive 
muscarinic-mediated pharmacology, such as excessive salivation,  hypoactivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typi[INVESTIGATOR_390648] 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy wer e generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous-filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing). 
KarXT-301 was a 14-day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats wher e relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390591], with either xanomeline alon e or in combination with 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were administered e ither vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (spli t into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390649] 150/20 0 mg/kg/day or 
225/400 mg/kg/day, respectively (s plit into BID doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma af ter the first and la st doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in sup port of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target-organ toxic ity revealed by [CONTACT_390738]. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article. 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490152] was identified.  
Clinical observations noted in mos t animals administered 300 mg /kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral dischar ge, dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], irregular o r labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and rough hair 
coat, among other observations. The se findings are generally co nsistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three TK animals in the low-dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus  the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed t o these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), the n they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no mic roscopic evidence of toxicity w as seen in any toxicity animals 
in this group or i n the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination group. Two toxicology animals had evi dence of gavage accidents.  For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined, and a test article-related effect canno t be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of es ophageal muscular is indicated s ome dosing-related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involve d, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ micros copic findings in GI tract or an y other tissue of any animal, 
including the early deat h toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics-mediated reduction in GI motility is consist ent with the anti-muscarinic 
effects of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390650]. Fecal retention,  malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deteriora tion followed with continued do sing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose combination animals tha t survived led to rapid recove ry, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics-related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any xanomeline-alone group. The lac k of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or 
surviving animal implies that t he adverse effects were pharmaco logically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity. 
Twenty-eight Day Repeat-Dose St udies with Xanomeline in Rats an d Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0% , 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monke ys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived  until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body wei ght in the high dose group, incre ases in gamma-glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile  duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), a nd lower serum globulin (femal es). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of  intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrh ea, hypoactivity,

trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]) group mal es. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when compa ring the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combin ation group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose 
combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the terminal euthanasia. The bile duc t hyperplasia was considered a dverse in the high-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group male s and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed-adverse-effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the comb ination of xanomeline tartrate /trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
146,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL fo r trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 267,000 pg• hr/mL for xanomeline; an d 16,700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL 
for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence  of bile duct hyperplasia in 
females cannot be explained from  differences in drug exposure. At the recovery e uthanasia, bile 
duct hyperplasia was still pres ent but was limited to minimal s everity, and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomelin e tartrate and combination group  males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combinatio n groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased i ncidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts  at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smal ler/flattened epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], 
noninflammatory, and an absence of  portal bridging), changes at the recovery eut hanasia were

was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dos e for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 75 mg /kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomelin e tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. For 
males, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL  for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For fem ales, corresponding mean plasma  AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 
950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Da y 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerati ons of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomelin e or trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390599]. 
Target organ findings with xanom eline alone were limited to bil iary hyperplasia in the 28-day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12- month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT , biliary hyperplasia was not o bserved in the 14-day rat 
study but was reported in the 40-day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre-neoplastic lesions, because they were of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary-related 
serum chemistry.

A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the effects of x anomeline were examined in 20  subjects with schizophrenia 
utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study desi gn. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly be tter than subjects in the placeb o group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24-point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group sh owed improvements relative to

Overall, treatment with xanome line 225 mg daily + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 40 m g daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and w ell tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (a lthough not statistically signif icant) in visual analog scale (VAS) 
scores for cholinergic events for  the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390654]. S pecifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390655].  
Results of the clinician-administered scales were supportive of  a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and s weating that interfered with  daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390604]. 
There were no meaningful diffe rences between treatment groups i n heart rate, resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardi ogram (ECG) parameters includ ing QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment arms  had transient increases in hear t rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in  those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone a rm) experienced syncope. The inc idence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-h alf that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.

and diarrhea. Subject incidences  of these 5 TEAEs was higher in  the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390605]  (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline [ADDRESS_490160] profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was  lower in the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390606].

group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were g enerally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing.  
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur primarily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390610] (KarXT 150/40 BID and KarXT 125/4 0 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID, suggesting  to consider slightly lowering 
the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390611] 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs w ere mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs  or deaths. Treatment-emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few antic holinergic). Doses of 100 mg and  125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] , respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID w as acceptable and supports

versus placebo in reducing PANSS to tal scores in adult inpatien ts with a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead-in dose of KarXT  50/[ADDRESS_490164] 2 days 
followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing w as titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490165] was continuing to experienc e AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/[ADDRESS_490166] as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically mea ningful mean reductions in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001) in the modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjuste d mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score (Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; more over, the difference appears

5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT and Study Rationale 
The risks and benefits of KarXT  in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trosp ium. The available clinical trial data indica te that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs. Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these seri ous side effects pose a signifi cant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead t o discontinuation  of treatment and significant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration qualit y pi[INVESTIGATOR_240436] 182 subjects met the pr imary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo  with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.[ADDRESS_490169] bo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reductio n in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (Weeks 2, 4,  and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0.75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demons trated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive sympto m subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores, and CGI-S scores. 
More than [ADDRESS_490170] been exposed to xanom eline tartrate (oral 
formulation, either alone, in c ombination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These  early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revea led any specific contraindica tions to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic relat ed effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sw eating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The  addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390659] a bett er tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT.

In a Phase 2 (KAR-004) clini cal study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30 ) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia in sub jects with acute psychosis afte r treatment for [ADDRESS_490172] common T EAEs being constipation, 
nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TE AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic d isorder) was reported by a singl e subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study. KarXT was generally well-tolerated and f ound to be safe in this patient 
population. 
KarXT represents a novel appro ach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningf ul alternative t o current ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population by [CONTACT_240468] [ADDRESS_490173] s will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390617] 24 hours a day. In add ition, the inpatient setting represents 
an important venue for research, examining the effects of KarXT  and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible , subjectivity and bias. Furthermore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adher ence.

Screening Period:  
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize app roximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US and 10 sites in Ukraine. Subje cts will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receiv e either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5 weeks. 
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all s ubjects assigned to KarXT will st art on a lead-in dose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the first  2 days (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490175] is continuing to expe rience AEs from the previous d ose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All 
subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490176] the opti on to return to KarXT 100/[ADDRESS_490177] not  change after Visit 7 (Day 21)  of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerab ility reasons no more t han once during the  study. In addition, dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID may not occur outside of the per mitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8.  
All randomized subjects will have structured diagnostic intervi ew sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study (see Schedule of Assessments Table 2 ). Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed. 
Efficacy assessments (PANSS scores and CGI-S score) will be ass essed at scheduled visits.

 Page 41 of 96 7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
A randomized, double-blind, parall el-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimiz e bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safet y parameters of the investigational drug. 
Schizophrenia is a long-term menta l disorder which requires a chronic therapy. A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered  an acceptable treatment durati on to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint ca n be achieved). The 5-week tre atment duration is substantiated 
by [CONTACT_390743] t outcome of the KAR-[ADDRESS_490180] has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit ( Visit 10/Day 35 [End of 
Treatment] for subjects who ro ll over into KAR-008 or Visit 11/Day 42 [Follow-up] for subjects 
who do not roll over into the KAR-008 study) as indicated in th e Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects completing this study wil l have the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label 
study (KAR-008) in which every subj ect will receive KarXT, following completion of 
Visit 10/Day 35 of the cu rrent study (KAR-009). 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed [ADDRESS_490181] completed Visit 10/Day 35 but do not rollover in to th e long-term open-label study. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee 
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group  of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a re gular basis accumulating safety a nd tolerability data from the 
clinical study. The ISMC will include 3 clinicians and a report ing statistician. This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for an y new toxicities that might be 
involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinde d data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important sa fety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the detail s of the types of data to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no trigger s), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.

Once a subject is withdrawn fro m the study, the subject will no t re-enter the study. 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the stu dy at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE 
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject’s partici pation in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request . The reason for subject withdrawa l will be noted on the

reaches term 
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, pa rticularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who compl eted the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_390745] t he unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of study will be followed until the AE is resolved (regardless of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open-label study KAR-008) or the subject is considere d to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in  case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making fu rther treatment of subjects 
impossible. In this event, the i nvestigator(s) will be informed  of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy 
No evidence of mutagenicity, o r treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animal s following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well-controlled studi es in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390665], but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (FDA

 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 100/20 or placebo level is conf irmed by [CONTACT_390716] 3/Day 3, that dose is to be administered in the morning. 
• When Day [ADDRESS_490205]’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day  visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated until the stud y visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20 or placebo before escalating to KarXT 100/20 or placebo. 
• This may result in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo d ose at Visit 5/Day 8, 
which is acceptable. 
• All subjects must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 or placebo BID.

Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is conf irmed by [CONTACT_390716] 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for ser ial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2 ,

• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of dose escalation for Visit 5.  
• For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; therefore, there must be no changes in dose for at least [ADDRESS_490206] accompany the 
actual day of Visit 8 if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• All subjects will receive their final dose of KarXT or placebo on the morning of 
Visit 10/Day 35. It is intended that subjects rolling over to K AR-008 will begin 
open-label treatment the next day in the morning.

 Method of Study Treatment Assignment 
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will a ssign a unique subject 
identification number to the s ubject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject  who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obt ain a Subject Number. This 9-digit 
number will consist of a t3-digit study code and a 3-digit site  identification followed by a 3-digit 
subject number assigned sequentially within each site, starting  at . 
On Day -1, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a  1:[ADDRESS_490207] generated by 
[CONTACT_390717]. Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or othe r 
designated unblinded individual) , subjects, informants/caregive rs, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study  treatment, that subject will be 
discontinued from the study unle ss there are ethical reasons fo r that subject not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be  obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT will generate and maintain the security of the randomi zation code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject’s safety or wellbeing, t he investigator may break the r andomization code for just that 
subject via the IWRS, by [CONTACT_390746]/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be relat ed to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investig ational treatment and/or treat t he subject. Subject withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. I f discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490208]’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: In most circumstances, it is  not necessary to unblind a 
subject, even if an SAE has occu rred. For many drugs there is n o specific therapy for AEs. The 
appropriate course of action is t o stop the investigational dru g and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE. 
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the sa fety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subjects will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous pre clinical and 
clinical studies (see Section 5.2). Per the protocol, subjects  will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_490209], and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or d isposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects. 
Administration of study drug w ill be supervised by [CONTACT_240473]. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document th at the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigationa l product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by [CONTACT_390747] m onitor. 
9.[ADDRESS_490210] be rec orded on the eCRF. 
During the study (ie, from the time of screening visit until st udy completion), subjects will 
refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without  the specific prior approval of 
the investigator. The administration of any other concomitant m edications during the study 
period is prohibited without the  prior approval of the investig ator unless its use is deemed 
necessary in a medical emergency. Any medication or therapy tha t is taken by [CONTACT_390766]. The entry must include 
the dose, regimen, route, indication, dates of use, and time of use (only for concomitant 
medications used on an as-needed [PRN] basis). 
After written informed consent is  obtained from the subject, th ose subjects who are taking the 
following medications must have the minimum washout periods spe cified below and not take the 
medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half-lives or 1 week, whichever is longer, before base line (Day -1), subjects 
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibi tors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tri cyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibito rs, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken  on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could no t have received a dose of 
medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRINZA®).  
Note: Please direct questions relating to prohibited medication s to the Medical Monitor. 
 Concomitant Medications for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subjects are allowed to take benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (up to 6 mg loraze pam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation, and insomnia on a PRN basis. Subjects may also use non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_240449] (eg, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zaleplon) as a sleep aid also on a P RN basis. Study sites must record 
the use of such medications in th e eCRF on a per-administration  basis and subject’s source 
document. Note: Cognition test ing should not be done within 8 hours of receiving a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_390623].

subjects who are escalated in th e morning of Visit 5/Day 8 ± [ADDRESS_490219] also be drawn in relation to the morning do se for subjects who are 
not escalated at Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days. For Visit 10/ET, a sin gle PK blood sample should be withdrawn before discharge (prefe rably in the morning 
after the last dose of the study drug). One PK blood sample may  also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported during  a scheduled visit or if 
there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reporte d during an unscheduled visit (n o multiple draws). For an ET Vi sit that is related to an 
AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and sho uld be drawn before discharge. 
q. It should be performed before PANSS assessment.

all visits at which it is perform ed. The PANSS assessment inclu des the Marder Factor. 
s. C-SSRS first time use lifetime, other times use “Since Last Visit” version. At the Unscheduled visit, the C-SSRS should be per formed to monitor subjects 
for suicidality. 
t. During screening, subjects will complete each of the CANTAB tes ts for familiarization purposes. These same tests will then be administered on Visits 
2a, 7, and 9. Note: Cognition testing cannot be done within [ADDRESS_490220] 7 days leading up  to Visit 8.

Page 62 of 96 11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician-admini stered scale used for measuring symptom severity of subjects 
with schizophrenia and is widel y used in the study of antipsych otic therapy[ 23]. The PANSS 
rating form contains [ADDRESS_490222] em scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. S ubjects are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion  of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approx imately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is  the sum of all scales with a m inimum score of 30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder Factor. 
It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments (exce pt MINI at screening) for all visits at which it is performed.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI-S is a rating scale com pleted independently by a clinician that is used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subjects with mental disorders. It is u sed to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of  assessment. The modified CGI-S  asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical  experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 =  normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline 
mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating is based upon observe d and reported symptoms, behav ior, and function in the past

Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screenin g. The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alterna tively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity, which will be  obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Medical and psychiatric history w ill be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms  of the subject’s preexisting co nditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surg ical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include his tory of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within [ADDRESS_490224] occurring or de tected during the study and/or w orsening of a concomitant illness

changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medica l history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic vital signs (systol ic and diastolic  BP and heart ra te measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the  Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_240441] 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During tre atment, beginning with Day 1, orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning dose of the specified vi sit days, but additional orthos tatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically signific ant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repea ted at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinica lly significant vital sign me asurements must be recorded as

A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). During the ECG, ventricular ra te (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained. ECG at Day 1 will be performed 2 hours (+ 15 minutes) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled v isits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety lab oratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be i nterpreted by [CONTACT_390750](s) at the 
central reading facility. 
At screening, the investigator w ill examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be

present at screening will be docum ented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the st udy. Clinically significant vital  signs and laboratory abnormalities 
should also be recorded as AEs. S urgical procedures that were p lanned before the subject 
enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study 
inclusion; the medical conditi on should be reported in the subj ect’s medical history. 
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period,  and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. A Es will be elicited by [CONTACT_390752] e subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the r esults of the final laboratory tests 
are available. 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study d rug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is t o be classifie d as being seri ous or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are  to be documented on the eCRF. 
For the purposes of this st udy, the period of observation for c ollection of TEAEs extends from 
the time immediately after t he administration of study drug on Day 1 until the End of Study 
(Visit 10 for subjects who roll  over and Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR-
008 study) or early termination. F ollow up of the AE, even afte r the date of therapy 
discontinuation, is required if th e AE persists until the event  resolves or stabilizes at a level 
acceptable to the investigator. When changes in the intensity of  an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event shoul d be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be rec orded separately (with distinct  onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be grade d according to the National Ca ncer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5. 0 (Grades 1 through 5).

Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appr opriate medical judgment, are c onsidered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for  the identificati on of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into accoun t both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either t he Sponsor or the investigator  believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered, during the study, or 
within [ADDRESS_490229] Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance email address is:

The investigator will assess whet her or not an event is causally related to study treatment. The 
Sponsor (or their designee Syne os Health) will consider the investigator’s assessment and 
determine whether the event meets the criteria for being report able as a 7-day or 15-day safety 
report. S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life-threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities 
and the IEC/IRBs (where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor (or their designee) has first

Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390681]. Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], like other  antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with co nditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis. 
Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma:  
In subjects being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] c hloride should only be used if 
the potential benefits outweigh th e risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring. 
Central Nervous System Effects:  
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390682] s. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have been  reported, including dizziness , confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly 
after beginning treatment or i ncreasing the dose. Advise subjects not to drive or operate heavy 
machinery until they know how trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390683]. I f a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinua tion should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Ren al Impairment:  
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390673] d by [CONTACT_10521]. The effects o f moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely  increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment. 
Elevation of liver enzymes: 
Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in previous studies o f xanomeline alone in patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease. It is notable, however, that hepatic enzyme elevations were not 
observed in the Phase [ADDRESS_490234] elevations 
observed in the Phase 2 schizophrenia study (KAR-004) with KarX T (a combination of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]) were quite limited in contrast to the effects observed with xanomeline 
in the elderly Alzheimer’s popula tion. Moreover, even in patients with Alzheimer disease who 
experienced more hepatic enzyme elevations, the data demonstrat e reversibility even with 
continued xanomeline treatment in those patients for whom there  was sufficient follow-up data. 
Importantly, there were no Hy’s law cases or elevations in tota l bilirubin to a value of >2 × upper 
limit of reference range in either the xanomeline or KarXT data sets.

As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit (except at Visit 2a), subjects will be asked 
whether they have experienced constipation per the ROME III cri teria since the last visit, and if

Additional attention can be give n to other complaints as well i ncluding: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard  stools and pain with bowel 
movements secondary to strain ing, abdominal pain, abdominal blo ating, and the sensation of

• Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanome line and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390632] 5/Day 8 ± 2 days  (first dose of fixed titrati on period) and Visit 8/Day 28 
± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time points on these days:  
PK Sample Timing of Collection Collection Window 
1 Before morning dose  
 After morning dose  
2    0.5 hours ± 0.5 min 
3    1 hour ± 0.5 min 
4    2 hours ± 10 min 
5    4 hours ± 10 min 
6    8 hours ± 10 min 
7     12 hours after (but before the 
evening dose) ± 10 min 
• It is very important that the exact time of each PK draw and dosing times are recorded in 
the eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the specified  times of collection. 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of potential dose escalation for Visit 5. 
•  For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If vi sit windows are used for 
Visit 8, the PK sampling should occur at least [ADDRESS_490241] 
accompany the actual day of Visit 8.  
• Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before discharge (pref erably in the morning 
after the last dose of the st udy drug) at Visit 10/Day 35 -2 da ys or ET. In addition, one PK 
sample may be drawn if a relev ant/significant AE is reported during a scheduled visit or if 
there is a dose adjustment or relevant/significant AE reported during an unscheduled visit 
(no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to an AE, the collection of a PK blood 
sample is not optional and should be drawn before discharge.

A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This doc ument will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analy sis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences. 
The statistical evaluati on will be performed using SAS® software vers ion 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary  tables will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_7169]. For continu ous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of s ubjects (N), mean and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by [CONTACT_1570]. For categorical variables, data  will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subjects for each category by [CONTACT_22058] t group. 
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of  change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 
8 points between drug and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 9 0.3% for a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects  are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
All subjects who are randomize d to the study will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population 
All subjects who are randomize d, received at least [ADDRESS_490242] and step down 
through the statistical testi ng of each endpoint using an alpha  of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS n egative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS re sponders will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha l evel (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would 
continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy e ndpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control t he overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested. Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

5. Change from baseline in CGI-S score at Week 5 
6. Percentage of PANSS responders ( a 30% change in PANSS total sco re) at Week 5  
 
14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Primary Estimand 
The population of the primary estimand is among adult inpatient s (aged 18-65 years) with a 
DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia , confirmed by [CONTACT_390768], who are acutely 
psychotic and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240452] 80-120 at time o f enrollment, defined according 
to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary analysis will be executed on the mITT 
population, including all subjects  with a baseline and at least  [ADDRESS_490243]-baseline PANSS 
measurement, grouped as randomized.  
The variable is the change from baseline in PANSS total score a t Week 5.

discontinuation from the study wi ll be included in the analysis  
• Use of concomitant medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid: Treatment policy strategy 
where results will be used regardless of concomitant medication s for anxiety and/or sleep 
aid 
The population level summary is the difference between treatmen t groups (KarXT vs placebo) in 
mean change from baseline in PANSS at Week 5, obtained from a m ixed modelrepeated 
measures (MMRM). 
Robustness of the estimand will be assessed through sensitivity  analyses using alternative 
methods for handling of missing data (eg, multiple imputation); accounting for changes in dosing 
(eg, including actual dose as a time varying covariate in the M MRM), and accounting for use of 
concomitant medications for anxi ety and/or sleep aid (eg, subgr oup by [CONTACT_390769]-varying covariate in the 
MMRM). 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from b aseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week [ADDRESS_490244] correlati on will be accounted for using 
an unstructured covariance matrix. Fixed effects will include t he treatment group (KarXT or 
placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment grou p and visit, site, age, sex, and 
baseline PANSS total score. Low-enrolling sites may be pooled, if necessary, for modeling 
purposes. The algorithm for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be pe rformed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying tr eatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. Alternative time-varying parameterizations of dose level and use of concomitant 
medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid may also be included in  sensitivity analyses. In addition, 
alternative covariance matrices f or the MMRM may be investigate d. The sensitivity analyses of 
the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP. 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Wee k 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMR M).  
The categorical secondary endpoint ( percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT and placebo) using  the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test.

14.5 Safety Analysis 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher. The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by  [CONTACT_177346]. All AEs will  be listed by [CONTACT_220248] t, along with i nformation regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and sev erity to study drug, action taken  with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome. 
Orthostatic vital signs, clinical  laboratory data, prolactin le vels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarize d using descriptive statistics, including observed and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with value s outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by [CONTACT_1570]. Similar descriptiv e summaries will be provided for 
SAS, BARS, change in cognition (CANTAB), AIMS, body weight, BMI , and waist 
circumference. 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
• PK results will be listed for all subjects who received active treatment. The profiles or time 
points obtained with protocol devi ations affecting PK results w ill be flagged and may be 
excluded from summaries and analyses. 
• The data will be presented graphically via individual plots and  mean plots summarized by 
[CONTACT_29628], visit, and time point.  
• PK parameters for xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390635]. Actual time elapsed from dosing will be used to estimate all individual PK parame ters. The primary PK parameter s of interest will include 
C
max, Tmax, and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from [ADDRESS_490245] measurable concentration). 
Additional parameters (not limited to the following) such as th e elimination half-life, 
clearance, and volume of distribution will be determined if the  data permit. 
• The effect of dose on PK and other inferential analyses for exp osure-response relationship 
may be performed. The details of the PK analysis will be descri bed in the SAP. The 
noncompartmental analysis will be  described as a part of final clinical study report.

Several different methods to handl e the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used. 
• For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling ap proach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied. 
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the last 
observation carried for ward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_390759] P ANSS total score carried forwar d.  
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by [CONTACT_390760] a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute).

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men whose sexual pa rtners are WOCBP must 
use at least [ADDRESS_490258] dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarch e and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bila teral oophorecto my. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 mont hs without an alternative medic al cause. A high 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_490259] a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contrac eption associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administ ration may be oral, intravagin al, or transdermal) 
• progestogen-only hormonal contrace ption associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(administration may be oral, injectable, or implantable) 
• intrauterine device 
• intrauterine horm one-releasing system 
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion 
• vasectomy (provided that the mal e has a medical assessment of surgical success) 
• sexual abstinence (defined as re fraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk in relation to the  duration of the clinical tria l, in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject) 
All subjects will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male subjects) should 
not become pregnant while on study treatment or for [ADDRESS_490260] report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and 
appropriate management in the e vent that she may be pregnant.

Study Design:  This is a Phase [ADDRESS_490265] s 
will be randomized  (1:1 ratio)  to receive either KarXT or placebo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Subjects will start on a lead-in dos e of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50  mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID  for the first 
2 days (Days  1 and 2) followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 (xanomeline 
100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week  1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to Ka rXT 125/[ADDRESS_490266]  is continuing to experience AEs from the previous

Visit 5/Day  8. 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed 
for all those subjects who d o not ro llover in to the long -term open -label 
study KAR -008. 
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophreni a subjects with acute psychosis will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and 
secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_490270] and step down through 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, and PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, 
CGI-S score at Week 5, and percentage of PANSS responders will be 
performed only if the primary endpoint is sign ificant at the 0.05 alpha 
level (P  ≤ 0.05), and t esting would continue through a preordered list of 
key secondary efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, then formal 
statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

5-week treatment period, and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR -008 s tudy) . Subjects completing this study will have 
the option of rolling over into a long- term open -label study (KAR -008) in 
which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy  Assessments : PANSS total score, PANSS positive score , PANSS negative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score,  and CGI -S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits . 
Safety  Assessments : Spontaneous AEs  including AESIs , procholinergic and anticholinergic 
symptoms,  SAS, BARS , AIMS, body weight, body mass index , waist 
circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen), 
prolactin levels, physical examination, and C -SSRS will be evaluated 
throughout the study as scheduled.  
Pharmacokinet ic Assessments : AUC , Cmax, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population : All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population.  
Modified ITT (mITT) population : All subjects who are randomized, received 
at least [ADDRESS_490278] 
1 postbaseline PANSS  assessment will be included in the mITT population 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis.  
Safety p opulation : All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in the safety analysis.  
PK population : All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be 
included in the PK population and wil l be used in the PK analysis. Subjects 
must have  received at least [ADDRESS_490279] or 
score , CGI-S score  at Week 5 , and percentage of PANSS responders at 
Week  5. The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
variables will account for multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequence testing 
procedure. This testing procedure will control the overall Type 1 error rate 
across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.  
Assuming the treatment difference in the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 8 points between KarXT and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 172 subjects  (86 evaluable 
subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05

Page  19 of 94 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long- term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fr agmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the [LOCATION_002] (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US  is 5.1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schizophrenia is antipsychotic dru gs (APDs) [5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. 
First-generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with these agents is 
marked by [CONTACT_240462] (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia , 
and they consequently have limited use today. The second-generation agents that include risperidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasi done, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] , and lumateperone tend to have 
lower levels of EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD 
class. However, the second -generation drugs also have proble matic side effects that include 
significant weight gain, metabolic disturbances, sedation, and akathisia[ 6,7,8]. These side effects 
contribute to poor medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602][ 9,10]. 
Thus there is a need for medications for schizophrenia which act through alternative mechanisms.  
Central muscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments fo r 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1- M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events (AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of muscarinic agonists in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by [CONTACT_240463] (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT  (Xanomeline Tartrate an d Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240430])  
Xanomeline tartrate  is a muscarinic -cholinergic receptor agonist. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M
1 and M 4 receptors  and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects

Page  20 of 94 (Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very potent M [ADDRESS_490289] in vivo, measured by [CONTACT_240464][ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240431] a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate [15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action  is unrelated to direct dopamine involvement.  
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy.  In a multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo were assessed for 
26 weeks [16,17]. Significant dose-dependent improvements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placeb o were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240432] s who 
were symptomatic at baseline and a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive improvement was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive enhancement [16,17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In addition, improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of xanomeline led to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “ procholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by 
[CONTACT_240465]’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390586] a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist which binds to and antagonizes all five muscarinic receptor subtypes [19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 ye ars by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) and by [CONTACT_240466] [19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390587], consistent with the drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Karuna hypothesized that the addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240435] (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating and hyper -salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this combination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced the se side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and tran sient in nature,

1.[ADDRESS_490290] s (KAR -004). KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001), with statistical separation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4 , and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. 
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 30 mg) administered twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnosis of schizophrenia. A placebo arm is included

Nonclinical Studies  
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of  xanomeline tartrate was ev aluated i n mice and  rats.  All ani mals were 
observed for [ADDRESS_490291] article included excessive

water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (split into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390688] d osages of 150/200 mg/kg/day or

hypoactivity, clear oral  discharge, dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], irregular or labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and rough 
haircoat , among other observations. These findings are generally consistent with the anticipa ted 
pharmacology of xanomeline. Three TK animals in the low -dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed to these deaths. If gavage accidents were involved (as happened  with some TK animals), then they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no microscopic evidence of toxicity was seen in any toxicity animals  
in this group or in the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal  deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination 
group. Two toxicology animals had evidence of gavage accidents. For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined , and a test article -related effect cannot be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of esophageal m uscular  is indicated some dosing- related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involved, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no evidence of target organ microscopic findings in GI tract or any other tissue of any animal, including the early death toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics -mediated reduction in GI motility is consistent with the anti- muscarinic 
effects of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390593]. Fecal retention, malabsorption, cessation of eating, dehydration, and rapid deterioration followed with continued dosing. Cessation of dosing in the high dose combination animals that survived led to rapid recovery, implying the deleterious effects had been pharmacodynamics -related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any 
xanomeline-alone group. The lack of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or surviving animal implies that the adverse effects were pharmacologically mediated rather than direct target organ toxicity.  
Twenty -eight Day Repeat -Dose Studies with Xanomeline in Rats and Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0 %, 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monkeys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived until necropsy. Safety findings in rats included reduced body weight in the high dose group, increases in gamma- glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), and lower serum globulin (females). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrhea, hypoactivity, weight loss, and treatment- related tachycardia in the high -dose animals.  
Forty -Day Repeat Dose Study of KarXT in R ats (KarXT -302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were giv en vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day, trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390594] 100 mg/kg/day,

after the first and last doses to determine concentrations of each drug. Dosing was initially planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxicity was seen. Safet y findings included pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390596]-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4 unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high -dose xanomeline alone group (150 g/kg/day ) and 2 in the high-dose 
combination group (150 mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]).

Based on the results of the 90-day rat toxicology study, oral administration of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390689]:CD (SD) rats BID (12 hours ± 60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 and 50 mg/kg/dose trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 and 75 mg/kg/dose xanomeline tartrate , and a combination of 37/25, 75/25, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline

trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]) group males. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when comparing the single vs combination groups, there was an increased severity observed in the combination group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the 
terminal euthanasia. The bile duct hyperplasia was considered adverse in the high -dose 
xanomeline tartrate group males and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed -adverse- effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/tros pi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
146,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasm a AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 267,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 16,700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL 
for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in 
females cannot be explained from differences in drug exposure. At the recovery euthanasia, bile duct hyperplasia was still present but was limited to minimal severity , and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomeline tartrate and combination group males. There was also no 
notable difference in se verity between the single vs combination groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased incidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smaller/flattened epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], noninfl ammatory, and an absence of portal bridging), changes at the recovery euthanasia were 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490294] been tolerable by [CONTACT_390740]. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434], 75 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. For males, corresponding mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and  133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For females, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + xanomelin e, respectively, on Day 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerations of systemic and CNS muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomeline or trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390599]. 
Target organ findings with xanomeline alone were limited to biliary hyperplasia in the 28 -day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12-month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 6-month monkey study. With KarXT, biliary hyperplasia was not observed in the 14- day rat
study but was reported in the 40-day rat  study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not
thought to represent pre- neoplastic lesions, because they were  of low severity; no fibrosis or
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary -related
serum chemistry.

orthostatic BP or any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment a rms had transient increases in heart rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in those subjects. Two subjects (both in the xanomeline alone arm) experienced syncope. The incidence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-half that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.

1.[ADDRESS_490300] commonly reported treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) in KAR -001 (≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were hyperhidrosis, salivary hypersecretion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences of these 5 TEAEs was higher in the xan omeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390605] (34.3%). 
Overall, treatment with xanomeline [ADDRESS_490301] profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was lower in the xanomeline + trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390606].  
Study KAR -002 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose adaptive design pi[INVESTIGATOR_390692]. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + [ADDRESS_490302] time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as only 3 doses were given.  
Study KAR -003 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pi[INVESTIGATOR_390693]. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarXT at various dose combinations, administered BID. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (3:1 ratio). All subjects on KarXT received 2 days of 50 mg xanomeline + [ADDRESS_490303] of 
trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390609] (PK) and bioavailability of xanomeline, or the impact of 
xanomeline on the PK and bioavailability of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], the PK results suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK behavior of the other drug. 
During the 2- day lead -in phase, the most common AEs (≥20% of subjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that 
completed dosing, although the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the KarXT 100/20 BID

(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) was similar between the [ADDRESS_490304] commonly reported TEAEs ( 20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, dyspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria. For the treatment groups that did not complete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were generally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing. 
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur prim arily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390610] (KarXT 150/40 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID, suggesting to consider slightly lowering the trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390611] 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and there were no SAEs or deaths. T reatment -emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few anticholinergic). Doses of 100 mg and 125 mg BID of xanomeline were well tolerated when paire d with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID was acceptable and supports further evaluation at similar doses in future studies. Doses of KarXT 150/20 BID and 150/40 BID w ere not well tolerated in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg

schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/[ADDRESS_490305] 2 days 
followed by [CONTACT_240469] 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490306] was continuing to experience AEs from previous dose increase of 100/[ADDRESS_490307] as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction s in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001) in the modified intent- to-treat 
(mITT ) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjusted mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score ( Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and  4; moreover, the difference appears 
to be widening with each successive time point . In addition, sensitivity analyses of the primary

The overall safety/tolerability data were also fairly unambiguous; among the highlights:  
• The overall discontinuation rate on KarXT was 20%, similar to placebo (21%). The number 
of discontinuations due to TEAEs  was equal in the KarXT and placebo arms (N = 2 in each 
group) 
• The dose escalation rate on KarXT was high and similar to placebo

o 4% percent de-escalated back to 100/20 KarXT dose (vs 1% on placebo) 
• The overall TEAE rate on KarXT was 5 4% vs 43% on placebo  
• Most common TEAEs  were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. 
None of these TEAEs were rated as severe, and none led to  discontinuations 
• One SAE  occurred in the study (the subject was on KarXT): the subject discontinued 
treatment and subsequently sought hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390694], meeting the regulatory definition of an SAE. 
• No syncope or mean changes in BP were seen  
• A 5.[ADDRESS_490309]  trend

should discuss KAR -008 protocol participation with potential subjects prior to the final day of 
participation in the acute study, via use of the provided recruitment materials.  
Screening Period : 
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time  is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US  and 10 sites in Ukraine. Subjects will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5  weeks.  
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all subjects assigned to KarXT will start on a lead -in dose of 
KarXT  50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the first 2 days (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by [CONTACT_240469]  100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_490314] is continuing to experience AEs from the previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID.

 Page  40 of 94 7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimize bias and provide reference data for comparison of efficacy and safety parameters of the investigational drug.  
Schizophrenia is a long- term mental disorder which requires a chronic therapy.  A 5-week 
treatmen t duration is considered an acceptable treatment duration to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint can be achieved). The [ADDRESS_490319]  has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit (Visit 10/Day 35  [End of 
Treatment /Early Termination ] for subject s who roll over into KAR -008 or Visit 11/Day 42 
[Follow-up] for subject s who do not roll over in to the KAR -008 study) as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subject s completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a long-term open- label 
study (KAR -008) in which every subject  will receive KarXT , following completion of 
Visit 10/Day 35 of the c urrent study (KAR -009). 
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Treatment/Early 
Termination  visit (Visit 10) for subjects who have completed Visit 10/Day 35 but do not rollover 
in to the long- term open -label study  KAR -008. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety and tolerability data from the 
clinical study. The ISMC wi ll include 3 clinicians and a reporting statistician. This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new toxicities that might be involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinded data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important safety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the details of the types of dat a to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no triggers), and the communication plan for disseminating review recommendations.

complete or discontinue early from the study will be discharged  from  the study site, if clinically 
warranted  after completing all the Visit 10/early termination  assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Treatment/Early 
Termination  visit (Visit 10)  for those subjects who do not roll over into the long-term open- label 
study KAR -008. 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_240471].  
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject  will not re-enter the study. 
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease  
• unacceptable toxicity or AE  
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a  subject ’s participation in the study may be

• on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgement 
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes in the subject ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject  has need for a 
medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760])

• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.8. A ny study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study treatment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term  
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study 
Subject s withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who completed the study.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_1130] s who leave the unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of 
study will be followed until the AE is resolved  (regardless  of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open- label study KAR -008) or the subject  is considered to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making further treatment of subject s 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240444], but potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C).  
Therefore, WOCBP  in this study must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth 
control (see APPENDIX [ADDRESS_490330] of acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) 
during the study and for [ADDRESS_490331]  on Day - 1 (before receiving KarXT)  and 
thereafter, as designated at other scheduled visits ( Table 2). In case of positive urine pregnancy 
test result, a serum sample should be sent to the central laboratory to confirm the result.

unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense study drug in a blinded fashion to personnel who will be responsible for administration of IP to the subject. For the 2- day lead -in period 
(Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 BID,  followed by 2 capsules of KarXT 50/10 mg BID or a dosage of 100/20 BID for a total daily 
dosage of 200/40 mg xanomeline/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240448] 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week 2, dosing may be increased to 2 capsules of KarXT  62.5/15 mg or a

Further details on labelling of investigational products will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 Study Drug Storage 
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature 15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel. 
 Study Drug Retention 
Study drug  not used in KAR-009 may be used for the long- term extension study (KAR -008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or termination of the KarXT program, and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. The unused study drug can be reassigned in the IWRS to subjects in the KAR-[ADDRESS_490338] be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified by 
[CONTACT_2728]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropriate records of the disposal are documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully accounted for by [CONTACT_11200].

after a meal. Some considerations for dosing and PK blood withdrawals are provided in the 
subsections below. 
 Visit 2 b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning , and the evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose. 
• All subject s must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation  to KarXT 100/20 or placebo BID.

 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 100/20 or placebo level is confirmed by [CONTACT_390716] 3/Day 3, that dose is to be administered in the morning. 
• When Day [ADDRESS_490340] ’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated  until the study visit occurs. In all cases, the 
subject  must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20  or placebo before escalating  to 
KarXT  100/20 or placebo. 
• This may res ult in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo dose at Visit 5/D ay 8, 
which is acceptable.  
• All subject s must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 or placebo BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK C onsiderations and Visit 8 /Day 28 PK 
Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is confirmed by i nvestigato r 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for serial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2, 
Footnote  p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must accompan y the 
actual day of dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
• For Visit [ADDRESS_490341] ’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; there fore, there  must be no 
changes in dose for at least [ADDRESS_490342] accompany the 
actual day of Visit 8  if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• All subjects will receive their final dose of KarXT or placebo on the morning of 
Visit 10/Day 35. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject 
identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Subject Number. This 9- digit 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490343] s will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_490344] generated by  
[CONTACT_390717] . Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or other 
designated unblinded individual) , subject s, informants /caregivers , Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees  (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study. 
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject ’s study treatment, that subject  will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT  will generate and maintain the security of the randomizati on code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject ’s safety  or wellbeing,  the investigator may break the randomization code for just th at 
subject  via the IWRS , by [CONTACT_390775]/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be related to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investigational treatment and/or treat the subject . Subject  withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. When a subject  has an AE that requires that the investigator be unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in the subject ’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: I n most circumstances , it is not necessary to unblind a 
subject , even if an SAE has occurred. For many drugs there is no specific therapy for AEs. The 
Approved
1.[ADDRESS_490345] s will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous preclinical and 
clinical studies (see Section  5.2). Per the protocol, subject s will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_490346], and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or disposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subject s. 
Administration of study drug will be supervised by [CONTACT_240473]. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodical ly by [CONTACT_240474]. 
9.[ADDRESS_490347] be recorded on the eCRF. 
During the stud y (ie, from the time of screening visit until study completion), subject s will 
refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without the specific prior approval of the investigator. The administration of any other concomitant medications during the study period is prohibited without the prior approval of the investigator unless its use is deemed necessary in a medical emergency. Any medication or therapy that is taken by [CONTACT_390776]
1.[ADDRESS_490348] include 
the dose, regimen, route, indication, dates of use, and time of use (only for concomitant 
medications used on an as- needed  [PRN]  basis) . 
After written informed consent is obtained from the subject , those subject s who are taking the 
following medications must have the minimum washout periods specified below and not take the medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half- lives  or 1 week , whichever is longer, before baseline ( Day -1), subjects  
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibitors, mood stabilizers (ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could not have received a dose of medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRIN ZA
®). 
Note:  Please direct questions relating to prohibited medications to the Medical Monitor.  
 Concomitant Medication s for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subject s are allowed to take benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (up to 6 mg lorazepam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation , and insomnia on a PRN  basis . Subject s may also use non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_240449] (eg,  zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zaleplon) as a sleep aid  also on a PRN  basis . Study sites must record 
the use of such medications in the eCRF on a per- administration basis and subject ’s source 
document. Note: Cognition testing should not be done within 8 hours of receiving a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_390623].

any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and QTcF  (msec)  
measure ments should be obtained. 
i. Refer to  Table  [ADDRESS_490352]  may be performed at unscheduled visit s based on the Investigator’s discretion.  
k. Blood sample for prolactin must  be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug  at scheduled visits  (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests completed at Screening: anti -HCV antibody, HBV surface antigen, HBV c ore antibody, 
HIV- [ADDRESS_490353] tests positive for anti -HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain reaction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection.  
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subject s will be asked whether they have experienced constipation (per the ROME III criteria and 
Bristol Stool Form scale ; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject  answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subject s to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant 
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not already an inpatient, the subject should be admitted to the inpatient  unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID  (first dose of study will be administered in the morning of Day 1, and evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.[ADDRESS_490354] PK sampling  [for Vi sits 5 and 8 ] is completed) , on an empty stomach  ie, at least [ADDRESS_490355] 4 dos ages of the 50/20  BID before dose escalation to  KarXT  100/20 BID.

morning after the last dose of the study drug). One PK blood sample may also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported during a scheduled visit 
or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reported du ring an unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to 
an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and should be drawn before  discharge.  
q. MINI  should be performed before PANSS assessment.  
r. It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all the other scale assessments  (except MINI)  for 
all visits at which it is performed. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder Factor.  
s. C-SSRS  first time use lifetime, other  times  use “Since Last Visit” version. At  the Unscheduled visit,  the C-SSRS  should  be performed  to monitor  subject s 
for suicidality.  
t. During screening, subject s will complete each of the CANTAB tests for familiarization purposes. These same tests will then be administered on Visit s

10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing s are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2). Section  12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessment s and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 2).  
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include PANSS and CGI -S scores . 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs; AESIs, 
procholinergic and anticholinergic symptoms ; cognition testing  (CANTAB) ; SAS; BARS ; 
AIMS ; body weight; BMI; waist circumference; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory 
assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen); prolactin 
levels ; physical examination ; and C- SSRS. 
PK assessments are described in Section [ADDRESS_490362] igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow  up or are  considered by [CONTACT_190370]. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  The assessments and procedures that may be  performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). Additional assessments 
can be performed as needed, at the discretion of the investigator , and after discussion with the 
medical monitor .

It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments  (except MINI at screening)  for all visits at which it is performed.   
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI -S is a rating scale  completed independently by a clinician  that is  used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subject s with mental disorders. It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s i llness at the time of assessment. The modified CGI -S asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7- point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 23]. 
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past [ADDRESS_490365] the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

performed at protocol- specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical  and Psychiatric History  
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screening.  The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alternatively year  of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity , which will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the subject ’s preexisting conditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within [ADDRESS_490366] occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the e CRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as clinica lly noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_240441] 2 minutes. BP  measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During treatment, beginning with Day 1 , orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the morning dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is allowed at the investigator ’s discreti on. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measure ments must be recorded as 
AEs.

Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table 2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
12.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12- lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2). During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained . ECG at Day 1 will be performed 2 hours 
(+ 15 minutes ) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be interpreted by [CONTACT_240478] (s) at the 
central reading facility . 
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject  from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be re corded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.

return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug-induced liver toxicity, detailed in 
Section  12.7.5, during the study.  
Other Laboratory Assessments : 
A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or m arijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and cocaine) will be performed using a dipstick at 
screening  and at  Visit 2a (baseline) . 
Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or urine alcohol test.  
If a subject leaves the study site , they should have a urine drug screen test and test for alcohol 
(breathalyzer or urine alcohol test) upon returning to the study site . 
 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics 
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for exploratory pharmacogenetic analy sis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central laboratory facility, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The collection, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], processing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.

12.7 Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at screening will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
Approved

enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject ’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit A Es and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period, and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs  will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed  symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the results of the final laboratory tests 
are available.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, severity, rel ationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time immediately after the administration of study drug on Day 1  until the End of S tudy (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over and Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR -008 
study)  or early termination . Follow up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an A E occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) , version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_240479] 4 and Table 5.

causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test  drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_240482], environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for whi ch a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administ ration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_240483], environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_390779] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the test drug.

machinery until they know how trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390683]. If a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Renal Impairment : 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_390631]. The effects of moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal impairment.  
Elevation of liver enzymes: 
Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in previous studies of xanomeline alone in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. It is notable , however, th at hepatic enzyme elevations were not 
observed in the Phase [ADDRESS_490377] elevations observed in the Phase 2 schizophrenia study (KAR-004) with KarXT (a combination of 
xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]) were quite limited in contrast to the effects observed with xanomeline 
in the elderly Alzheimer’s population. Moreover, even in patients with  Alzheimer disease who 
experienced more hepatic enzyme elevations, the data demonstrate reversibility even with continued xanomeline treatment in those patients for whom there was sufficient follow -up data. 
Importantly, there were no Hy’s law cases or elevations in total bilirubin to a value of >2 ×  upper 
limit of reference range in either the xanomeline or KarXT datasets.

As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit  (except at Visit 2a) , subjects will be asked 
whether they have experienced constipation per the ROME III criteria since the last visit, and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject answers yes, sites are 
instructed to ask subjects to provide event date and ensure event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant medication. Subjects will not be required to collect and present their stool sample nor will clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject assessment. 
Additional attention can be given to other complaints as well including: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard stools and pain with bowel movements secondary to straining, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and the sensation of incomple te bowel evacuation[ 29,32 ].

A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives.  The SAP will  serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS
® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_7169].  For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of subject s (N), mean  and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by [CONTACT_1570].  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subject s for each category by [CONTACT_1570].  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of change from baseline in  PANSS total score  at Week 5 is  
8 points between drug and placebo  (standard deviation 16) , a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent -to-Treat Population  
All subjects who are randomized to the study will be included in the intent- to-treat ( ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population  
All subjects who are randomized, received at least [ADDRESS_490389] and step down 
through the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS negative score, and PANSS 
Negative Marder Fa ctor score, CGI -S score at Week 5 , and percentage of PANSS responders 
will be performed only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy endpoints. If at 
any point P > 0.05, then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested . Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Primary Estim and 
The population of the primary estimand is among adult inpatients (aged 18- 65 years) with a 
DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia, confirmed by [CONTACT_240485], who are acutely 
psychotic and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240452] 80 to 120 at time of enrollment, defined  
according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria . Subjects will receive flexible dose KarXT, whereby 
a subject receiving 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) may be titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 on Day 8. All subjects who are increased to 125/[ADDRESS_490390] the option to 
return to KarXT 100/20, but may not change their dose after Visit 7 (Day 21) or decrease their dose for tolerability reasons more than once. The primary analysis will be executed on t he mITT 
population, including all subjects with a baseline and at least [ADDRESS_490391]- baseline PANSS 
measurement, grouped as randomized. 
The variable is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5.

where results will be used regardless of concomitant medications for anxiety and/or sleep 
aid 
The population level summary is the difference between treatment groups (KarXT vs placebo) in 
mean change from baseli ne in PANSS at Week 5, obtained from a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM).  
Robustness of the estimand will be assessed through sensitivity analyses using alternative methods for handling of missing data and accounting for use of concomitant medications f or 
anxiety and/or sleep aid (eg , subgroup by [CONTACT_390780] -varying covariate in the MMRM) . 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week [ADDRESS_490392] correlation will be accounted for using 
an unstructured covariance matrix. Fixed effects will include the treatment group  (KarXT  or 
placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment group and visit, s ite, age, sex , and 
baseline PANSS total score.  Low-enrolling sites may be pooled, if necessary, for modeling 
purposes. The algorithm for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analys es of the primary efficacy endpoint may be performed on an observed case 
basis,  using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying treatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. Alternative time -varying parameterizations of dose level and use of concomitant 
medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid may also be included in sensitivity ana lyses. In addition, 
alternative covariance matrices for the MMRM may be investigated. The sensitivity analyses of 
the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP . 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMRM).  
The categorical secondary endpoint (percentage of PANSS re sponders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT  and placebo) using th e Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequen ce testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested .

revised consent forms, the subjects must be re-consented for continued participation in the study. 
A caregiver informed consent (Ukraine only) should be obtained before any data pertaining to him or her and the subject is collected. 
Subject  Registry (for the US only): 
Clinical trial registries, such as clinical trial subject database (CTSdatabase) and Verified 
Clinical Trials (VCT), seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by [CONTACT_390783]. At the time of providing the informed consent for the study, the investigator or designee will explain the IRB -approved Subject 
Database Authorization to the subject and witness the signature.

database will enter the subject study ID number and authorized subject identifiers. Two reports, 
one from CTS  and one from VCT , detailing any potential protocol violations or dual enrollment 
attempts will be generated and shou ld be printed for source documentation. The reports will 
detail each protocol violation detected and specific washout period dates where applicable. 
Participants who are identified as verification failures by [CONTACT_390784].  
At the last subject contact, CTSdatabase and VCT staff will automatically close out the subject (safety follow -up, ET, or completer) based on interactive response system  (IXRS). 
15.2 Data Handling 
Any data to be recorded directly on the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be 
identified at the start of the study.  Data reported on the eCRF that are derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepanc ies must be 
explained.  See also Section 15.3. 
Clinical data will be entered by [CONTACT_240488]. Data on 
eCRFs transmitted via the web -based data system must correspond to and be supported by [CONTACT_190394], unless the study site makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original or source documentation is maintained.  In such cases, the 
study site should document which eCRFs are subject to direct data entry and should have in place procedures to obtain and retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_202819]. 
All study forms and records transmitte d to the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly  identifying personal information is not transmitted.  The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet- based electronic data capture (EDC) system maintained by 
[CONTACT_144175].  Access to the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s 
secured internet web site, where a user unique assigned username [CONTACT_240489].  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made through the use of the EDC system . 
Electronic CRFs will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been resolved.

invest igator shall ensure that study subject s authorize the use and disclosure of protected health 
information in accordance with HIPAA Privacy Regulation and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
15.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according to the KAR -009 monitoring plan to ensure that it is 
conducted and documented properly according to the protocol, GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
Monitoring visits , on-site and remote (telephone)  or a combination and contacts will be made at 
appropriate times during the study. The Principal Inv estigator will assure him/her and adequate 
site personnel are available throughout the study to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical 
monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to check the completeness, 
clarity, and consistency of the data recorded in the eCRFs for each  subject. 
The invest igator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the invest igator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations, and GCP  
guidelines.

The Sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor lies with the invest igator generating the data.  
The Sponsor will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that 
the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Audits will be independent of and separate 
from the routine monitoring and quality control functions. Quality assurance procedures will be 
performed at study sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data are 
adequate and well documented.

and will be submitted to the IEC/ IRB for information only. Syneos Health  will ensure that 
acknowledgement is received and filed. Amendments that are classed as  substantial amendments 
must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IECs/ IRBs for approval and 
will not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received other than in the case of an 
urgent safety measure. 
 Protocol Deviations 
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study report.  Reporting of protocol deviations to the I EC/IRB and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory authority mandates is an investigator ’s responsibility. 
All protocol deviations will be tracked in the Clinical Trial Management S ystem . Deviations 
considered major will be identified as such before study unblinding during medical monitor periodic review . 
Major protocol deviations will be tabulated including the frequency and percentage of subjects 
with each type of deviation by [CONTACT_1570].

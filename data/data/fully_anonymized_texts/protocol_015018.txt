PI: [INVESTIGATOR_65435], PhD, RN   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date : 07/24/[ADDRESS_894895] the feasibility of the innovative Patient -Reported 
Outcomes -Informed Symptom Management System  (PRISMS ) to enhance 
personalized supportive care for cancer patients and caregivers during post-
treatment care transition. PRISMS was formerly known as PROCESS (Patient -
Reported Outcome -Informed Caregiving Education and System Management 
System). We will randomly assign  20 colorectal and bladder cancer ( CBC ) 
patients who transition from post -ostomy creation  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662929] -
management  at home and their caregivers to either the PRISMS  or usual care 
groups  (a total of 40 individuals) . We will conduct pre- and post -assessments of 
QOL and PRO (symptoms) at baseline upon enrollment and [ADDRESS_894896] common cancers in the US respectively,1 colorectal 
and bladder cancer (CBC) affects more than 100,000 patients each year.2 CBC 
disproportionately affects older patients, with median age of diagnosis 63 years 
and 75 years for colorectal and bladder cancer, respectively.1 After ostomy 
surgery, a major treatment option,1 patients often encounter significant symptoms 
and complications (e.g., dehydration, infection) and wound care problems.3,4 
These symptoms and complications are associated with  reduced quality of life 
(QOL)5-[ADDRESS_894897] -treatment self -care at hom e.  
 
To address these issues, our team has developed a web -based mHealth 
symptom and complication  monitoring and self -management program for CBC 
patients with ostomies and their family caregivers, known as PRISMS . PRISMS  
is a personalized/customized mHealth program that integrates patient reported -
outcomes (PRO) measures  and technology in enhancing program relevance and 
usefulness, and improving human -technology interaction and information 
delivery, all of which predict use of technology -delivered programs.  
 
PRISMS aims to provide monitoring, education, skills training, and social support 
to ameliorate the complex, interrelated symptoms and complications, and 
ultimately, improve QOL. PRISMS includes modules addressing ostomy care, the 
most common  complications (e.g., dehydration, skill problems) and related 
LCCC 1929   CONFIDENTIAL

Version/Date : 07/24/2019   January 24, 2018  
 
2 physical and psychosocial symptoms (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, emotional 
distress, and sexual dysfunction), and safe physical activity for speedy recovery 
(while preventing hernia and falls). PRISMS integrates PRO (e.g., fatigue) and 
objective data from wearable devices (smart bottle and smart scale that monitor 
fluid intake and loss) to provide continuous monitoring of patients’ symptoms and 
complications after they are discharged home. PRISMS  triages patient care based 
on the monitoring data that i ndicate severity of their symptoms and complications. 
Patients and caregivers will self -monitor and manage at home for mild and 
moderate symptoms but be referred to professionals (e.g., wound and stoma 
nurse) when the patient experiences severe symptoms or  significantly worsened 
symptoms. PRISMS also provides moderated online forum to promote peer 
support among study participants who face similar challenges, as well as “Let’s 
Chat” to facilitate professional support.  
 
1.3 Purpose and Rationale  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] (RCT) using mixed methods. We will 
examine the feasibility of PRISMS  by [CONTACT_14664] a two -armed pre -post pi[INVESTIGATOR_662930] . 
Study participants - twenty CBC patients with new ostomies and their caregivers 
(N=20 dyads , i.e., 40 individuals ) - will be randomly assigned to either the 
PRISMS  or usual care groups.    
 
2.[ADDRESS_894898] the data using administration 
log and study website.  
The study outcome, Quality of life (QOL), will be assessed at T1 and T2 using 
the 27 -item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy general scale 
(FACT -G).94 We will measure general QOL and physical, social/family, emotional, 
and functional subdomains.95 Caregivers will report QOL using the spouse’s 
version of FACT -G with slightly modified wording.[ADDRESS_894899] participants’  demographics (age, race/ethnicity, income, 
education) and patient treatment information at T1. At T2, we will collect 
quantitative data  on participant satisfaction of and comfort with using PRISMS . 
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
To examine the feasibility of delivering PRISMS  to patients and caregivers (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_662941], enrollment, and retention rates, and satisfaction

3 with and perceived ease of use of PRISMS ).  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives   
To estimate the magnitude of benefit of PRISMS . We hypothesize that, 
compared with the patients receiving usual care, the PRISMS  users will report (1) 
greater improvement in their primary outcomes of QOL (overall, physical, 
emotional, and social QOL); and (2) fewer post -treatment care services related to 
stoma complications (e.g., ER visits, readmission, use of healthcare providers ) 
from between T1 and T2.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_894900] (1) have been surgically treated for bladder or colorectal cancer; 
(2) have a newly created ostomy within the past 4 weeks , and (3) have a 
caregiver who is willing to participate in the study. The caregiver must (1) be 18 
years and older, (2) be identified as the primary caregiver by [CONTACT_102].  We will 
also recruit [ADDRESS_894901] -surgical care to CBC patients  to 
provide feedback on the PRISMS . Providers, patients and caregivers will be 
recruited from the LCCC urologic (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) oncology in - and 
out-patient units.  
3.[ADDRESS_894902] (IRB) 
approval, we will inform the health care providers working at the GU and GI units 
and obtain their permission to display the flyers of our PRISMS  study (with our 
contact [CONTACT_3031]) on the information board at the units.  
 
A research team member will meet the patients who express interest in the 
PRISMS  study by [CONTACT_662942] -patient GU or GI unit prior to their discharge home. The research 
team will provide study information, answer questions, screen the patient and 
caregiver for eligibilit y and willingness to participate, obtain informed consent, 
and collect baseline (T1) data (demographics, QOL, and symptom distress). The 
coordinator will then schedule a home v isit to install PRISMS  within 48 hours of 
discharge and train participants to use the study devices. Patients and caregivers

4 will use the PRISMS  for 3 months —the period of time that patients have the 
highest risk for complications and related ER visits and readmission. Participants 
will be instructed to synchronize their devices daily. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_662943] [ADDRESS_894903] the follow -up interview (T2)

prior to their discharge home. (Note: However, the clinician Co-Is and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662931]  I early September  to explore the possibility and procedure of enrolling 
potential participants  prior to surgery. Once we have the details we will modify 
the study protocol immediately.) The coordinator will provide study information, 
answer questions, screen the patient and caregiver for eligibility and  willingness 
to participate, obtain informed consent, and collect baseline (T1) data 
(demographics, QOL, and symptom distress). The coordinator will then schedule 
a home visit to install the PRISMS  within 48 hours of discharge and train 
participants to use the study devices. Patients and caregivers will use the 
PRISMS  for 3 months —the period of time that patients have the highest risk for 
complications and related ER visits and readmission. Participants will be 
instructed to synchronize their devices daily. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_662945] [ADDRESS_894905] the follow -up interview (T2) and 
collect the devices.  
 
Our project coordinator will identify potentially eligible patients and caregivers 
and introduce to them the PRISMS  study and answer any questions they may 
have via in -person meeting (before discharge) and via telephone (after 
discharge). Potentially eligible patients and caregivers will be provided study 
brochures and introductions, written or telephone informed conse nt (whichever is 
the most convenient for participants) will be obtained from all patients and their 
caregivers  prior to any research activities. After informed consent, patients and 
caregivers will complete their baseline assessment of quality of life and symptom 
distress. The project coordinator will then schedule for a home visit to install the 
study devices wit hin [ADDRESS_894906] of the study.  But the assessment schedule can be 
reset if new symptoms and complications appear or existing symptoms and 
complications worsen. That is, if the patient experiences severe symptoms,  
participants will be automatically directed to use PRISMS  more often. The 
synchronization between the iPAD and wearable devices (Fitbit, smart scale, and 
smart bottle) is designed to be a 1 -click process to ease PRISMS  use for elderly 
participants because  colorectal and bladder cancer disproportionately influence 
older people.

6.0 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
6.1 Definition  
This study involves minimal risk to the participants.  
 
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study 
subjects refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; 
and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related 
to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_894907] be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web -based 
reporting system.    
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Design  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] (RCT) using mixed methods. We will 
conduct a two -armed pre -post pi[INVESTIGATOR_662932] . Study participants - twenty CBC patients 
with new ostomies and their caregivers (N=20 dyads , i.e., 40 individuals ) - will be 
randomly assigned to either the PRISMS  or usual care groups.  
7.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
We plan to recruit 20 patients with recent ostomy (within 4 weeks ) and their 
caregiver  (with a total of 20 patient -caregiver dyads and 40 individuals)  and 3-5 
health care providers . Based on previous experiences, we anticipate we will 
achieve data saturation among these participants.  We claim such a study as Screening  x

7 feasible if and only if both (i) recruitment rate (p) and (ii) retention rate (q) are 
large enough. More specifically, this is to test the following hypothesis: H0: p <= 
65% or q <= 65% vs H1: p >= 80% and q >= 80%. We will claim the study 
feasible (high r ecruitment rate and high retention rate) if we reach 29 or fewer 
patients/dyads to recruit 20 dyad s, AND more than 14 (>= 15 out of 20) 
participants remained in the study. This study reaches 76% power at alpha level 
0.10.   In addition, we will estimate the  proportion and associated 95% confidence 
interval of patients’  satisfaction with and perceived ease use of PRISMS . With 10 
couples in the PRISMS  arm and expected satisfaction rate of 70%, the width of 
the 95% CI will be around 0.58 (0.29 for 1 -side width).  
7.3 Data Analysis  Plans  
The feasibility of successful delivery of PRISMS  will be measured using 
indicators such as recruitment and retention rates . Analysis of these primary 
indicators are described above.     
 
Appropriate descriptive statistics will be calculated for other indicators of 
feasibility, quality of life; general, and physical, social/family, emotional, and 
functional subdomains, for participants and partners, by [CONTACT_7206] (T1, T2), and 
by [CONTACT_19313], and  patient’s health care services utilization (e.g., clinic visits, ER 
visits, and readmission) by [CONTACT_19313].   This sample size (10 in each group) will 
ensure 80% power to detect a large effect size of 1.[ADDRESS_894908] 
change (from T1 to T2), or mean level at T2 (if an outcome is only measured at 
T2), of a given outcome between the two intervention groups.  
  
Appropriate exploratory analyses (e.g., trajectory analysis of frequently measured 
PRO outcomes), for the purpose of generating hypotheses, may be conducted.  
  
All analyses will be conducted using an intention -to-treat approach, in which all 
randomized participants will be analyzed according to their assigned group, 
regardless of the extent of intervention actually received. Due to the fact that this 
is an exploratory proof -of-concept study, rather than a confirmatory study, we will 
not adjust for multiplicity when computing the CIs in conducting comparisons. 
Unless otherwise specified, all tests will be one -sided at an alpha level 0 .05. All 
analyses will be conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC ).  
 
7.4 Data Management /Audit  
Data will be collected at baseline  (T1) and follow -up (T2) survey s and post -exit 
interview by [CONTACT_662946].  We will use  
RedCap to store all of our data. Feasibility of PRISMS  will be measured using 
indicators such as recruitment and retention rates, and automatic recorded online 
activity comprising navigation time, number of logins, utilization of program 
sections. We will collect the data using administration log and study we bsite.  
 
7.4.1 Data Management  
Study ID numbers will indicate the identities of subjects, and this information will 
be accessible only to the study investigators. All questionnaires will bear study ID 
LCCC 1929   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_65435], PhD, RN   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date : 07/24/[ADDRESS_894909] 20% of 
the recordings against completed data for adherence to protocol, data 
completeness, and accuracy.  
 
REDCap online database will be managed by [CONTACT_662947]. NC TraCS is a key initiative of the Biomedical Informatics 
core of the UNC -Chapel Hill CTSA.  The purpose is to provide a system and 
associated support resources , to enable efficient and high -quality collection and 
management of research data that is standards -based in design, development 
and implementation.  Standard features of electronic clinical research data 
management systems are available in the web -based s ystems provided with the 
service.  These include interactive data entry with real -time field validation, lab 
data imports, audit logs to record database modifications, database integrity 
checks, security (in logins, permissions based on need, and encryptio n), 
reporting, forms inventory, and exports to common statistical packages for 
analysis. Logging tracks all data entered in REDCap so that it can be traced back 
to the person who entered it.  No data can be changed without showing who has 
made the changes.  This allows the study team to ensure there is security and 
integrity of the data collected and submitted, there are controls surrounding this 
aspect.  REDCap also provides for principle investigator to sign off on the data, 
as required in FDA studies.  Al though users can modify data based on their 
permissions, they cannot delete the subject or history of that subject.  Requests 
to delete a subject must be made to the REDCap system administrator.  Our 
database system provides for secure web -based data entry with the data stored 
on servers that staff at NC TraCS maintain.  The data is encrypted during 
transmission.  The servers are located in a secure campus area with all the 
appropriate physical security measures in place.  The web and database servers 
are mo nitored by [CONTACT_356884], patched frequently, and scanned by a third -
party vendor to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities.  The 
scanning application is the standard service for the entire campus.  Access is by 
[CONTACT_662948] i d, and is restricted to the forms and/or functions that the user 
needs to have.  The applications themselves are written using open source tools, 
and have also been scanned by [CONTACT_662949] k nown exploits.  The data is backed up to 
electronic media on a daily basis.  The electronic media is secured by [CONTACT_662950] a secure area separate from the servers.  
 
The study website for PRISMS  and NCI landing is hosted and maintained by [CONTACT_662951] (CHAI) of the UNC 
Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. The web activity data of all 
participants will be deidentified (using randomly assigned user IDs) and 
automatically tracked via a built -in feature of the study website. The de -identified 
web activity data from the PRISMS  website and the NCI website landing page at 
CHAI will be automatically electronically transferred th rough SFTP to the 
research office at the School of Nursing on a weekly basis.

9 All administrative data (including randomization, referral data) will be centrally 
managed using REDCap at the PI’s research office at the School of Nursing and 
accessed only by [CONTACT_105577]. These administrative 
data will be managed separately from the deidentified, password protected, 
encrypted and securely transferred data including surveys and web activity data. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_662933].  
 
The data collected from this study will help us to design and conduct a definitive 
trial to examine the efficacy of PRISMS, a potentially scalable intervention that 
can be disseminated through oncology clinics nationwide to enhance post -
treatment care for CBC patients with ostomies and their caregivers.  All data will 
be deidentified and saved in secure encrypted shared folder on UNC server. All 
identifiable data will be deleted from redcap and other sources following IRB 
instruction and data safety policies . 
 
 
7.4.2. Data Monitoring/Audit.  
This study is of such low risk. With a primary outcome of change in quality of life 
(QOL) between the PRISMS  and the usual care control groups, there would not 
be anything significant to provide to the DSMB that might signal a reason for the 
DSMB to stop a study.  However, we will implement a data and safety -monitoring 
plan to ensure the safety of participants as well as the validity and integrity of the 
data. The data monitoring plans are as follows:  
 
Oversight for this study will be provided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_662934].  An Adverse Event Monitoring Committee  will be formed  to 
oversee the conduct of the study.  Chaired by [CONTACT_60306]. Song (PI), the committee  will 
be comprised  of all of the Co-investigators . [CONTACT_461042]  will chair  the committee,  
which  will meet as needed to review  the activities  of the  study  including  
management,  personnel,  recruitment,  performance,  and any emer ging problems. 
The research staff will ensure all entry criteria are met prior to the initiation of the 
protocol and all study procedures and reporting of adverse events and 
unanticipated events is performed according to the IRB -approved protocol. Any 
actions taken and associated follow -up activities will be recorded in the study 
database. All intervention -related adverse events will be reported to the PRC and 
IRB within 3 -7 days.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_662935] (no interference in usual

reporting AEs that require investigators to report any AEs that are unexpected, 
fatal or life threatening to the IRB using standard forms within [ADDRESS_894911] (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol  prior to consenting and enrolling any participants.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
   
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by [CONTACT_38785] A Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that 
the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give co nsent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_468561]-approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the feasibility study , the written informed 
consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_235693].

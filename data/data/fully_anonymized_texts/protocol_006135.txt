ROUTE  Oral 
NUMBER OF SITES  Approximately 20 sites  in the [LOCATION_002] of America  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, efficacy and safety study with Azstarys
® in children 4 to 12 years 
of age with attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  
The phases of the study are as follows: 
• Screening Period  (Visit 1) 
Subjects will undergo a S creening Period up to 30 days prior 
to entering the Treatment Period . 
• Doub le-Blind Treatment Period  (Visit 2 through Visit  6) 
Eligible subjects will be randomized  in a blinded fashion to 
Azstarys ® or placebo at the start of  the Treatment Period . 
Randomization will be applied separately in each cohort and stratified by [CONTACT_547].  
o Cohort 1:  Subjects 4 and 5 years (<6 years) will start 
at 13.1 mg/2.6 mg  or matching placebo and may be 
titrated up or down to doses of 13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 26.1 mg/5.2 mg , or 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  Azstarys
® or 
matching placebo  approximately each week  through 
Visit 5  
o Cohort 2:  Subjects 6  to 12 years (<13 years) will start 
at 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  or matching placebo and may be 
titrated up or down to doses of 26.1 mg/5.2 mg , 
39.2 mg/7.8 mg, or 52.3 mg/10.4 mg Azstarys® or 
matching placebo  approximately each week   through

• Roll-over into Study KP415.P02 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 10 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 Subjects of Cohort 1 ( ages 4 and 5 years ) who successfully 
complete the treatment phase  have the option to participate in 
a 12-month open- label safety study with Azstarys ® 
(Study KP415.P02). At Visit 6 of the current study, all entry 
criteria to enroll in Study KP415.P02 (see protocol for Study KP415.P02) will be evaluated (Visit 6 for the current study is also Visit 2 of Study KP415.P02). 
• Follow- up Phone Call:  
Subjects who will not be rolled over into  Study KP415.P02 
will receive a Follow-up Phone Call, at 5  ±[ADDRESS_443216] to use another ADHD treatment will be discontinued from study treatment and from the study (Early Termination [ET]).  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to the end of the Treatment Period  (Visit 6) because of adverse events ( AEs), 
overdosage, or use of a prohibited treatment other than an ADHD treatment  will be followed (unless consent is withdrawn) with 
scheduled assessments until the end of the Treatment Period  
(Visit 6). If, during the remaining time on study, an ADHD 
treatment is  used, the subject will be discontinued from the study 
(ET).  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  • To determine the efficacy  of Azstarys® compared to placebo 
in treating children  ages 4 to 12 years old with ADHD. 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  • To determine the safety and tolerability of Azstarys
® 
compared to placebo in treating children 4 to 12 years old with ADHD. The safety objective includes evaluation of changes in body weight and height, and sleep behavior. 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Based on data from a previous study (efficacy study with Azstarys
® in subjects 6- to 12-years of age), the power and 
proposed sample size in each age cohort was calculated based on a two -sample t -test as follows (with no multiplicity correction for 
the two age cohorts): 
• 90% power to detect a 6- point treatment difference with an 
SD of 10-points using two- sided α=0.05 in Cohort  1 (4- to 
5-years -of-age) yields N=60 per treatment group in a 1:1 
ratio for a ctive and placebo for a total sample size of 120 
younger subjects 
• 80% power to detect a 6- point treatment difference with an 
SD of 10-points using two- sided α=0.05 in Cohort  2 (6- to 
12-years of age) yields N=45 per treatment group in a 1:1 
ratio for a ctive and placebo for a total sample size of 
90 older subjects. A lower power was selected for this cohort 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 11 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 because efficacy in this age group was previously 
established.  
Combining the two age cohorts for a total of 105 subjects per 
treatment group yields 99% overall study power to detect a between -treatment difference of 6 points with a SD of 10 points 
using two- sided α=0.05 for a total sample size in the study of 
210  s ubjects.  
A blinded sample size re- estimation will be conducted to 
recalculate the SD when approximately 50% of subjects  in Cohort [ADDRESS_443217] completed Visit 6 .  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  In each age cohort, a n appropriate number of subjects will enter 
the Screening Period to randomize approximately the following number of subjects in the Treatment Period . 
Randomization between  Azstarys
® and placebo will be applied 
within each of two age cohorts: 
• Cohort 1 (4 and 5 years of age):  130 subjects (6 5 per arm) 
with the intention to complete with approximately 120 subjects . 
• Cohort 2 (6 to 12 years of age):  100 subjects (50 per arm) 
with the intention to complete with approximately 90 subjects . 
The additional number of subjects enrolled is based on an approximate 10% early discontinuation rate. Subjects who terminate early in the Treatment Period  will not be replaced. 
In accordance with a male- to female distribution ratio of 3:1 of 
children diagnosed with ADHD in clinical practice , it is 
anticipated that approximate ly 75% males and 25 % females will 
be enrolled.

o Cohort 2:  Subjects 6 -12 years (<13 years): will start 
with at 39.2 mg/7.8 mg   Azstarys® or matching 
placebo  and may be titrated up or down to doses of 
26.1 mg/5.2 mg  39.2 mg/7.8 mg, 52.3 mg/10.4 mg 
Azstarys® or matching placebo  at Visits 3, 4, and/or [ADDRESS_443231] assessed by [CONTACT_737]. If a lack of tolerability should occur between visits, the dose may be lowered at any time. 
The optimized daily dose will be determined at Visit 5 and will 
be kept the same for the remainder  of the Treatment Period , with 
the following exception: if a lack of tolerability should occur, the dose may be lowered at any time. 
Study drug will be taken orally in the morning within [ADDRESS_443232]. Study drug will be swallowed whole (without crushing, cutting, chewing, opening, or dissolving) or may be taken by [CONTACT_355762] a small amount of applesauce. 
On each day at home (no scheduled visits to the study site) during 
the Treatment Period , the assigned study drug will be taken under 
the supervision of the subject’s parent or caregiver.

ADHD SEVERITY/  
EFFICACY EVALUATION CRITERIA The following scales will be used to assess the changes in ADHD severity:  
• ADHD- Rating Scale (ADHD-RS ): The Preschool Version 
of ADHD -RS-IV (McGoey 2007) will be used for 4- and 
5-year-old subjects (Cohort 1), and ADHD- RS-5 will be 
used in 6- to 12-ye ar-old subjects (Cohort 2). The 
ADHD-RS is an 18- item scale ( DuPaul 1998, DuPaul 2016) 
based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (American Psychiatric Association 2013 ) criteria 
of ADHD that rates symptoms on a 4- point scale. Each item 
is scored using a combination of severity and frequency ratings from a range of 0 (reflecting no symptoms or a frequency of never or rarely) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms or a frequency of very often), so that the total ADHD-RS scores range from 0 to 54. The 18 items can be divided into two 9- item subscales: One for 
hyperactivity/impulsivity and the other for inattention. Scores will be obtained during a clinician- directed interview 
with the parent/guardian/ caregiver at each visit.   
• Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid; Sheehan 2010) . Will  be used to 
conﬁrm the diagnosis of ADHD and identify comorbid psychiatric conditions. 
• Clinical Global Impressions –Severity (CGI -S): The CGI -S 
is a clinician -rated scale that evaluates the severity of 
psychopathology (ADHD symptoms in the study) on a scale from 1 (not at all ill) to 7 (among the most severely ill) (Busner and Targum 2007).  
• Clinical Global Impressions –Improvement (CGI- I): The 
CGI-I is a clinician -rated scale that evaluates the 
improvement of psychopathology (ADHD symptoms in the study) on a scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). 
During the Treatment Period , the ADHD- RS, CGI -I and CGI- S 
scale assessments are the main efficacy response variables (in conjunction with tolerability and safety) to guide dose optimization.

Page 20 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 All other concomitant medications will be allowed  if 
necessary . 
Note:  Subjects who are rolled over into Study KP415.P02 after 
the end of the Treatment Period  in the current study will need 
to continue to abstain from prohibited medications as explained 
in the protocol for Study KP415.P02. 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  • The occurrence of treatment  emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs) will be assessed following the first dose of study drug and ending with the Follow-up Phone Call or ET Visit.  
• Physical examinations will be performed at Screening, before 
the first dose of study drug (Visit 2 ), and at the end of the 
Treatment Period  (Visit 6) or at ET. 
• Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at Screening  and at 
the end of the Treatment Period  (Visit 6) or at ET. Urinalysis 
will also be performed at Screening, before the first dose of 
study drug and at the end of the Treatment Period  or at ET. 
• ECG parameters will be collected at Screening  and at the end 
of the Treatment Period  (Visit 6) or at ET. 
• Vital signs, height and  body weight will be collected at each 
visit.  Blood pressure data will be analyzed using the 2017 
AAP guidelines based on the average of 3 blood pressure measurements 2-5 minutes apart. 
• Height will be measured at Screening, Visit 2, and at the End of the Treatment Period . 
• A C-SSRS will be performed at each study visit. 
• Ratings from th e modified, abbreviated Children’s Sleep 
Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) will be collected at Screening, and at each  visit of the Treatment Period , or at ET. 
EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  During the Treatment Period  (Visits 2 -6): 
• ADHD- RS-IV (Preschool Version, Cohort 1) or ADHD-
RS-5 (Cohort 2) will be assessed at each visit . 
• CGI-S will be assessed at each visit  (Visits 2-6) 
• CGI-I will be assessed at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  • Safety Population:  Overall and for each cohort separately, 
all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication  and who have at least one post- dose 
safety assessment. Safety endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Population. Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Population. 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : Overall and for each 
cohort separately, all subjects who received at least one 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_443235] -
randomization ADHD- RS Total Score. Demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT 
Population. All  efficacy analyses will be conducted in the 
ITT Population. 
• Per-Protocol (PP) Population : Overall and f or each cohort 
separately, all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and  have the baseline and at 
least one post-randomization ADHD- RS Total Score, and 
who did not miss more than [ADDRESS_443236]-baseline measurements, where applicable, for continuous efficacy endpoints by [CONTACT_1570], overall and separately for each age cohort.  
For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in ADHD 
Rating Scale (ADHD -RS) total score, a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fitted using all data as observed. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender (stratification factor for randomization), baseline ADHD- RS total score, visit 
and visit-by- treatment interaction as well as a random effect for 
the subject.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on comparisons of 
Azstarys
® and placebo at Visit 6.  From the MMRM model, the 
Visit [ADDRESS_443237] square (LS) means of Azstarys® 
and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95% CI and two-sided p- value. The above analyses will be repeated 
for each age cohort separately.  
The primary estimand for this study is the difference in LS means of Azstarys
® and placebo with respect to change from baseline in 
ADHD-RS total score at Visit 6, based on the primary endpoint MMRM model fitted to the Intent- to-Treat population. There will 
be no adjustments made for the use of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355750]. The p -value associated with the primary 
estimand will be used to test the primary hypothesis of this study, that mean change from baseline to Visit 6 ADHD -RS total sc ore 
for Azstarys
® is different from that of placebo. If Azstarys® is 
shown to be statistically superior to placebo, then the superiority of Azstarys
® to placebo will be tested for each cohort separately.   
As a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, change from 
baseline in ADHD -RS total scores, the above analyses will be 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 22 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 repeated in their entirety using multiple imputation methods to 
impute the missing data.  If the primary analysis renders a 
significant treatment difference, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_355751] (MAR) assumption. The imputed values for Azstarys
® subjects’ visits post discontinuation 
will be made worse by a delta defined as k times the treatment difference between Azstarys
® and placebo obtained from the MI 
MAR analysis, where k is a shift parameter that is incremented in order to identify the point at which the primary analysis result becomes non-significant (the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]). Consideration will then be given to how plausible the imputed values are at the tippin g point. If not plausible, then the conclusion for the primary 
analysis under the MAR assumption is supported. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline to post-baseline timepoints in ADHD -RS for hyperactivity/impulsivity 
and the ADHD -RS for inattention as well as change from 
baseline CGI -S will be analyzed using the same methods as the 
primary efficacy endpoint. For each endpoint, MMRM ANCOVA models will be fitted using all data as observed. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender, baseline, visit, and visit-by- treatment interaction as well as a 
random effect for the subj ect. From the MMRM models, the Visit 
6 difference between LS means of Azstarys
® and placebo will be 
presented along with the corresponding 95% CI and two-sided p-value. The analyses will be repeated for each age cohort separately.  
For the CGI- I, an MMRM ANOVA model will be fitted using all 
data as observed. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender, visit and visit-by- treatment 
interaction as well as a random effect for the subject. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 diffe rence between LS means of 
Azstarys
® and placebo will be presented along with the 
corresponding 95% CI and two-sided p- value. The analyses will 
be repeated for each age cohort separately.  
Visit 6 CGI -I will also be compared between treatment groups 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi square test within 
each age cohort stratified by [CONTACT_547]. An overall CMH test will also be conducted stratified by [CONTACT_25890] (4 strata). 
Type I Error Control for Efficacy  
For the primary endpoint, the hypothesis of superiority of 
Azstarys
® to placebo will be tested at a two -sided alpha of 0.05 
for the two age cohorts combined.  If significant, the same hypothesis will be tested for each age cohort at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance.   
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 23 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 If the primary endpoint comparison is significant for Cohort 1, 
the superiority of Azstarys® to placebo with respect to the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, ADHD -RS for 
hyperactivity/impulsivity and ADHD -RS for inattention, will be 
tested for Cohort [ADDRESS_443238] listings.  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred term and system 
organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_14340], by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_78487]. The number and percentage of subjects with SAEs and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation will also be summarized by [CONTACT_14340] . 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_355763] (in kg), change and percent change from baseline in body weight, height (in cm), change and percent change from baseline in height, weight and height z-scores, and weight and height percenti les by [CONTACT_1570], separately for each age cohort. In 
addition, descriptive statistics will be tabulated by [CONTACT_355764]. 
An MMRM ANCOVA model will be fitted to change from 
baseline CSHQ total Sleep score. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender, baseline CSHQ, visit, and visit-by- treatment interaction as well as a random effect for 
the subject. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 difference between LS means of Azstarys
® and placebo will be presented 
along with the corresponding 95% CI. The MMRM analysis of the change from baseline CSHQ scores will also be conducted separately for each age cohort.  
An MMRM ANCOVA model will be fitted to change from baseline C-SSRS score. The model will include fixed effects for treatment,  age cohort, gender, baseline C-SSRS, visit and visit-by-treatment interaction as well as a random effect for the 
subject. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 difference between 
LS means of Azs tarys® and placebo will be presented along with 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 24 of 74  November 14, 2022 
  
 the corresponding 95% CI. The MMRM analysis of the change 
from baseline C -SSRS scores will also be conducted separately 
for each age cohort.  
Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted for potential sample size increase in subjects 4 and  5 years of age (Cohort 1). When 
approximately 50% of the Cohort [ADDRESS_443239] deviation (σ) will be estimated for 
change from baseline to Visit [ADDRESS_443240] sample size.  Since the study 
will remain blinded  for the sample size re -assessment, no alpha 
penalty for the final analysis will be incurred.

2. Study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated at Screening and Visit 2.  
3. Medical History: A complete medical history including chronic conditions, relevant surgical procedures (with start date), and history of drug use. 
4. Physical Examination: at Screening and at the end of the Treatment Period  or ET (if possible).  
5. Height will be recorded in centimeters (cm) using a stadiometer with the subject’s shoes removed. Height will be recorded at Screening, Visit 2, 
and at the end of the Treatment Period . Body weight will be measured in kilograms (kg)  using a calibrated scale ; subjects will remain in their 
normal clothing with shoes and jacket (and/or outer clothing) removed. Weight will be recorded at every visit.

signs will include sitting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic measurements), pulse rate (beats per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] r ate (breaths per minute), 
and oral temperature. Three (3) blood pressure measurements will be taken 2-5 minutes apart. Only the average of the 3 blood pressure 
measurements will be entered into the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
7. ECG: A [ADDRESS_443243] 3 minutes. Abnormal ECGs may be repeated for 
confirmation in which case only the repeated ECG will be recorded. 
8. Urine Screen for Drugs of Abuse: Urine samples will be tested for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, methamphetamines, benzodiazep ines, 
barbiturates, cannabinoids, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_355752]) at the Screening visit. If the urine test is positive for a ny of the analytes at 
Screening, the subject will be excluded from study participation. 
9. Urine Screen for Methylphenidate (MPH): Urine samples will be tested for MPH by [CONTACT_355765] a sample collected  at the Screening 
Visit. A urine dipstick (e.g., NarcoCheck®) will be used to screen for the presence of MPH in the urine at Visit 2. If a subject’s current ADHD 
medication at Screening contains MPH, the urine screen at Screening may test positive for MPH. All ADHD medications must be washed out by 
[CONTACT_4838] [ADDRESS_443244] negative. 
10. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS): The “Children’s Baseline/Screening” version will be assessed at Screening, and the 
“Children’s Since Last Visit” version will be assessed at all other visits. For subjects too young to comprehend the concept of suicidal ideation, the 
C-SSRS questionnaire will be filled in by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/caregiver. Subjects who have, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinically 
significant suicidal ideation/behavior, based on history of attempted suicide and the C- SSRS assessment at Screening or at any time before the last 
dose of study drug, will be excluded from further participation in the study. The follow-up C-SSRS will be obtained via phone. 
11. Subjects must wash out ADHD medications prior to Visit 2. Stimulant ADHD medications (with the exception of study drug), incl uding herbal 
medications, are prohibited from 5 days prior to Visit 2 to the end of the Treatment Period (Visit 6)  or ET Visit.  Non -Stimulant ADHD 
medications are prohibited from 14 days prior to the start of the Dose Optimization Phase (Visit 2) to the end of the Treatment Period (Visit 6)  or 
ET Visit. Before or on the day during the S creening P eriod that the subject will need to start the washout of their ADHD medications (for example, 
5 days before Visit 2 for stimulants), study site staff will contact [CONTACT_423]’s parent/guardian by [CONTACT_355766] (“Washout Phone C all”).  Other prohibited medications and the windows of prohibition are listed in the protocol.  
12. Dose Optimization/ Treatment Period : Subjects will begin taking study drug at home the morning following Visit 2. The starting dose will be 
13.1 mg/2.6 mg day or matching placebo in Cohort  1 and 39.2 mg/7.8 mg or matching placebo in Cohort 2. Dose adjustments, if needed, will be 
performed at approximately weekly intervals. Actual visit dates may deviate from exactly 7  days apart such that the total duration is 3 weeks 
(21 ±3 days ). The daily doses of study drug used will be 13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 26.1 mg/5.2 mg, 39.2 mg/7.8 mg, or 52.3 mg/10.4 mg Azstarys
® or 
matching placebo . At Visits 3, 4, and 5 based on the CGI scores, interview with the parent/guardian/caregiver, and safety data, the Investigator 
will evaluate the subject’s therapeutic responses and tolerability to treatment and decide whether the current dose should be increased, decreased, 
or remain the same for the next week of dosing. If a subject experiences symptoms of intolerance during at- home treatment, they must contact [CONTACT_42042], and, at the discretion of the Investigator, their dose may be adjusted before the next scheduled visit. Unsche duled visits between Visits 
2, 3, 4, and 5 are allowed as needed, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
13. Drug Accountability & Compliance Assessment: Study drug receipt, dispensing, and return will be recorded by [CONTACT_25733]’s pharmacy staff or 
Investigator-delegated employee. A record of the study drug accountability will be prepared and kept by [CONTACT_977]. 
14. Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to Azstarys® or matching placebo within each cohort. Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_547].

16. Adverse Events: To be assessed and recorded in the eCRF following the first dose of study drug, through either ET or the Follow-up Phone Call. 
Subject’s parent/guardian will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_355767] (AEs ) during at-home periods. 
17. Concomitant Medications: new and/or changed medications and dose, medical treatments, and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355753]-up Phone Call or ET. 
18. Subjects of Cohort 1 ( ages 4 and 5 years), who qualify, have the option to participate in a 12-month open- label safety study with Azstarys
® (Study 
KP415.P02). At Visit 6 of the current study, all entry criteria to enroll in Study KP415.P02 (see protocol for Study KP415.P02) will be evaluated. Visit 6 for the current study is also Visit 2 of Study KP415.P02. Roll -over S ubjects will not receive the Follow -up Phone Call in 
Study KP415.P01. 
19. Early Termination: Subjects who meet withdrawal criteria post- dose during the Treatment Period  (after at least one dose of study drug is 
administered) will complete E T procedures. At the discretion of the Investigator, ensuring the safety of the subjects, any Early Termination 
procedures that were already performed on the same day as part of the procedures of the Treatment Period , do not need to be repeated. Subjects 
who elect to use another ADHD treatment will be discontinued from study treatment and from the study (ET). Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment prior to the end of the Treatment Period  because of AEs, overdosage, or use of a prohibited treatment other than an ADHD treatment  
will be followed (unless consent is withdrawn) with scheduled assessments until the end of the Treatment Period (Visit 6 ). 
If, during the 
remaining time on study, an ADHD treatment is used, the subject will be discontinued from the study (ET).  
20. Assessment changes due to Corona virus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19): If a subject is not able to attend the site for a scheduled visit due to COVID -
[ADDRESS_443245] safety assessments ( vital signs, labs, ECG, physical exam) when the subject is next 
able to safely return to an on- site visit, even if those assessments would not normally be done at that visit. These assessments will be mapped to 
the nearest scheduled visit. Changes in scheduled visits and corresponding assessments due to COVID -[ADDRESS_443246]’s presence at the site (e.g., AEs, C -SSRS, ADHD -RS-IV, ADHD- RS-5; CGI -S, CGI -I, CSHQ) 
will be collected by [CONTACT_355768]. If needed, alternate measures to dispense study  drug to the subject during their COVID-19 
isolation period will be implemented (e.g., study drug directly delivered to the subject’s residence  or dispensed to another family member).

 2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Attention -Deficit /Hyperactivity D isorder (ADHD)  
Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder  (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder that 
occurs in 6 % to 8% of children and 4 % to 5% of adults worldwide ( Wilens 2008). The [ADDRESS_443247] common and effective therapeutics for the treatment of ADHD are central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulants, 
which contain amphetamine or methylphenidate (MPH). Amphetamine -containing products 
include brand names such as Adderall
®, Dexedrine®, Dextrostat®, and Vyvanse®. Methylphenidate 
containing products include Metadate  CD®, Concerta®, Daytrana®, Ritalin®, Methylin®, Quillivant 
XR®, and Focalin®. Positive effects on behavior and academic productivity are well established for 
stimulant medications such as MPH ( Wilens and Biederman 1992 ). Several studies have shown 
that, in children with ADHD, MPH improves classroom functioning, notably by [CONTACT_355769], accuracy and improvement in teacher 
ratings. In addition, MPH has been shown to improve performance in children for several cognitive tasks, including measures of attention and memory. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation 
and Treatment of Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, MPH  may be considered if behavior 
therapy is not available or does not provide significant improvement, and there is moderate -to-
severe continued disturbance in the 4 - through 5 -year-old child’s functioning ( Wolraich 2019).  
These guidelines go on to state that many young children with ADHD might still require medication to achieve maximum improvement. Ther e are limited clinical studies in this age group with 
stimulants ( MPH  and amphetamines) and non- stimulants , although most of the evidence -based data 
is with MPH  medications ( Greenhill 2006 ). 
2.2. Azstarys
® Product  
An extended -duration d -methylphenidate (d -MPH) product has been developed that contains 
immediate -release  (IR) serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), a prodrug of d- MPH, co -formulated with IR  
d-MPH. SDX is an inactive prodrug until converted to d- MPH in vivo and thus SDX provides a 
molecular delivery system for d -MPH. The drug product is formulated in a fixed molar dose ratio 
of 70% SDX Cl:30% d -MPH HCl. Chemically, SDX consists of a single d -MPH molecule 
covalently attached via a carbamate bond to a methylene oxide linker, which in turn is connected to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring of a nicotinoyl- serine moiety.  
The three dosage strengths of the approved formulation, for the treatment of ADHD in subjects 
ages 6 years and older, are as follows:  
• 26.1 mg/5.2 mg  Azstarys
®  
• 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  Azstarys®  
• 52.3 mg/10.4 mg Azstarys® 
To accommodate the lowest  dose in children of ages 4  and 5 years, capsules with 13.1 mg/2.6  mg 
Azstarys® have been developed.

scaling factor .

3. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  OF AZSTARYS® IN SUBJECTS OF AGE ≥6 YEARS  
As part of the clinical development program  of Azstarys®, 10 studies were conducted to examine  
the PK of SDX and SDX- derived d -MPH after oral administration of clinical doses of single -entity 
SDX  Cl or Azstarys®. Of these, 5 studies were conducted after single oral doses of single -entity 
SDX  Cl in healthy adult volunteers, 4 studies were conducted after single or multiple oral doses of 
Azstarys® in healthy adult volunteers, and 1 study was conducted after a single oral dose of 
Azstarys® in children (6- to12-years -of-age) and adolescents (13 - to 17-years -of-age) with ADHD. 
Studies were conducted with oral solutions of SDX  Cl and Azstarys®, an early capsule formulation 
of single -entity SDX  Cl, or with the final, marketed Azstarys® capsules.  
The key findings of the clinical pharmacology program are as follows:  
• The PK profile of Azstarys® capsules is a composite of the underlying d-MPH exposure 
derived from the d-MPH HCl and SDX Cl components ( Figure 1). After oral 
administration, early d -MPH exposure is governed by [CONTACT_941] d- MPH  HCl component and 
mid- to late -day exposure is governed by [CONTACT_355771], intra-intestinal conversion of inactive 
SDX to active d -MPH. Similar and predictable d -MPH PK profiles were observed in 
children  (6 to 12 years old), adolescents, and adults, and as a result, the efficacy profiles 
are also expected to be similar in all 3 age groups.

• Azstarys® capsules were not bioequivalent to the Reference Listed Drug, Focalin  XR 
(Focalin  XR label  2019 ), with respect to d -MPH exposure. The long -term safety of 
Azstarys® capsules was established in a clinical trial in patients with ADHD 6 - to 12- years -
of-age. The efficacy of Azstarys® was evaluated in a laboratory classroom study in children 
(ages 6 to 12 years) with ADHD. A bridge of the efficacy findings to older age groups is 
based on PK data with Azstarys® in adolescents and adults , and by [CONTACT_355772] d -MPH as established by [CONTACT_355773], adolescents, and adults. 
• Since the systemic exposure of d- MPH after oral administration of a 56/12  mg Azstarys® 
capsule is not higher than after 40 mg Focalin XR, prior findings of efficacy and safety for  
Focalin XR ( Focalin  XR label  2019) can be referenced to support, at least in part, efficacy 
and safety of Azstarys® capsules .

 • Administration of Azstarys® capsule under fed condition (high fat/high calorie meal) and 
administration of capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce increased peak d- MPH plasma 
exposure (C max) by 24% and 34%, respectively, and delayed median T max by 1.75 and 
2.00 h, respectively, with no significant increase in overall exposure (AUC 0-inf). 
Administration of Azstarys® capsule contents mixed in water under fasted condition was 
bioequivalent when compared to administration of intact Azstarys® capsule under the 
fasted condition. Based on these results, Azstarys® capsules can be administered wi thout 
regard to food. Mixing the capsule contents in water or sprinkling on applesauce are 
acceptable alternative modes of oral drug administration . 
• Following administration of 28/6 mg , 46/9 mg , and 56/12 mg Azstarys® capsules, d- MPH 
Cmax and AUC values increased proportionally with an increase in Azstarys® dose over the 
dose range studied. 
• Following multiple doses of 56/12 mg  Azstarys® capsules , steady -state of d -MPH was 
reached after the second dose, with  minimal accumulation of d- MPH when comparing 
Dose [ADDRESS_443248] SDX was observed with repeat-dosing. 
• Following oral administration of 60 mg [14C]-SDX  Cl: 
o The mean combined total recoveries of radioactivity in feces and urine over 168 h 
was 98.9%. The mean total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces were 62.1% and 36.8%, respectively.  
o No SDX- unique metabolites were identified in plasma . 
o Ritalinic acid was  the most abundant metabolite in all matrices ( i.e., plasma, urine, 
feces). SDX was only found at trace levels in urine (0.43% of total dose) but was the second most abundant species in the feces, accounting for  10.8% of the total 
dose. Recovery of d -MPH was generally low in urine and feces , accounting for  
2.74% of total dose observed in both excreta.  
• Following oral administration, the pharmacologically inactive SDX is largely confined to 
the intestinal tract until it is converted in the lower intestine to active d -MPH or excreted 
unchanged in feces. Due to the charged nature of SDX  and lack of substrate activity at 
common transporters , it has poor permeability across cellular membranes, resulting in both 
minimal systemic absorption and poor tissue penetration. The small fraction of oral SDX 
that is absorbed (mean oral bioavailability [F]< 3%)  remains la rgely in the intravascular 
fluid where it remains mostly unmetabolized until excreted unchanged in urine  (0.43% of 
an oral dose of SDX Cl is excreted unchanged) . 
• The collective nonclinical and clinical safety package have indicated no unique biological 
effects or toxicities  related to SDX as the intact prodrug. Thus, the only role of SDX is to 
provide a molecular mechanism to gradually and consistently deliver active d-MPH to the patient.

 • Following Azstarys® administration (after adjusting for dose), systemic exposure to 
d-MPH was higher in younger children because CL/F increased with age due to intrinsic 
body weight differences between younger children and adolescents. As a result, when 
normalized for body weight, CL/F values of d- MPH were comparable across age groups. 
Similarly, V z/F increased with age but when normalized for body weight, V z/F values of 
d-MPH were more comparable across age groups. Body weight is thus an appropriate 
scalin g factor between adolescents and children  (6 to 12 years old)  for exposure of d -MPH 
after oral Azstarys® dosing.

 8.1.1.  Azstary s® Capsules  
Azstarys® capsules contain two active pharmaceutical ingredients: d -methylphenidate 
(dexmethylphenidate; d- MPH) hydrochloride, and serdexmethylphenidate (SDX; a prodrug of d-
MPH). In terms of total d -MPH dose amounts, all capsule strengths contain 30% d -MPH and 70% 
d-MPH in the form of the prodrug. The total equivalent amount of d- MPH in each capsule strength 
(used as daily doses in this study), and the amounts of both APIs are listed in the following table .

2. The total dose of d- MPH expressed in terms of free base.  
The inactive ingredients in Azstarys® capsules include:  colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, 
hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and talc.  
Azstarys® is a Schedule II controlled substance. Therefore, study sites are required to have the 
appropriate permit from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to receive, store, ship and dispense 
Azstarys® according to all local, state, and federal regulations for Schedule II controlled substances . 
8.1.2.  Placebo Capsules 
Placebo  capsules will visually match the Azstarys® capsules  and will contain the following inactive 
ingredients only:  colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and talc.  
8.2. Treatment Assignment  
All subjects will receive study drug, as follows: 
At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized in a blinded fashion to either Azstarys® or placebo. 
Randomization will be applied to each cohort separately and will be stratified by [CONTACT_547]. 
During the Treatment Period , daily treatments of double -blind study drug  (one capsule per day) will 
be administered  for titration to an optimal daily dose. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive 
the dose -associated matching placebo capsules.  
o Cohort 1: Subjects 4 and 5 years (<6 years): will start at 13.1  mg/2.6  mg Azstarys
® 
or matching placebo and may be titrated to doses of 26.1  mg/5.2 mg , 
39.2 mg/7.8  mg Azstarys® or matching placebo  at Visits 3, 4, and/or 5. 
o Cohort 2 : Subjects 6 -12 years (<13 years): will start with at 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  or 
matching placebo and may be titrated to doses of 26.1 mg/5.2  mg, 52.3 mg/10.4  mg 
Azstarys® or matching placebo  at Visits 3, 4, and/or 5.

Page [ADDRESS_443262] assessed by [CONTACT_737]. If a lack of tolerability should occur between visits, the dose 
may be lowered at any time.  
The optimized daily dose will be determined at Visit 5 and will be kept the same for the remainder  
of the Treatment Period , with the following exception: if a lack of tolerability should occur, the 
dose may be lowered at any time.  
8.3. Drug Administration  
All study drug will be taken orally within [ADDRESS_443263] , at approximately 
the same time in the morning of each day.  
Study  drug will be swallowed whole (without crushing, cutting, chewing, opening, or dissolving) 
or may be taken by [CONTACT_355762] a small amount of applesauce. See 
Appendix  A for detailed instructions of the oral administration of study drug. 
On each day at home (no scheduled visits to the study site) during the Treatment Period , the 
assigned study drug will be taken under the supervision of the subject’s parent or caregiver.  
On days with scheduled visits to the study site, s ubjects will take the assigned study drug either at 
home under the supervision of the subject’s parent or caregiver before coming to the study site for 
their scheduled visit, or if their visit occurs in the morning, subjects may take the assigned study 
drug at the study site under the supervision of site staff.  
8.4. Blinding  
Study drug  will be blinded during the Treatment Period . Neither the subject, the Investigator, nor 
the Sponsor will know the subject’ s treatment assignment.  Upon completion of the study and after 
the database is locked according to the Sponsor (or designee)  operating procedures, the 
randomization codes will be provided to the statistician to unblind the  study.  
Emergency unblinding of patients : Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until  
all subjects have completed treatment. The blind for individual subjects can be broken before study  
unblinding at the request of the Investigator only if a specific emergency treatment would be  
dictated by [CONTACT_355774] a subject. When knowledge of the subject’s  treatment  
assignment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject , the Investigator should  
contact [CONTACT_1689] (or designee). Prior to unblinding the subject’s  treatment  assignment, 
the Investigator should assess the relationship of an AE  to the administration  of the study drug (Yes 
or No). The Investigator must then contact [CONTACT_355775]’s  
treatment assignment. If the blind is broken for any reason, the  Investigator must record the date 
and reason for breaking the blind on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and source 
documents. If a  serious adverse event ( SAE ) is reported, the Medical  Monitor (or designee) may 
unblind the treatment assignment for an individual subject for expedited regulatory reporting 
requirem ents. 
8.5. Compliance  
Study drug receipt, dispensing, and return will be recorded by [CONTACT_25733]’s pharmacy staff or Investigator -
delegated employee. A record of the study drug accountability will be prepared and kept by [CONTACT_977] . 
Drug accountability and c ompliance will be evaluated at each visit in the Treatment Period  and will 
be based on the number of dispensed and returned capsules  for each subject.  Subjects will be asked 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 42 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 to bring their unused medication to the clinical site  at each visit.  
Acceptable compliance is defined as 80 -100% (inclusive). If c ompliance between subsequent 
scheduled visits is outside this acceptance range, or cannot be determined (when, for example, the 
subject did not return unused study drug), the Investigator or designee will counsel the parent/legal guardian. If a subject is noncompliant more than once, the Investigator will discuss the subject’s 
noncompliance with the Medical Monitor, to decide whether the subject should be terminated early from further participatio n in the study . 
9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will consist of a Screening Period , a Double- Blind  Treatment Period , and a Follow -up 
Phone Call . A table with the Schedule of Events (SOE) representing the required testing procedures 
to be performed is included  in Section  1. Following is a list of these procedures and assessments. 
For instructions on procedures to follow if a subject is unable to attend a visit due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) restrictions, see Section  9.10.2. 
9.1. Screening Procedures  
Subjects will complete the S creening Visit within 30 days  (Day -30 to Visit 2 ) prior to starting the 
Treatment Period . Prior to conducting any study- related activities , including screening procedures , 
written I nformed C onsent and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
authorization must be  signed and dated by [CONTACT_7071]/legal guardian . For subjects [ADDRESS_443264] be completed.  
The following information collection/assessments will be performed at the Screening Visit:  
1. Informed Consent  and HIPAA authorization  by [CONTACT_174964]/legal guardian of the subject . 
2. Informed Assent by [CONTACT_423]  (Cohort 2, 6 years and older).  
3. Subject demographics including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity.  
4. Review of  inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine study  eligibility .

7. Body weight  and height. 
8. Vital signs after a minimum of [ADDRESS_443265] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse  rate, blood 
pressure, and oral temperature). Three (3) blood pressure measurements will be 
collected  2-[ADDRESS_443266] a 
CGI-S score of ≥4 (Moderately Ill) for further study participation. For subjects requiring 
washout of ADHD medications, this criterion refers to a score following washout. 
10. Perform the ADHD- RS-5 for Cohort 2 and the ADHD- RS-IV assessment for Cohort 1 
subjects.  Scores will be obtained during a clinician- directed interview with the 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 43 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 parent/guardian/caregiver present.  The ADHD subtype  in each subject  (combined 
subtype, impulsive/hyperactive subtype, etc .) will be recorded .

laboratory measurements may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects with a greater than trace proteinuria will be asked to provide the study site a morning void urine sample (unscheduled urine sample) to rule out orthostatic proteinuria. This urine sample will be sent to the clinical laboratory where u rine protein and creatinine 
will be quantified and the U
P/C ratio will be calculated to rule out “false positive” 
proteinuria. The morning void urine sample will be collected by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/caregiver under direction of the study site, and will be dropped off at the study site.

test is positive for any of the analytes at Screening, the subject will be excluded from study 
participatio n. 
18. Urine samples will be tested for MPH  in a clinical laboratory. If the urine test is positive 
for MPH  at Screening, the subject will be excluded from study participation, with the 
exception of the following: Depending on a subject ’s current ADHD medication at 
Screening, the urine screen may test positive for MPH . All ADHD medications must 
be washed out by [CONTACT_4838] 2. Subjects with a positive MPH urine screen by [CONTACT_5230] (e.g., 
NarcoCheck®) at Visit [ADDRESS_443267] will need to start the 
washout of their ADHD medications (for example, 5 days before Visit 2 for stimulants), study site staff will contact [CONTACT_423]’s parent/guardian by [CONTACT_355776] (“Washout Phone Call”) . Stimulant ADHD 
medications, including herbal medications, are prohibited from 5 days prior to Visit 2

Study  KP415.P02. 
• The ET Visit for subjects who withdraw early from the study. 
9.9. Unscheduled Visits  
At the discretion of the Investigator, subjects may be asked to come to the clinical site for an 
unscheduled visit. Subjects will need to bring their unused study drug to the visit.  
Unscheduled visits can occur at any time during the study . Examples of reasons to conduct an 
unscheduled visit:  
• If a subject experience s an AE during at -home treatment, they must contact [CONTACT_977], 
and, at the discretion of the Investigator, further in- person medical evaluation and review 
may be performed.  
• If a subject experience s symptoms of intolerance during at -home treatment or have 
complaints about increases in ADHD symptoms, they must contact [CONTACT_977], and, at the discretion of the Investigator, their dose may be adjusted before the next scheduled visit.  
The following procedures will occur at the Unscheduled Visit:  
1. Record the number of administered capsules of unblinded study drug for drug accountability and compliance. For this purpose, subjects will be asked to bring their unused medication to the clinical site.  
2. Vital signs after a minimum of [ADDRESS_443273] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, blood pressure, and oral temperature). Three (3) blood pressure measurements will be collected approximately 2- 5 minutes apart.  The average of the three measurements will 
be entered into the eCRF.  
3. Assessment and review of AEs . 
4. Review of concomitant medications, treatment and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
The following procedures will occur at the Unscheduled Visit, each at the discretion of the 
Investigator: 
1. Evaluations for safety, as needed (for example, to evaluate and review AEs ): 
a. Physical examination. 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_443274] has been in supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a minimum of 3 
minutes. Abnormal ECGs may be repeated for confirmation in which case only 
the repeated ECG will be recorded.  
c. C-SSRS, “Children’s Since Last Visit” version. The C -SSRS questionnaire will 
be filled in by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/caregiver. Subjects with clinically significant suicidal ideation/behavior, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], based on the C-SSRS assessment, will be excluded from further participation in the study, and 
further evaluation and/or preventive intervention steps for suicidal behavior will be taken, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
d. Clinical laboratory assessments (under fasted or non -fasted conditions). 
2. If, at the discretion of the Investigator, an unscheduled evaluation of the changes in ADHD symptoms is needed, for a potential unscheduled dose level change of study drug: 
a. If needed, perform an assessment of ADHD severity. This may include an ADHD- RS, CGI-S, and/or CGI -I scale assessment.  
b. If needed, perform a dose adjustment: based on the ADHD severity assessment, interview with the parent/guardian/caregiver, and safety data, the Investigator will evaluate the subject’s therapeutic response and tolerability to treatment, and decide whether the current dose should be increased, decreased, or remain the same. On any day during the study, the daily dose will be either 13.1 mg/2.6 mg, 
26.1 mg/5.2  mg, 39.2 mg/7.8  mg, or 52.3  mg/10.4 mg  Azstarys
® or matching 
placebo capsules.  
If a subject meets  any of the withdrawal criteria during the Unscheduled Visit, the subject will be 
withdrawn, and ET  procedures will be completed. 
9.10. Visit and Assessment Changes Due to COVID -19 
9.10.1.  General Guidelines  
Due to the COVID- 19 public health emergency and in alignment with the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards entitled FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during CO VID-19 Public 
Health Emergency (March 2020; updated August 30, 2021), alternative measures will be implemented for some subjects and/or sites participating in the study. Measures will be implemented on an “as needed” basis, to maintain trial continuity, sustain subjects’ access to study drug and ensure the continued safety of subjects and the integrity of the study data. Where it is possible, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol. However, for some study subjects and sites, the COVID -19 public health emergency and resulting “stay at home” orders, site 
closures, and travel limitations may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol- specified procedures, 
including on -site delivery of investigational product and adhering to protocol -mandated on-site 
visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing for the study. In these circumstances, alternative measures will be employed and documented as protocol deviations that will be summarized within the CSR. These alternative measures are intended to remain in  effect only for the duration of the public health 
emergency related to COVID -19, and are applied only if an on- site study visit cannot occur. The 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_443275]’s residence and replacing on- site 
study visits with remote study visits, which may include:  
• Adaptation of efficacy assessments  
• Alternative methods for safety assessments  
A listing of all subjects affected by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_443276] number and 
by [CONTACT_76537], and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered will be 
generated. Specifically, the listing will include, but is not limited to, the following: 
• Subjects who had on- site visits converted into remote visits  
• Subjects who had visits and/or assessments not performed/missing along with the reason 
• Subjects who had efficacy and safety data collected out of window 
All of the above study changes will be captured as protocol deviations. Additionally, these data will be captured in the eCRF . 
9.10.2.  Study -specific Guidelines  
If a subject is not able to attend the site for a scheduled visit due to COVID -[ADDRESS_443277] safety assessments (vital signs, labs, ECG, physical exam) when the subject is next able to safely return to  an on -site visit, even if those assessments would 
not normally be done at that visit. These assessments will be mapped to the nearest scheduled visit. Changes in scheduled visits and corresponding assessments due to COVID -19 restrictions will be 
captured in the eCRF. Instructions will be included in the eCRF completion guidelines for capturing 
visits and/or assessments that were missed (not performed), delayed, or performed remotely. The following visit and assessment changes will be included in submission datasets:  
• All on -site visits that were converted to remote visits due to COVID -19 restrictions will be 
flagged. This information will be captured in the eCRF and protocol deviation log. 
• Missed visits and assessments are flagged if the “not done” field is indicated and the comment field indicates “COVID -19.” 
Assessments that do not require the subject’s presence at the site (e .g., AEs, C -SSRS, ADHD -RS, 
CGI-S, CGI -I, CSHQ) will be collected by [CONTACT_355768].  
If needed, alternate measures to dispense study drug to the subjects during their COVID -19 isolation 
period will be implemented (e .g., study drug directly delivered to the subject’s residence or 
dispensed to another family member). 
10. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS  
Subjects will be instructed not to consume any of the below products; however, allowance for an

 11.2. Packaging and Labeling  
The Azstarys® capsules and placebo capsules for the Treatment Period  will be packaged and labeled 
appropriately. 
All study medication will be blinded  throughout the study. Blinded study medication will be 
dispensed  for each subject based on the  randomization scheme. The patient randomization number 
assigned by [CONTACT_15017]  (IRT) or similar system/process will correspond 
to the number on the bottle (s). 
Blinded study medication  will be packaged as bottles with [ADDRESS_443280] 7 days of dosing in the Treatment Period  (1 
capsule/day) and 3 extra capsules to cover the potential loss of capsules or extra dosing days before 
the next visit. Each bottle will be dispensed with instructions on how to administer study drug. The number on the bottle will be recorded in the Elec tronic Data Capture (EDC) system for the study. 
11.3. Dispensing Procedures  
Blinded bottles of drug supply (Azstarys
® capsules or matching placebo) will be dispensed at each 
visit as follows: 
• Visit 2: Subjects will be dispensed a blinded bottle with 10 capsules of either 
13.1 mg/2.6  mg or 39.2 mg/7.8  mg Azstarys® (starting dose  for Cohort  1 and Cohort 2, 
respectively ), or associated placebo capsules . 
• Visit 3: Subjects will return to the clinic after 7 ±3 days for Visit 3 with unused study drug and will be dispensed a bottle with 13.1 mg/2.6 mg or 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  Azstarys
® (same 
daily dose as Week 1  for Cohort  1 and Cohort  2, respectively ), with 26.1 mg/5.2  mg 
Azstarys® (dose level increase from Week 1 for Cohort  1 subjects or decrease from Week 1  
for Cohort  2 subjects ), or with 52.3 mg/10.4 mg Azstarys® (dose level increase from Week 
1 for Cohort 2  subjects ), or associated placebo capsules . 
• Visit 4: Subjects will return to the research clinic after 7 ±3 days for Visit 4 with unused study drug, and will be dispensed a bottle with 13.1 mg/2.6 mg , 26.1 mg/5.2  mg, 
39.2 mg/7.8  mg, or 52.3 mg/10.4 mg  Azstarys
® (same daily dose as Week 2, or a dose level 
decrease or increase from Week 2), or associated placebo capsules .  
• Visit 5:  Subjects will return to the research clinic after 7 ±3 days for Visit 5 with unused 
study drug, and will be dispensed a bottle with 13.1 mg/2.6 mg , 26.1 mg/5.2  mg, 
39.2 mg/7.8  mg, or 52.3 mg/10.4 mg  Azstarys® (same daily dose as Week 3, or dose level 
decrease or increase from Week 3), or associated placebo capsules . 
At Visits 2, [ADDRESS_443281]’s parent or legal guardian with 
instructions when and how to administer study drug while at home, under supervision of parent or legal guardian. At each visit, site personnel will record the number of returned and administered capsules of study drug for drug accountability and compliance.  
In the event that a subject experiences  lost study drug during the at- home dosing periods, they will 
be instructed to contact [CONTACT_355781]. Lost drug supply may be replaced with the appropriate new bottle after the Investigator or designee contacts the IRT  or 
similar system/process. All efforts will be made to ensure subjects receive daily doses of double -
blind study drug for at least [ADDRESS_443282]’ s parent/legal guardian in the study . 
11.4. Materials Control  
Azstarys® is a Schedule II product under the Controlled Substances Act. Therefore, the study site 
is required to have the appropriate permit from the DEA to receive, store, ship and dispense the 
Azstarys® product according to all local, state, and federal regulations for Schedule II substances. 
Once received  and labeled by [CONTACT_355782], the drugs will 
be considered study drug material. The pharmacist or designee will maintain adequate records of 
the receipt, dispensing, return or other disposition of the drug, including dates, quantity, serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], as appropriate. Reasons for any departure from the expected regimen will be documented. These documents will be made available to regulatory agency inspectors upon request. The Investigator  will not supply study drug to anyone other than those named as sub-
investigators on FDA Form 1572, designated site staff, and subject ’s parent/legal guardian  in the 
study. 
11.5. Storage of Study Drug 
Study drug will be stored at controlled room temperature 20° -25°C (68° -77°F) with excursions 
allowed between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F). Transient spi[INVESTIGATOR_201164] 40°C are permitted as long 
as they do not last for more than [ADDRESS_443283](s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented,  and reported to the Sponsor . Once 
a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. 
11.6. Study Drug Accountability  
An accurate and current accounting of the dispensing and return of study drug for each subject will be maintained on an ongoing basis by a member of the study site staff. The number of study drug dispensed will be recorded on the Investigational Drug Accou ntability Record. The study monitor 
will verify these documents throughout the course of the study. 
12. SAFET Y ASSESS MENT S 
12.1. Medical  History  
12.2. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examinat ion will be completed for all subjects  at Screening  and at the End -of-
Treatment  (Visit 6) or ET. The complete physical examination will include a review of the subject’s 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 55 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 general appearance, skin, head and neck , musculoskeletal/ extremities, heart , lungs, abdomen and a 
brief examination of the neurological system.  
Body weight  and height will be determined a t each visit. Height will be recorded in centimeters 
(cm) using a stadiometer with the subject’s shoes removed. Body weight will  be measured in 
kilograms (kg)  using a calibrated scale; subjects will remain in their normal clothing with shoes and 
jacket (and /or outer clothing) removed. 
A complete medical history will be obtained at the Screening Visit includ ing the recording of 
demographic data ( date of birth, sex, age, race, ethnicity), and collection of previous surgeries, 
medications , and chronic conditions, past or present illnesses or dysfunctions, substance/drug 
abuse, and history of allergies or idiosyncratic responses to drugs. Medical history (changes from 
Screening) will be updated at subsequent visits after the Screening Period.  
12.3. Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)  
The modified, abbreviated CSHQ will be used to assess the sleep behavior  during the Treatment 
Period . The CSHQ is a retrospective, 33 -item parent questionnaire to examine sleep behavior in 
small children ( Owens 2020). Items are rated on a 3 -point scale of “Usually”, “Sometimes” and 
“Rarely” for occurrences in a number of key sleep domains (bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, 
sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) . Scores will be obtained during a clinician -directed interview with the 
parent/guardian/caregiver at Screening, at each visit during the Treatment Period , or at the ET Visit.  
The total Sleep Disturbance Score  is the sum of the  frequency ratings of the 33 items.  
CSHQ s cores will be obtained during a clinician -directed interview with the 
parent/guardian/caregiver . 
12.4. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidal ideation will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] C-SSRS , Pediatric  Version  (Posner 2010). The “ Children’s 
Baseline/Screening” version will be assessed at Screening, and the “ Children’s Since Last Visit” 
version w ill be assessed at all other visits.  For subjects too young to comprehend the concept of 
suicidal ideation, the C-SSRS questionnaire will be filled in by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/caregiver . 
Subjects who, i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], have  clinically significant suicidal 
ideation/behavior, based on history of attempted suicide and the C -SSRS assessment at Screening 
or at any time before the last dose of study drug, will be excluded from further participation in the study, and further evaluation and/or preventive intervention steps for suicidal behavior will be taken, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
12.5. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will be obtained at each visit after the subject has been seated for 
3 minutes. Vital signs will include sitting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic measurements), 
pulse rate (beats per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute), and oral temperature . Blood 
pressure data will be analyzed using the 2017 AAP guidelines ( Flynn 2017 ) based on the average 
of [ADDRESS_443284] has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a minimum of 
3 minutes.  Abnormal ECGs may be repeated for confirmation in which case only the repeated ECG 
will be reco rded. ECGs will be collected at Screening, Visit 6, and at ET. 
The following ECG parameters will be recorded : 
• Heart Rate (bpm) 
• QT I nterval  (msec)  
• RR Interval (msec)  
• ECG Evaluation (performed at the clinical site ): one of the following:  Normal ; Abnormal, 
not clinically significant; Abnormal, clinically significant. If Abnormal, a specific 
description of the abnormality in the ECG. 
12.7. Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
Up to [ADDRESS_443285] 
during the study and sent to the clinical laboratory . Clinical laboratory samples will be obtained at  
the Screening V isit, at the end of the Treatment Period  (Visit 6), at ET, and at Unscheduled Visits 
(if applicable).  
Urinalysis will also be performed by [CONTACT_355783] 
(Visit 1), at the end of the Treatment Period  (Visit 6), at ET, and at Unscheduled Visits (if 
applicable).  
Clinical laboratory m easurements  may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator. 
The c linical laboratory evaluations will consist of the following: 
• Total Hematology with  differential: red blood cell count, white blood cell count with 
differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), hemoglob in, 
hematocrit and platelets . 
• Serum Chemistry: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, phosphorus (inorganic ), calcium, chloride, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, gamma 
glutamyl transferase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, sodium, total protein, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) . TSH will be measured at Screening only (to 
evaluate the exclusion criterion for subjects with uncontrolled thyroid disease). 
• Urinalysis : 
o Urinalysis will include, but not be limited to, the following: bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, protein, and urobilinogen 
o Unscheduled urine sample: Subjects with a greater than trace proteinuria on any visit (including Screening) with urinalysis assessments throughout the study will be asked to provide the study site a morning void urine sample to rule out orthostatic proteinuria. This urine sample will be sent to the clinical laboratory, 
where u rine protein and creatinine will be quantified, and the urine protein to 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 57 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 creatinine (U P/C) ratio will be calculated to rule out “false positive” proteinuria. A 
UP/C ratio <0.2 will be considered normal. The morning void urine sample will be 
collected by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian/caregiver under direction of the study site, and 
will be dropped off at the study site. 
• Urine Screen for Drugs of Abuse: Urine samples will be tested for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, methamphetamines, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, cannabinoids, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_355752]) at the Screening visit. If the urine test is positive for any of the analytes at Screening, the subject will be excluded from study participation. 
• Urine Screen for MPH : 
o At Screening, the urine sample collected for urinalysis will also be tested for MPH  
in the clinical laboratory. Depending on a subject's current ADHD medication at 
Screening, the urine screen may test positive for MPH . Subjects must wash out 
current ADHD medications from 5 days prior to Visit 2 and not use them to the 
end of the Treatment Period (Visit 6) or ET . 
o At Visit 2, urine samples will be tested for MPH with a urine dipstick 
(e.g., NarcoCheck
®) that provides immediate results. Subjects with a positive 
screen at check -in to the Treatment Period  will be excluded from further study 
participation . 
12.8. Adverse Event Assessments  
Adverse events  (AEs) shall be monitored continuously from the administration of the first dose of 
study drug until either the Follow -up Phone Call or ET  visits  as noted on the S OE. Definitions and 
details of AE rep orting and documentation are listed in  Section  18. 
13. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
13.1. ADHD Diagnosis  
ADHD- RS: The Preschool Version of ADHD -RS-IV (McGoey 2007) will be used for 4 - and 
5-year-old subjects (Cohort 1), and ADHD -RS-5 will be used in 6- to 12-year-old subjects 
(Cohort 2). Although there is a Version 5 of the ADHD -RS, the validated preschool version is 
currently Version IV . The ADHD- RS-IV and ADHD- RS-5 are 18- item scale s (DuPaul 1998 , 
DuPaul 2016) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association 2013) criteria of ADHD that rates symptoms on a 4-poi nt scale. Each item 
is scored using a combination of severity and frequency ratings from a range of 0 (reflecting no symptoms or a frequency of never or rarely) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms or a frequency of very often), so that the total ADHD -RS scores range from 0 to 54. The 18 items can be divided into 
two 9 -item subscales , one for hyperactivity/impulsivity and the other for inattenti on. Scores will be 
obtained during a clinician- directed interview with the parent/guardian/caregiver at each visit. 
At Screening, the ADHD Presentation (Predominantly Inattentive, Hyperactive -Impulsive, or 
Combined ) will be reco rded for each subject.

Page 58 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 13.2. Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI 
Kid)  
The MINI Kid (Sheehan 2010) will be used to conﬁrm the diagnosis of ADHD and identify 
comorbid psychiatric conditions at the Screening Visit only . 
13.3. Clinical Global Impressions –Severity (CGI -S) 
The CGI -S is a clinician -rated scale that evaluates the severity of psychopathology (ADHD 
symptoms in the study) on a scale from 1 (not at all ill) to 7 (among the most severely ill) ( Busner 
and Targum 2007).  The CGI -S will be performed at Screening  and at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
13.4. Clinical Global Impressions –Improvement (CGI -I) 
The CGI-I is a clinician -rated scale that evaluates the improvement of psychopathology (ADHD 
symptoms in the study) on a scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI -I 
will be performed at Visits 3, 4, 5, and  6. Since the CGI -I is an assessment of improvement versus 
the previous visit, there is no CGI -I assessment at baseline (Visit 2).  
14. PHARMACODYNAMICS  
This study will not include PK evaluations. Therefore, PD assessments are not applicable.  
15. DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
15.1. Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
A subject may be discontinued or choose to withdraw from study treatment at any time if the 
subject, the Investigator , or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue. 
The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:  
• Subject withdrawal of consent. 
• Subject is not compliant with study procedures. 
• Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_355755]. 
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment. 
• Lost to follow-up after a missed visit, when there is no response to two attempts by [CONTACT_54322] a registered letter to the subject. After these [ADDRESS_443286] to follow-up. 
• Sponsor request for early termination of the study.  
• O
verdosage, at the discretion of the Investigator (e.g., intentional overdosage, multiple 
occurrences of overdosage). 
• For other reasons (reason will be recorded) .

from the clinic , if possible . 
At the discretion of the Investigator, ensuring the safety of the subjects, any ET procedures that 
were already performed on the same day as part of the procedures of the Treatment Period , do not 
need to be repeated.  
The Sponsor may be contact[CONTACT_355784] a case- by-case basis.  
15.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Enrolled s ubjects who withdraw from the study early will not  be replaced .  
16. EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
The following endpoints will be used to determine efficacy: 
16.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• Change from baseline (Visit  2) through the  end of treatment  (Visit  6) in the ADHD  
Rating Score (total score) . For Cohort 1, the ADHD -RS-IV will be used; for Cohort 2, the 
ADHD- RS-5 will be used.  
16.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Changes from baseline (Visit  2) to all post -baseline visits through the last evaluation (Visit  6 
or ET ) in the ADHD Rating Score for hyperactivity/impulsivity.  
• Changes from baseline (Visit  2) to all post -baseline visits through the last evaluation (Visit  6 
or ET) in the  ADHD Rating Score for inattention.  
• Changes from baseline (Visit  2) to all post -baseline visits through the last evaluation (Visit  6 
or ET) in the  CGI-S. 
• CGI-I from Visit [ADDRESS_443288] evaluation (Visit 6 or ET ). 
17. STATISTICAL METHODS  AND REPORTING  
17.1. Sample Size Calculation  
Based on data from a previous study (efficacy study with Azstarys® in subjects 6- to 12- years of 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 60 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 age), the power and proposed sample size in each age cohort was calculated based on a 
two-sample t -test for the comparison of change from baseline to [ADDRESS_443289]- baseline in ADHD 
Rating Scale total score as follows ( with no multiplicity correction for the two age cohorts ): 
   
− 90% power to detect a 6-point treatment difference with an SD of 10-points using two-
sided α=0.05 in the Younger Cohort (4- to 5- years of age) yields N=60 per treatment 
group in a 1:1 ratio for Active and Placebo for a total sample size of 120 younger subj ects 
− 80% power to detect a 6-point treatment difference with an SD of 10-points using two-sided α=0.05 in the Older Cohort (6- to 12- years of age) yields N=45 per treatment group 
in a 1:1 ratio for Active and Placebo for a total sample size of 90 older subjects . A lower 
power was selected for this cohort because efficacy in this age group was previously established.  
 
Combining the two age cohorts for a total of 105 subjects per treatment group yields 99% overall study power to detect a between -treatment difference of 6 points with a SD of 10 points using 
two-sided α=0.05 for a total sample size in the study of 210 subj ects. 
 A blinded sample size re-estimation will be conducted when approximately 50% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_443290] completed Visit 6 .  The sample size may  be increased based on that analysis.  
Details are presented in the Interim Analysis section below.  
 
Supporting Material for the Assumed Mean Treatment Difference and SD:  
The estimation of the point estimate of 6 points and a SD of 10 points is based on the following 
data:  
• No clinical studies with MPH  have been published that used a parallel design with active vs 
placebo throughout the study. D ose titration with active investigational drug followed by 
[CONTACT_355785] a placebo arm was typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]. Therefore, 
the mean ADHD- RS-5 (total score) change from baseline (CFB) in the titration phases of 
the Phase 3 studies conducted with Azstarys® were used  (Table 2  and Table 3 ). 
• Point Estimate: Based on the range of CFB seen in E01 ( -25.6) and S01 ( -28.2) during 
[ADDRESS_443291].  
• Variability: The SD (10 points) was estimated as approximately the overall mean of the SD values of CFB at each visit across both studies (E01 and S01 studies, Table  2 and Table  3, 
respectively ). Based on the range of coefficients of variation  (CVs) seen in E01 (16.7 -
54.8%) and S01 (18.7- 63.0%) during 4 weeks of treatment, a SD of 10 is equivalent to a 
CV of 10/6 = 167%, and is very conservative.

one post -randomization ADHD -RS Total Score. Demographics and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized for the ITT Population. All efficacy analyses will be conducted in the ITT Population . 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population  is defined overall and for each cohort separately. PP population 
includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and have the 
baseline and at least one post -randomization ADHD -RS Total Score, and did not use prohibited 
medications deemed to impact efficacy. The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the PP Population, as sensitivity analyses. 
17.3. Statistical Analyses  
A Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lock and will 
include detailed descriptions of all analyses to be conducted on all data collected for this study as 
well as complete details on the procedures to handle missing data . This section is a summary of the 
planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
All clinical study data will be presented in subject data listings. Descriptive statistics will be

Page 62 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 presented by [CONTACT_355787] (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum. and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency 
and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables. Unless otherwise specified, all tests will be 2 -
tailed at 0.05 level of significance. All CIs will be two-sided 95% CIs.   
Within each cohort and overall, the numbers of subjects screened, the number of subjects randomized, and the number of subjects in the safety, ITT,  and PP Populations  will be displayed 
overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. For randomized subjects who discontinue from the study, the 
primary reason for discontinuation will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_355788]. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristic data will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_1570], overall and by [CONTACT_50802], including sex, age, and race as well as weight , height, 
BMI, and ADHD subtype. The study medication doses received will be analyzed descriptively and 
the optimized dose will be analyzed descriptively overall and by [CONTACT_50802]. Concomitant 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects using each concomitant medication will be presented  by 
[CONTACT_1570], overall and by [CONTACT_50802] . 
17.4. Efficacy Analyses  
17.4.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline (Visit 2), all post baseline measurements (Visits 3 to 6), and changes from baseline to all post -baseline measurements of ADHD Rating Scale 
(ADHD- RS) total score by [CONTACT_1570], overall and separate ly for each age cohort.  
For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD- RS) total score, 
a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fitted using all data as observed. The dependent variable will be change from baseline (Visit 2) in ADHD Rating Scale total score for all post -baseline assessments for each subject. The model will 
include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender (stratification factor for randomization), baseline ADHD -RS total score, visit (V isit 3, 4, 5, and 6), and visit -by-treatment interaction as well 
as a random effect for the subject. The mixed model will utilize restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the Kenward -Roger method used to compute the denominator degrees of freedom 
for tests of fixed effects. The model will assume an unstructured covariance matrix. If the model 
does not converge under the unstructured covariance matrix  when using the SAS PROC MIXED 
default Newton -Raphson algorithm, other numerical methods such as the Fis her scoring algorithm 
will be tried. Details regarding the alternative algorithm(s) will be provided in the study SAP. If the model using the unstructured covariance matrix still fails to converge, alternative covariance structures will be used until conve rgence is reached based on an ordered list of progressively more 
specific covariance structures which will be documented in the SAP. If a structured covariance is used, then a robust sandwich estimator will be utilized for estimating the variance of the tr eatment 
effect estimate.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on comparisons of Azstarys® and placebo at Visit 6. From the MMRM model, the Visit [ADDRESS_443293] square (LS) means of Azstarys® and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95% CI and t wo-sided p -value.  
The above analyses will be repeated for each age cohort separately. 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 63 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 The primary estimand for this study is the difference in LS means of Azstarys® and placebo with 
respect to change from baseline in ADHD -RS total score at Visit 6, based on the primary endpoint 
MMRM model fitted to the Intent -to-Treat population. There will  be no adjustments made for the 
use of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355756]. The p- value associated with the primary 
estimand will be used to test the primary hypothesis of this study, that mean change from baseline to Visit 6 ADHD -RS total sc ore for Azstarys® is different from that of placebo. If Azstarys® is 
shown to be statistically superior to placebo, then the superiority of Azstarys® to placebo will be tested for each cohort separately.   
To the extent possible, attempts will be made to minimize the amount of missing data through measures planned in the study conduct. Subjects who discontinue treatment due to adverse events, overdosage, and use of prohibited medications will be followed thr ough the end of study unless and 
until they withdraw consent or start a new ADHD medication  (as treatment with a new ADHD 
medication will confound the effects of the randomized treatment) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], it is 
expected that there would still be so me missing primary endpoint data in this study. Missing primary 
endpoint data will be handled as follows: 
As a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, change from baseline in ADHD -RS total scores, 
the above analyses will be repeated in their entirety using multiple imputation methods to impute 
the missing data. The following three steps will be followed:   
In step 1, missing data will be imputed with multiple imputation (MI) using SAS PROC MI. The SAS PROC MI will be used for imputing the change from baseline in ADHD -RS total score over 
time. Missing values at intermittent timepoints prior to the permanent d iscontinuation of study drug 
will be imputed using the MCMC option. Since classification variables such as treatment group cannot be included in the MCMC statement directly, a BY [CONTACT_355789]. Missing data following 
permanent discontinuation of study drug will be imputed by [CONTACT_355790]. Baseline and post- baseli ne scheduled visits will be used in the regression option to impute the missing values.  
The output from PROC MI will be a data set containing multiple repetitions of the original data set, along with the newly imputed values. A minimum of [ADDRESS_443294] the equality of the change from baseline in ADHD-RS total score means for Azstarys® and placebo.  
In step 3, the results from each separate analysis in step 2 will be pooled using SAS PROC 
MIANALYZE. The pooled results will contain the estimate for the mean difference between Azstarys® and placebo for the change from baseline in ADHD -RS total score at Visit 6, as well as 
the corresponding standard error, 95% CI, and p-value.  
If the primary analysis renders a significant treatment difference, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_355757] (MAR) assumption. Details will be provided in the SAP and a summary is provided below:  
As missing values following early discontinuations may not be consistent with a MAR assumption, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation under a missing not at random (MNAR) assumption will be performed searching for a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_355758] t he primary analysis conclusion. The 
imputed values for Azstarys® subjects’ visits post discontinuation will be made worse by a delta defined as k times the treatment difference between Azstarys® and placebo obtained from the MI 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 64 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 MAR analysis, where k is a shift parameter that is incremented in order to identify the point at 
which the primary analysis result becomes non- significant (the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]). Consideration will 
then be given to how plausible the imputed values are at the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]. If not plausible, then the conclusion for the primary analysis under the MAR assumption is supported. 
17.4.2.  Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline (Visit 2), all post baseline measurements (Visits 
3 to 6), and changes from baseline to all post -baseline measurements of ADHD -RS for 
hyperactivity/impulsivity and ADHD -RS for inattention by [CONTACT_3148] g roup, overall and separately 
for each age cohort.   
The secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline to post -baseline timepoints in ADHD- RS 
for hyperactivity/impulsivity and the ADHD -RS for inattention will be analyzed using the same 
methods as the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in AD HD-RS Total Score.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline (Visit 2), all post baseline measurements (Visits 
3 to 6), and changes from baseline to all post -baseline measurements of CGI -S by [CONTACT_1570], 
overall and separately for each age cohort.  A MMRM ANCOVA model will be fitted using all data 
as observed.  The dependent variable will be change from baseline in CGI -S post-baseline 
assessments for each subject. The model will include fixed effects for treatment,  age cohort, gender (stratification factor for  randomization), baseline CGI -S, visit (Visit 3, 4, 5, and 6), and visit -by-
treatment interaction as well as a random effect for the subject. The mixed model will be fitted in the same manner as described above for the primary endpoint analysis. From the M MRM model, 
the Visit 6 difference between LS means of Azstarys® and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95% CI and two- sided p -value.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for all post baseline measurements of CGI -I by [CONTACT_6490], overall and for each age cohort separately.  A MMRM ANOVA model will be fitted using 
all data as observed. The dependent variable will be CGI-I post- baseline assessments for each 
subject. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, age cohort, gender (stratification factor for randomization), visit (Visit 3, 4, 5, and 6), and visit -by-treatment interaction as well as a random 
effect for the subjec t. The mixed model will be fitted in the same manner as described above for the 
primary endpoint analysis. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 difference between LS means of Azstarys® and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95% CI and two-s ided p-
value.  
Visit 6 CGI -I will also be compared between treatment groups using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) chi square test within each age cohort stratified by [CONTACT_547]. An overall CMH test will also be conducted stratified by [CONTACT_25890] (4 strata). 
17.4.3.  Type I Error Control for Efficacy  
For the primary endpoint, the hypothesis of superiority of Azstarys® to placebo will be tested at a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05 for the two age cohorts combined. If significant, the same hypothesis will 
be tested for each age cohort at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.   
If the primary endpoint comparison is significant for Cohort 1, the superiority of Azstarys® to placebo with respect to the secondary efficacy endpoints, ADHD- RS for hyperactivity/impulsivity 
and ADHD- RS for inattention, will be tested for Cohort [ADDRESS_443295] listings.  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred term and system organ class using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are 
AEs that begin in the time period following  the first administration of study medication  through [ADDRESS_443296] possibly related to study medication based on the Investigator’s 
assessment.  The number and percentage of subjects with SAEs, and the number and percentage of subjects with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will also be summarized by [CONTACT_14340] . 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_355763] (in kg), change and percent change from baseline in body weight, height (in cm), change and percent change from baseline in height, weight and height z -scores, and weight and height percenti les by [CONTACT_1570], separately for 
each age cohort. The descriptive statistics will include n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
[ADDRESS_443297] quartile (Q1, Q3), and range ( minimum and maximum ). In addition, descriptive statistics 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_355764].  
The CSHQ total Sleep Disturbance Score and the change and percent change from baseline CSHQ score will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_355791]. A MMRM ANCOVA model will be fitted using all data as observed. The dependent variable w ill be change from baseline 
to all  post-baseline assessments of the CSHQ score for each subject. The model will include fixed 
effects for treatment,  age cohort, gender (stratification factor for randomization), baseline CSHQ, visit (Visit 3, 4, 5, and 6), and visit -by-treatment interaction as well as a random effect for the 
subject. The mixed model will be fitted in the same manner as described above for the primary endpoint analysis. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 difference between LS means of Azstarys ® 
and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95% CI. The MMRM analysis of the change from baseline CSHQ scores will also be conducted separately for each age cohort. 
Descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_355792], observed values, and 
changes from baseline in C -SSRS for all post -baseline assessments, overall and by [CONTACT_50802]. A 
MMRM ANCOVA model will be fitted using all data as observed. The dependent variable will be change from baseline to all  post-baseline assessments of the C -SSRS score for each subject. The 
model will include fixed effects for treatment,  age cohort, gender (stratification factor for randomization), baseline C -SSRS, visit  (Visit 3, 4, 5, and 6), and visit -by-treatment interaction as 
well as a random effect for the subject. The mixed model will be fitted in the same manner as described above for the primary endpoint analysis. From the MMRM model, the Visit 6 difference betw een LS means of Azstarys® and placebo will be presented along with the corresponding 95%

 CI. The MMRM analysis of the change from baseline C -SSRS scores will also be conducted 
separately for each age cohort. 
17.6. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted for potential sample size increase in subjects 4 and 5 years 
of age (Cohort 1). When approximately 50% of the Cohort [ADDRESS_443298] deviation (σ) will be estimated for change from 
baseline to Visit [ADDRESS_443299] sample size.  Since the study will remain 
blinded for the sample size re -assessment, no alpha penalty for the final analysis will be incurred.  
18. ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATIO N 
18.1. Adverse Events  
18.1.1.  Recording and Monitoring of Adverse Events 
For the purpose of this clinical trial, all AEs  will be recorded and monitored for all enrolled subjects 
from the moment they r eceive the  dose of study drug until they complete the study at the EOS (the 
Follow-up Phone Call  or the ET  Visit) . 
18.1.2.  Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product. An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure 
or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each 
subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents. Adverse event s will be 
recorded in the patient eCRF. AEs will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), 
severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
18.1.3.  Adverse Event Grading  
The severity of each AE will be graded by [CONTACT_355793]:  
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_443300]’s usual function (awareness of symptoms or signs, but 
easily tolerated [no specific medical intervention required]).  
Moderate Interferes to some extent with subject’s usual function (enough discomfort to interfere 
with usual activity [minimal intervention; local intervention; noninvasive 
intervention]). 
Severe  Interferes significantly with subject’s usual function (incapacity to work or to do usual 
activities [significant symptoms requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006]]). 
 
If there is a change in severity of an AE, only the maximum severity of the AE should be recorded.  
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF, as follows: 
• None 
• Study product stopped 
• Study product temporarily interrupted 
• Concomitant medication  
• Other, specify  
18.1.4.  Adverse Event  Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following: 
1. Probably - Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. 
2. Possibly - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
3. Unrelated - An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug. 
18.2. Serious A dverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. 
Protocol KP415.P01 CONFIDENTIAL  Corium, Inc. 
 
 
Page 68 of 74  November 14, 2022 
 18.2.1.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Within 24 hours after a SAE detection, observation, or report of occurrence (regardless of the 
relationship to test article) , the investigator/qualified designee will complete a SAE/Overdosage 
report with required information regarding the SAE in accordance with the Safety Management 
Plan and submit the completed form to the Pharmacovigilance service provider . The event will also 
be entered into the appropriate AE module of the eCRF  as soon as possible . Preliminary  reports of 
SAEs must be followed by [CONTACT_202852], such as including clear and anonymized 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when 
requested and  applicable . SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the 
event to be  related to the investigational  drug. 
Serious adverse event s considered  probably or possibly related to study drug shall also be classified 
by [CONTACT_355794] “expected ” or “unexpected.”  An unexpected event is one that is not 
listed in the  Investigator’s Brochure or Azstarys® Prescribing Information document. 
All serious event reporting by [CONTACT_355795] 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32 
for Investigational New Drug (ND) substances  (7-day or 15 -day alerts) and 21 CFR 314.80 for 
marketed drugs (15- day alerts). Unexpected fatal or life -threatening SAEs considered probably or 
possibly related to the study drug by [CONTACT_355796] [ADDRESS_443301] (IRB) will be noti fied of the 7- and 15- day alert reports per FDA regulations.  
18.3. Adverse Event Treatment and Follow -up 
All AEs, including SAEs, will be followed to resolution when possible. All AEs and treatment administered will be recorded on the e CRF.  Treatment may be rendered on site under the direction 
of th e Investigator as appropriate. Events requiring diagnostic evaluation or treatment beyond the 
scope of what is available and appropriate within the clinical research unit shall be referred in a timely basis to other care providers. Records of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions shall be 
requested in compliance with HIPAA requirements, and those received shall be retained in the subject’s file.  
Serious adverse event  assessment, treatment, and follow up shall be performed up to at least [ADDRESS_443302] dose used in the study (by [CONTACT_9084]), i.e., > 39.2 mg/7.8 mg  Azstarys ® for Cohort  1 or > 52.3 mg/10.4  mg Azstarys ® for 
Cohort 2. If the overdosage has  an associated AE or SAE, the site is to report and document the 
event as listed in this protocol.  
Signs and symptoms of acute MPH  overdose, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS 
and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may  be followed by [CONTACT_355797]), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, 
headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension,

 tachypnea, mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, and rhabdomyolysis ( Azstarys® Package 
Insert 2021).  
Notifications of known incidences of subjects taking more than one capsule of study drug per day 
(irrespective of the dose size), which is considered misuse, will be provided by [CONTACT_355798]. 
19. PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
A protocol violation occurs when the subject, Investigator, or Sponsor fails to adhere to significant 
protocol requirements that materially (a) reduces the quality or completeness of the data, (b) makes the Informed Consent Form inaccurate, or (c) impacts a subject's safety, rights, or welfare. Examples 
of protocol violations may include the following: 
1. Inadequate or delinquent Informed Consent 
2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria not met 
3. Unreported SAE s 
4. Multiple visits missed or outside permissible windows  
5. Materially inadequate record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
6. Intentional deviation from protocol, Good Clinical Practice, or regulations by [CONTACT_3462] 
7. Subject repeated non -compliance with study requirements  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report to the IRB of any Protocol Violation(s) according to the IRB ’s policy. Copy of the IRB submission will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the 
Sponsor’s files.  
20. DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
20.1. Data Management  
Data will be recorded at the site on e CRFs  using EDC . All entries on an e CRF  are ultimately the 
responsibility of the Investigator, who is expected to review each form for completeness, accuracy and legibility before signing. An e CRF  must be completed for each participant who has given 
informed consent. The eCRFs and source documents must be made available to Sponsor and/or its representatives.
